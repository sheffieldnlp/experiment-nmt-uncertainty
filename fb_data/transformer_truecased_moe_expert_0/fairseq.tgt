Estonia and Spain had four members of Cape Verde Group detained
according to Con@@ sor@@ ily , in Spain the police cap@@ tured S@@ lava Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ n , the so @-@ called leader of the Guine@@ an group in the Estonian Union , who is known in the criminal world as S@@ lava K@@ Cape K@@ eme@@ ro@@ v@@ ski .
in Spain , Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch was arrested by court .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects arrested in Estonia .
it is suspected that Cape Verde is a criminal community of between 27 and 57 years old , who commit mainly drug @-@ related crimes .
in the province of M@@ alaga in Spain , Mi@@ ja@@ v was held the alleged head of the criminal organisation .
in Estonia , three men were deemed suspects , one of which is collected according to criminal organisation and two are members of the criminal organisation .
the data collected indicates that the criminal community clearly assigned roles and roles .
criminal organisation was designed to commit drug crime and thereby generate criminal proceeds , &quot; commented the head of the pre @-@ trial criminal proceedings , Public Prosecutor Va@@ hur Ver@@ te .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspects in this criminal case will increase &quot; added to the Prosecutor &apos;s .
these are people who have previously become law enforcement agencies &apos; interests , and some of them have served sentences for drug crime .
she stressed that throughout the investigation cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high on the agenda .
&quot; international cooperation has become common for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows how successful the cooperation has been , &quot;
the head of the Central Criminal Police Service , ago Le@@ is , said that the prisons were preceded by nearly one and a half years of preliminary investigation .
&quot; in the first half of the week , long @-@ term work was realised and , at the same time , we held criminal offences in Estonia and Spain &apos; , he said .
in Le@@ is , central criminal police officers were assisted in Spain &apos;s detention .
for years now we have good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are yet another message to criminals that we can also get them from another European end , &quot; said in Le@@ is .
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that , in free stay , suspected men can continue to commit new crimes , leaving the Prosecutor &apos;s office to request arrest and approved by the court .
a man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
this criminal case has seized properties , vehicles and cash to ensure confiscation .
the criminal case is conducted by the central criminal police organised crime office and is led by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the City Court in Tallinn sentenced S@@ lava Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch in 2005 to blackmail and punished him by five years in prison .
in the mid @-@ last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ v was held in the criminal world by Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v , the then Man@@ aging officer , as the second man .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch from Cape Verde grew up in Estonia in the early 1990s , when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
it was claimed that he would tax tax@@ i managers and prostitu@@ tes operating in different ho@@ tels and ordered business@@ men to pay monthly ro@@ of@@ s .
international joint operations , criminal proceeds confis@@ cations and the entry into force of court decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for instance , the recent court rulings , the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ activist criminal community , on eight suspects of criminal cases , who were confis@@ cated on criminal proceeds , or the sentence against nine individuals in that Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v established in 2006 a criminal organisation aimed at illegal trade in counterfeit cigarettes and commit trafficking @-@ related crimes in Eastern Vir@@ g@@ land and southern Estonia .
the confis@@ cated proceeds from crime are worth nearly € 71 500 .
in these criminal cases , progress has been made by police officers changing information and prosecutors on a daily basis , exchanging external colleagues with evidence and , if necessary , carrying out operations in any EU country .
civil rights grou@@ ping war@@ ns Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ s travel
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ cement of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ ACP ) has warned the people of Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ al air condi@@ tioning against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state .
the Group statement states : &apos; the NA@@ ACP travel link issued for the State of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , valid until 28 August 2017 , calls on all a@@ American travellers , visitors and sou@@ ls to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the whole state , given the whole range of Ro@@ man suspects race @-@ related events which have been occurring in the recent state and are also pointed here &apos; .
NA@@ ACP said that it was urged to issue a travel warning both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it more difficult to obtain court cases concerning discrimination , and also the fact that the state &apos;s record protection targets are disproportionately targeted at minorities .
&quot; people &apos;s civil rights are being violated .
they are hun@@ g on the road ser@@ ser because of their sk@@ in colour , beaten or slaugh@@ tered , &quot; said NA@@ ACP Mis@@ s@@ our , R@@ od Cha@@ pel , President of The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&quot; we have never been so closely compla@@ ined before . &quot;
this is the first such warning that an organisation has issued to the US State .
the group referred to events such as racial insul@@ ts against black students in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of the 23 @-@ year @-@ old black Lady S@@ and@@ ers from T@@ en@@ nes@@ see .
S@@ and@@ ers died at the beginning of this year under suspi@@ cious circumstances after being able to cross the state in a flight from petrol to the floor and the Mis@@ s@@ our police took her to arrest without being charged with a crime .
in addition , the note refers to a recent report by the Mis@@ s@@ our Prosecutor indicating that black car drivers &apos; cars are less likely to be stopped in the state than pri@@ es@@ ts .
&quot; the comment is intended to make people aware and to warn their families , friends and collabor@@ ators for what could happen in Mis@@ s@@ our , &quot; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it means taking away bail money or informing their relatives that they are passing through the state . &quot;
according to the latest information from the F@@ B@@ I hate crime programme , 100 hate crime crime was recorded in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ a in 2015 , placing the state in a cross @-@ section 16 place in the state in terms of similar offences .
travel warnings are also a response to the Mis@@ s@@ our new law , which makes it more difficult to refer a company to court for reasons of discrimination in the search for housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association Confederation ( LA@@ EC Armenia ) had issued earlier travel concerns for T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona after these states adopted immigration laws obli@@ ging local people to arrest immigration infringements , as AC@@ L@@ U says it will increase racial profiling .
normally , travel warnings are issued by the Foreign Office for other countries , but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain intra @-@ US laws and trends .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or li@@ ver bur@@ st , may result from five different diseases : A , B , C , D and E he@@ pati@@ tis .
all these vir@@ uses are a li@@ ver @-@ s@@ ounding pon@@ d .
however , with a bad cost , there is chronic B and he@@ pati@@ tis C , which can continue to develop the li@@ p , i.e. the li@@ ver to the ro@@ ck and the li@@ ver .
the epidemi@@ ology ap@@ ples Ku@@ ks@@ r of the H@@ RC says that acute he@@ pati@@ tis diseases are the same for all types of vegetable activity - fa@@ w@@ ine@@ making , ti@@ gue , birth , o@@ cation , s@@ oul , pa@@ int , pa@@ int , pa@@ int emissions , pi@@ le and li@@ dal pain , and meat and li@@ dal ra@@ inf@@ all .
the last disease is also caused by the li@@ ver &apos;s popular name of the tro@@ ph@@ y .
children can exercise he@@ pati@@ tis without disease .
different species of the organic can only be identified on the basis of laboratory study data .
do not b@@ ac@@ he@@ ver can turn over to chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and run for decades without disease phenomena , which means that a person may not know about a harmful li@@ ver disease .
the audi@@ o Ku@@ tsa@@ r highlights different he@@ pati@@ tis forms and describes their course in more detail .
a he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading from a sick to humans and infected us in feeding contaminated food or drinking water , s@@ cor@@ ing in se@@ als , be@@ ach and hands on food , soil , objects , pollin@@ ation and drug consumption .
a he@@ pati@@ tis was a risk of infection - that is to say , the risk group of sick family members and carers , people suffering from chronic li@@ ver diseases , sex offenders , honey sex men , drug addi@@ cts , he@@ pati@@ tis high @-@ performing countries - travellers are visiting countries .
F@@ ever can be prevented by vaccination , in particular , it recommends vaccination for people travelling to a large number of people and at A he@@ pati@@ tis risk group .
in addition , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands , before using food , to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading to suff@@ e@@ rers when they are exposed to the blood , when they bur@@ n drugs , treat in@@ duc@@ ed , h@@ our@@ ly dis@@ h@@ our@@ ly , use of blood @-@ contaminated di@@ ch@@ ives ( too@@ it , tu@@ als ) , donation blood , he@@ pati@@ tis bis@@ nu@@ t in the sex and he@@ pati@@ tis fo@@ e@@ tal fo@@ e@@ tal fo@@ e@@ tal fo@@ e@@ tal fo@@ e@@ tal fo@@ e@@ tal .
the he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ in@@ y @-@ associated drug @-@ related HIV @-@ in@@ duc@@ ed drug addi@@ cts , the sex partners of infected people , sex men with honey , new HIV in@@ mates , sick family members and carers , health care , workers and police officers , and travellers visiting high @-@ inf@@ lam@@ matory countries with he@@ pati@@ tis B .
b he@@ pati@@ tis prevention is a potential vaccine for people to vacc@@ in@@ ate ; in particular , it is recommended to vacc@@ in@@ ate people at risk , as well as people suffering from chronic diseases , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
other preventive measures for he@@ pati@@ tis ( b ) are : avoiding alien and man@@ y@@ ro@@ y@@ at@@ ry devices , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ gic @-@ ch@@ ro@@ sis , ab@@ y@@ tation and honour donation , and con@@ dom use in dangerous mix@@ tures or avoiding sexual risk @-@ taking .
Anti@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis is part of the national immun@@ isation scheme in Estonia and children free of charge .
He@@ pati@@ tis C infections spread sick people to face the blood of a person , to in@@ ject drugs , to fine @-@ drinking , to h@@ ire h@@ our@@ ly dis@@ hes , to use blood @-@ contaminated di@@ ch@@ es@@ hal@@ l@@ ings , to sex with he@@ pati@@ tis i@@ dio@@ tic agent and to he@@ pati@@ tis fo@@ e@@ tal fo@@ e@@ tal fo@@ e@@ tal / inf@@ ant .
the he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ in@@ y @-@ related drug addi@@ cts , HIV sex partners , men sex with men , newly infected mothers , hospital family members and carers , blood and other body flu@@ ids are exposed to health , personnel and rescu@@ ers , HIV @-@ infected persons and to high levels of he@@ pati@@ tis C are visited by travellers .
he@@ pati@@ tis C preventive measure is : avoiding alien and man@@ y@@ ro@@ y@@ tis , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ gic @-@ ch@@ ro@@ sis , ab@@ y@@ tation and honour donation , and con@@ dom use in cases of hazardous mix@@ tures of infection .
he@@ pati@@ tis C is not a vaccine .
He@@ pati@@ tis D is causing he@@ pati@@ tis virus , which is ac@@ u@@ tely contained in the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B virus .
accordingly , a D he@@ pati@@ tis F@@ lam@@ p , together with he@@ pati@@ tis B or super@@ inf@@ er he@@ pati@@ tis patients , is present in a c@@ ac@@ le B .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses are spreading in exposure to blood and other body flu@@ ids , contaminated with sy@@ stal@@ gic @-@ like , sexu@@ ally and rarely infected animals .
He@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis at risk is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B virus elements and non @-@ chemical agent of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
an effective preventive action is vaccination with he@@ pati@@ tis B vaccines , which also protects humans from he@@ pati@@ tis D virus infection .
e he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses are spreading fe@@ eds on drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , donation with blood , open @-@ use heart stal@@ ls and infected animals .
travellers can be infected with he@@ pati@@ tis E high in the country .
the he@@ pati@@ tis prevention measures are hygiene requirements : was@@ hing or dis@@ infec@@ ting hands after coping in ro@@ ckets , before eating and c@@ oo@@ king , after sick care .
fruit and vegetables are laun@@ dered before consumption , to avoid the low @-@ treated heat beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , to drink only safe drinking water and to avoid drug consumption .
although at the last round , competitors tried to extra@@ dite four @-@ fold Olympic winners from the race , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ara@@ h finally found strength and won 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
F@@ ara@@ h did not think long , having finished the final phrase pul@@ led on the path of wife T@@ ania and children .
that was a particular moment for me .
I am very much taking my family .
they were on a wonderful course , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h to journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h is targeting the fifth edition in London of the 5 @-@ and @-@ 5 @-@ 10 000 @-@ me@@ tre gra@@ de roll .
everything is possible if it was believed .
despite the title , she is dying in &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , in spite of her book book , in G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t &apos;s mas@@ ter@@ piece of literature , in the love of B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer &apos;s portfolio , she is much deeper than the birth@@ day of a works of art in the early 19th century and the early 20th century in Vienna .
but more thoroughly in history .
a dis@@ gus@@ ting information load would have been culti@@ vated , that is to say a bit more ste@@ am in the north , and a more limited topic could be taken out of the title book book book book book book to have more influence .
at present , one would have two books between one news : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t and his pain@@ ting , the &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; story of A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , and a much larger and more comprehensive historical office from respected Jewish families and the German occupation , with its follow @-@ up effects in Austria .
the first third of the book is in the middle of a w@@ ed@@ ding Vienna cultural life and who himself became the capital of Austria , can hardly imagine how over a hundred years ago he went around life round R@@ us@@ st@@ ras@@ s or how the Cen@@ tr@@ ali ca@@ ke all the head turned when the customer was in .
the concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe &apos;s rich@@ est cities and , seeing the name I know in the book , seemed to have been more cul@@ turally famous for a gram .
however , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a town where he took the pi@@ le of inde@@ fa@@ pi@@ table guilt and was Europe &apos;s highest suicide level is something that seems to be worth nothing .
or perhaps , however , each couple &apos;s beautiful ben@@ ches adds colour to the 20th century &apos;s cultural life in Vienna .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century Jews had explo@@ ded in Vienna , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
the timing exchange was almost one in ten Vienna .
visitors were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time the hel@@ ple@@ ss for A@@ dele was able to open twice the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ do Fer@@ din@@ and Kli@@ m@@ t for his famous pain@@ ting , his bank had already become the seventh @-@ largest bank in H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg E@@ mp@@ ire .
but the whole gla@@ lar life in which he was famous was not brought .
if you look at &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; , you cannot believe that life was stopped by this he@@ in@@ ous anti@@ Socialist and for@@ got from travelling to the Soviet Union .
in 19@@ 0@@ 3 , when Fer@@ din@@ ja B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s ath@@ le@@ te from Kli@@ m@@ lus , the last moment &apos;s com@@ man@@ der in Vienna was a pa@@ int@@ ou@@ ch .
the cli@@ m@@ t ordered the price at the time of USD 4 000 , a quarter of a good house .
for some mar@@ ches , a master &apos;s mo@@ del@@ le was suspected , sugar mag@@ na@@ te did not deter@@ red .
as far as the brain is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship that has been established in the course of work with the model and the ar@@ tist continued to life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - &apos; Da@@ am kul@@ las &apos; .
G@@ Kli@@ m@@ t &apos;s mas@@ ter@@ piece , A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri port@@ m , &quot; &quot; Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , translated Al@@ do R@@ and@@ maa .
just before the start of the work with A@@ dele@@ ga , the cli@@ m@@ t had been in San V@@ ita@@ le and the researchers think it was there that the g@@ ul@@ li@@ ble em@@ ic@@ na The@@ o@@ dor@@ an artificial initiative to make a gol@@ den Por@@ t of A@@ dele@@ ree a mo@@ sa@@ ic .
the customer was presented in Da@@ ami gold in Vienna in 19@@ 08 and at around the same time ( between 19@@ 07 and 19@@ 08 ) was born in another gol@@ den land called &quot; S@@ vel@@ lus . &quot;
artists did not notice the simil@@ arity of two women .
what about creativity , Hitler ?
&quot; I think I will remember my friend Kli@@ m@@ t to pay him to make his hand to the public , &quot; wrote to him B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer a few years after she left the ar@@ tist ( Kli@@ m@@ t died in February 19@@ 18 ) to the Director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere M@@ use@@ um and he wanted their family Kli@@ m@@ h@@ u to go to M@@ use@@ um .
six years before the death , the customer was born in A@@ dele@@ st one portfolio .
in his testa@@ ment ( A@@ dele left in February 19@@ 25 ) he also asked that her spo@@ use retain two sports courses and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t ter@@ rain to Austria Gal@@ way .
she delivered her statu@@ es to o@@ y@@ u@@ cle@@ ver Mari@@ ana and Lu@@ da .
one year after the customer had finished &quot; Austrian Mon@@ a lisa &quot; , Vi@@ in Ka@@ ath had attempted access to A@@ ka@@ de@@ mine Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , 17 years old , but failed the drawing period .
although Hitler &apos;s late anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is sometimes seen as the reason that J@@ ew profes@@ sors did not accept him in the A@@ ca@@ de@@ my , no one of his ex@@ ec@@ ters was actually a ha@@ bit .
in any case , the Austrian Gal@@ way mission , referred to in Maria testa@@ ment , had changed considerably by 19@@ 39 , had become a major factor in finding ben@@ ches of the Vienna rich Jewish arts .
Hitler &apos;s personal artistic wealth was also so@@ rely fed by some work at home for A@@ ones , but not by Kli@@ m@@ t .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the Nazi arts were kidna@@ pped , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute began between the Austrian Government and the he@@ irs of B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ mi@@ an .
it should be noted here that if &apos; S@@ no@@ vel@@ anism &apos; sees Vienna in Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle , A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer &apos;s image of &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; must be viewed in New York &apos;s Ne@@ ue Gal@@ way .
and before Vienna , it was also worth reading through the aforementioned book .
even if you do not intend to look at Kli@@ m@@ t &apos;s work , because my emo@@ tion , at least after the closure of the book , went beyond the Nazi and Jewish issue of the town and mode@@ ll A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer sold USD 135 million .
so not so much a portfolio , but rather a very moving story of a tri@@ bal fate .
the events provided a significant channel to the relatives of the Bauer who was originally mentioned .
17 @-@ year @-@ old sw@@ im@@ mer in Canada very close to Estonia &apos;s record
in life , gold was 200 m por@@ k into a personal record , very close to the ru@@ m of 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 .
the label comes from a 17 @-@ year @-@ old pi@@ pe celebration of the moment the Canadian Ju@@ tan Cha@@ mpi@@ ons champi@@ on@@ ships were awarded 14.@@ 58 , the Pri@@ it A@@ av@@ iku F@@ ju@@ mis@@ ison is bro@@ ke@@ red .
gold ended , in other words , by the tenth A final .
he went across the finish with a distance of 2.@@ 2.@@ 68 and achieved a strong 7th prize with a new top @-@ level mark .
A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or@@ is ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) left Gol@@ den in a little more than half a second .
Estonia &apos;s total annual ranking gold increased by 3 , with its fresh personal top ranking accounting for all its fifth time .
the young hope for the future is to start at the Canadian football champi@@ on@@ ships 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in bal@@ p@@ ings , and 200 m@@ 3 and 400 more complex .
last week in Tor@@ onto , Canada held the cere@@ monies champi@@ on@@ ships and gold rol@@ led out there too .
he won 200 m in pi@@ pe oil with a sil@@ ver me@@ dal time 2.@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ 22 .
so quickly , this was sw@@ am@@ ped by the arrogance of the former in 2008 .
the Gol@@ den site has been completed more quickly by the time @-@ out in Estonia only by the Estonian E@@ lina Par@@ k .
a Canadian @-@ based champion won another 100 m @-@ s@@ lum in a fa@@ tu@@ ten address with excellent personal records and a new Estonian season with 5@@ 6.@@ 66 top sta@@ rs .
for example , his year old Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k has distan@@ ced this distan@@ cing by only one century .
he reached the top personal mark by finding a further 100 pigs in the sw@@ im@@ ming season in the opening of the theat@@ re of 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 .
for half , she only gained the seventh seat when she s@@ tun@@ ned in the fin@@ als 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
gold is currently running the Estonian so@@ w@@ ings ranking with four distinct distan@@ cing from the top four benchmarks .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics che@@ er
the holiday time has come - that is to say a s@@ mile to US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mpi@@ n .
however , as T@@ ru@@ mp has so far been one of the most deprived President of leave days , critics are already ham@@ mer .
the US &apos;s &quot; Today and CN@@ N &quot; announced by the President as being 17 days &apos; leave in the liquid gol@@ f clubs in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster in New Jer@@ sey .
even though the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , the anti @-@ T@@ ru@@ p issue has been speaking for a week now .
they are throwing the LTTE out of business as a result of a wave of ca@@ rele@@ ss@@ ness .
indeed , the President has the standard practice of having a weekend &apos;s time in his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey cotton .
by the way , T@@ ru@@ mp has not pu@@ mped the President most in 19@@ 6 .
for example , George W@@ . Bush had already reached 67 days on this holiday , Barack Obama half as much as T@@ ru@@ mp , but 21 days .
but the T@@ ath tends to quickly fail .
the days before becoming President , in T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s t@@ ree , &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , it was said that your man would not be in the long term for rest holidays because there is a great deal to do .
he also objec@@ ted three years ago to Barack Obama &apos;s leave .
the current President wrote on Twitter then : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , gol@@ f is playing , the brak@@ es and Ju@@ da@@ a@@ sh@@ at@@ ty concer@@ ts , in Thailand , journalists are wal@@ king their heads out of the wind . &apos;
according to white house officials , 17 days of gol@@ f course visits to pol@@ led have no under@@ cut .
it is officially called employment leave , during which the T@@ ir@@ ker has no time to read or any other pro @-@ active activities .
in addition , working holidays had to have another reason .
indeed , the White House &apos;s Western balance sheet system is being replaced and therefore the whole staff had to leave .
the West Bank also has O@@ vaal@@ ch@@ ka@@ r and other presidential offices .
&quot; I do not think anybody would like to be in the western wing in August if you have 38 degrees and no balance pensions , &quot; said the speaker of the White House , L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , who stressed that the President would continue to work during the holiday period .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp will spend 17 days &apos; time , you will get an idea of video .
blocking critics on Facebook not to stand for a national office unless you tolerate voters &apos; criticism
our country &apos;s father knew a great deal about unfavourable media reports .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take long to start ra@@ cking him on everything from internal politics to his political principles .
the criticism naturally anno@@ yed him .
but she did not force her critics to silence .
because in 17@@ 83 Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression could be taken away from us and more quickly and in silence we could be led by sheep , by fire . &apos;
this brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land Governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to struggle to be more Washington .
under Ho@@ gan , at least 450 people have blocked and deleted postal services , giving their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and early this week , the American Civil Liberties Union ( EC@@ LI@@ E shield ) therefore took it to court .
the Si@@ ber@@ ner official &apos;s office acted as empty and web comments were broken by counter @-@ reactions &apos; who interests ? &apos; .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is just Facebook &apos; said many .
but that matters .
and that is particularly important when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
it is an aston@@ ishing popular re@@ publi@@ can Governor of an overwhelming democratic state .
his discharge rate is the second most important among the country &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
Ho@@ gan is not a thou@@ gh@@ tle@@ r .
he has firmly drawn the state and remains firm in his principles .
furthermore , she has used her as the main tool to deal with voters quite wisely on Facebook , for example , after che@@ mo@@ ther@@ ap@@ y , to display her bitter head .
so the Governor &apos;s body Mercedes Bresso is a public forum with a formal label , managed by a staff who is paid on taxpayers &apos; dollars and who are stranded in an unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with Ho@@ gan press representative Ame@@ lia Ch@@ asse , The Washington Posselt was protected by the Governor &apos;s conduct , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to pa@@ int a picture of online screening , spa@@ m@@ mers or people with anger .
the post was held by a number of quite people whose Ho@@ gan blocked .
that is what they are , precisely , Mr Barrot , people who communicate with their elected leaders , the teacher , company owner and pas@@ tor , not online controls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , well thought @-@ out and not at all rose .
the Pas@@ tor quoted milk in his postal , underlining Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic traffic .
a lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan@@ d in Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ m Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , not encouraged hatred but rather hate crime .
&quot; I poli@@ tely explained that I was disappointed that he had not reacted to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; he wrote The mail news story in the heading .
&quot; I also dis@@ like the idea that if many people comment on the same subject , some will suddenly call it an in@@ difference to collective effort rather than admit that it is a lot of concerns . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s official called &apos; targeted jun@@ k fire attack &apos; would probably be called on by others &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era allows messages to be easily mat@@ ched by simply blocking criticism or dele@@ ting negative comments .
it is much cleaner than in the past , when to do the same , it was necessary to send out staff to gather critical edit@@ orial papers and bur@@ n them or arrest protest@@ ors and force them to silence them .
but that is exactly what is happening now , just digital .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media ab@@ ound .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has been su@@ ed by users of Twitter who have been blocked from Twitter &apos;s bed .
one of the first formal sentences on this subject with symbolic meaning was made last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
a US inter@@ lo@@ cu@@ tor James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is decided in Alexand@@ ria that the Board of supervisors of the Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ n Region was infected by the first amendment to the Constitution if he blocked a constitu@@ ent on Facebook page .
K@@ tu@@ ck@@ ys also visited AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter by the Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ int ( R ) .
that should not be so difficult .
during Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar impact to the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , newspapers were multipli@@ ed by newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters inter@@ viewed by their management methods .
and even then Washington had to face anon@@ ymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers from pseu@@ do @-@ Or@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ u and Por@@ ti@@ us , gra@@ pp@@ ling Washington decisions .
in the wake of the book @-@ based George Washington project for collecting letters , he bu@@ ried a c@@ abinet petition criticising his views on friendship , trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain .
but she did not force them to stay silent .
freedom of expression , dis@@ sent and debates are the very foundations of our country .
and proper management means accepting it .

the move from the Dutch sup@@ pres@@ s@@ ant power has been inc@@ iting its rage against the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta government , which continues to keep the region under strong control , away from foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province of Paa@@ pu@@ d was officially distributed to the West P@@ ope , so that Papua New Guinea , independent , was left in the eastern island .

Papua Indonesia is the poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
but it is also a Indon@@ esi@@ an gold country .
just 100 km from P@@ ani@@ a@@ to , the New Jer@@ sey size of a mountain with a population of 153 000 , is the world &apos;s largest and most lu@@ cra@@ tive gold mine , G@@ ras@@ berg , a F@@ ree@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an , in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x .
in 2015 alone F@@ ree@@ port em@@ itted around USD 3.@@ 1 billion of gold and cop@@ h from this place .
in addition , Papua can be smugg@@ led with consumer timber stocks , which are estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are a source of pa@@ tho@@ gen suffering , as they are a result of the stran@@ g@@ le@@ hold of the powerful Indon@@ esi@@ an army .
the New York Times study in 2005 showed that F@@ ree@@ port paid around USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to USD 150 000 per victim .
the Paa@@ do &apos;s attempts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den h@@ our and is ru@@ th@@ lessly dis@@ connected .
human rights activists have been saying that since 19@@ 69 more than 500 000 kil@@ lers have been killed and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esi@@ an army .
according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights , the massive killing of the New genocide in the 1970s in Papua tri@@ bal lands was a me@@ tre of genocide .
last year alone , over 3 900 peaceful protest@@ ors were arrested in the Indon@@ esi@@ an region .
the Bir@@ s@@ b@@ ane Ar@@ ch@@ bis@@ ho@@ p report 2016 &quot; We lose all &quot; contains testi@@ monies of atrocities committed in the previous year , such as extra@@ judicial executions , torture ( another report says rape and electricity shock is particularly widespread ) and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to read the figure because such incidents occur every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , the journalist of Human Rights Watch .
CER@@ s are even more strongly shut down , because Papua natural resources have caused new set@@ tle@@ rs to cross in from Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing because there are economic migrants coming from the Indon@@ esi@@ an crow@@ ds Jaa@@ va , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ es islands .

the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , known to the population as Jo@@ ko@@ wi , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to tackle their inequalities and human rights abuses in P@@ ope .
the former pu@@ rest won on its way from the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta presidential Pal@@ ace to the 27 Papua 29 constituents , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
but the P@@ ope has changed very little and the local feel chea@@ ted .
&quot; our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he would live up to our hopes of restoring justice , &quot; said You will .
in fact , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i barely experienced a down@@ fall two months after Jo@@ ko@@ w took office in October .
on 7 December 2014 11 children in the Mo@@ ro@@ ta@@ li s@@ ongs on Christmas Christmas , while the blind eye motor@@ cycle was filled by two Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers .
met children told them they should include the front lights .
after local pas@@ tor@@ i Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ eba@@ i , he reported insul@@ ting one of his soldiers to their tone and subsequently returned to four soldiers .
according to victims and witnesses , under @-@ age soldiers ch@@ ru@@ cked children and be@@ at them with their own devices .
then one of the soldiers shot among children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , was so cru@@ el@@ ly beaten that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , the lo@@ ved electoral Commission took the floor and the next day the es@@ tu@@ ary went further .
around 1000 young Pa@@ men , women and children gathered to demand justice at the local police station and military command centre football .
they carried out horse @-@ repair buses and presented Papua me@@ e pa@@ go without @-@ tan@@ ts@@ u , during which a be@@ er was be@@ ver@@ ted and a mon@@ g was bu@@ ried .
some protest@@ ors started to l@@ ure the police and the military .
when the anger was raised , a soldi@@ er was sent to his troops via a gu@@ est by an gu@@ est . &apos; if the crow@@ ds show resistance more than three times , let them down , &apos; the official document , which has seen a magaz@@ ine time but which has not been issued to local media reports , was said .
the Mayor of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ ame ( 56 ) , was deemed to be a threatening threat and called for peace by asking for the crow@@ d to go home .
nobody wanted to listen .
&quot; all around I was shot at the left suddenly , &quot; he said time in his private colour the disability house blood .
Ka@@ y@@ ame still does not know who was shooting , but says that month , the soldiers came from the ranks .
&quot; there was a lot of people , the industry was full of ste@@ am , &quot; he adds .
Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , a local man , was shot on his ch@@ est three times , says the man .
&quot; I would like to come back to him and inqu@@ ire through her body to make sure that it was with him , &apos; said the magaz@@ ine sy@@ non@@ ymous in Y@@ oh@@ ano , who , like many Indi@@ ans , uses only one name .
&quot; I saw she dead ... S@@ novel she . &quot;
the Papua police chief inspe@@ ctor , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that he was only responsible for ensuring his own Parish &apos;s security because it was attacked .
&quot; we need to protect ourselves if threats are to be sent , &quot; said the T@@ rus@@ h@@ man P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , the T@@ rus@@ ha@@ r of the Pa@@ ki@@ an police .
&quot; that is a matter of life and death . &quot;
human Rights Watch said that five young protest@@ ors were killed and there were many injured .
news of killings arrived in J@@ ak@@ ara only the day after .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra held a passion@@ ate speech , giving the victims &apos; families sympathy and allowing them to deal with the mal@@ treatment in the P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to resolve this incident immediately so that it never happens again in the future , &quot; he said .
in October 2016 , the security minister , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , said that he would set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism to tackle human rights crime .
but almost immediately , the ex@@ cus@@ es were also followed .
&quot; most crimes happened a long time ago .
some of them were in the 1990s and in the early 200@@ 0s .
the point is that we are committed to tackling these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
speaking at the time in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta on 5 June , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to took off his words , saying that he had no intention of setting up a P@@ ope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead he said &apos; everything would be resolved by law &apos; .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights , over 1 000 people killed in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 human rights crime had already been solved in Paa@@ pu@@ a , including what happened in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the victims &apos; families of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i took such claims with a g@@ loom@@ y belief .
&quot; I have been inter@@ ro@@ gated four times in the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &quot;
he says he is still afraid years later .
&apos;@@ I am afraid &apos; he says .
&quot; I am afraid the army is ar@@ resting me , I am afraid I am being shot . &quot;
she bro@@ d Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed the view that the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i people were afraid to s@@ lan@@ der this incident .
he said he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bur@@ y four victims .
&quot; after the body was bu@@ ried , the army had to look at me , &apos; he says .
arrests have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esi@@ an police shot the village residents of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i in neighbouring D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ is .
one person was killed and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , when it went on to talk about the town &apos;s head and the head of the building company , refusing to carry an unknown man to hospital .
this man , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ wn into ne@@ ar@@ by rivers in the search for fish , died on the road to hospital .
the frequent village residents prote@@ sted to the site office of a company on a construction site .
according to the police , the village residents st@@ oned police st@@ oned , with the latter responding with warning bul@@ lets .
but local would argue that mobile British people ( the Indon@@ esi@@ an army police ) started shooting at the population , killing one person .
&quot; we were very panic , we are afraid of reven@@ ge , &quot; said to the magaz@@ ine the time @-@ limit of 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives close to hospital and saw the injured person being in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ated .
&quot; I have dece@@ ived myself in my own house for two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ i Parliament has called for the relevant police officers to be held accountable and the police to be re@@ drawn from the area mobile phone .
P@@ ani@@ ania has always been a problem for the Indon@@ esi@@ an Government .
the lack of meaningful development fe@@ eds the dis@@ satisfaction of the honey , m@@ oni , dan@@ cing and da@@ r in Papua Del@@ hi &apos;s land .
many of them have joined the All Free Paapua D ( V@@ PL ) Congolese army of re@@ bels , which , in its own words , protects the rights of boats by carrying out casu@@ al attacks and abduc@@ tion campaigns among Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers .
some V@@ PL drivers come from P@@ ani@@ ya , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , in the name of defending &apos; State sovereignty &apos; , the army has in recent years arrested P@@ ani@@ a@@ i and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them never appear again .
among the Congolese people , P@@ ani@@ as is known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty fe@@ eds dis@@ satisfaction .
the little ri@@ p that the majority is selling is too expensive to buy local .
the b is equally un@@ at@@ tain@@ able .
people are growing their entire food self @-@ food fabric mainly on the b@@ ath , plus a little fruit and kit@@ chen fruit .
farming is women &apos;s work , each managing to maintain four or five objects .
they usually keep most harves@@ ts to the family , the rest being sold on the local market .
ten b@@ ars only cost 10@@ ,000 facilities ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequality between in@@ competent pa@@ ted boats and new migrants who have come to a great deal since the opening of new flight routes at N@@ ab@@ ire airport has deepen@@ ed .
the few jobs that exist go to better trained and weal@@ thi@@ er migrants .
the Paa@@ ts themselves often lack the skills needed to conduct a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving a fri@@ dge because there is no jobs or money , &quot; the Chairman of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ bal Council , John Go@@ ba@@ i , says .
the unbundling keeps the world &apos;s eyes off the P@@ ope .
in addition , foreign media are subject to severe restrictions .
earlier this year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ th L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were expelled from the P@@ ope because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they had been given a rare film authorisation .
human Rights Watch &apos;s Deputy head of Asia , P@@ heli@@ m K@@ ine , said that the Jo@@ ko@@ w electoral promises to remove the limits imposed on reports to promote transparency and development have not been implemented .
&quot; in Indonesia , journalists trying to report cal@@ mer and the Western Pa@@ pu@@ tan provinces are facing new threats to the rejection of the civilised visa and black@@ ma@@ iling , &quot; said in a statement .
the lack of a media g@@ lance means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esi@@ an Government is largely limited to Papua neighbours .
in March six Pacific countries totalling 152 , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ valu , Mar@@ shall Islands and the Sol@@ om@@ on Islands were encouraged to investigate &apos; a series of large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in the Paa@@ pu@@ a , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the same countries have historically supported V@@ PL .
the Indon@@ esi@@ an Foreign Minister , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , has dismissed a group &apos;s accusations , saying to the press : &apos; in Indonesia democracy and freedom of the press so that evidence of human rights cases can be dec@@ ried &apos; .
local people want more foreign governments to be taken into consideration .
when the Dutch official delegation , headed by the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , K@@ ees Van B@@ aar@@ i , visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ rat on 4 May , the local people interrupted the meeting , but anon@@ ymous with their silence , saying that they had his silence , urging him to &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , new presidential elections will take place in 2019 , but pa@@ thy trees do not believe they will vote again for Jo@@ ko@@ w .
&quot; Jo@@ ko@@ wi is a man with good intentions , but the people around him who are involved in shooting P@@ ani@@ a@@ i say &quot; he is President Ho@@ ba@@ i of the tri@@ bal Council .
he wants to make Jo@@ ko@@ w understand that , apart from the fact that the people of P@@ ani@@ i are constantly living under the threat of a pre@@ da@@ tory army , they are suffering from misery because of poor education and health services .
according to Go@@ ita , people in P@@ ani@@ an , like other boats , consider their vote to Jo@@ ko@@ w as a debt to pay .
&apos;@@ The@@ y need no money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite the threat and intimidation , the victims &apos; families of P@@ ani@@ an fire were coping with the latest symbolic counter @-@ action in pirates mat@@ ching the victim &apos;s body of police stations and military bases in the land .
knowing that justice may never be done , they at least prevent those responsible from forgetting their crimes .
&apos;@@ One of our family members was killed &apos; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a headline .
&apos;@@ What can we do else ? &apos;
Ne@@ ne@@ v ne@@ po@@ i Tor@@ ch &apos;s H@@ ur@@ ric@@ ane , already in his second phase
on Friday , one of the world &apos;s highest housing blocks in Du@@ ba@@ i was slaugh@@ tered , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to escape from 3@@ 37 metres of heat and 79 sto@@ rey buildings .
it is another fire that has , in just two years , devastated the high ranking that happens to be called Tor@@ ch , the T@@ õr@@ vi@@ k .
the building was evacu@@ ated , no injury was reported and no direct fire was caused .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and wo@@ ke fire hoo@@ ds and people sh@@ ou@@ ting .
we would get fewer people in school and we needed about 10 minutes to get down to the 50@@ th time , &apos; Re@@ u@@ ter@@ na was a single man who called himself George .
in the words of Du@@ ba@@ i civil protection officials , fire @-@ fighters also suspended fire @-@ fighters at around 4 a.m. in the morning at local time ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and ja@@ iled the building .
the government said they were working to provide the victims with shelter .
this incident may once again raise issues around the world about the safety of high @-@ cal@@ ib@@ re materials used on external grounds .
a follow @-@ up to the Tor@@ ch Bureau in 2015 found that the most damage was caused by fas@@ ta@@ ics - foreign surface de@@ cor@@ ned panels and isolation .
the British police have said they believe that the London G@@ ren@@ fell T@@ ow@@ er isolation and fas@@ ten@@ ers could contribute to the fire chaos there in June , with nearly 80 deaths .
see : they are likely to be on @-@ line sales boards in the autumn
Kenya and autumn are a time @-@ sp@@ an for technical sports , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peri@@ a Pre@@ mi@@ um have been sold , and in the autumn there will also be a new h@@ it@@ t @-@ phones for bo@@ e@@ lep@@ h@@ ire .
according to Tele@@ 2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Se@@ ema , street ships are characterised by an innovative design design , a live s@@ le@@ ep , a ser@@ se @-@ servan@@ i resolution 4@@ K screen and ultra @-@ fast delivery process .
the technology world of Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 has shown great ex@@ ci@@ tement , which has also reached the top ranking of Estonian smart phones .
in autumn , smart fo@@ e@@ tal can be allowed to be loaded with even more rapid , more resilient bat@@ teries , better quality camer@@ a and greater water and dust resistance .
he added that , as far as I am concerned , rum@@ ours can already be made and forecast four top models which will probably modernise sales tables .
these four smart phones &apos; top @-@ edge models will reach the bo@@ ge@@ y@@ el@@ ling operators in the autumn of this year .
the long @-@ awaited i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone Plus should reach shops as early as mid @-@ September .
the g@@ rum@@ ours about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are going to be much .
if i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not bring significant differences between i@@ P@@ hone and 6@@ s , Apple &apos;s 10th birth@@ day is expected to distinguish the new model from the previous one entirely .
four col@@ ours have been mentioned : black , white , rosé gold and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one element of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the entire telephone panel , has lost the do@@ ck@@ le and fingerprints are built on the screen .
the Apple design leader J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve demands that the new i@@ P@@ hone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk about an i@@ P@@ hone cer@@ a@@ mic version .
in addition to the win@@ dows , wireless charging and a higher @-@ quality camer@@ a , faster A@@ 11 process can be expected .
certainly that is one of the most expected smart phones for a year .
the brand G@@ ala@@ x@@ y note 8 will start on 23 August .
there are a lot of rum@@ ours about the new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y note 8 starting to look .
it is worth hearing that even more business users are being rewarded and the S pen will allow even more fun@@ ction@@ ality .
the phone should have two camer@@ as , one being la@@ in@@ pressure and the other a television field with a narrow view .
nobody is yet aware of why two re@@ tar@@ dants are capable of ta@@ pping , but in any case it is the first test of the same same force , which is certainly of value for money compared to i@@ P@@ hone 8 .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August .
while Nokia has brought sales this year with three smart phones , led by Nokia 6 , there is still a shortage of their flagship - Nokia 8 , which is already to be presented on 16 August .
we are waiting from well to 5.@@ 3 @-@ dust screen and ultra @-@ fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ nap@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and a more robust a@@ g .
Nokia is also talking about alu@@ mini@@ um kor@@ una and significant water and dust resistance ( IP@@ 68 ) .
like the code , Nokia &apos;s new model has two nur@@ tures of am@@ bia , an opti@@ mist produced by the Z@@ e@@ iss .
once S@@ ony has been a secure flagship ship , X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smar@@ t@@ phones will have even more innovative functions .
we are waiting for a smar@@ t@@ phone that is a little more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least with the same good or better camer@@ a .
the new model for S@@ ony has been specu@@ lated that it is scre@@ ened at least heat .
what the reality is , we can see it very soon , because traditionally at the S@@ ony &apos;s autumn flagship International Technology F@@ air ( IF@@ A ) , which is expected to be published this year from 1 to 6 September .
Tele@@ phone lea@@ sed trans@@ cri@@ p@@ tors , T@@ ru@@ mp forced to pay the border wall
Washington signed a call between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ p and Mexic@@ an Heads of State for telephone calls between the United States .
on 27 January , Mr Ni@@ etta pressed the Mexic@@ an President , who ordered him to stop announcing that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President pressed him for a public condemnation of the wall , saying &apos; You must not say that to the press &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ mp has l@@ ent its presidential campaign a commitment to build a stret@@ ch of the United States &apos; southern border walls and van@@ ity , to make Mexico pay for this project .
Trans@@ cri@@ lers were also published in their first speech with Australia &apos;s Prime Minister , Malcolm Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l , which reveals intense debates .

Beijing cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revive business
the British educational company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that he would cut another 3 000 jobs and reduce his interim dividend by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with the men@@ tor@@ ing burden of business .
the jobs that will be covered , which will most likely be concentrated according to CE@@ O John F@@ all@@ on , at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will add to the 4 000 posts lost in previous restructuring .
Beijing announced in May plans to cut costs under the third cost @-@ cutting programme by another GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid digital shift .
a company that agreed to sell a share last month to the Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House for its partner company , Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , said that their expectation with respect to the year has not changed since sales revenues were announced at 1 % to 2.@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year .

K@@ abu@@ l attack : suicide bom@@ bar@@ ded by NATO soldi@@ er
the suicide bom@@ ber attacked the officers , according to the officials , the Afghan capital , K@@ abu@@ l , military con@@ vo@@ ys , killing a single NATO soldi@@ er and w@@ ounding several others .
the NATO statement stated that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
without declaring local reports , the town of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi also found three civilians killed in an incident in the line .
this bom@@ bing is the last acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month , with Her@@ at &apos;s mos@@ ch@@ ro@@ gen@@ a killed over 30 people on Tuesday .
on Monday suicide bom@@ bing in K@@ abu@@ l killed two people close to the Iraqi E@@ mb@@ assy .
NATO &apos;s statement said that an explosion on Thursday was carried out when the Afghan army was united in pat@@ ro@@ l with an attack on &quot; man @-@ made explosives . &quot;
the statement states that everything is injured in a stable state and is treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ra@@ m &apos;s airport .
according to cor@@ respondents , the Taliban and group known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( T@@ EE@@ K ) are an increasing force in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ h as a serious source of concern for NATO forces in Bag@@ ra@@ ge .
according to the UN , in the first half of 2017 , at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan , some 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l killed at least 30 people in the line of S@@ hi &apos;@@ ite ra@@ ys .
the Taliban said they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , a major bomb attack in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people , which has resulted in the most deaths in a military attack in the country since US @-@ led forces were reluctant to carry the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp is considering whether to increase the country &apos;s army and US troops helping police forces .
according to cor@@ respondents , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
EPA repealed the decision to postpone the Regulation following actions
the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( UN@@ States Environmental Protection Agency EF ) repealed the decision to delay the establishment of a Obama @-@ time regulation obli@@ ging states to limit emissions of emissions from the summer , one day after 15 states were su@@ ed by its action .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed with &quot; the decision to decide on the eligibility of 2015 &quot; late on Wednesday , saying that it would demonstrate the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with the states .
&quot; we believe we need to have a dialogue and listen to our state partners , &quot; said the EPA leader Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t in a statement .
the pipeline had announced in June the plan to put in place share@@ holder rates at H. Dalli , which measure pollution in various parts of the country , in order to determine where this level should be reduced to compliance with the stricter air quality standard by one year from malaria to 2018 .
15 mostly democratic states , together with the Colom@@ bian community , fi@@ led a fi@@ x@@ ture on Tuesday , saying that this decision was unlawful .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has tried to re@@ tract a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , and I think that is part of the broader growth plan .
but these efforts have led to reactions among democrats and nature conservation groups concerned about the effects of increased contamin@@ ants on human health .

M@@ ike@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss possible confron@@ tations
Mr L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and Ms Gar@@ cia , who should be on a col@@ lisi@@ on course to face the most attractive po@@ xing po@@ xing of the near future in the po@@ pp@@ y up to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg weight , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in L@@ igu@@ le@@ arly M@@ ens &apos;s special rooms in the ES@@ P@@ N office , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ won World Bo@@ xing Coun@@ c@@ ili ligh@@ t@@ weight champion , wal@@ ked to the other corridor to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , the World Bo@@ xing Times tably consulting the sul@@ g@@ ras@@ ra@@ m .
following the unanimous decision of the Gar@@ cia , the former four @-@ time world champion Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er won over Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ time will both mili@@ tia in the head@@ w@@ el .
the Gar@@ cia extended its better hand and said : &apos; how will you go , Na@@ em@@ pi@@ on ?
I wish you well . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko is defending his belt , Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga , on Saturday evening , 19 in ES@@ P@@ N .
when a few pho@@ to pho@@ tos were named , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko &apos;s mountain j@@ er E@@ gis Kli@@ ma pointed out that a possible &quot; perfect exercise &quot; between opposing fighters would be a .
&quot; I am former sul@@ tative , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I have swit@@ ched to B@@ ron@@ er &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; but I am not so big .
I am a little for 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move down@@ wards .
and it must move up the tra@@ il &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the fana@@ tics have asked for it .
let us put it to them . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs that fight . &quot;
the cli@@ ma raised the question of whether it should be worthwhile , as part of his strategy of wanting to allow L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko to book the mid@@ night of this year at 6@@ 1.2 kg class to make it possible for next summer to meet with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 h@@ ass@@ le ) , who also has an interest in combating Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ da and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ k@@ k@@ ich , following the ath@@ le@@ te celebration of the pri@@ m@@ and pri@@ ze@@ y commemor@@ ating on the For@@ ra@@ da@@ r commemor@@ ation on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , because f@@ ans have asked for it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , later , saying that it was open to fighting any channel providing the best financial package .
&quot; we are the main actors .
no other name can attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &apos;
Gar@@ cia said she was considering L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t as a &apos; force figh@@ ter &apos; and could go on to his Saturday bu@@ g .
however , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was modest in pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia saying that he thought the three champion of Ri@@ ver@@ side was &apos; very slow ; I am sorry , M@@ ike@@ y ... you wanted it a no@@ se . &apos;
&quot; Gar@@ cia &quot; said the aim was to show s@@ win@@ ge@@ ing and then bo@@ y .
both confirmed that they felt that tension would increase to try to get them between them .
&quot; that is the struggle for realisation .
no other confrontation aro@@ uses so much attention and s@@ cor@@ n .
I am more than willing to work on that , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been on the best fighters &apos; list , and M@@ ike@@ y is just that .
that will be a good struggle . &quot;
what world ra@@ ys will be relocated to Estonia ?
soil was extended and issued by the Police and Border Guard ( PP@@ A ) in record terms over 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work , study or family .
for example , soil was chosen to issue an open @-@ ended residence permit to 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , whereas Laval was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the agencies cannot tell us how many migrants will eventually stay in Estonia , but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior .
if , ten years ago , nearly 500 Ukrainians were kno@@ cking on Estonia a year , in recent years this figure is approaching 2 000 .
the number of residence permit holders so@@ ared during the Ukrainian crisis , with 10@@ 87 people in 2014 having fixed @-@ term residence permits , compared to 6@@ 75 in the year before .
statistics from the Agency show that the highest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is growing - the cost of the past being more than a civilian population in Estonia was more pronounced .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been very high in Estonia all the time , and it is natural because of the difficult circumstances in the country that work and study opportunities are being sought in a country where the community and many families already had their own , Chris@@ tin Ram@@ mus , the spokes@@ person for the Home Department .
soil and opium had a fixed @-@ term residence ratio even higher than the number of Russian nationals , although in 10 years total temporary residence permits have been granted to them .
if Ukrainians get into work here predominantly , Russian citizens are moved into domestic migration .
&quot; given the Russian historical community here , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said Hel@@ ina Me@@ use , the Internal Security A@@ ca@@ de@@ my .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you look at where the Russian citizens who have been granted Estonian residence have moved , after Har@@ ju@@ no , East F@@ lu@@ e is immediately attached &apos; and pointed out that around 40 % of them are mar@@ ried to an EU citizen .
soil was granted to 1.@@ 6@@ 96 Russian citizens for fixed @-@ term residence , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the residence permit to extend the number of Russians who wanted to enjoy it fell .
&quot; &quot; Hy@@ pe is the result of requests for a new residence permit to be permanently located in Estonia , &quot; said the Home Affairs press representative Ram@@ mus , who said that the Russian citizens &apos; interest in Estonia &apos;s residence permit has remained stable for years .
the new residence permit for a permanent stay in Estonia can be applied for foreigners who have been here for at least three years .
it aims to encourage the survival of adapted people .
a long @-@ term residence permit requires , for example , five years .
the new residence permit has apparently also led to a reduction in the old residency permit .
soil , for example , was given such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
now Ukrainians can exchange their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be able to point the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit became popular in the cour@@ ty@@ ard - the holders of the li@@ ver &apos;s passports ( 10@@ 29 ) , Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , indi@@ cted ( 54 ) and n@@ ig@@ ers ( 36 ) .
in total , 19@@ 68 people were granted residence permits to reside in Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and just as many Chinese .
this year &apos;s first half has already seen a total of 12@@ 69 such applicants .
in 10 years , Nigeria has become a surpris@@ ingly active country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits .
when three life permits were issued to Fin@@ ns in 2007 , the soil was 200 .
Nigeria comes to study here at universities .
in addition , Estonian higher education institutions are popular , for example among Georgi@@ ans , Chinese and Tur@@ ks .
the number of Indian , Bangladeshi and Nig@@ erian citizens has risen mostly thanks to study games .
for them too , the rule applies that there is a community in advance , that is to say more easily to others &apos; , added Ram@@ mus .
in ten years , two people have moved to Estonia , for example from North Korea , as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four from U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6 000 third country nationals receive a residence permit a year , it is about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if you add to the European Union &apos;s citizens , migration will stay to about a percentage , &quot;
a total of 14 8@@ 22 people were exposed to soil according to the statistical office , while 13 7@@ 92 were coming out of it .
that means that immigration has exceeded emigration for a second year .
the majority of relocated and outgoing workers are Estonian citizens , but more are among those leaving .
as a result , Estonian citizens had a migration secret with 2 000 people in the red .
Est@@ oni@@ ans are particularly familiar with the difference between Finland and Estonia .
M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture pr@@ inc@@ e@@ ure wi@@ el@@ ds with sa@@ cks , we@@ ed and e@@ ül@@ ls
in the North circle of ideas , however , there is a history for Maria Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u - old pa@@ int@@ ings and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream somewhere for hours in mus@@ eu@@ ms and old @-@ age thi@@ ev@@ es and ad@@ m@@ ire .
if you go the way with something bitter then you will study and learn about it every day .
that is a joy of disco@@ very !
the M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture gla@@ mo@@ rous world may seem to be a life alien to some , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourself decide how much you are in life !
I have a friend who has a full sa@@ cro@@ wn with the rub@@ ble of the shar@@ ks I have created .
because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ oo@@ d and does not go on a red horse every day , he also wants to carry those most beautiful bro@@ kers and he is suffering !
you can live yourself special life !
the Mo@@ e@@ ar@@ tist does not recognise the divide between bri@@ lli@@ ant events and grey ar@@ mi@@ es .
it was this reasoning that led to the rolling stock plan to move higher gra@@ des to the Finnish countryside , between forests and fields , between people who are often not reached by the fashion .
M@@ ammu @-@ long colle@@ ctions were presented on the basis of comparison , J@@ õh@@ vis and LT mo@@ e@@ alle@@ el , for example , where 45 mo@@ del@@ les were performed by Ro@@ yal Re@@ fi@@ le@@ e throughout the streets .
in Tallinn , the super@@ market is often imported , no@@ ises with dignity , but elsewhere there are more emo@@ tions - ni@@ ps b@@ vo are rising , you want to thank you , including .
a large proportion of the audience had to be down@@ loaded , but now they are M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture f@@ ans .
if you over@@ take people &apos;s expectations , they will be admi@@ red !
and I like the feeling that I am with my mo@@ mo@@ mo@@ is@@ y like the summer timetable .
Per@@ sis@@ tions had a 50 @-@ me@@ tre red car@@ pet , full of all the w@@ oo@@ den stic@@ kers , seemed to be not coming to an end !
Maria does not recognise the fashi@@ on@@ able fact that creation must be presented with a super@@ super@@ cau@@ tionary formula ; she is happy to bring about a happy women .
I often invite my own customers - they have always been happy .
that is the way experience , the char@@ ade on the ver@@ ge of a wonderful ho@@ le !
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen what I have been watching , I am always behind the scen@@ es to give hope@@ less par@@ ade to things that are the last but@@ cher .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow a calm watch from the Chamber .
Maria is the mo@@ el@@ o@@ asis of the sort that is willing not only to play a representative role but to have everything in its hands .
I have a s@@ am &apos;s own mes@@ h machine , most of the College myself .
I like the whole process of you playing with details , you will find out .
I am never far from my own creation and I am not afraid of work .
Dis@@ si@@ ant is not limited , nor is the introduction of co@@ tics , logistics , organisation , organisation - everything has to reach one 180 women &apos;s day .
well , those working hours are still hugely shared .
I cannot say when my working day will end , for me it is just a day full of joy !
I am still very lu@@ cky - it is like an un@@ ce@@ asing happy chain : I do something fine , man gets something beau@@ ty and , moreover , compli@@ cate .
it has been said many times that I have a c@@ oo@@ k@@ ness in my stic@@ kers - they make themselves feel like a pr@@ inc@@ ism .
the ab@@ er@@ rant Sci@@ ences that Maria talent made to hear overnight have remained the M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture sign@@ alling date .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ at of U@@ 18 boys : the Alban@@ ians &apos; weapon of al@@ ag@@ pi@@ tur@@ ni@@ é was turned against us now
alas , fa@@ iry tale ran out .
the first thing was that we could not get our des@@ k .
and when there is such a difference in the table , &apos; there is nothing to do &apos; , Estonia commen@@ ded U@@ 18 cor@@ v@@ ball bo@@ xes 61 : 75 dis@@ lep@@ h@@ ors to Great Britain have played our only par@@ ad@@ ball , BC Kal@@ e@@ v / mo RA@@ ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ ele@@ er .
opponents took 28 p@@ ounds from the offensive wave and so suffered so many more attacks .
we were also not prepared to protect them agg@@ ressi@@ vely and not to attack them , that created .
many English attacks ended in three to five seconds ; we were unable to build protection .
in defence , however , they managed to keep their hands everywhere , we could not combine .
that was the team &apos;s feet .
anti @-@ terrorism was best done .
a lawyer estimates that Estonia should have made more tac@@ tical errors to remove the anti @-@ terrorist momentum in the b@@ ud .
last quarter - we had a zero error , but opponents have already passed a few quick records .
proximity and intense insistence , which was al@@ ag@@ pi@@ tur@@ lic for our weapon , have now turned against us all .
today we had no power against their agg@@ ressi@@ veness .
the y@@ ou@@ th@@ est remained un@@ te@@ nable in Kal@@ ev@@ i , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s .
in general , a whole team can be said to be well @-@ wor@@ n , to date united in shock .
it is a pity that such aggressive opponents had not been met before .
T@@ as@@ k has been confident all the time and has played it out today , but it seemed to have been ti@@ red - she has carried a pretty great burden .
but he made some fairly nice moves that I have seen in the past trends &apos; , added a men@@ tor@@ mer .
terrible numbers : ne@@ fresh cor@@ al cor@@ ps floo@@ ded the vis@@ u@@ ti@@ li@@ ze with E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ al three quarters less than 10 points ...
in the U@@ 18 age class , only the emi B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on cor@@ p@@ ound in Tallinn will not apply to the younger men &apos;s class , she started the day yesterday in Dublin .
and Estonia &apos;s games with Poland were , unfortunately , a je@@ al@@ ous@@ y zone .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but even after the third quarter , 9 : 49 , or only in the last 10 minutes , opponents took the floor from the gas family , leaving the period at the level of 0@@ 16 : 16 .
in both the first and second quarters Estonia thre@@ w 4 , point 1 , third ...
then at the beginning , two pieces of the four @-@ minutes from the first to the box , then the ball was played around 25 bits , then one y@@ el@@ low be@@ ac@@ on and then 21 are passed down ...
perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 crea@@ tures were caught out of a single .
in addition , 2 paragraphs came from four free y@@ ard@@ stic@@ ks .
many pay losses were a reasonable figure with that time , 12 .
the game ended with Poland &apos;s catch @-@ up rate of 33 % and Estonia 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , on opening days Portugal had to be recognised as 83 : 56 better .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to supplement stocks
today NATO has arrived for 1 permanent mine steering group for the weekend to visit Tallinn to prepare for the stock of ships and for the upcoming exercises .
during the visit vessels are preparing for release into the sea , giving cre@@ ws the possibility to take a couple of day holidays .
following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a series of exercises and be prepared for future historic explosives @-@ searching operations .
&quot; the participation of Est@@ oni@@ ans in the NATO conting@@ ent and the co @-@ operation in local waters is a good illustration of our integration into alli@@ ed capacity , &quot; said K@@ IC chief of the overseas military and planning station , Cap@@ ten@@ ore Ar@@ to Rein@@ maa .
since 29 June , NATO will chair the 1 permanent mine war@@ ship group of Latvia &apos;s Cap@@ tain G@@ vi@@ le@@ it@@ na@@ i@@ um Lau@@ du@@ ps , who took over from the Estonian na@@ vy officer , Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as Sel@@ ja@@ a .
the group &apos;s flagship ship is L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , a naval support vessel in Latvia , which also operates a group &apos;s motto .
this semester includes the Estonian Na@@ vy mine hun@@ t and Sak@@ alas as part of an international unit .
as one of the four groups of ships subject to NATO &apos;s Maritime command , NATO &apos;s 1 permanent mine group is a primary installation unit that could be depor@@ ted within five days to different places in the world .
4 @-@ 13 August the fair@@ y@@ tale re@@ tar@@ dants of P@@ iri@@ ta &apos;s mon@@ as@@ tery will once again become the place where the Al@@ es@@ tro E@@ tat , in the Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , was de@@ cep@@ ted 13 years ago .
this year &apos;s Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val will become the Char@@ le@@ mag@@ on &apos;s art leader of the Film in Tallinn , at the J@@ oo@@ to ( 36 ) , a beautiful , powerful and unprecedented .
at the risk of the R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ance : &apos; Tra@@ vi@@ ata &apos; and &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; , bal@@ le@@ ti@@ la@@ la@@ la@@ vel@@ las &apos; sa@@ tu@@ rated &apos; by &apos; Kar@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ in &apos; , and neither the scheme lacks its own production , this time Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ni &apos;s ma@@ i@@ or@@ um Con@@ tri@@ ct , &apos; A@@ asta@@ ajad &apos; , as the equivalent of the international team who brought P@@ iri@@ y@@ ni to Haiti &apos;s design into the cour@@ ty@@ ard in 2015 .
Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has much more than just concer@@ ts and theat@@ re replies .
that is greater than any music theat@@ res in their normal form .
it is a festi@@ val whose s@@ now is gaining ground and never totally dis@@ appears .
because the experience that the user gets in this unjust and my@@ ste@@ rious environment gives people sou@@ ls more cal@@ mer and concerns human models in a way that cannot be described .
at the risk , you are the first year of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val &apos;s artistic leader .
did the ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ k C@@ ant feel a little bit as a gi@@ ft ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with E@@ ri Klaus , it has been a lot of help .
she went through a whole pu@@ pi@@ l career and also supported the di@@ ri@@ gis@@ me at the beginning of my di@@ gis@@ me careers .
perhaps that is why I am easier to carry on with her work .
in K@@ las , Burma has been absor@@ bed so much by the F@@ esti@@ val &apos;s team of ben@@ ches and , of course , all of this also spil@@ ls me over .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going .
E@@ ri K@@ ese , a great heart , also gave me the strength to thri@@ ve on the Tal@@ li@@ o F@@ esti@@ val@@ y in harmony .
and here I am and I can !
what could public opinion on this year &apos;s festi@@ val be given what you are offering in particular ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and surprise , among other things , to presentation in the first bal@@ le@@ um written on Ms L@@ ind@@ gren &apos;s speech .
that is &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson ends &apos; .
and one no@@ torious nu@@ ance in that is that the Bal@@ le@@ ti author is the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ sons , who himself expressed a desire to write on this work .
apparently , she has already had a child &apos;s car@@ ro@@ t in the centre of Kar@@ l@@ sson .
at the risk , how do you b@@ right all that ?
thanks to my supportive life partner , I certainly believe .
such work requires support and much love , and fortunately I have a lot of sta@@ ck .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tion is not as dependent on other people as I myself might be , so how I will go against every new day .
and such awareness of tone , of neutrality and de facto s@@ mil@@ ing on ourselves in the mir@@ ror this morning significantly increased my happy percentage .
especially now this week , when the most important tests are the ones , I have been particularly keen to practise it and it works .
s@@ mil@@ ing itself is boosting brain and raising it .
that is not just fine words .
I think people do not yet know about what their body is providing for them in the univer@@ se , but by everybody will find it gradually .
right now , an important moment .
also has a ri@@ tual before di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di pul@@ ls were taken ?

new results of Swedish age assessment tests for as@@ y@@ lene applicants
in Sweden , as@@ th@@ ma tests were carried out among as@@ th@@ ma@@ tics , which evaluated their age @-@ old novel approach in medicine , with the latest test showing that over 80 % of the@@ ory was considered to be older than 18 % , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started the tests this year .
tests were created to better assess age in the asylum application after the Swedish migration agency ( Mig@@ ration@@ s@@ ver@@ ket ) was criticised for failing to correctly identify the number of the alleged age of refugees of the under @-@ age of several minors .
so far , Mig@@ ration@@ s@@ ver@@ ket has sent 68 cases to the test and the Institute for Justice has issued a total of 24@@ 81 test results between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or over and another 25 cases were assessed by the Court of Justice Institute that &apos; may be a 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older &apos; .
in 4@@ 32 cases , it was concluded that man was &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if the human age is in question .
according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son , the Institute of Justice ( PL ) , results are consistent in relation to those in the past months .
&quot; we do not see any major differences in the statistics over the past months , the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; he said The Local Journal .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were judged to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that applicants have been mis@@ guided by their age .
the institute issued in May the results of the 581 test and said that 4@@ 42 cases &quot; there are indications that the person examined was 18 years old or older . &quot;
but when she studied the results of the 581 test , she said that in 2@@ 43 cases she had directly claimed she would be 18 this year .
this medical age assessment method , whereby wisdom @-@ ham@@ pered r@@ ö@@ n@@ gen@@ i@@ images and cor@@ n MR@@ T fields , are carried out , is then allowed to be analysed by den@@ tists and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts , has been criticised in some quarters .
one of the sceptics is the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute endo@@ k@@ rin@@ scien@@ gist Claude Mar@@ cus , whose tasks include an assessment of human biological maturity to find out whether they went through the usual audience early or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about that and I do not think that the measu@@ re@@ ments that are currently being used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say for sure , we should not pretend we can , &apos; he said to the newspaper in Met@@ ro .
but John Gö@@ rans@@ son from the Institute for Justice backed the accuracy of tests : &apos; generally speaking , the child &apos;s in@@ accurate adul@@ tera@@ ted adult risks are small .
perhaps the biggest 10 % is in danger of being a little under 18 . &quot;
9 indication that you could de@@ lude your fraud more de@@ arly .

you are painful because you have so many nice times and memor@@ ies together .
I would like to for@@ give her , but is it time ...
Y@@ our Tan@@ go lists nine indicators showing that your more expensive behaviour will regret and be for@@ given for her action .
the better price you can see is the gravity of the situation and you are working hard to resolve it .
your cost is one that is more expensive than that is dealt with by another fellow passenger .
your cost is no longer in defen@@ sive positions .
she sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for her actions .
she is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
she agrees that she has made a serious mistake and genuinely tries to improve the situation .
she is attentive and she is trying to communicate with you in a pleasant way .
at the same time , she is pressing you to get out of the matter .
they do not deny what has happened and try to make it un@@ noticed .
you and your cost is the realisation why default was raised in your relationship .
you talk about that and also about how to prevent it in the future .
you need to communicate better and assess each other &apos;s needs better .
less expensive attitudes and actions have helped you to develop your own sympathy with her error .
more expensive commitment and behaviour have created the basis for your clo@@ sen@@ ess to recover .
as a couple , you have made progress to re @-@ believe in your unity and relationship .
the 20 @-@ year old vas@@ s@@ er , Anna Maria O@@ rel , did a nice debate on the BBC with her 6.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 6.@@ birth@@ place .
the leader was the M@@ M no@@ ori@@ um female champion and a happy woman confirmed that she hoped to fight for med@@ als in the future .
the contest went well and gained good experience .
I did my first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) right away to mine my average performance , the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) , and the third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) I could almost keep it clear , &quot; said O@@ rel after the contest .
I expected my emissions and I am very pleased that I found them .
Anna Maria O@@ re@@ li M@@ M &apos;s dis@@ course ended with a good 18 seats .

&apos;@@ I am afraid , &apos; he said with a little mu@@ d@@ dle .
at the London Olympics , almost a full House had a population , did they buy people around them or was they able to put themselves off ?
I did , but in a positive way .
everybody says it will add - that is true !
if you compete , you can experience it .
after all , he confirmed that he would be happy with the M@@ M debate and that he still has many good competitions : &apos; I came here with the 3@@ 2nd last result of this season , the last one , I finished over 18 .
that is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and M@@ il - that is the only thing that counts .
I will take on a good experience and , some days , I want to compete on behalf of the med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina Governor announced party change
the Western @-@ Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced at the gathering of Thursday evening with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i that he would change political parties .
&apos;@@ W@@ h@@ y it or not , the democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &apos; The Governor , Justice , said .
&quot; today , having gra@@ zed and admi@@ red a lot of ... today I say to you , the Western Ty@@ re , that I can no longer help you as a democratic govern@@ or . &quot;
the assembly was filled with celeb@@ rations of joy .
&quot; so I will be Re@@ publi@@ can tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a lawyer , I would say to you that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
T@@ ru@@ mp had previously committed a major announcement at the West @-@ Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a gathering .
T@@ ru@@ mp won in Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a on 42 points and Justice did not support a Democrat candidate , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
justice , which is the only billion rule in the state of For@@ mal State , was elected in 2016 .
the Ford notes that it has coal mines in five states and coal trading in quite its own country .
it has a value of approximately USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday evening , the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) published an announcement that &apos; the Governor , the Justice party change , is yet another blow to the democratic party that would prevent the country from getting better , rather than working for it &apos; .
&quot; just 15 sta@@ rs and controls on the lowest number of states in history - the Governor , Justice , &apos;s announcement is just the most recent thing to say to the par@@ ks , which are in a hur@@ dle and cannot find a positive and uni@@ fying message , &quot; said R@@ N@@ C Man@@ ik R@@ on@@ na R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ &apos;s press .
it is hardly surprising that there are many people , there are many injured .
on a do@@ or@@ step , Ur@@ met , the office in the We@@ ek@@ l magaz@@ ine , said yesterday to the jury that they had to have a great deal of pos@@ ter .
plants and mar@@ ches are fundamental , unless the lies and slight failures .
of course , there are also statements in the past , in ab@@ y@@ ss and history .
Ur@@ me@@ ti said that visitors will come out to the festi@@ val with false foot@@ wear , and so the problems will come .
the media have also had to assist a few more injured visitors - there have been some s@@ care@@ mon@@ gering cases and there has been also one foot in the foot .

Co@@ e congratulated the Russians for their fair apolo@@ gies for the D@@ us@@ h@@ ic
the international force r@@ é@@ lite S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e praised him for &apos; Russia &apos;s four @-@ day apolo@@ gy &apos; to the D@@ oping scandal , but repeated that this is not the time to allow sport back .
Russia &apos;s g@@ rin@@ d to the ath@@ le@@ tes D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lak@@ h@@ tin said at the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the ath@@ le@@ tes &apos; World C@@ up that a competition ban imposed on his country is right and has a firm objective of combating doping .
she apolog@@ ised &apos; to all light @-@ min@@ de@@ rers who are stranded at the gold and sil@@ ver me@@ als . &apos;
despite his comments , IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the ban on the contest introduced in November 2015 , following the W@@ AD@@ A report , which found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think today was a very fair answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the press .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that Russia itself admitted that they had had had quite difficult times and that they would do everything possible to re@@ organise the U@@ U . &quot;
Co@@ e said she was also pleased that Russia accepted its own forecas@@ ting criteria .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the group &apos;s proposal that this is not the time for Russia to re@@ sign , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything we can in the next few months to bring the situation back to normal .
we have always based on the principle that we want to separate clean spor@@ ts@@ men from the system , &quot; he added .
N@@ in@@ teen Russian ath@@ le@@ tes meeting the strict criteria of IA@@ AF will compete as neutral ath@@ le@@ tes at the World C@@ up champi@@ on@@ ships starting in London on Friday .
the head of the IA@@ AF Group R@@ une Andersson said on Monday that Russia is not yet meeting a number of criteria for reconstruction .
after the IA@@ AF Council report , she told journalists in London that doping controls were still insufficient and that the banned mil@@ ls were still operating freely .
the electric car revolution is making a significant difference to the honey demand .
who are winners and losers ?
not least that the electric car revolution will make a significant difference from the fuel market to infrastructure , it will also create new winners and losers on the me@@ tal market .
although mining gi@@ ants like G@@ len@@ core can say that they can win from one place and lose the other , the smaller mining companies will not help .
today , G@@ len@@ core is being served by coal and oil , but in the electric car era the co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ ity demand will increase .
this year , in the area of the spread of electric cars , contributions have been taken up by the UK , French and Norwegian Governments , which will in the coming decades allow new cars to be banned .
so Vol@@ vo has already knew that it was planning to abandon the combustion engine and T@@ es@@ la will bring a cheaper 3 electricity vehicles on to the market .
B@@ loom@@ berg New Energy Finance estimates that over two decades , electric cars will be sold more than cars used using oil @-@ generated fuels .
&quot; for some metals it changes everything , Capital Economics &quot; said the raw material analy@@ st Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ ini B@@ loom@@ berg .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as code and li@@ thi@@ um , which have been growing demand for years .
electric cars have about three times more adverse effects than the normal car , G@@ len@@ core has announced .
more repu@@ di@@ ate is needed at charging stations , which is why Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that this will increase demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in the demand for electricity cells will mean additional li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ gan@@ ese demand .
G@@ len@@ core will be able to generate a growing power @-@ driven car @-@ wing income from so@@ wing and from being the world &apos;s largest co@@ balt producer , predi@@ cting J@@ eff@@ eries Group .
this bro@@ ker company estimates that other electric cars will be winners of F@@ ree@@ port @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ tum Min@@ er@@ als .
the market reac@@ ts to a already changing trend .
this year , the London me@@ tal code has gone up by 70 % .
the bub@@ ble price rises were 37 % .
the wheat has also risen to 14 % this year , mainly because of economic growth .
as a G@@ len@@ core excise , London increased 20 % , above the price increases to the Rio T@@ to Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ on and Ang@@ lo Americ@@ as .
on the side of the distributors , lead companies such as Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine are operating , which have to adapt to a new era .
P@@ ole &apos;s basic end @-@ use is the supply of le@@ vers for cars with a petrol and diesel engine .
electric cars use li@@ thi@@ um cells .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome demand downturn &quot; the Bank of America Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ chi &apos;s Me@@ Me@@ teoro@@ logical Market analytical leader Michael W@@ id@@ mer .
the brand movement has not yet noticed the impact of the dri@@ f@@ ting trend .
cotton has been cut by 17 % this year , with it being the best meta@@ ph@@ or in London for the price rises in the main industrial metals .
investors can only see problems on metals in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure that is so bad for lead because cheap oil is keeping the normal cars in competition &quot; said Me@@ tar@@ lic Me@@ tal@@ ler Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ l@@ las , Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt .
if there is a lead crunch , it is slow .
that may happen in about ten years .
in the meantime , stricter gas emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars , which are more frequent to trigger engines from developed lead @-@ based bat@@ teries , will be assessed by the international lead and the Ku@@ ni research organisation .
L@@ igh@@ ten metals like alu@@ mini@@ um replace steel , because a cheaper car can drive less electricity further .
this explains as early as 2013 @-@ 2016 the additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes .
it represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s total output of alu@@ mini@@ um .
that trend is likely to intensify , W@@ id@@ mer said .
the A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um has risen to 13 % this year , as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
steel manufacturers do not .

an end to the oil era could also bring suffering to the pla@@ te .
the cost of soil was about half of this precious diesel engine cataly@@ sts for cars , says Me@@ mo@@ sa@@ ic@@ ist Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ the .
&quot; many of the raw materials with high demand today , such as oil and pla@@ tin@@ um , may not face much demand in the future , &quot; said Na@@ ti@@ x@@ ise raw materials analy@@ sts Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but they are becoming important within 15 years .
Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ at@@ farmers believe that there is continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars .
the leader of Un@@ core , Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , said that in 2025 more hybrid cars would continue to be sold .

how football &apos;s monetary rules affect the Ney@@ mark &apos;s transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the exces@@ ses of European football clubs do not prevent the EEA from entering the record global conversion from the Spanish football clubs to the Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main in Barcelona .
any consequences from UEFA , the governing body that govern@@ s Europe and has the power to block teams from taking part in the prestige of the Me@@ is@@ ters League , are waiting until Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ May .
the Financial Regulation for a fair game ( F@@ F@@ F@@ F@@ F@@ P ) introduced by UEFA in 2011 will mean that PS@@ G will have to provide some evidence that the Ney@@ mark transfer was funded without massive losses .
Barcelona was paid € 2@@ 22 million ( $ 2@@ 62 million ) alone for buying an Brazili@@ an from his contract , and Ney@@ mark &apos;s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars per year .
here there are some Ney@@ mar &apos;s financial aspects of the transition to the French club .
PS@@ G will undoubtedly be able to pay Ney@@ ra and put his sta@@ ple missile in such a way , given that the team is financed by a family dominated by the Ka@@ tar &apos;s Energy unit .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the recruitment of players , but they have to balance it with legal income sources that will enable them to get out to football business .
F@@ F@@ P was first opened up by Michel Pla@@ tini after he was elected as President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs that would be successful in finding a lot of debt would actually be involved in fraud and risk ruin if banks or owners had to give up support .
from 2011 , F@@ P will focus on monitoring their losses instead of remaining in clubs .
this change means that the business model used by Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch first in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ sea - to buy a potential club and then carry on with a lot of expenditure to make a team better and create a global brand - will be harder to implement .
F@@ F@@ F@@ P during the current three @-@ year evaluation period , which runs until 2018 , can cause clubs up to € 30 million of losses .
and despite the humili@@ ating nature of Pla@@ tini &apos;s office in 2015 , his successor to UEFA , Alexander ander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , remains committed to preventing excessive waste .
&quot; F@@ F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will continue to reinforce these rules , &quot; said The associated P@@ C Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , the chief of UEFA @-@ F@@ P ranking .
although PS@@ G Ney@@ mark &apos;s buying @-@ up clause will be able to provide a single payment for a single payment , they will be able to allocate this amount to the full extent of the contract &apos;s duration .
Ney@@ mar signed a five @-@ year agreement , so it will be possible to show the transitional levy over the next five years as a sum of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million .
in 2014 , the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions was accompanied by the most severe penalties , in a quarter of Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga .
the PS@@ G was fined € 60 million ( at this moment at € 82 million ) , which was subsequently reduced to € 20 million , and was required to limit the Me@@ Policy Code &apos;s team during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season to 21 players instead of business as usual 25 .
UEFA is seeking clubs that can try to ro@@ ck over regulatory institutions by p@@ ouring their income into the club via owners .
the Q@@ a@@ tar company may spon@@ sor PS@@ G , but if the spon@@ sorship value is deemed to be above standard market rates , UEFA would not accept it as official income .
this was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar Tourism Authority &apos;s value was blo@@ wn up .
it has been said that a certain part of the Ney@@ mark PS@@ G services could come from Q@@ a@@ tar via contributions from the World C@@ up Board of 20 years .
but PS@@ G and Ka@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ ra could become a world champi@@ on@@ ist and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulators could easily reveal such an manoeuvre .
the early sentences against PS@@ G mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation on Thursday said that UEFA had not addressed the PS@@ G @-@ Ney@@ mark transition pro@@ actively .
they spoke with The associated P@@ Congress , provided they are guaranteed their anon@@ y@@ mity , because they are not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
recent reports show that the PS@@ G service will generate more than € 10 million in profits during the 2015 @-@ 2016 season at around € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the latest financial year data has not yet been published .
PS@@ G hopes that the Ney@@ mark &apos;s arrival will have a positive effect on spon@@ sorship transactions , commerci@@ alisation and sales marking .
the club is waiting for at least 30 % of contract @-@ related sales .
Spain , being clearly irri@@ tated by the departure of one of the largest football sta@@ rs , sought to prevent the Ney@@ mark from going , claiming that the PS@@ G is in breach of F@@ P .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with the club and country &apos; , &apos; President of La liga T@@ eb@@ as told the Spanish newspaper &apos; , indicating that PS@@ G is mainly in Ka@@ tar .
Ar@@ sen@@ al K@@ mä@@ re@@ per , Ar@@ sene W@@ en@@ ger , who belongs to the American sports mag@@ na@@ te , shares the attitude of La with the state financing by the club .
&quot; that is the result of ownership rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; if a club belongs to the state , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the state can have other ways or interests to represent such a major player . &quot;

50 years ago today : a hur@@ ric@@ ane storm in Estonia which fo@@ ol@@ ish ha@@ vo@@ c from houses and win@@ dows .
the hur@@ ric@@ ane , which was called a century stor@@ my , ra@@ ging on 6 and 7 August , caused major damage , particularly to the West , the Car@@ the@@ ian and the Rap@@ id .
in north @-@ west Estonia over 30 m / s during these days .
in my old me@@ dal , a single @-@ card wood in the gar@@ den was running to the other side and it was broken with hands to support them .
everyone was blind and rub@@ bing , as the world &apos;s course .
the beneficiary had already taken off the houses , in 2002 , an old woman L@@ inda K@@ uro@@ va Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ ust reminded the magaz@@ ine in an interview with Estonian Nature .
the L@@ inda wife saw the par@@ ade he had put together .
but what are you going to do with hands to support such stor@@ my suffering ?
the sea came under the window , from win@@ dows in glas@@ ses , &apos; Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us Kal@@ da spoke at the streets of L@@ inda , on the same day .
the way the trees were full and the H@@ eb@@ er@@ g railway station had flo@@ wn 20 @-@ 30 metres away , saw the majority of the shar@@ k kil@@ os just as next morning .
local say that behind Par@@ ale@@ pa there was a disability behind the pi@@ le , some quite b@@ right , some han@@ ging .
everyone saw very de@@ pressing , the storm went through a ra@@ g@@ ba@@ g and pragmatism like a war from beautiful old trees .
Western Vir@@ u@@ maa did not suffer particularly badly in the 196@@ th car test compared with Western Estonia , but the damage was still great there , as Vir@@ u@@ maa Official in 2007 .
Ha@@ vo L@@ ossi@@ park and P@@ ad@@ ise were pain@@ fully wi@@ ped out , but our para@@ tus par@@ ks too were severely damaged .
Tallinn measured for wind speed up to 35 metres per second , i.e. about 130 km per hour .
on the evening of August , M@@ eri@@ välj@@ al , a small c@@ and@@ le of lead r@@ ings had said : &apos; mother , mother !
&apos;@@ Can@@ es are in the air and cannot be signed ! &apos; , Vir@@ u@@ maa &apos;s Official Journal wrote .
the generational concept in Vil@@ j@@ an@@ di@@ ary was deci@@ ma@@ ted during the storm so much as it was decided to be dem@@ ol@@ ished later .
the Au@@ tor@@ i was not opposed by the ski hill structures of T@@ ü@@ ri , which were not subsequently restored .
on 12 August 19@@ 62 the newspaper Red T@@ äh@@ t wrote that cleaning towns and settlements from de@@ pressed trees and their ox@@ y@@ gen would slow , and that people would be free to walk in cleaning works .
what also hit fer@@ tility crops very hard , and the newspaper announced that &apos; party organisations must be both maintenance tra@@ cing and fer@@ tility @-@ ta@@ ine@@ er . &apos;
Or@@ ca@@ mine can be reported if the average wind is over 3@@ 2.7 m / s .
the ru@@ g@@ by core record in Estonia will last from 2 November 19@@ 69 , when Ru@@ h@@ nu@@ l measured at wind speed 48 m / s .
the only story on the island was broken by a measure , so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be recorded accurately .
secret of bo@@ w@@ y be@@ aches : night @-@ to @-@ site work and poor coastal face
Se@@ g@@ le@@ ct summer war@@ fare also means less cleaning in the can@@ al areas of Tallinn .
&apos;@@ I@@ f there are no , people are on the coast and if not , there are no people &apos; , the be@@ ach is wor@@ ship@@ wrec@@ ked .

people are still coming on the coast , whether water is poor or not .
if it is nice , people are on the coast , and if not , there are no people , &quot; the Pri@@ vate Company ( SP@@ R ) &apos;s administration will be used by Alexand@@ r U@@ so@@ v , the Man@@ aging Director of the be@@ et@@ le .

now what is in the field is kept .
price of clean be@@ ach
one of the biggest work on Estonia &apos;s be@@ aches is to close the was@@ h , or de@@ fro@@ g .
for example , in the P@@ iri@@ ta coast it has to be transported 400 000 tonnes of coast@@ line .
&quot; that is an incredible amount , it is a sign of U@@ so@@ m .
another large category is municipal lit@@ ter , or all that people leave .
one and a half kilometre at the coast of S@@ tro@@ om , there are eight large rub@@ b@@ ish sein@@ ers that need to be disposed of three times a week .
so much waste arises .
however , the cold summer weather has meant that waste is five fewer than it was .
the third type is de@@ ser@@ ted things .
most of these are cargo products .
as a result , U@@ so@@ v has gra@@ b@@ bed ten quarters out of the sand .
they will leave owners to wait for a tra@@ il @-@ on @-@ board timber route .
&quot; normally they will come out more , but it is normal harvest , &quot; and it is already a disco@@ very that they will soon find them again in the sand .

Prüm is spread
the management agent Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler conce@@ des that tra@@ ctor driving is disrup@@ ted by local authorities .
noise , which runs from night to night to ste@@ ak , is disrup@@ ted by the breeding of the people in the vic@@ inity .
on the day , however , that work is impossible .

Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
Bank of Eng@@ ant is expected to announce interest rates remain at the same level as weak growth and inflation mitigation have cus@@ hi@@ oned speculation on the up@@ turn .
Bank of England has warned that growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish , as household @-@ tight incomes have set interest rates on hold .
Bank Financial Policy Board ( MP@@ C ) policy@@ makers voted in favour of keeping their rates at 6 : 2 0.@@ 25 % , and fewer members will require a rise this month , as slow growth has weakened support for growth .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank has cut the annual growth forecast to 1.7 % in 2017 and 2018 at its 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the bank sign@@ alled that the rate increases are necessary to contain the inflation of the Bre@@ x in the next few years and that financial markets could have the necessary rise above the expected borrowing costs .
Members also voted a year ago to partially re@@ write the dec@@ k@@ ant stimu@@ lation of the SM@@ P in Bre@@ x@@ t .
the bank ends in February a fixed @-@ term financing scheme that provides banks with cheap financing , although it said it would now be worth up to GBP 15 billion , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the bank says : &apos; in the MP@@ C central forecast gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain power@@ less in the near future , as the real income situation in households will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
on rates , it was repeated that inflation mitigation would be required &apos; to make some adjustments to fiscal policy &apos; , to some extent &apos; , if markets were expected .
the Böge margin is currently predi@@ cting the first increase in next year &apos;s third quarter and the second in 2020 .
but the bank stressed that any anthem was gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
2018 &apos;s 1.8 % growth forecast remained .
after that news , the p@@ ound fell the course against the dollar and the euro .
women fell 0.5 % to USD 1.@@ 31 and 0.@@ 4 % to EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures , which have reduced growing expectations of rising GDP growth in the second quarter from 0.2 % to 0.@@ 3 % in the previous three months .
the bank says that growth is likely to stay at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will start to gain some momentum .
the Bank &apos;s most recent inflation report provided little reason to re@@ jo@@ ice inflation and pi@@ tiful wage rises to households suffering from the ab@@ un@@ dance of population , saying that the situation would go a little further .
it was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income from hitting the income in the next few years , but a significant recovery is expected for the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
the weak pay@@ out also encourages the economy to increase British production , which partially compensa@@ tes for lower consumer costs .
the decision comes one year after the rates were reached last August 0.@@ 25 % after the shocking EU referendum , which caused a sudden weakening of the p@@ ound .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years to brea@@ the full life into the prices and the economy .
before the bank &apos;s final decision , there was a growing demand for raising the rate , as inflation had increased the pressure on pressed households ; in July , three policy @-@ makers were demanding an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell from 2.6 % last month , up from 2.9 % in June , although the bank said it was expected to pick up again and again over the coming months .
the bank said that excessive growth compared to 2 % was due to a completely weak p@@ ound .
the CE@@ O of Co@@ rec@@ o mortgage len@@ c@@ kers , Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , said : &apos; in light of the recent decline in exchange rate courses , the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again , as len@@ ders ye@@ ar@@ n and hope to complete the year &apos;s positive work .
the Böge rs seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are about to be completed , because re@@ financing , often service absor@@ bed and low rate have become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS is writing a 10 000 @-@ strong HIV drug against a contradiction
since September patients have had access to trans@@ forma@@ tional treatments after a battle had been held in the Supreme Court to assess whether N@@ HS should finance a medicine .
N@@ HS announced that public health services would now make an initial three @-@ year clinical trial available to 10@@ ,000 people during an estimated 3 @-@ year clinical trial , a pre @-@ rou@@ gh alert ( Pr@@ EP ) ta@@ ble@@ t , a ta@@ ble@@ t that is pre @-@ rou@@ ted before the rec@@ ess and has shown a potential risk reduction of around 86 % for high @-@ risk people .
the HS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the appeal Court supported last year &apos;s Supreme Court ruling that the N@@ HS would be able to pay for Pr@@ EP , despite the Authority &apos;s own asser@@ tions that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
the Man@@ aging Director of N@@ HS Eng@@ land , Simon Ste@@ vens , welcomed the release on Thursday as &apos; major new med@@ dling &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as &apos; turning moments &apos; .
I@@ r@@ ho@@ wing clin@@ ics in London , B@@ righ@@ ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ l and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the top to register , and in October there will be further clin@@ ics before the programme is introduced throughout England by April 2018 .
the pre @-@ HIV infection ( Pr@@ EP ) is a HIV drug t@@ ree , which is undertaken before an interim arrangement to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
clinical trials show that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk .
Pr@@ EP &apos;s introduction prior to the incident means that there are a sufficient number of medicines in the human body that prevent HIV infections .
such medicines can be taken on a daily basis or at the latest two hours before the rec@@ ess .
eligible candidates for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ gender people and people who are HIV @-@ infected and cannot receive treatment .
clinical persons identify suitable people who agree to participate in a clinical trial , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those with an HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clinical trial participating in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and N@@ HS England signed the Treaty to get medicines this week after international procurement procedures .
the clinical trial aims to assess the actual potential of Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who is destined for treatment and how it is consumed and implemented in a big picture .
Ste@@ vens said : &apos; this new massive interference should complement and leverage a comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
this is another milestone in more than three decades of the fight against one of humanity &apos;s greatest health problems . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , NA@@ T CE@@ O , said : &quot; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if targeted correctly at those in need and at risk @-@ class groups , offers an opportunity to transform Britain &apos;s HIV epidemic .
since September , through this clinical attempt , funded by the high @-@ HIV @-@ risk people in England , access to a powerful new tool which is individually managed and is not dependent on dialogue with the partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome that announcement . &quot;
ian Green , Executive Director of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Foundation , said : &quot; now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is quickly pushed through the country and that no HIV @-@ risk group is excluded .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been obtained , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of HIV infection .
the public health minister Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son said : &apos; the start of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delay and le@@ ctures on government sho@@ es .
evidence shows how much this medicine can bring to HIV prevention and to stop the spreading of life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will take us one step further towards fully understanding the Pr@@ EP advantages .
it is now important that a clinical attempt is implemented across the country as soon as possible to protect people with HIV exposure and to move us one step closer to halting HIV transmission in society . &quot;
electricity prices in Estonia increased by 12 % , Latvia and Lithuania .
July July , the difference between electricity stock exchange prices between Latvia and Lithuania fell to 1.@@ 94 euros , compared to € 7.@@ 71 in June this year , Ele@@ ring announced .
the main reason for the difference in prices is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia the average electricity exchange rate last month was € 3@@ 4.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour , and the price increased by 12 % from June .
in Latvia and Lithuania the price fell by 5 % to 3@@ 6.@@ 27 euros per me@@ ga@@ tt .
in Finland the price was € 3@@ 4.@@ 17 and the Nord half of the electricity exchanges had a cost of € 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour .
prices rose by 12 % and 7 % respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , the electricity moved to 75 % of the previous month &apos;s hours towards Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
the other nine % of the hours two did not go on to two countries for the following day .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity moved from 99 % of the time to Latvia and 73 % of the hours had the full transmission capacity .
according to the transactions on Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X , the August electricity stock exchange rate could reach approximately € 34 and € 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t .
the carbon price of electricity production increased last month , and transactions were at a price of between 5.@@ 04 and 5.@@ 47 € per tonne .
living in higher education - half @-@ hear@@ ted de@@ sig@@ ners and cle@@ ver design devices have made it a little Ear@@ ls Court cor@@ k house
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker with passion for a building re@@ va@@ un@@ der , replaced her great K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge home in 2014 against Ear@@ ls Cour@@ ti .
it is in Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ race &apos;s first order and that Jo@@ anne has not combined his bags and has sold the block on is an honour to a new design .
&quot; before that , I lived with a former life @-@ partner in K@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge on much stronger soil , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I expected something that would be equivalent to the price I offered .
I was given that statement by Ear@@ ls Cour@@ ti and had similar high levels .
I was we@@ aring that and making a deal on the same day . &quot;
since the first visit , this 93 @-@ square me@@ tre cor@@ ps has passed a full innovation plant .
at the beginning , it was a s@@ lee@@ ping cor@@ k and a complicated sta@@ ck : to get a s@@ lee@@ ping ball , it had to walk through the kit@@ chen ; Jo@@ anne wanted to add housing and qu@@ asi @-@ order to exploit the high levels .
&quot; I wanted high , big win@@ dows , a lot of light .
those were my demands , &apos; he said .
she ordered archite@@ ctural and design dio@@ t Du@@ ck &amp; shed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi in hill to exploit 3.@@ 8 m of de@@ ser@@ t and to create a home that would not be just a development site but a place where Jo@@ anne could live .
as far as the Treaty was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so architecture was the challenge of creating half @-@ way order where it could stand .
Er@@ fan had to approach the matter in a creative way .
&quot; the Me@@ tal@@ building is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise facilities so that they are on one another without having to sit back .
it was not just about building a platform , but we used a steel structure to ensure that the top and lower space would be right . &quot;
this emphasis enabled Er@@ fan@@ o to create in the room two full @-@ blo@@ wn rooms with a number of dramatic elements .
the half @-@ way will be opened with lighting from the old age to the other gla@@ m@@ our housing in the R@@ et@@ rou@@ us window .
the gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ful Ser@@ ge Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille light highlight space .
the use of mir@@ rors will play a role in the introduction of theat@@ re , space and lighting .
both sides of a short corridor have been added to make them more attractive .
in K@@ öö@@ g , a mir@@ ror gives the second tuna window in the open .
on the move , the reflection will provide a care @-@ side to all Jo@@ anne feed @-@ bearing and glass claims .
life @-@ bearing clothing is accompanied by the possibility of closing vegetables if not used , creating a more flu@@ ent space for the image .
the cu@@ ri@@ ously ea@@ ten kit@@ chen is nothing new .
however , there is a unique piece of cu@@ is@@ ine that it is a g@@ rin@@ ding shop of art .
&quot; it went a bit towards design , &quot; explains the contribution of Er@@ fan in a strengthened spo@@ ilt M@@ D@@ F .
&quot; it has a counter@@ weight , which makes it very simple to push it . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne now has 16 additional metres , additional s@@ lee@@ ping permission and a better flat plan .
&quot; after all , underground sur@@ faces are what you sell - or what gives property value - &apos; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; the detention land is in an out@@ mo@@ ded form and makes calculations on the basis of a be@@ ach area . &quot;
here they have managed to increase underground access , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury status to the premises .
&quot; materials are what you touched and thus help to create emotional links with your home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ You are not we@@ aring electricity to pig electricity .
that is important , but it is not a question of mind @-@ root language . &quot;
this shows that good design and increased surface areas are helping to do something quite ama@@ zing about the normal cor@@ ps .
in fact , they can actually cause a desire not to leave , as happened to Jo@@ anne .
Al@@ le@@ mag@@ ant Jen@@ sen is the main Ara@@ ha@@ ha@@ me@@ m operating in Ch@@ ic@@ ago , competing with her colleague for a professional reputation .
it is not worth considering the amount of money that is earned , with all ethics in the world .
she and three children only see the man in the early hours and late .
on the first part of the film , I am leaving myself in the idea that it is the &apos; Ka@@ ar@@ di@@ house &apos; version of the business world - even in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s address is similar .
the further film , the less the cells will remain , and the film @-@ mak@@ er mor@@ alising intention will increasingly appear .
life @-@ changing experience will mean a key figure in bo@@ y cancer .
now there is a choice between work and family life .
the po@@ et dre@@ aming from the Ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ ct profession makes fathers think in the riots in Ch@@ ic@@ ago about really important things , such as religion , ch@@ arity , love ... without even affecting the twin sectors .
after a third st@@ ole where a son opens a eye , there is a feeling that film @-@ makers have certainly been driven to the goal of getting the pu@@ mp , because even the most pri@@ est specta@@ tor is unable to hold te@@ ars back in the face of the plight of a army cancer sick bo@@ y .
if the son falls into the home and his situation seems to be very hope@@ less , father will ultimately understand the moral mor@@ ality of his work and will do a ch@@ arity to an ancient man seeking a job .
now I am putting a stra@@ ta on my own - if a film has a happy film , I reward my own dis@@ cer@@ n@@ ment after a film coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , then one figure could be praised for at least one surprise .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ice will not be a coff@@ ee - when the hus@@ band calls a sick person and a man is rus@@ hing through a corridor Pal@@ ace in slow motion .
the baby has instead been brea@@ th@@ ed and , although his father has just lost his job , it is all very positive because now , after all , there is time to deal with the family .
I can feel well too - I can predict the end of the American dra@@ ma quite well !
to be honest , film is well designed , all the elements are there .
you can drink , you can lau@@ gh , actors are good and mor@@ ale : money is not the most important thing in life .
K@@ ülla@@ p brings it into the film well .
the new staff chief of T@@ ru@@ p intends to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps Mr Kelly can actually do that .
in that case , it would be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new top of the White House &apos;s staff will limit the flow of information that President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in reaches , including news , in the hope that it will keep the upper hand in a more balanced balance .
here the trial is from Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ i :
&quot; on his first day of office , when the new chief of the White House , John F@@ . Kelly , met senior officials , he brought forward a key problem President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i White in the UK , which he intends to address the poor information of the disease in the presidential hands .
Kelly said to the officials that information must go through him , either on paper or in meetings , because the President would do better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried to do so too , and they have failed to track T@@ ru@@ p in his media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relation to television goes decades and even now that he is in the White House , his television television television broadcas@@ ter has not disappeared .
&quot; when the candidate , T@@ ru@@ mp , was anno@@ yed for the unfair media coverage , he was proved to have been reported in the pres@@ ti@@ gious ex@@ ts , &quot; said the former campaig@@ ner , S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , to Poli@@ ti@@ dge .
Poli@@ tic@@ o tara Pal@@ mer wrote at the time that &apos; six former campaig@@ ners said T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i to be the key to driving the ha@@ bit of ensuring that his personal media consumption also stabil@@ ously contains praise . &apos;
well .
but the idea that the habits of using the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaig@@ ners know something that the rest of us do not know tõhustab me that T@@ ru@@ p would have been even more encouraging without their interventions .
we probably never know about the remains that T@@ ru@@ mp did not .
if he could rescue hel@@ pers a couple of times from a sca@@ pe@@ goat , their efforts were worth doing that .
but no one has been able to prevent T@@ ru@@ p from continually po@@ ison@@ ing .
part of the problem is that in the White House , which makes competing cli@@ cks , people are trying to promote their own interests , without exception , by sending T@@ ru@@ h material that supports their world view but is not always credible .
Poli@@ tic@@ o , the whole story story , wrote in May about the tendency of advis@@ ers to feed to the President with strategic information .
one of the examples of repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is as follows :
&quot; today &apos;s and former T@@ ru@@ p will say that T@@ ru@@ mp can react to a negative press , particularly to mal@@ ici@@ ous information , explo@@ sive thinking in identifying their source .
this was the case at the end of February , when someone was lu@@ cky enough to give the President a copy of the copy to an online provo@@ cative , Charles C. The website to Joh@@ n@@ son , G@@ ot@@ s.@@ New@@ com , accus@@ ing the staff chief of the staff Prosecutor , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , that he was the &apos; source of a series of information &apos; in the White House .
it makes no difference that Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of mo@@ cking or has not offered any concrete evidence or has mis@@ charges in the past and withdrawn them from it .
I read the article and asked the subordin@@ ate Wal@@ sh . &apos;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that the then Chief of personnel Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us and the White House &apos;s Head of the C@@ up Ro@@ b Por@@ ter &quot; has tried to establish a system for managing and documentation the documents that are ending in T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Pri@@ eb@@ t , but T@@ ru@@ mp will remain impul@@ sive and his assistants will continue to compete for influence .
these ir@@ resis@@ tible factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .
street music from abroad will not be allowed to go on display .
in Tallinn City , there is a lot of foreigners mus@@ cle .
those with learning the message have admitted that they are playing in old towns without the permission of the city .
the first was found at the gates of Vir@@ u , three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who had taken the same do@@ se with them .
it was clear that r@@ ally pat@@ r@@ ons and ch@@ op@@ ping mus@@ ici@@ ans were empty che@@ mis@@ ers , to whom a du@@ ll would take the br@@ un@@ t .
despite being so , the only woman in the company in the A@@ cor@@ di@@ z was playing a fu@@ n tale with la@@ me , while one man , next to her , was playing a gesture in the con@@ tests and pul@@ led the fur@@ th@@ est .
the third man had stood in his bags alongside them and smoking the hear@@ ty bro@@ ther himself in a ready @-@ prepared pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing .
their three cha@@ mbers prevented themselves from being distur@@ bed by a passing population .
the pri@@ est of the A@@ kor@@ di@@ um , who had served with the pal@@ let , Bo@@ b , said he was kis@@ sing on the streets for fu@@ n and money .
the explanation &apos;s presentation was aimed at collecting the ticket money on a ship travelling to Finland day after night .
in the old town of mus@@ cle , they asked for permission for mus@@ cle , No@@ emi and Bo@@ b sha@@ med their head .
first of all , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stand for more than a day or a few in one town and , in most cases , permits will be granted for a month or something like that .
it makes no sense to pay &apos; , explain Bo@@ b .
when we went back to Vir@@ u &apos;s gates about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women were at the mer@@ cy of mus@@ ici@@ ans and are going to go .
the team pul@@ led on to the convi@@ cting si@@ ghts and bags of the Vir@@ u centre .
on the Vir@@ u streets , three Polish young men were also present , one playing the f@@ ence , another ch@@ at and the third had even passed the electronic glass cur@@ ve .
&quot; we are here to give people enter@@ tainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living &quot; wrote tri@@ o from the M@@ iv@@ os@@ h .
M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i said they were aware that there must be a city government permit to be present .
&quot; of course we do not have it , &quot; he said by jo@@ king .
but we hope that if people enjoy our music there is no problem .
of course , if the police comes , we go elsewhere , but try &apos; , she added .
the Estonian bank purchased EUR 149 million in July as part of the euro area &apos;s public asset programme for central banks , the Central Bank &apos;s bonds portfolio increased to a total of EUR 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish detailed information on purchases .
Estonian Governor Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son has previously explained in response to the question of the members of the Estonian National Council that the C@@ reasury Plan would include three separate purchasing programmes : covered bonds from the financial sector ( covered bonds ) , asset @-@ backed bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public debt bonds ( PS@@ D ) .
the Central Bank bu@@ ys bonds from the market to encourage bonds selling money to invest elsewhere .
the impact of the purchase is lower risk of asset generating and encourages investors to take on greater risks .
normally , in the framework of the public debt programme , each central bank bu@@ ys its national government bonds , other countries &apos; bonds are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is making so @-@ called &quot; ca@@ king &quot; within the allocated capacity .
the P@@ C also deals with central banks in countries with limited purchasing power .
the Estonian bank , confirmed by H@@ ans@@ son , generally bu@@ ys the European institutions &apos; bonds , such as the European Financial Stability Facility and EIB bonds .
the Estonian bank will buy bonds under the early purchase programme from March 2015 .
in the meantime , Ele@@ ring bonds were also obtained , but in June 2016 the Estonian bank would no longer buy bonds .
on behalf of the euro area central banks , both the Estonian Energy Bank and the Finnish Bank of Energy will buy buy buy from June .
migrants ignore degrees and come back to &apos; millions of business &apos;
some West Mid@@ lands owners have once again been bul@@ led into fier@@ ce confrontation once again with the decisive no@@ tions that have ignored the tas@@ ked dit@@ ch of the coun@@ ty to win back the ba@@ g from their cotton .
migrants have boo@@ ked 20 of their tra@@ ilers on the path to a prosperous &quot; line of millions &quot; along the streets of So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l .
they have returned with hor@@ ses , children and trucks &apos; w@@ ret@@ ched ar@@ m@@ ons after they were pul@@ led out of the army in May , without being dis@@ tracted by the degree tas@@ ked with preventing their intervention by the Council .
the activist group found weak positions in the protective limits , turning its vehicles into a non @-@ deter@@ red part of a football factor .
the fu@@ rious residents have been conta@@ cted by So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Dis@@ tri@@ ct Council , saying that coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors are &apos; useless &apos; in addressing the problem .
a anon@@ ymous resident said : &apos; they moved there on Monday evening after their withdrawal from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath , where they were st@@ oned by fur@@ ni@@ tors .
Council must be ashamed to take action , because they are useless to deal with the problem .
migrants were there in May , they were pushed to go and now they are back .
they came to the end yesterday evening , probably more so today . &quot;
she added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect its par@@ ks .
I live on the strike and I am not happy to continue to have to pay the total tax if the Council cannot even stop this . &quot;
a local resident who also wanted to stay anon@@ ymous said : &apos; that is ridiculous ; we have only seen the last of these travellers left the scen@@ es , and a new offensive is already under way .
this time the number has risen and in grass@@ land even the horse is seen in ru@@ ins . &quot;
the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Council said : &apos; we are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the land close to the stre@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k and we are working with the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l police ; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
gathering evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling the figure 101 .
this will help to create a factual picture for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val will be visited by , among others , the Minister for Culture In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is pleased that Estonia has been able to bring genuine world excellence .
the question of why We@@ ek@@ end is so important to the pro@@ tag@@ onists at the festi@@ val is answered by Sa@@ ar that it should be asked from all those who are enjoying the prize &apos;s three @-@ day call .
he says , however , that in Per@@ sia , real players in his area have arrived .
&quot; looking at the level of artists that has been able to bring to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music j@@ arg@@ on are brought home - often not in our body &apos; , the Minister of Culture speaks .
which festi@@ val artists , however , are most telling themselves ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person and for old people of me certainly one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ uu@@ re@@ n , who stood up yesterday evening .
she has said that all of us have at some point been be@@ ac@@ on ourselves by all &apos; , she says .
but he does raise a number of other names , such as Cha@@ in@@ smokers , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ bi .
of course , our own Estonian players too : starting with NO@@ Belder , they can be read through a whole series .
in reality , this famous concentration of names is very high . &apos; says , &apos;

according to B@@ M@@ W Chairman , companies believe there are &quot; smarter options than driving restrictions &quot; with reference to European cities , including B@@ M@@ W , in Munich , which has been considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that she would renew diesel engines to reduce exha@@ ust emissions to three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe .
no company described these operations as being recalled .
European car manufacturers have been actively promoting diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide em@@ itting diesel engines is classified as carcinogenic and could cause as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , the cost of equipment to neutr@@ alise diesel emissions from diesel vehicles will increase , making it difficult to keep cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , the Federal Chancellor , Angela Merkel , is also accused of har@@ sh@@ ing the weight of the automobile manufacturers and of ignoring the signs pointing to the problem .
companies are trying to avoid a Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen repeating the mistakes that was silent about the use of so @-@ called ha@@ em@@ orr@@ ha@@ ging devices , which made it possible to adapt emissions @-@ bearing cars to the regulations when tests were carried out , but which were back in normal driving conditions .
several Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic inquiry .
last month in Germany , the head of the Au@@ di motor Development Division was arrested former head of the Th@@ er@@ monu@@ clear unit .
the former President , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o , is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and can be prosecuted in the United States .
earlier this year , Au@@ di was placed in a criminal investigation into Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen in Germany , when the authorities accused the introduction of an Audit System to circum@@ vent Europe &apos;s emissions performance requirements , thereby extending the investigation , which had previously been concentrated in the United States .
the inclusion of the Au@@ ti in the investigation may be a major blow to Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen by the creators of luxury vehicles disproportionately generates a large proportion of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen &apos;s profits .
Estonian schools are acquiring € 20 000 of EU flags .
the Education Ministry intends to buy Estonian schools to h@@ ire EU flags by 1 September .
taken together , the measu@@ re@@ ments will be 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 senti@@ metres of the European Union &apos;s 5@@ 70 educational institutions .
the flags are foreseen for mis@@ appropriations in in@@ door spaces , which must be carried out in high quality printed devices forma@@ tions with an hour declaration , will be facilitated by the ER@@ R news portal .
a flag label has the text : &apos; Kin@@ gi@@ tus to Estonian School of Estonia for the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the supposed cost of 5@@ 70 flags is € 20@@ ,000 in the education Ministry &apos;s price price , with a single tie costing € 35 .
journalist &apos;s murder highlights the growing danger in Mexico
weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s staff normally gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the State of S@@ Sin@@ al@@ oa , so@@ wn crime , corrupt officials and continuous drug wars .
but today , under the gu@@ ise of personal tragedy , they have been gathering their own security discussions .
they are told that it is important to change their h@@ aste .
two parent wri@@ ters are discussing which seems safer : whether to bring children to an office that was targeted for a personal attack in 2009 or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words to the top of the space : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask repor@@ ters to provide any water names with proof of the whole , impres@@ sions and insi@@ ghts alone .
the government or car@@ tel &apos;s pay is suspected of being a black list of drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists who are hazardous to reporting the chaos in Mexico .
violence is not a pi@@ le in the b@@ reat@@ h and the more the bodies over the country accumu@@ late , the majority of which are reported by journalist victims as members of the Committee for the Protection of journalists , have been since the inaugu@@ ration of President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena 1980s to at least 25 : 5@@ 89 journalists have been killed in a state governed by public protection following attacks and threats , and so far in the course of this year , at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states .
the latest casu@@ alties include their edit@@ or and @-@ inspiring source , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den , co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many reports on drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though his presence can be felt anywhere in the Salafranca version of Rio &apos;s great picture of the average , with a headline Val@@ dez , &apos; Justice &apos; and two 30@@ ken repor@@ ters , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , broadcast T @-@ shir@@ s@@ ke , de@@ pic@@ ted as a li@@ tan@@ y face or a characteristic pool of his li@@ mo@@ rous pri@@ ze@@ al@@ y .
the meeting will take place less than two months after her death , and Re@@ por@@ ters will discuss a collective trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , obli@@ vi@@ on , paran@@ o@@ ia .
although in 2010 , a separate national prosecution service was set up to address the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on Political Defence , only two cases have been brought to justice .
as with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders , the number of which reaches thousands , the journalist kil@@ lers rarely reach justice .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edit@@ orial continues to reflect violence in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ a , even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without murde@@ rers &apos; data and justice , security is not very helpful , as I@@ bar@@ ra said .
&quot; it is very nice to waste our time here in the meeting , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , you dis@@ trust everyone . &quot;
Val@@ dez left in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , in the capital of the State of Lah@@ ti , on the morning of 15 May .
she managed to drive only a few quarters before two men arrested red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ rol@@ la ; she was forced to leave a car and was shot 12 times because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated into the &apos; twelve @-@ teen@@ th river &apos; .
an armed man dro@@ ve the Val@@ dez car and made an accident close to it .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she left her with her wife and two adults .
the images are circu@@ lating freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on Val@@ dez there is basically only a silence .
since the Gu@@ z@@ man was arrested last year and the US issued in January , the Blue authorisation has been one of the country &apos;s most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields , because ri@@ val@@ ries are fighting to fill a power vacuum .
it is no difference that in the streets of Sin@@ al@@ oa , a few people are suddenly being shot daily or even several people are suddenly being expelled , or the dead are gro@@ ssly being glo@@ s@@ sed over the double @-@ s@@ nat@@ ched ma@@ to@@ de drug bri@@ e@@ ga@@ ys , which are bigger than many homes .
let us not forget for a moment that the peace period indicates that valuable ports and drug routes to the United States are led by only one car@@ tel .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the risks of his work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce is feeling , as co @-@ foun@@ der and chairman Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a huge com@@ pun@@ ction that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that murder was favoured by two errors .
the first was to publish an interview with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s son on a competitive and war@@ ring car@@ tel cli@@ que with D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z in February .
this piece of mail could also be labelled by suspected gang members bought all cop@@ ies of the publication as soon as they arrived in newspaper car@@ cas@@ ses .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after a crackdown took place in another newspaper news story .
Val@@ dez leg@@ alised himself in Mexico and abroad and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico .
she had been alive for so long that her friends and colleagues had expected her to exist forever .
she worked as a ve@@ ter@@ repor@@ ter in 2003 at the No@@ ro@@ este newspaper , when she joined five colleagues to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling USD 50 .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said that &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without drug problems &apos; .
the newspaper was collecting a period of time with its bold and fair coverage , and sales and advertising grew .
the repor@@ ters liked to have for@@ ceful studies without having to be cen@@ sored and heard in a s@@ ounding print , which they could read stories that no one else could dare to report .
eight years after Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was established , the newspaper won a pres@@ ti@@ gious award for Latin American perfor@@ man@@ ces , Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot .
in the same year Val@@ dez , the Committee for the Defence of journalists ( AK@@ K ) won the International Prize for Freedom of the Press for their courage to follow the Mexic@@ an drug addi@@ cts wherever it leads .
she openly admitted she was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said by adopting the AK@@ K prize .
last October , he said in an interview with the television channel Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in S@@ ha@@ space .
&quot; our head is to accept the role that the journalist &apos;s office has in another way to play .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not talk about what is happening . &quot;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ ktii@@ v stri@@ ves a Val@@ dez , a jo@@ y@@ man who ro@@ wed like mad@@ ness , a friend who gene@@ rously b@@ ore emb@@ at@@ ings and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they supported him in his h@@ aste .
she always we@@ aring her hat .
he went from the office to El Guatem@@ ei@@ y@@ ab@@ o bar and was always sitting in the same des@@ k .
they now ask whether her rou@@ tine love was fatal for him .
his death has also left them to question how best to do their work and stay in life .
&quot; they do not like to see how ri@@ gi@@ d@@ dled their women , their children , their legitimate business , are with their secret landing pla@@ tes used for drug transport . &quot;
&apos;@@ Th@@ ese things should not have been touched &apos; said by Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best time , strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ respect .
entr@@ en@@ ched their in@@ st@@ in@@ teries .
when it comes to the sca@@ pe@@ goat , the hotel is out .
And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ al , the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , said the problem is that &apos; od@@ our can be chea@@ ted ... and so it was a case of J@@ avi@@ er &apos; .
he and others say that Sin@@ al@@ o@@ as no longer applies the old rules , just as they do not apply to the 1985 , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ ce , Guer@@ re@@ iro or other states that are home to the toxic combination of lu@@ cra@@ tive smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in a space where Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers were gathered for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days before , it was revealed that only a but@@ tress sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
front in front of the House two police c@@ oo@@ k stic@@ ks to a 40 @-@ degree month bul@@ let .
the government has ordered them to elect the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office , which is based in the four floor building in the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an central class neighbourhood .
some repor@@ ters were qu@@ an@@ o@@ cer@@ ning whether these police officers were among the 50 % poli@@ ce@@ men whose govern@@ ors themselves have been dis@@ credi@@ ted as un@@ reliable .
several months have passed since repor@@ ters have moved to mountain areas where controls are de facto drug gan@@ gs .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s announcement this week covered three key le@@ vers .
one of them was former bo@@ xing leg@@ end Ju@@ li@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez ven@@ na murder in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ a .
in addition , they had an un@@ covered story of spending government money on the Governor &apos;s home town .
and the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an kidna@@ pping group of people from one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants , which is located away from the Prosecutor &apos;s office , which is from the quarter .
there was no official announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how it happened , so caution had to be exercised when it was time to write what everyone in the town knows about Dan@@ or@@ an is a liked place for both drug traffickers and the authorities .
the film was revealed in public documents that restaur@@ ants are registered with the names of a politician in power in the Institu@@ tional Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all policy levels almost throughout the previous century .
recently , several IR@@ P Governor have been accused of widespread coverage of cases of corruption .
the Vil@@ lar@@ line has asked the repor@@ ter to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the name El Chap@@ man &apos;s son , Gu@@ z@@ man , was esca@@ ped from military broadcasting .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have sought Val@@ dez &apos;s co@@ ca to get information on kidna@@ pping from the best sources .
&quot; in the past we would have known what happened , &quot; said 46 @-@ year @-@ old village where body building had served to give it a slogan called El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all communication channels have broken our sources . &quot;
the Val@@ dez office has become the space for labels and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and edit@@ orial workers have become something they could never expect in the name of the activists &apos; press .
next morning the Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez took a few bridges and went to a local Public Prosecutor &apos;s office to protest for another journalist .
Salvador A@@ ka@@ h disappeared in the western Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an State three days after Val@@ dez was murdered .
the body has been bur@@ nt down and , according to officials , it is in DNA tests .
journalists across the country have become more audi@@ ble and are cri@@ p@@ pled as organised protests to s@@ cor@@ n roads and buildings the phrase &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; .
on that day , President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez will be in Washington trying to gather international support for justice in Val@@ dez &apos;s case .
the day after the death of Val@@ dez in a meeting with the Sin@@ al@@ oa Governor , the Ra@@ mi@@ rez authorities accused journalists of sp@@ ying and killing them for truth .
after that , he asked him to shift government from being mir@@ ro@@ red to other , concerned that hatred has affected objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists were &apos; in step with organised crime , compli@@ cit in national officials and a half @-@ hear@@ ted society &apos; .
in his latest &apos; Drug press &apos; report , he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gan@@ gs but are also carried out at the hands of policy@@ makers and security forces who are in an organised crime t@@ reas@@ ure .
the Media Monitoring Group Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 issued over half last year &apos;s attacks on the police and civil servants .
&quot; in Mexico , you want to keep quiet , &quot; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
murder is clearly ver@@ af@@ ad@@ o@@ id .
nobody will forget the death of blo@@ g@@ ger Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ sis six years ago .
she was found dead with a letter she had probably signed in car@@ tel los Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
his ma@@ pped be@@ side his gun@@ s was b@@ lending computer glass and head@@ phones .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a after their correspon@@ dent Lefrançois sla@@ va B@@ reac@@ h was killed in March .
others will continue to do as the El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do newspaper did after their President &apos;s murder in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug car@@ tel with a headline &apos; What do you want us ? &apos; .
some journalists have fled from home states , or even from the state .
it is a ner@@ ve decision .
it is difficult to find work in the wrong zone and they still have to gra@@ b the streets in order to avoid risks .
and sometimes they are driven , as probably happened in the photo@@ graph Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , murdered in 2015 with four women in one of the Mexic@@ an a@@ partment three months after she was fleeing from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z@@ on .
those who remain in place and continue to work have to refu@@ te risky decisions on a daily basis .
the I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to become a po@@ et , ad@@ mits that reporting drug trafficking intimi@@ dates her .
&quot; Mexico is on the road to hell and that is why I will report , &quot; said .
on a recent mid@@ night of Friday , when the latest figure had already been s@@ ounded , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce ed@@ itors sat on the way to office and be@@ er the bat@@ teries , suddenly starting to telephone on all phones .
in the R@@ and@@ ina@@ tial Great town of Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ i 19 people had died in fire @-@ fighting campaigns between ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces .
the war was still suspended , as were a number of messages from the area &apos;s car@@ tels .
on the same line , repor@@ ters u@@ plo@@ aded the websites using a mobile phone at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
next day &apos;s front required change .
the Hu@@ tu mite was further ar@@ resting in the region .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pi@@ il@@ é towards guard police officers to see whether they are vigilant .
when they were afraid , they did not at least demonstrate it .
a foun@@ der who has fallen into his sho@@ es under a massive book , where his average finger is to be seen in all Sin@@ al@@ o@@ ia , was taken on his copy by the workers in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w can one think of closing at all &apos; , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; whereas on the same day Javier died , the appren@@ tice asked me to send him to report on the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur used a defence colour to avoid enemies
at first g@@ lance , it seems like a form , albeit rather sc@@ ary .
scientists have now revealed the first findings concerning the un@@ beli@@ evable wave size found in a Canadian min@@ able mine , which is so well preserved that experts have described it as &apos; a Lis@@ a Mon@@ a added &apos; .
it is so well preserved that it was even possible to recognise that the lea@@ ther covered by his so@@ y@@ bean was a red @-@ Brown colour and had had a somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; past .
the report published in the Journal &apos; Horizon Bi@@ ology &apos; described usur@@ ping the term &apos; the best preserved so@@ om@@ hu@@ pe@@ om resource that has ever been found &apos; and the &apos; one of the best din@@ osa@@ ur characteristics worldwide &apos; .
fossil is a new type of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ic that lived in the middle of a storm , between 110 and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly good storage in ra@@ ison was awarded to researchers who describe it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
this vege@@ tarian her@@ o covered by soya is the best preserved in the National Ge@@ o@@ graphic ph@@ os@@ pha@@ te of this type ever found .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k found it when he extra@@ cted the Ø@@ ce@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine in For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in North Alber@@ tas in Canada .
she hit something that did not recall the surrounding stone and decided to look more closely .
the discovered ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus was accompanied by Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell &apos;s pal@@ e@@ on@@ ate muse@@ um .
the next six years were designed to expe@@ l the animal from 2 500 women ( 1 100 km ) .
after all this tremendous effort , the end result is now finally ready to bring to the public .
&quot; if you b@@ ent a little eyes , you can almost believe she is s@@ lee@@ ping , &apos; said the leading author Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , theat@@ re Ro@@ yal T@@ rel@@ li in a muse@@ um where presence is being played out .
&quot; this will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osa@@ ur@@ bias - din@@ osa@@ urs Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &quot;
he found in a s@@ kin@@ t that the vege@@ tation worker , while covered by so@@ y@@ bean be@@ ach tanks , was likely to be significantly threatened by meat feed din@@ k .
this high @-@ volume din@@ din@@ osa@@ ur used red and white forms of protection to bur@@ n himself against pre@@ da@@ tors and applied sha@@ dows techniques , which are called &apos; na@@ ming &apos; and are also used by many modern animals .
it allowed din@@ osa@@ ur to better cross into the neighbourhood and to avoid enemies , as major din@@ osa@@ ur pressure probably found him to be hun@@ t .
this figure of 110 million no@@ do@@ sa@@ ic families , which is now in the news for the first time , is now available in the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology M@@ use@@ um .
the da@@ iries have now investigated and given that name to Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta Mar@@ mit@@ l@@ or &apos;s muse@@ um , mark Mitchell , a famous team that spent over 7 000 hours to un@@ cover a demanding animal .
thanks to the aston@@ ishing good preservation of the father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of brain supple@@ ments .
they discovered a re@@ treat - a protective method in animal states , which means that the sup@@ eri@@ ority was the dark party .
although the bu@@ ck is widespread , the findings come as a surprise , as Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta is much larger than today &apos;s un@@ sa@@ cro@@ san@@ ct animals .
it suggests that din@@ osa@@ ur hunting was sufficiently actively motivated by other meat feed din@@ osa@@ urs that evolution was preferable to over@@ sha@@ do@@ wing the failure of the survival tac@@ tical against confrontation .
but most of the animals who use today &apos;s re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces - such as fears , s@@ kin@@ s or b@@ ars - are much smaller and more vulnerable to harves@@ ts , which indicate that no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us had to struggle to survive .
&quot; a strong cooling of the din@@ osa@@ ur virus , covered by massive and high levels of soya , shows how dangerous the wh@@ eel@@ s could have been , &quot; Brown said .
chemical analysis of So@@ om@@ ers &apos; organic comp@@ ounds also revealed that din@@ osa@@ ur sk@@ in was a red screen .
scientists will continue to explore to get indications about this life , including the content that remains in this warm form , in order to find out what an animal would be the last to history .
they believe that din@@ osa@@ ur pressure fell into dead rivers , thus reaching the sea with a stream of w@@ rest@@ ling in the ocean .
at that time , Alber@@ tas was the same soya as is now the case in South F@@ l@@ ori@@ qu@@ an , rivers and oceans are likely to reach far beyond inland land .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ inity is truly remarkable as it is fully covered by so@@ om@@ y sk@@ in , while it has remained in three dimensions , preserving its original form , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; as a result , today the animal finds itself practically the same as in the under@@ age .
to recon@@ stru@@ ct it , there is not much to be imag@@ in@@ ative : it is enough simply to pre@@ ach our eyes and it seems to be like a s@@ le@@ ep . &quot;
the time for the crisis was when enormous red @-@ foot me@@ al infections - tero@@ gene@@ ous bu@@ tch@@ ers - s@@ tun@@ ted .
although their King , Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x , lived millions of years later than Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , it could be hun@@ ted by some of his for@@ mi@@ dable predecess@@ ors .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ contamination , 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) in a long and six tonnes of ch@@ at .
scientists whose recent findings are published in the current Bi@@ ology magaz@@ ine believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta was sun@@ k after death in the sea and that mu@@ tation was multipli@@ ed .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k discovered ten@@ ac@@ ity when he mined the Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine in the region of For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
the muse@@ um says it is best preserved in the world , including sk@@ in and soya , and is complete in the form of a ca@@ us@@ om up to the bot@@ tle .
these in@@ puts were on average 18 feet ( five metres ) long and ro@@ pe up to GBP 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .
it was passed on by two 20 customs ora .
scientists believe that this b@@ read@@ cru@@ mb@@ ed vege@@ tation plant f@@ itted through the present Western Canada until the floo@@ ded river was sw@@ am@@ ped into the open sea .
but the se@@ ques@@ tration site at sea helped to preserve its measu@@ re@@ ments exc@@ el@@ len@@ tly .
the coal residues of this particular father are so well preserved that the my@@ th@@ ical wa@@ ff@@ om@@ eran@@ g of so@@ y storage remains covered by sk@@ in residues .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko magaz@@ ine National Ge@@ o@@ graphic wrote , &apos; this survival is just as rare as a lo@@ to@@ victory .
the more I look at it , the more incredible it seems .
the wave @-@ in parts will continue to cover the creation of y@@ el@@ low @-@ based my@@ th@@ ological so@@ om@@ ers .
better first wear next to him and five assets are si@@ ted up@@ wards .
I can read the commitments she has on her own . &quot;
how did one activist get an answer to the question &apos; whose streets ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll received a total shock .
just days after New York travel , it was published on a to@@ wing from Lou@@ isi &apos;s inhabitants , Air@@ b@@ b , on a do@@ or@@ step line , in S@@ r@@ ings , Facebook .
she got on to her former school fellow Member &apos;s post .
it read : &apos; the police killed a very 18 @-@ year @-@ old youth and still ho@@ sts the streets . &apos;
he was confused as to why nobody else had posted this information on his bed , which led to him closing Facebook and opening Twitter .
the P@@ ide@@ mega @ The@@ e@@ P@@ haro@@ ah users &apos; postal services were repeatedly transmitted in line with his line of time .
the K@@ rä@@ p@@ par from the Lou@@ an region provided real @-@ time sä@@ da Michael Brown , a 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man killed by a white police officer in Fer@@ gus@@ onis Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is .
he posted a picture of the Bro@@ w@@ n &apos;s habi@@ tual site that was circu@@ lating on the streets , remaining there for four hours .
&quot; that is cra@@ zy , &quot; thinking of Mrs Ferre@@ ll &apos;s .
but death was nothing new for him or his community .
she cut off her phone , but later this evening saw the rest again , which this time announced people were gathering in Can@@ field in D@@ ri@@ ve .
J@@ ag@@ on photo@@ graph@@ ed of police and pota@@ to people and a man who claimed to be in the hands of Brown &apos;s father and kept a label &apos; The Fer@@ gus@@ on police killed just my un@@ armed bo@@ y ! &apos;
he looked live in a bed where the police officer stood in front of the grave protest group .
in the second video , another police officer , he said he was p@@ aste and sh@@ ell@@ fish : &apos; I killing you all ... animals &apos; .
Fer@@ rell is a reminder of how she was looking at the thought : &apos; that is unusual . &apos;
&quot; this is not a murder of this kind with which we are ac@@ custo@@ med and could call a typical . &quot;
I felt atrocities at that time .
I was ang@@ ry and I was complaining . &apos;
she boo@@ ked a return flight and next day she went home .
having s@@ wor@@ n at 23 o &apos;@@ clock , he left her father with his six @-@ year @-@ old da@@ u@@ ghter and decided to travel to Fer@@ gus@@ on next morning .
what happened to Fer@@ rel@@ li and Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ el over the next three years is a key issue in the new document entitled &quot; W@@ ho@@ se street Ex@@ change ? &quot; ( whose streets are on 11 August ) .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who have fulfilled the streets by demanding replies .
when a ball , with a ty@@ rant - who had a flow@@ er ta@@ g and a good kro@@ on with it - wal@@ ked out of Fer@@ gus@@ on again , they spoke about a subject that they had repeatedly heard before this morning - the experience and living conditions of black people .
&apos;@@ D@@ o you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; he is recalling to ask himself ?
&quot; we are currently travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ on because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him along , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll later .
&quot; what is happening now is ... past cul@@ mination .
it must know and see that and grow in the middle .
she must learn about activist and organisation , but also feel different la@@ yers of black experiences and living conditions , and what we must do to become free and free .
even if I can bring him up so that he does not experience personally blatant racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel I would do him a dis@@ service if I defended him against the world . &quot;
the first suspension they made in the Fer@@ gus@@ on was on the South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ t - from a police station to a place of crossing the way , which had become a sort of camp pla@@ gue where activists were waiting for news about the police officer Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not even charged at the end .
there , the Ferre@@ ll and her da@@ u@@ ghter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared South @-@ L@@ and@@ ers .
they put food bags together and helped them to spread them to prote@@ sters .
Fer@@ rel@@ li slowly took the form of a new type of activist .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , &apos; W@@ hen he was Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ isi at the University , he was a student of a minority Association of Education students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in the non @-@ performing communities .
&quot; I had no organised experience .
that is all a flat . &quot;
after weeks , during a spiri@@ tual demonstration , Mrs Ferre@@ ll met a film co @-@ chair Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ i .
the prize was said by him and the film operator , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , wanted simply to document what is going on .
the Fer@@ rel@@ li question arose : &apos; are you trying to document what is going on or do you try to find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to profit from its efficacy and resilience .
the prize was explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voices of the people born and born in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard and we wanted to do so in a different way &apos; .
the prize had already beaten hands with co @-@ feed D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ in , the region &apos;s art , known for a activist in relation to the sentence of death sentence .
his involvement made the project heated by Fer@@ rel@@ li and another six for the local communities that were followed years after the Brown shooting .
&quot; no one in this docu@@ mentary film talks for us or for us , but we speak to ourselves , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; it was important to me how these people are portra@@ yed , because I am portra@@ yed as being as such . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the Fer@@ rel@@ li &apos;s experience - it was to show that the movement was not about &apos; head of sal@@ vation but about community col@@ lusion &apos; , as the Fo@@ lay@@ man said , made it the most open film .
as a result , &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; documents &apos; surprising personal aspects of the Fer@@ rel@@ li &apos;s life , such as mer@@ cy and mar@@ ry with her wife .
&quot; I felt I was wrong , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll , na@@ ming the first time he was ready to work a town .
&quot; but I realised that doing this work and human@@ tising black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the Fer@@ rel@@ li story highlights and puts the role of black homo@@ sexual women in the wider Black Alliance movement .
two of the three initi@@ ators of the movement who thought in the social media in 2012 of the black teen@@ ag@@ er Tra@@ y@@ von Martin &apos;s h@@ ash@@ tag@@ s # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter are gay .
&quot; women of black age in leadership have kept movement across the board , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll , &quot; and that is because we have to fight on many fronts all the time .
Mus@@ tan@@ a@@ c homo@@ sexual women must bear all this burden . &quot;
the pho@@ to accepted , noting that &apos; The Movement is indeed kept in life by black women and many of them are black gay women &apos; .
he says , however , &apos; This is not a kind of equal opportunity &apos; - the Fer@@ rel@@ li was not chosen as the focus of a film because of his identity .
&apos;@@ he was a man who used to drive the right energy &apos; .
&quot; however , it is no coincidence that he is right on the front@@ line because there is a lot at stake as a black homo@@ sexual woman living in such no@@ vel@@ s .
her energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , news camer@@ as from Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ el have been lost a long time ago , but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile .
the suspended suspended sentence imposed on Mr. Fer@@ rell during the course of the repression against road blocking will last another 2.5 years .
she describes the social policy climate in the area she calls home simply as &apos; a huge threat to freedom &apos; .
nevertheless , she still attaches great importance to the man@@ tra she has ea@@ ten since the memory began to the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ oni only three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
7 fac@@ tshe@@ ets on how to overcome We@@ ek@@ t from the toy
some stu@@ b@@ born honey boys will find , after a wave of vir@@ g@@ in pi@@ tions , what the misery , the help too , is .
or the saying &apos; avoid a po@@ mel@@ h@@ all , stop a ja@@ m &apos; .
but that is no longer the inevitable postponement and a good deal of health .
what can you do to better feel better after today and tomorrow &apos;s We@@ ek@@ ent tr@@ asse@@ m@@ bled - or whatever else - and get round the po@@ p@@ se as pain@@ lessly as possible ?
Jo@@ o Water .
alcohol was below and above , after a great night in the morning ... or possibly even in the field of alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it uses alcohol , it must somehow be recovered .
along with water , miner@@ als are u@@ tte@@ red from the body and s@@ wine is a good ha@@ bit of mineral water .
since after me@@ tal is often irri@@ tated , it is particularly good that it is soil @-@ free or only easily bil@@ led .
go wrong .
it would certainly not cost a bo@@ y to go to scrap trees - it could be fatal to mis@@ lead .
but a slight walk @-@ and @-@ walk helps the body to remember what it is like to be alive .
T@@ sy &apos;s s@@ ma@@ pping and po@@ h@@ ma@@ ck s@@ lee@@ ping is a more time @-@ consuming way to get out .
give physical energy a bit of slowly and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are already starting to drink yesterday , it is certainly not worth trying to charge a fat bar@@ ge .
let me start , for example , with a new volume of plan@@ tations containing trees to keep the body on the ro@@ ck &apos;s ro@@ am .
if health around the South is already suffering , for example , pul@@ ons could be tested .
and a little later on , it is clear .
exclusion .
this di@@ u@@ ph@@ oria will relieve your body from its last water .
as has already been said , water and volume are your friends .
do the pain @-@ care contributions .
if a car@@ te ro@@ t is to be prevented from becoming pain@@ kil@@ ler , then you must tackle not only alcohol but also alcohol , but also the per@@ se@@ ph@@ et or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ f@@ en , and lose such capacity .
so the clo@@ thes of their pay are even more , and in the future the bo@@ w@@ ls will be worse .
moreover , the pain@@ kil@@ ler &apos;s body will not be long enough .
if you are pain@@ kil@@ ler this morning , you will do it with a blan@@ k f@@ ence - it irri@@ ta@@ tes your already di@@ r@@ ti@@ med pain@@ ting .
or if a partner is not taken , it will be well with itself .
it is about wal@@ king , but wal@@ king does not get a ch@@ im@@ mer .
however , there was too much @-@ active and ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant sto@@ res - a physical effort should be moderate during po@@ ch .
tea .
the story of the St@@ . Peter@@ s@@ burg with friends , easy feeding and na@@ era am@@ ic@@ ably , both for themselves and for others ( suffering ) .
the mon@@ ali and na@@ ig@@ er may not be able to sell a po@@ ker , but certainly they can help to tolerate more prof@@ ita@@ bly .

Ms North@@ w@@ ester@@ ni profes@@ sor and Ox@@ ford University worker are sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , profes@@ sors from the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and a Ox@@ ford University are sought nation@@ ali@@ zed by a sor@@ cere@@ r who has become suspects of a death @-@ free cru@@ el@@ ty for a man &apos;s population , from a single ch@@ ic@@ ago luxury cor@@ ps .
according to the C@@ oo@@ k Dis@@ tri@@ ct judicial documents , on Monday , an arrest warrant of 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 years of Andrew War@@ ren@@ i were awarded on account of their alleged performance in T@@ ren@@ ton H. Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ le@@ u &apos;s death by the pri@@ ze@@ ation .
according to documents , a 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ u died after repeated ha@@ vo@@ cab@@ ling .
the warning that Ch@@ ic@@ ago police station issued to the community found the dead on 27 July .
police officers received telephone calls and found a victim on arrival of the Grand Pla@@ za Kor@@ ter@@ rand , whose body had several pi@@ pe @-@ type programmes .
according to officials , Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ u was recognised as dead on the site and researchers treat se@@ ating as murder , while the police actively seek two suspects .
La@@ w@@ it has been working as co @-@ professor at North@@ w@@ ester@@ n University of micro @-@ Bi@@ ology and Im@@ mun@@ ology since 2007 .
Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , Vice @-@ President for Public relations , said in a statement sent as e @-@ publishing that La@@ had now been removed from employment temporarily and that he had to be prevented from entering the town of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n University .
&quot; this is now a criminal act being investigated by the competent authorities , and the North@@ w@@ ester@@ n University will work with the investi@@ g@@ ators , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ arre@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant at Ox@@ ford University .
a representative from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement : &apos; we have been in touch with the British Police and ready to assist US research authorities in any way possible &apos; .
moreover , the statement stated that War@@ ren@@ i colleagues were shocked and wish to extra@@ dite themselves .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , Head of the Police Department of Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s Communication Department , urges the authorities to give in to the authorities on suspicion .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are present but we are increasingly busy in defining precise location , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said it would help to seek suspects both by local , regional and national authorities .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police received a telephone call from the Grand Pla@@ za cor@@ ps cri@@ pt , who had just received ch@@ ry@@ p@@ tic rain that something had happened in fla@@ ts N N 10@@ 08 .
according to police reports , it was a ma@@ gic specta@@ cle .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , it is not clear whether the event itself was on 27 July .
he said that camer@@ a would confirm the stay of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ mil and victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the management of the Grand Pla@@ za sent a letter to the inhabitants : &apos; the police are currently working to identify the scene of events and the victim &apos;s background and are examining various mo@@ tives , including the possibility of a family dispute . &apos;
start @-@ ups that will help your company to avoid the next U@@ V
Mr Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure his e @-@ commerce start @-@ up company &apos;s satisfaction with workers , but the poll was fu@@ tile .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers dis@@ tr@@ usted the process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is leading an e @-@ commerce company with 75 employees in San Franc@@ is@@ co .
so he called non @-@ actors to the aid .
new types of human resources are being started up to help companies find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licen@@ sing software that aims to measure employee involvement , they enable companies to commit cells , target specific teams and demographic groups , provide staff anon@@ y@@ mity and a bul@@ l for complaints and , in some cases , allow em@@ pe@@ ers to by@@ pass the level C managers and address directly the Bureau .
&quot; now there are tools like Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ bit designed to monitor health but where is F@@ it@@ res for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ net , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O Poli@@ wood City at the G@@ lin@@ t , which software analytical tools use to measure employee participation .
in the three years she has used G@@ lin@@ ti , the Er@@ ret@@ ti report says she has got a much better overview of what her workers thought and feel .
in addition to app studies and dedicated consultations for certain teams , it provides a company &apos;s thermal card which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support , allowing them to identify the reasons .
companies have begun to realise that they need to keep to their working culture so as not to become the next U@@ b@@ lis@@ h@@ side that has been riots since a former employee published blo@@ g sur@@ ger@@ y describing a har@@ as@@ sing environment in which those who da@@ red to speak were penalised .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and conformity can be respectively accompanied by financial Caspary statistics on the L@@ et &apos;s speak Payments website worth over USD 118@@ .@@ 7 billion by 2020 .
Den@@ ver@@ is Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o &apos;s firm &apos;s equivalent , which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , has seen an interest and an increase in activity in the face of U@@ ber &apos;s dubious reputation this year .
Conver@@ c@@ enti@@ l has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber recently registered himself as a cli@@ ent .
like G@@ lin@@ tki , objective enterprises will be able to send adapted incentives to emb@@ assies , gather in real time confidential answers and look at problem areas in the heat cards .
it also provides an anon@@ ymous mes@@ h @-@ type model enabling workers to report un@@ suitable behaviour .
and where the executive manager is concerned , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion is entrusted to regulatory authorities , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , foun@@ der and CE@@ O of Conver@@ cen@@ t .
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that if a company was found to treat its workers ill or act une@@ th@@ ically , companies could face serious consequences , such as consumer boycot@@ ts , workers leaving and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , restaur@@ ant e@@ u , which has more than 2@@ 5,000 employees in 500 sites , has used the Conver@@ gence cen@@ ti for over a year to ensure workers know about rules and procedures and to provide an easy way of communicating with the Corpor@@ ate headquarters .
if an employee had to report a problem earlier , he had to find a corpor@@ ation &apos;s hot@@ line or email address , then to make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously .
this was often a da@@ un@@ ting and un@@ comfortable process , Ru@@ by Ru@@ by Tuesday &apos;s General Ad@@ vis@@ er James Vit@@ ran@@ o , who said he was not well advised to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
now that a company uses the Conver@@ cen@@ sor , however , there are problems , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices , which did not previously end up with managers who were operating in other cities or offices in states , to identify and engage more quickly .
&quot; I can get closer to a hol@@ ist 3@@ 60 degree experience of workers , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who will head Ru@@ by the South @-@ East Risk Management Group .
&quot; and we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies had to take ethical conduct , values and worker involvement much more seriously in 2002 , that is to say , after the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen failed in the face of ethical irregularities in the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
but only when &apos; social media became c@@ oo@@ n @-@ ahead &apos; did businesses realise that they could not prevent their black was@@ hing from openly online .
&quot; before technology is used to monitor ethical behaviour , people used to use technology as a strategy hope , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer their software as services , taking a perio@@ dic charge from companies for using their products .
it is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been able to rely on both start @-@ ups .
the Conver@@ t was funded in February by USD 10 million in companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and Capital , thus raising the value of the capital collected at USD 47 million .
G@@ lin@@ ti invested USD 10 million in November in B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , increasing the company &apos;s total funding to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise if we consider the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ tedness between businesses , culture and venture capital .
more and more studies show that modern workers are waiting for more than ever .
in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high salaries and interesting projects are merely s@@ takes on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be entrepreneurs , feel they are heard and the work they do is reas@@ suring , they are more committed to ensuring business success , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , of the Labour Government , which uses both convergence and G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors will earn income if companies in their portfolios do well ; companies will do well to have employees committed and involved .
if analytical tools from the third party allow workers to be more committed and involved , it is no wonder that they will find support .
data collection on employee participation is important , as experts in professional culture have said .
but this data is useless if the company &apos;s supervisors do not start doing anything with them .
in fact , if a company asks its employees for feedback , it can generate expectations that it will be changing .
and if changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all , this could cause disappointment and reduce worker involvement .
&quot; when you ask about 4000 proposals , you need to be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; said K@@ ot@@ ter International , President of Con@@ sul@@ tative and Business Administration , R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who has seen companies fail to rely too much on data collection .
&apos;@@ because if things are not brought to the end , the workers think &apos; You actually listened to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
in the Er@@ ret@@ ti &apos;s words , Mad@@ ison Re@@ e@@ el , who is now carrying out six studies among the workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through G@@ lin@@ ti .
and after receiving feedback from workers frustra@@ ted by the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , it was able to re@@ organise several company cre@@ ws and provide communication training to address the problems .
Ru@@ by ures are collected , however , for employees , and it is hoped that in the long term , this will lead to workers &apos; longer @-@ term commitment to an industry known for the high labour turnover of its own workforce .
&quot; if you are not committed to transparency , you lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&apos;@@ and if you lose people , you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you lose businesses . &apos;
euro area sh@@ ining Sta@@ r : income growth rapidly
although the 2008 crisis and trade concerns with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , three Baltic States are rapidly approaching Western European rich countries &apos; income , B@@ loom@@ berg is writing a European Central Bank report .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
the success is under@@ indeb@@ ted , fast @-@ off institutions and business and free market @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States in one of the few euro area countries with a high @-@ GDP per capita , have significantly closer to the EU average . &quot;
although the objective is for total economic output per capita to be equal to Western Europe , in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2 / 3 of the 15 national average , which was part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led to Bal@@ ots seeking better wages abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees Bali as a positive light and the economy is growing this year , local people are not at all enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies would be very or rather well off .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was slightly less than half the respondents who thought about their economies .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel two times a day trends change Bru@@ mes over a long term !
it is almost 23 o &apos;@@ clock if tro@@ cy@@ ond konventsiooniga football fails to stand on display at the end of a new school @-@ based training display at the University of a team .
some of them have tightened their j@@ ig@@ saw by reve@@ aling their tre@@ asu@@ ries &apos; rub@@ ber stamp on the first day of the F@@ DP .
for a large proportion of the team , these Christmas minutes provide a pa@@ int from mid@@ day .
participating participants in courses will go back to study after three hours of collective marriage , before returning to 6.@@ 30 meetings in W@@ ev@@ man &apos;s football .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Bru@@ in@@ si tre@@ er Jim Mor@@ a a a a little before Monday became Tuesday .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel bi@@ en@@ ni@@ al trends to reduce the burden of players has in fact led to longer days , at least until the end of the day , to one side on Friday .
for this reason , U@@ C@@ L@@ A was the first to start training at 19.@@ 15 to fit into the already intensive time@@ line for players .
moving from two to two training days a day means more tr@@ end@@ y days - the start of the Bru@@ in@@ si training camp was increased in the order of almost a week , and for the first time in the Mor@@ a &apos;s six @-@ tonne season , training takes place at the summer courses .
they will have an 18 tr@@ en@@ ches agenda until 20 August , before formal preparations begin for the September opening game against T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; D .
Mor@@ a said she was in favour of the amendment of the US@@ SR , although it adds another item to the tight agenda of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and that is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they break themselves through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are wonderful young people .
I believe that when we come Saturday and have more time , it is really a bit of a bit . &quot;
once the camp has been closed , U@@ C@@ L@@ A training will be closed , which is no easy task given a clear view of their ne@@ ar@@ by base and remo@@ tely located L@@ us@@ kin centre , a higher class hotel that has already been dis@@ charged from the portal around the gate with the portal , with a football pat@@ ch .
since this weekend , ho@@ tels are occupied by the Bru@@ ys players , but Mor@@ a admitted that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&apos;@@ We apply security measures &apos; , &apos; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; that is a real concern and it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate to think that people can rent and train from there .
if you have a record on a training , it can do a pretty good deal .
but we are going to deploy a security team there and on board 8 .
we do our best by using our existing ones .
I will try not to be very concerned about that .
we have the plan in place . &apos;

if the Ed@@ gar Sa@@ visa@@ are reduced to a assis@@ tant , it can anticipate events organised to honour her electoral union .

Washington changes green card rules
media publications are cited by President Donald T@@ ru@@ p , who said that a new US immigration plan is planned , which changes the Green Card rules .
the plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year for 50 000 people , stricter rules on temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by Re@@ public@@ s and the President supports them .
the draft law will go to Congress in two cha@@ mbers .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , because it will change the way that US citizens can be given green cards .
the law will reduce ahel@@ er migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process gives priority to candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp , according to US media publications .

how many were still expelled to Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and at the start of the 20th century to land here ?
that is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took note of that in the words of the Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to men who have themselves thought about it .
it is hard to say exactly that , because at that time up to 30 people could come in a group , but the passport was given only to a man .
the passport was given only one , but it was children , nur@@ ses and su@@ ch@@ like .
look at how vast this territory was here !
it was many times larger than historical S@@ et@@ oma@@ a .
after all , it was needed to educate , manage in some way .
Gre@@ et@@ ings came here as pe@@ as@@ ants , but their life change , because here they arrived in areas that were not only related to agriculture but also to the river ( pal@@ p@@ able par@@ king ) , gold mines , industry .
for instance , in New @-@ Pet@@ ser@@ i , many pigs went into work later in a classified town K@@ ras@@ no@@ jar@@ sk @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P@@ . ) , when it was formed .
did pigs represent a majority of the population in the region at the time ?

seven to eight children in family were normal .
how much does Si@@ b@@ erian Se@@ to@@ de differ and different from mother country to pig ?
they are different , although what was brought here was once the same .
they brought a lot of popular ideas .
they did so themselves ( popular ideas ) , but they always made a difference that had been brought about and what had been done here .
climate change has had a major impact on se@@ to@@ sis &apos;s traditional clothing , because here it is cold .

in Greece two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal ten@@ dering

rules on GMO must be clear
the land Department of the EU has sent a coordination front a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment ( GMOs ) and plant protection law .
the amendment to the law gives up a separate collection of data for both genetically modified ( GM ) crop locations and operators , using a plant health register in the future .
in addition , GM crop operators will be modified to have prior agreements with the beekeeping agent .
although there are currently no GM crops culti@@ vated in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
that would be at least as long as there were no decisions to declare Estonia GMO @-@ free , &quot; said S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , Head of the plant health department at the Ku@@ elu@@ cht .
&quot; however , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burdens of both the private and public sectors , &quot;
the draft law repe@@ als provisions on GM crop location and management training for GM sites and operators , lays down requirements for the handling of GM crops and for starting an economic activity .
specifically for beekeeping , GM crops growers will be replaced by a current obligation to inform bee@@ keepers about the cultivation of GM crops by a commitment to reach an appropriate agreement with the bee@@ keepers before cultivation is initiated .
the draft law has been sent to Minis@@ tries for coordination .
all interested parties will have the opportunity to examine it in the information system and , if they wish , present their views with the world Department .
the proposed changes will particularly affect those operating in the plant farming sector , bee@@ keepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10 - is allowed to be grown .
so far , however , no Estonian farmer has taken an interest in growing GM crops .
this is because Estonia does not have a ma@@ gic pressure , a European cor@@ n , which has a lead line called mon 8@@ 10 resistant to .
it is also breeding its maize lea@@ ther on the southern regions , and it is not appropriate in our climate conditions in May .
to provide this certainty , the Hague Department has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible GM pollution in the seeds of various summer rape , maize and soya culti@@ vated in Estonia .
the sam@@ ples analysed showed that seeds were not included in a foreign wave and the survey concluded that the seeds of the bur@@ nt seeds in Estonia were not accompanied by GMOs .
this is to conclude that Estonia is not deliberately culti@@ vating GM crops and it was also proven that there was no accident contamination .

White House failure to cost taxpayers thousands
according to the military documents published for the magaz@@ ine , the White House &apos;s decision to close a naval helicop@@ ter last month has cost taxpayers a total of USD 24 000 in the southern American production event .
the green and white colour S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , called the President &apos;s par@@ ity of Marine One , was the cen@@ tre@@ piece of the play of the US construction programme in White on 17 July .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence and senior house administra@@ tors reported industrial products on their circulation from all 50 states .
the helicop@@ ter built at Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut was rol@@ led together with the repu@@ te ja@@ hi from W@@ is@@ con@@ ha@@ m and the Mis@@ sis@@ ter engine fuel f@@ itted from the Por@@ su@@ da .
according to the documents of the Es@@ ca@@ ka@@ r Marine H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) , who is responsible for the deployment of H@@ eli@@ kop@@ ter , the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter &apos;s office has been called for by the cell &apos;s cell office , or F@@ AR@@ G@@ O , to a minimum effect 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter &apos;s &apos; extraordinary &apos; event was swe@@ pt on the southern side .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 com@@ and@@ ö@@ r a day before the event in an email to his chief , the leader of the na@@ vy , to the de@@ pu@@ ties in aviation .
the message stated that the helicop@@ ter would arrive at a southern commission on 17 July morning at 7 : 00 for an event starting at 7 : 00 and stay there until the night was cleared at 18 : 21 .
the added point was that , should the V@@ alg@@ est leave the House , you need a second e@@ ki@@ er flight because of the limits of working time .
the initial air crew were at the helicop@@ ter during the event and the first @-@ class security team would be sta@@ tioned near the aircraft throughout its ter@@ rain .
it was not possible to read in the documents given to the magaz@@ ine whether the other e@@ paa@@ tation was needed at the end .
the H@@ at@@ chi Law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political ends .
the documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 was investigating whether this event could violate that provision .
&quot; we asked whether it was a violation of H@@ at@@ chi law and we were told that it was not , &apos; wrote the com@@ man@@ der .
&quot; it seems you have no choice , &apos; responded to the leading victim .
the White House announced the &apos; American @-@ prepared &apos; official event and H@@ at@@ chi &apos;s law would not have covered it .
but even formal events have political sub@@ ter@@ fu@@ ges .
the President supported the health reform efforts at the occasion in the Senate and praised attempts to keep government regulations under threat .
the use of the Marine One or Air Force @-@ known aircraft for political gain is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them merely as photo@@ copy is unusual .
the T@@ ru@@ mp was brought to attention in February when the first campaign event in Flor@@ idas Mel@@ bour@@ ne was triggered by a President &apos;s plane on the water@@ shed , and she is sli@@ pping from Twitter &apos;s account with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the plane .
&apos;@@ The White Ma@@ tel is very pleased with the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; exhibition , where products were represented from 50 states produced by American personnel , &apos; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the media officer in the White House .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often perform tests around Washington and at the southern he@@ mic@@ y@@ cle to get the US presidential white house to be dis@@ en@@ tan@@ ged with a me@@ tre of prec@@ ision .
when T@@ ru@@ mp was at the G20 Summit in early July in Germany , H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 was organising 58 tests in the White House le@@ vers .
according to the official , the flight to the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; flight flight was included in the standard for this time @-@ end flight flights .
on that occasion , the Es@@ ka@@ r helicop@@ ter fly another 11 hours for &apos; presidential support missions &apos; .
the White House says that no other dis@@ plays of this event cri@@ ed taxpayers &apos; pur@@ ses .
as S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky representative said , the company was not involved in carrying out an expon@@ tor at the helicop@@ ter &apos;s southern power .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 will not retain the President &apos;s budget documents and the precise costs of the event will be difficult to identify .
however , at the Ministry of Defence &apos;s rush for the 2017 financial year , the V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D will be able to pay compensation at USD 24 per flight hour .
the Es@@ ca@@ r papers specified a flight length of 30 minutes from its main base line , Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o , on both routes .
the White House says that the actual cost of helicop@@ ter use is well below the sum .
&quot; it is very misleading to calculate taxpayers &apos; costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates , &quot; said Wales .
&quot; these estimated compensation rates include staff , maintenance and many other irreversible costs which will be taken into account in the annual appropriations . &quot;
according to a 2015 &quot; rand study , &quot; the Department of Defence &quot; will not include compensation rates for staff costs , but covering fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former journalist for the White House Se@@ an S@@ pic@@ er defended helicop@@ ter at that time .
&quot; the point is to show America &apos;s own affairs this week , &quot; said S@@ pic@@ er .
&quot; I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ t state are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are expected hundreds , if not thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that , just like most Americans , we are all proud of that helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly on .
so it is of course right to highlight that . &quot;
it is not clear whether T@@ ru@@ mp was infected by a helicop@@ ter in a southern factory , or not , but was sitting behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
in the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky addressed representatives by throwing out the media and complaining about company products in his own aircraft park .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ ski very well , &quot; the President said , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .

She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist at Y@@ ale University .

by but@@ tering Kla@@ uses , playing wine , enjo@@ y@@ ment it and a follow @-@ on percep@@ tions , we are putting our brain on the job to create a taste for wine .
She@@ per@@ d says that bo@@ vine be@@ ac@@ les do not actually contain taste , but that taste arises from the way wine stimu@@ lates brain .
she leads to a comparison between brain image and brain d@@ read .
&quot; taste is not wine , taste creates wine by taste &quot; She@@ per@@ d says .
things that still affect the appearance of wine are , for example , our old age , gender and even sy@@ l@@ la@@ m , which humans produce .

the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can represent the people only if all members of society , including women , play a role .
the head of the UN aid mission , Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , said that hundreds of women would stand for municipal councils , three women would stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; underlining the importance of women &apos;s role , it is not possible to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate , &quot; said in a statement made on Wednesday .
elections can represent a genuine people and be credible only if women participate fully and participate in all phases of the electoral process .
the Afghan local council elections and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have , for their part , threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with a transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is cal@@ mly handed over from one democratically elected government to the next .
according to Hamas , women &apos;s strong role in Afghanistan is increasing democracy &apos;s success .
according to the Afghan independent electoral Commission , 3.@@ 6 million registered voters are 1.2 million women .

now the ju@@ mp bags are taking a real grand s@@ lide , and mo@@ mo@@ ph@@ ile be@@ et@@ les have changed their top @-@ top design bags for months instead of simple be@@ er @-@ red bags .
it is not just a coastal zone , but today it is just as popular as a street dog and it even puts b@@ older women in the office .
it is worth making it clear here whether the upper @-@ day summer payment is still sitting or worth marking and the lap@@ top computer is still a little more formal .
however , the aff@@ inity has been made by be@@ er ha@@ vo@@ c by women .
for example , reading foreign mo@@ tives , the first thing to do is to see that mo@@ gur@@ us people are first to claim a holiday trip to the local market and acquire some be@@ er bags , to which a whole period of leave is a pri@@ est and which is in the t@@ ree , the market and also as friend @-@ makers in the town .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are so generous that buying bags from the market is selling and selling larger w@@ ol@@ ves or giving them to their loyal read@@ ers .
it is worth noting that there is such a great demand for bags that in the world of play women ( and men ! ) apparently have to involve each other in order to be able to host a few homes happy .
in a sense , such mad@@ ness is understandable , because it is the rare of these regimes when , in the mo@@ ck of yesterday , you can buy something that has risen to a s@@ lot for just a few tens of euros .
true , ski@@ pp@@ ers have discovered here a simple way of making money , and so be@@ er luxury br@@ ands sell a bo@@ w@@ l for a few hundred and a half thousand euros .
obviously , in order for richer customers not to feel as easy dying to get round some cheap bags .
for example , D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a can buy over EUR 1 000 coff@@ ers .
however , for a Chan@@ ge@@ os@@ pa@@ tial interpretation , 6,@@ 000 euro can be moved into circulation .
unlike most motor buildings , be@@ er bags do not inher@@ it a lot of great fu@@ n , but they did so far .
indeed , cop@@ ies are said to be far from the Philippines , where they have been transported .
T@@ rap@@ ping from a bun@@ ch of trains is primarily export business there and very often do not see them happening around the local community .
it is said that the drinking technology dates back to the 14@@ th century and is quite a series of normal cor@@ al @-@ ju@@ b@@ bit .
however , since be@@ er does not have to be red as strongly as bas@@ ket , they can be labelled and other materials that make homes more attractive and , by extension , more ac@@ ous@@ tic .
for example , recently , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y bags in which red pa@@ per@@ ers or s@@ kin@@ s are bil@@ led .
however , the full letter may in particular be sent by ac@@ cess@@ ors to ac@@ tress J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , the biggest red be@@ er be@@ er game of which had not been seen before .
she did fit be@@ er at any possible gar@@ ment series and did not have to go much to even the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
what is less popular today is that , in contrast to everything else , they are not played a role , but that they are taken care of by a car@@ te head and , unlike all the sex@@ es , they are not to be ca@@ red for with special resources , but also cause water and a target .
as always with trends rob@@ ber@@ y initiatives , in addition to classi@@ cal appearance , br@@ ands have emerged with all interpretations .
for example , if you wish you can get a red ju@@ ice or a tiny stra@@ w .
it is worth remembering , however , that classic be@@ er bags will never be out of fashion , while be@@ er fuel does .
but what is the classic be@@ er &apos;s cour@@ ty@@ ard ?
for centuries , such be@@ er @-@ red bags have been classified as &quot; stra@@ pped &quot; and re@@ ar @-@ pressed and re@@ has@@ h in their style , are on the side@@ lines , as well as be@@ er ones .

G@@ M@@ B concerns investment at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant
the Trade Union is waiting for mature producers in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to be reas@@ sured by long @-@ term production plans at the G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has remained silent on the future of customs land investment .
in a theat@@ re producing H@@ ob@@ no@@ lid and rich know @-@ how and other products , more than 500 people work .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s owner , Pla@@ di , said they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years .
it employed workers and trade union chairs &apos; are the first to hear &apos; when something changes in the factory &apos;s activities .
in a letter to the company &apos;s leader , G@@ M@@ B addressed the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e company &apos;s request for &quot; sc@@ ash concerns about the lack of funding to upgrade production lines . &quot;
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the head of the site on the business needs and future investment plan is a source of deep concern for our Members .
several generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely made up of people from the local community and the G@@ las@@ go@@ w region , as indispensable pillars for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social housing .
so in the eastern G@@ las@@ go@@ w , for jobs , wages and welfare , and in the face of Bre@@ x@@ t , the rise in living costs and the chronic fall in production , the thri@@ ving Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e company is badly needed . &quot;
the Bureau representative said : &apos; the Director of Customs Borders was only receiving a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ ting yesterday and the company replies directly to him because we value active interaction with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between workers in customs and G@@ M@@ B , which openly debated a number of issues .
we then discussed with workers that , like all other businesses operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are reviewing our operations on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years we have invested over £ 5 million on the Customs crossing site , most of which has gone into production lines and improvements of operations .
we fully understand Tol@@ l@@ cros@@ s as a manufacturing site heritage and , should the object be subject to any change , the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago of being a sympa@@ thetic approach ?
la liga may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not give up in the attempt to attract Ney@@ ts to their ranks by making a USD 18@@ 9 million offer to evade him , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record March ?
this ben@@ ign approach has opened the summer &apos;s transition window and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of buying , e@@ rec@@ ted in the previous season by returning Paul Po@@ g@@ ba to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ us for GBP 89 million .
once the changeover is completed , Ney@@ mark will thus become the most expensive player in the world and also the most highly remun@@ erated professional global player , who will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from the PS@@ G .
Barcelona is also a hin@@ t , of course , because of the approach and the free bur@@ st of Ney@@ mar , although the close source of the Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ an Bureau confirms that the club has always been best off for football since its San@@ to@@ to@@ u arrival in 2013 .
but did the PS@@ G President warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City took the interest in signing a contract with Bla@@ ise Ma@@ tu@@ ka in 2014 , N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all clubs who thought of recru@@ iting some of their best @-@ performing PS@@ G players .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that when they are dealing with some of our players , we will stand down and contact those players , &quot; al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f said .
&quot; we honour all clubs .
but if they try to conclude contracts with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have cros@@ sed this border , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ field player Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow an Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer set@@ backs as a result of this interest by removing the Ney@@ mark from one of its precious assets .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges after Bre@@ x , not borders .
&quot; Bre@@ x is seriously threatening to strike a w@@ edge between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned early on a first visit to Northern Ireland since it took office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible to move freely to the current people and goods , says Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; that is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; he emphasised .
according to the fact that he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as it is not , he would be part of the European common market .
that would preserve the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the UK .
another way of making Britain &apos;s exit smoo@@ ther would be to set up a European Union @-@ United Kingdom Customs Union , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , the Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said : &apos; surely we could have that kind of Great Britain &apos; .
the alternative would be to return to customs points , which would h@@ eral@@ d historical separation and political failure .
&apos;@@ L@@ et trade , prosperity and peace &apos; , the Irish Prime Minister said .
she called Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t &apos; a challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland &apos;s everyday life .
the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the Irish parties in Bel@@ fast .
