Four members of the Cape Verde Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to Posselt , in Spain , the police detained the leader of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Kallirovo Group &apos; in Estonia , SpinGulevich , who is known as Sdra KCape rovski in the criminal world .
Gulevich arrested in Spain was arrested at a court permit .
Yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
It is suspected of being members of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde &apos; criminal community aged between 27 and 57 years , who commit mainly drug crimes .
In the province of Mala Mijas in Spain , the alleged head of the criminal community was detained .
In Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of them collected according to the figures being the leading figure in the criminal community , and two are members of the criminal community .
The data collected indicates that tasks and roles had been clearly divided in the criminal community .
The purpose of the criminal community &apos;s activities was to commit drug crimes and thus to earn criminal proceeds , &quot; commented on the head of the pre @-@ trial proceedings in criminal cases , Public Prosecutor Vaila Verte .
&quot; We do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; the public Prosecutor added .
It is people who have previously been interested in law enforcement authorities , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; International cooperation has become commonplace for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; said Public Prosecutor Verte .
The head of the central police service , ago in Leis , said that detention was preceded by an investigation lasting almost one and a half years .
&quot; In the first half of the week , we were in Estonia and Spain suspected of committing crimes , &quot; he said .
It added that central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
For years now , we have a good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civil card .
These arrests are yet another message for criminals that we will get them from another European end , &quot; said Leis .
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that men suspected of being free may continue to commit new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office requested their arrest and also approved by the court .
The man arrested in Spain expects him to be handed over to Estonia .
In this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation .
The criminal prosecution procedure is carried out by the central criminal police &apos;s organised crime office and is led by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
The city of Tallinn was convicted of blackmail by Sdra Gulevich in 2005 and punished him with a five @-@ year imprisonment .
In the middle of the last decade , Gulevitšit was regarded as the second most important in Estonia &apos;s criminal world following the Gendarmerie , Nikolai Tarankov .
Gulevich , who came from Cape Verde , appeared in Estonia &apos;s alliances at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Admittedly , he taxed taxi drivers and women on various hotels and ordered a monthly rotation tax on businessmen .
International joint operations , confiscation of proceeds of crime and entry into force of court decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
For example , the latest judgments , the eight accused of a criminal offence in the so @-@ called Diky Community , who seized EUR 80 000 of criminal proceeds , or the verdict against nine persons that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at illegal trafficking of illegal cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in Eastern Viruland and southern Estonia .
It has a total of around EUR 71 500 of recorded criminal profits .
In these criminal cases , it has been successful that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and , if necessary , that procedures are carried out in any country of the European Union .
Civil Liberties Group warns of Missourisse travel
The National Association for the Advangue of the People of Colored People ( NANicaragua ) has warned the people of the Muslim Brotherhood travelling in Missoula for discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the State .
In a statement by the Group , &apos; The NASR issued for the State of Missouri State , valid until 28 August 2017 , calls on all American passengers , visitors and souls to be particularly attentive and very careful when moving around the country , given the suspicious racial events that have taken place recently and have also been highlighted here &apos; .
According to NAUTS , the group urged both the recent Missouri law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that the country &apos;s regular lawyers &apos; targets are , to a large extent , minorities .
&quot; Citizens &apos; rights are violated .
They are drifted because of their skin colour , beaten or slaughtered , &apos; said Ros Chapel , President of NASR , Rod Chapel , The Kansas City Star .
&quot; We have never received such complaints so closely before . &quot;
This is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for the US state .
The group referred to events such as racist insults on musicians &apos; students at Missouri University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black Sandersi .
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , after he was beaten in petrol by state and the Missouri police captured him without being accused of a crime .
In addition , the report recently compiled by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri shows that the national flag state is likely to halt the cars of black drivers by 75 % more likely than white drivers .
&apos;For people to be aware and to warn their families , friends and collaborators about what might happen in Missouris , &apos; said Chapel .
&quot; People need to be ready , whether it means taking fun money or informing relatives that they pass through the state . &quot;
The latest figures from the FBI programme on hate crime were documented in the Missouris in 2015 at 100 hate crime , which places the state in 16 places in the country for similar offences .
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law , which makes it difficult for the company &apos;s court to complain about discrimination in the search for housing or work .
The American Civil Liberties Association ( American Civil Situation Union ) had previously issued travel barriers for Texas and Arizona following the adoption by those states of immigration laws obliging local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences because , according to ACLU , it increases racial profiling .
Usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a counterreaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
Hepatitis : What could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
Hepatitis , or incineration , can be caused by five different types of hepatitis - A , B , C , D and E .
All these viruses highlight the fierce burst of the liver .
However , the worst cost is chronic hepatitis B and C , which can develop further into the liver &apos;s circus , the lips and the liver .
The epidemiology of the Health Agency , KuSuu r , tells us that acute hepatitis disease events are the same in the case of all types of lipsy incineration - fatitis , fatigue , Easperation , oineration , spatitis , air pain , grey emissions , horse mackerel , meat and asylum , and swine and limasters .
The last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of the liver burnt @-@ up disease .
Children can undergo hepatitis without disease .
The various types of heat can only be determined on the basis of laboratory research data .
Alpatitis may turn to chronic hepatitis and run decades without disease phenomena , which means that man may not know anything about his or her dangerous illness .
Mr Kunilr points out various forms of hepatitis and describes their culmination more closely .
Ehepatitis virus infections are spread from a disease to humans and infect us when we eat contaminated food or drink water , via seals , from infected person &apos;s emissions to hand and hand food , soil , objects , contact and consumption of drugs .
Relatives and carers , people suffering from chronic pay , sex people with infected infections , sex men , drug users , Ahepatitis A high @-@ spread countries .
Contamination can be prevented by vaccination , in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling a lot and at risk of hepatitis A .
Furthermore , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : To wash or disinfect hands , before eating food , to wash all fruit and vegetables .
The hepatitis virus is spreading in the circulation of human blood , drugs incineration , therapeution , augmentation , blood @-@ contaminated fodder ( toothmeters , pregnancy tools ) , donor blood , hepatio @-@ hepatitis sufferers in sex and infpatitis sufferers &apos; disease .
The Group of the hepatitis infection includes drugs , sex partners of infected person , sex men , newborn mothers of infected mother , family members and carers , health care , rescue workers and police officers , and people visiting countries with high @-@ hepatitis B diseases .
In order to prevent hepatitis , it is possible to vaccinate people ; in particular , it recommends to vaccinations of people at risk , as well as chronic liabilities , HIV infections , sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes .
( B ) hepatitis other preventive measures are : Prevention of the use of hygiene and manure , other sharp tools and needles , systalstalgia , prophytoisation and augmentation , and use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection or prevention of sexual risk .
Vaccination against hepatitis V is part of the National Immunisation Scheme and free of charge for children in Estonia .
Hepatitis C virus is spreading in connection with the blood of a person who is infected with the disease , in the breadth of drugs , in Ecology , in augmentation , in the use of blood @-@ contaminated meters , in the use of blood @-@ borne foetuses , with blood blood blood blood blood blood , in the sexual treatment of hepatitis bullet and in the treatment of hepatitis patients to animals / newborn .
Drug users , sex partners of infected person , sex men , newborn mothers of infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police officers , people with HIV infections , and passengers visiting countries with hepatitis C .
Prevention of hepatitis C is : Non @-@ use of hospitality hygiene and manorary devices , other sharp tools and systalstalgia , therapeutic care and augmentation , and condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection .
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C .
D hepatitis tis is caused by the Dhepatitis virus , which goes much further in the presence of the hepatitis B virus .
As a result , Dhepatitis Bhepatitis infections , together with hepatitis B or superinfants , occur on chronic hepatitis B sufferers .
Blood and other body liquids , contaminated systalls and needles , relatives and rarely infected animals are spread through exposure to hepatitis virins .
The hepatitis hazard tax is chronic hepatitis B infections and people who do not have immunity from hepatitis B .
An effective preventive measure is vaccination against hepatitis B vaccines , which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus .
E @-@ hepatitis viruses spread by feeous means of drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , donor blood , psychips and more infected animals .
Passengers may be infected with high levels of E hepatitis disease in countries .
Ehepatitis preventive measures are compliance with hygiene requirements : To wash or disinfect hands after slaughter , prior to food preparation and eating , after hospital care .
Fruits and vegetables are washing before consumption , avoiding eating little hot meat , fish and seafood , eating only safe drinking water and avoiding drug consumption .
Although , over the last few months , competitors tried four times to printing the Olympic winner , 34 years old Farah ended up with force and won 26.49.51 .
Mr Farah did not think long enough to get the husband Tania and children on their way after the finalists .
This was a special moment for me .
I very much support my family .
Being with them was wonderful , &quot; said Farah to journalists .
Farah is focusing its fifth title competition in London on the golden dump of 5 000 and 10 000 metres .
Everything is possible if it is believed .
Despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connorm in Daam gold , Gustav Klimti , Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri has an extraordinary story of &apos; synonymous with one art works &apos; , much deeper than the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna .
But even more deeply in history .
The anthem &apos;s inferrant culmination , the sleep on the flash , the narrowly subject , would have had to have had more influence on the extraordinary portfolio licensed by the title .
At the moment , there would be some sort of two books : Gustav Klimti and his painting of Daam gold , the story of Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer , and a much more extensive and comprehensive history of Honourable families and the German occupation , with its aftermath in Austria .
The first third of the book leads to a thriving cultural life in the middle of Vienna , and who himself owed to the Austrian capital , it can hardly imagine how life went around Ringstrass more than a hundred years ago or how all its head was turned when the climate invaded .
The concentration of cultural characters was high in one of Europe &apos;s richest cities and the name familiar with in the book , as it were in a more cultural way .
However , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where there was an untreated arson in the pigmeat and the highest level of suicide in Europe does not add anything to development .
Or perhaps , however , every couple of paternalistic footballs also add colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna .
Dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
Nearly one in ten people in Vienna had a Jewish one during the Sajandiral .
Parents were also newcomers in Vienna , but by the time the Arad relief was launched twice by the Czech sugar magnad Ferdinja Bloch and the customer in his famous painting , his father had become the seventh largest bank in Habsbursts .
However , the whole life of the glaciers to which he belonged did not turn .
If you look at the &apos; Daam gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that , in the end of life , this kind of colless socialist infection was formerly infected and dreamt of travel to the Soviet Union .
For 1907 , when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband &apos;s luggage from Climate Kong , the painting maker in Vienna was the last moment .
The climate ordered a payment at the time of 4 000 kroons , a quarter of the price of a good @-@ place rural house .
The fact that some sports crews were suspected of a modelli of a master was not intimidated by sugar stunnatis .
As far as the delegate is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between the modelli and the artist created during the work continued until the end of life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connor - Daam gold .
Gustav Klimti Championship , Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri Corporree , &quot; The Varrak 2016 , the English translation Aldo Randland .
Shortly before the start of the work with Adelem , the climate had been visited Ravenna San Vitale , and the investigators think that it was precisely there that the superb mosaic countries Eulna Theodort gave the artist the idea of making a golden portfolio called Adeledeledeleger a mosaic .
The climate presented in his &apos; Daam gold &apos; in Vienna in 1908 and about the same time ( 1907 @-@ 1908 ) , one of the golden terrestrials , was born .
Art historians did not notice the similarities of the two women .
What about nature is Hitler ?
&quot; I think I owe him to make his hand publicly available to the public , &quot; said Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer a few years after the departure of the artist ( Klimt died in February 1918 ) to the Director of the Belvedere museum and wanted their family Klimti to go to museums .
Six years before the death , the climate had produced one of the Adeles .
He also asked her husband to leave her two sports courses and four Gustav Klimti landscapes to Galeri , Austria .
His founding fathers came to Mrs Mariana and Mr Luda .
One year after the Climate Minister had finished the &apos; Austrian Mona &apos; annex , Viin Kacarriart de Akademine had attempted to get 17 @-@ year @-@ old Adolf Hitler , but fell through the Code .
Although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ Semitism is considered to be the reason for the fact that Jewish professors did not accept him in the academine , none of his culminants were actually Jews .
In any case , the role of GalSpecial in Austria , referred to in Mrs Galeria , had changed considerably by 1939 , which had become important for finding decent works for the Maciras of the rich Jewish Jewish arts in Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal artistic musicians also served some work at home for As , but not for the climate .
Sixty years after the night of the Nazi arts , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old trial dispute began between the Austrian Government and Bloch @-@ Bauer heirs .
It should just be noted here that if the &apos; novel &apos; is seen in Belvedere Castle in Vienna , Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer , the &apos; Daam gold &apos; portrayed by Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer , must be seen as a trip to New York to Neue Galeri .
And , before the Vienna War , to read the aforementioned book .
Even if you do not plan to look at the climate &apos;s work , because at least my emotion , after the closure of the book , the subject of laughing and Jews was sold more than USD 135 million over the mamal and modell Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer .
So it is not so much a matter of courtesy , rather of a matribal fate - and a very moving story .
There was a significant simplification of the focus on events on the work of the Baudis &apos; relatives at the start of the book .
17 @-@ year @-@ old swimming in Canada was very close to Estonia &apos;s record
In eating , gold was very close to the personal corn of its own 200 m glue glue , flooding 2.16.62 .
The Tippmark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ old pipes every week since the Canadian Cup took place at 2.16.58 , the Priit Aavnik Ujugation blog .
Gold last escaped the A to the end of ten years .
In Finally , he went through his distance to 2.15.76 and achieved a good 7th seat with a new powerful peak .
Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.15.13 ) , consisting of Alina Kendziorn , remained just over half a second .
In Estonia &apos;s &quot; gold &quot; ranking all the time went up , and its fresh peak mark is the fifth ever result of Estonia .
The young hope of the future lies in the launch of Canadian adult Championships of 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in balfire and 200 mm and 400 metres in bundling .
Last week , Canada &apos;s jewellery championships took place in Tuonto , and gold also made successful start @-@ ups there .
He won 200 m in balfire with a silver man &apos;s time of 2.03.22 .
This distance was swamped so quickly by a standby last year .
In Estonia , only Estonia &apos;s record BSE , Elina Parkika , has matured this distance faster than ever .
As a star in Canada , the top 56.66 of the new Estonian season won a wonderful personal record of 100 m vouchers .
For example , her old year , Kertu ly Alnek , has distanced it by just one century more quickly .
He arrived at another 100 m in the opening of the theatre swimming of the theatre at 1.03.69 .
For half a long distance , he won only the seventh seat when he sleep in the final assembly of 2.17.31 .
Gold is currently leading the Estonian candbook of the season at four distinct distance .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics insured teeth
The holiday season is in hand - it is also a nonsense for the President of the United States , Donald Trul .
However , since the Trump has so far been one of the President who took the most holidays , critics are already wearing teeth .
According to the US VIS and the CNN , the President intends to have 17 @-@ day leave in a static golf club in Bedminster , which is located in New Jerseys .
Although President leave began yesterday , the anti @-@ Trumpi has been speaking for weeks .
They are asking the Olympics for too frequent cleansing .
It is precisely that the President has the time for a weekend in his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey in the cotton .
Incidentally , the Trump has not cleaned the President for its 196 working days .
For example , Mr Bush was able to have 67 days on this holiday , with Barack Obama half less than the Trump , but only 21 days .
However , the Truel tends to forget things quickly .
Ten days after becoming President , when he received the Trump , he said , &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , that there would be no time left for a holiday for his engineer , because a great deal needs to be done .
He also expressed his outrage about Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
On Twitter , the President @-@ in @-@ Office wrote : &apos; While Obama has a holiday , plays golf , the brakes and the jungle concerts are on the street , journalists in the country are pulling their heads off the horse &apos; .
According to white house officials , 17 days of golf club visits to pollen are not a betrap .
It is officially referred to as &apos; working leave &apos; , during which the Trul does not have time to read the Olympic Games or other sporting activities .
In addition , there was also a second reason for working leave .
It is precisely that the western canal system of the White House is changed , and that is why all staff had to leave it .
The West Bank is also based on Ovalkatsmanship and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West in August , when there are 38 degrees and no conglomerates , said Lindsay Walters , the white house spokesperson , who stressed that the President would continue to work during his leave .
Where President Trump will spend 17 days , you will get an idea of video .
Blocking critics from Facebook to 07 do not apply for state office if you do not tolerate the voices of the voters .
The father of our country knew so much about the unfavourable media coverage .
The Americans loved Mr Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to bull him for everything , from internal politics to his political principles .
Of course , he was annoyed by the criticism .
But he did not force his critics to remain silent .
Because , in the year 1783 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and , in darkness and silence , may lead us to slaughter animals &apos; .
This brings me to Maryland kuberner Larry Hogan , who is struggling to be more in Washington .
The organisers &apos; submissions have blocked and erased at least 450 people who expressed their views on their official Facebook page .
And at the beginning of the week , the American Union for Freedom of Citizens ( American Civil Nations Union ) therefore complained to the courts .
The Kuberner official &apos;s office paved the action empty and web commentates burnt in the counter @-@ reaction style &apos; who is interested ? &apos;
&apos;This is just Facebook , &apos; many people said .
But that counts .
And this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan .
This is an amazing popular Republican tourage in an overwhelming democratic state .
His approval percentage is the second highest ranking in the country &apos;s 50 months .
Hogan is not a reactive sight .
It has led the state firmly and remains strictly firm in its own principles .
In addition , she has used her as a major tool to communicate with his constituents quite bluntly Facebook , presenting , for the first time after the chemical waste , his head of his stone .
Therefore , a public forum with official marking , managed by staff who pay taxpayers &apos; dollars from Kenya is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous , is being blocked .
Hogan &apos;s press representative , Amelia Chita , defended the behaviour of the Governor in an interview given to Washington &apos;s Posselt , arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderecasting .
However , it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet controls on the Internet , sub @-@ prime workers or people full of hatred .
The post was interviewed with a number of people who were blocked by Hogan .
This is precisely what they are really the people who are talking to their elected leaders : The user , the owner of the company and the passport , and not Internet controls .
They all said that their comments were respectable , thought @-@ out and not ropaste .
Pastor quoted milk in his post , underlining the Catholic movement of Hogan .
The lawyer from Marylan Bowie , Lakshmi Sarma Raman , did not incite hatred , but rather hate crimes .
&quot; I was politely saying that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; he wrote the editorial news story in his country .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that how many people comment on the same subject , some of them call it an inextricably collective effort instead of acknowledging that it is a great deal of concern for citizens . &quot;
What the Governor &apos;s official called &apos; targeted junk attack &apos; would probably be invited by others to &apos; public support &apos; .
The age of Facebook allows for easy matching of messages by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments .
It is much cleaner than the old one when it was necessary to send out workers to do the same , to collect and bury critical editorial newspapers , or to arrest the protesters and to force them to remain silent .
But that is exactly what is happening now , just digitally .
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media toothless .
President Trumpi has accused Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter &apos;s bed .
One of the first key decisions on this matter was taken last week in Virginia .
James C. Cacheris , the US civil servant , decided in Alexandria that the director of the Managing Board of Loudouni land violated the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the voter on Facebook page .
In Ktucky , the Governor Matt Bevinit ( R ) also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter for use .
This should not be so difficult .
In Washington , the cost of affordable postal services had similar effects on the Internet .
Between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers and anonymous writers dared in his way of leadership .
Even then , Washington had to face anonymous controls .
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseudo @-@ unionyms such as Juricola , Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , making the decisions of Washington land .
According to historical documents which have been compiled in the framework of the Water @-@ based George Washington magazine , he burned his cabinet with petitions criticising his views on twinning , trade and shipping agreements with Britain .
But he did not force them to remain silent .
Freedom of expression , opinions and debates are fundamental pillars of our country .
And proper management means accepting it .
Ronan Rafferty hopes of the comfort of Renaissance Cclub &apos;s home territory
The former European Chairwoman Ronan Rafferty hopes of comfort in the next three days in East LoER , Renaissance Clubi golf courses , 25 .
The Northern Ireland , which was in the vicinity of Archerfield Linony in the past year , ahead of the last round of Mr Paul Ealna &apos;s resignation , is staging a new place of engagement and filling the seat of the club &apos;s founder and executive leader , Mr Jerry Srare .
&quot; I saw Renaissance Club built , and now we see the club blowing in full glory , &quot; said Rafferty .
&quot; Players see the path in their best shape , it is in a perfect state .
Jerry has done an excellent job in setting up this place .
He is a keen supporter of golf games and proud of what has been achieved here .
This will allow an excellent presentation of the path . &quot;
Ingan ever expects to be able to defend the title for the first time , even though the man has won both European Toubon and the European challenge Touril during his 32 @-@ year career .
&apos;They sends a very special feeling , &apos; said Sethportis &apos;s beating player .
&quot; I could not defend my Extremadura Orange , because it was taken away from my competition calendar one year after my victory .
It is mathematical to come back to this chicken .
This is an excellent place to play golf .
I remember the memories of last year , for me and for my wife , Mrs Sharon , last year &apos;s victory was a special one .
It was a very special time that we will always be at the heart . &quot;
Gary Orr , who joined the European Works Agency at the beginning of this year when he became 50 , will return to the competition on the ground of the country .
This is his first event in Scotland since the participation of Aberdeen profitable Management Scottish Openil in 2013 .
&quot; It is always a little more important to play at home , &quot; said Helensburgh &apos;s man Orr .
&quot; The Taks well , but at the same time they were also interested in an additional call .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and quite rightly demonstrated golf games .
I am pleased that things are going on so far . &quot;

Poverty and death in the farmland of Indonesia
When Barina Degei is preparing dinner , he does not use lead .
He seldom uses even a boy .
The Indonesian authorities , in the capital of the Municipality of Papua province Paniai , in the house of the majority of the puppet , place household manta in the local language in place in the direct replacement of the bar calling for instruction .
In half an hour &apos; time , brains will be taken from fire and skinned with unbeleaded hands .
Degei is silenced from another beach to theory and , at the same time , it is doing its daily household works , for example , washing the water of cradle from nearby @-@ nearby sex .
The ball plays a role in the uncovered room .
As he is a mother of four women , he has not been allowed to take care of any possessions .
Polügaamia is common here on May .
Late work may be dangerous , however , for most of the people of Somalis to be unemployed , and many of them are eating a lot , and there are still soldiers .
&apos;nobody dares to go around after 5 o &apos;clock in the village &apos; , &apos; he says .
It is a rare pilok in Papua mäki , a former Dutch colony , which was integrated into Indonesia in 1969 following a referendum in which only 1 026 older people were forced to vote in front of the forces .
The movement of Dutch people , who have apologised from the power of the Netherlands , is urging their rails quickly against the Jakarta Government , which is still keeping the region under strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pope and Western Pope , so independent Papua New Guinea remained eastern of the island .
The majority of the Roma is both a remote and deserted place , and in order to get here , 90 minutes from the capital of the province , Jayapuru , will have to fly to Nabimel and then pass a five @-@ hour journey with a rental car .
There is no public transport .
The city of approximately 19 000 inhabitants is made up of columns surrounded by carmbs and covers laininous iron roofs , which have been transformed into three @-@ brands .
Very few indicators have taken the road here , not to mention journalists , nor have there been almost any foreigners here .
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries , Mee Pago paints were marched by a God called Tamee .
There were other changes .
&apos;We were not used to wearing such clothes , &apos; says Degei , referring to the hijacked turbot of your colour , the fire on the pluustery and the English .
&quot; Before that , we only had a plant cow in the body . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the most poor province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
But it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
Just 100 km away from Paniao , a mountainous province of approximately 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey , the biggest and most profitable gold mine in the world is Grasberg , which belongs to the company Fbetporana McMoran , which operates in Phoenixis .
In 2015 alone , Frureexport from this place amounted to about USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper .
Furthermore , it is possible to conserve the supply of raw wood , worth which is estimated at USD 78 billion .
However , these riches are a source of suffering for paints , as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Iranian army .
A study by the New York Times in 2005 showed that Freexport between 1998 and 2004 was worth around USD 20 million to local troops and military units , including up to USD 150 000 to a single victim .
Pope efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden hall and are seamlessly betrayed .
According to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed , and thousands more have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the Iranian army since 1959 .
According to the Asian Committee on Human Rights , the massacre in the mountains in Papua tribes in the 1970s was the dimension of genocide .
Last year alone , over 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Colombian police in the region .
The 2016 report of the Grand District of Birsbane , entitled &apos; We shall lose all &apos; , contains testimony to the atrocities committed last year , such as extrajudicial executions , torture ( another report shows that rape and electric blowers are particularly widespread ) and the brutal repression of peaceful protests .
&quot; It is difficult to read the number of victims , as such incidents take place every week , &quot; says Andreas Harsono , the investigator of Human Rights Watch , Indonesia .
The nuances have been watered down even more strongly , because Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demographics are changing because of the influx of people in Indonesia from Barva , Kalimantan , Sumatra and Sulawsi from the islands of black economic migrants .
Photores of the public are sold in the Queen and the blending of vegetables to gado @-@ gado @-@ gado , which are stolen along with ground level .
They cannot compete with them .
&quot; Migrants started selling heroes and vegetables more cheaply than local boats on the traditional market , &quot; says Androulla Andersson born in Paniai , 24 years old , who worked in the home to the capital of the province , Jayapplause .
&quot; Syrians Fronmama @-@ Mama &#91; women &#93; painting boats are therefore losing their market share . &quot;
The President of Indonesia , Joko Widodo , who is known to the people as Jokow , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Pope .
The former pub won 27 constituencies , including Paniai , on his way to the presidential Palace of Jakarta .
However , the Pope has changed very little and the local feel cheated .
&quot; Our hearts have been broken because , in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jokow in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes with regard to restoring justice , &quot; says apprenticeships .
In fact , only two months after Jokow took office in October , Paniai was in a low position .
On 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the Roma stunned on Christmas when two Indonesian soldiers beauted blinded the dark .
Born children told them that they should include the front lights .
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai , one of the soldiers insulted their voting tone and returned later to four soldiers .
According to victims and spectators , in the &apos; drink @-@ driving &apos; , soldiers hunted children and deceived them with their guns .
Then one of the soldiers shot among children .
One child , 16 years old Yulianus Yeimot , was so brutally beaten that he fell into the home .
A few hours later , a nearby electoral Commission building was burnt and things went further next day .
Some 1 000 young people gathered in the football pitch in front of the local police department and the military command centre to claim justice .
They carried out direct refreshments and put forward the mails of Papua mee pago &apos;s waita @-@ tantantsu , where poultry songs were buried around and buried .
Some protesters started to lecture the police and the military .
&apos;When the crowd shows resistance more than three times , let them down , &apos; the official document , which has seen the magazine time but has not been issued to local media publications , &apos; .
The Mayor of Kego Koto , the city of Kego Koto , Yeremias Kayme ( 56 ) , felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking the people to go home .
No one had the will to listen .
&quot; Turning around me , I was suddenly shot in the left , saying &apos; he said time at night in his private colours at the blood of a tree .
We still do not know who the fire was , but it says that the soldiers &apos; rigs gathered in the month came from .
&apos;There was a lot of people , a lot of sweet , &apos; he adds .
The local man , Alfius Youw , was shot at his guns three times , according to a councillor .
&quot; I would expect him and I watched him through as a body to make sure that he is with him , &quot; said the magazine holiday synnically in Yohanes , who use only one name in many characters .
&apos;I saw him dead ... Snovel lew . &apos;
The Chief Police officer Yotje Mende said to the reporters that he was only the security of his department because it was attacked .
&quot; We need to defend ourselves when we are threatened to kill , &quot; said Vice @-@ President Pudjo Sulistiyo , the spokesman for the Police Service in 2015 .
&quot; This is a matter of life and death . &quot;
According to Human Rights Watch , five young protesters were killed and many injured .
The news about the killings arrived in Jakartail only on the next day .
Three weeks later , Jokowi Jayapuras made a passionate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses to be dealt with in Pope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
Security minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would put in place an alternative mechanism to tackle human rights crimes .
But almost immediately the excuses were also followed .
&quot; Most crimes happened a long time ago .
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s .
The point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
However , when speaking at the time at Christmas 5 June in Jakartas , Wiranto withdrew his words by saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism to deal with complaints in Pope .
Instead , he said that &apos; everything would be resolved by law &apos; .
The Wiranto , who has been accused by the United Nations of committing human rights crimes against more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the 1999 bloody referendum on independence , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Pope , including what happened in Paniais .
The families of the victims of Paniai adopted such statements with a gloomy disregard .
&quot; I have been interrogated four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Yohanes .
&apos;I am tired &apos; .
He says that he is still living in fear for years later .
&apos;I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&quot; I am afraid that the army is arresting me , I am afraid I will be shot . &quot;
His brother d Yacobus confirmed his opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid of this incident .
He said that he was beaten by the army after helping to bury four victims .
&quot; After burying the bodies of the dead , the army had to look for me , &apos; he says .
Executions have not stopped .
On Tuesday , the inhabitants of the Egyptian police in the neighbouring Paniai municipality in Deiyais were shot .
One person was killed and 17 injured , including children , when he went to the head of the village and construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to hospital .
This man &apos;s population , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ravianus Douw , who drowned to close rivers when trying to fish , died on the way to hospital .
The recent inhabitants of villages protested on a construction site before the company office .
According to the police , the people of the villages were lecturing police officers to be stoned , and the latter responded to warning bells .
However , according to local reports , mobile British people ( the Iranian military police ) started to shoot at the people , killing one person .
&quot; We were big panic , we are afraid of revenge , &quot; said Windows 29 years of Domingda Badii , who lives near the hospital and saw injured insects .
&quot; I have beaten myself in my house for two days . &quot;
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the police &apos;s mobile hybrid from the area .
Paniai has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
The lack of meaningful development is feeding the dissatisfaction of the meals , moni , dans and dammal tribes living in the central memory of Papua haljendaeva .
Many of them have joined the People &apos;s army of Perbels of the Free Movement ( VPL ) , which , according to its own , protects the rights of painants by orally carrying out attacks and kidnappings among Iranian soldiers .
Some of the VPL &apos;s leadership comes from Panian , including Tadius Yog and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
In response to this , over the last few years , under the pretext of defending national sovereignty , the army has arrested in Paniai and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
Some of them will never again appear .
Among the people of Papua Islands , Panians are known as &apos; tragic forgotten place &apos; .
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction .
The little rice that is sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
Cheap is the same unattainable .
People grow all their food themselves , mainly from Bahrain , with a little more fruit and vegetables .
Farming is the work of women , each of whom can care for four or five ruins .
They usually keep most of the receipt of the family ; the rest is sold on the local market .
Ten Bahá &apos;s pay only 10 000 Indonesian premises ( 75 cents ) .
Over time , economic inequalities have intensified between heavy boats and new migrants who have arrived in a row since the opening of new routes at Nabire airport .
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
The speculators themselves often do not have the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&quot; Young people are not interested in leaving the village because there is neither jobs nor money , &quot; says John Gobai , President of the Paniai tribal Council .
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world out of the Pope .
Furthermore , there will be severe restrictions on foreign media .
French journalists Franck Escudie and Babridge Longchamp were expelled earlier this year because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , even though they had been given a rare film permit .
According to the Vice @-@ President of the Human Rights Watch Asian department , Pichm Kine , the election pledges made by Jokow have not been implemented to lift the restrictions on reports aimed at promoting transparency and development .
&quot; Journalists attempting to report from the most troubled provinces in Papua ang and Western Pope in Indonesia face new threats to the rejection and blacklist of Madagascar , &quot; said in his statement .
The lack of a satellite view of the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to its immediate neighbours .
In March , six Pacific countries , Bahrain , Nauru , Belau , Tupain , Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands , urged the United Nations Human Rights Council to examine &apos; various large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in Pole , including the shooting of Paniai .
The same countries have historically supported VPL .
Arrmanatha Nasir heitis the charges for a group at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , saying to the press : &apos; There is still a democratic regime and freedom of the press in Indonesia so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bury &apos; .
The local people want more foreign governments to heed .
When the Dutch official delegation visited Jayapurat , the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , Kees , on 4 May , the local people intercepted the meeting but wanted to be anonymous , according to the source , to remain silent , urging that &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
In Indonesia , there will be a new presidential election in 2019 , but the tanks do not believe they will vote again in favour of Jokow .
&quot; Jokow is a man with good intentions , but surrounded by people involved in shooting Paniai , &quot; says Hbai , President of the Council of the tribes .
He wants to give Jokow the impression that , in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai live under the threat posed by the army , they are suffering from poor education and health services .
According to Gobai , the people of Paniai , like other boats , regard their votes to Jokow as the debt that they have to pay .
&quot; They do not need money , they want justice , &quot; he says .
Despite threats and intimidation , the families of the victims of the fire in Paniai were able to cope with yet another symbolic objection to Madagascar , which swept one victim &apos;s body into a police station and the military case in response to the country in question .
Knowing that justice can never be put on its feet , they at least do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; One of our family members was killed , &quot; says Yacobus with a shot .
&quot; What else can we do ? &quot;
Negover of Dubai Torch &apos;s pilots had to come under his hand for the second time .
On Friday , hundreds of people had to flee this 337 metre of buildings and 79 crafty buildings in the world .
This is the second fire , which has been ravaged for just two years from the high level that is called the Turin case , or the Thimvikur .
The building was evacuated , none of the injuries were reported and there were any direct causes of fire .
&quot; We sleep and wake up to the fires and the people &apos;s fears .
We would wait for the tour and we had about 10 minutes to fall to the 50 order , &apos; said to the Reuterans one of the people who called themselves George .
According to Dubai &apos;s civil protection officers , fire fighters also deleted at around 4 o &apos;clock in the morning at local intervals ( 00.00 GMT ) and seized the building .
The government said that it was working to provide the victims with shelter .
This incident can once again raise questions about the safety of high @-@ level materials on foreign soil around the world .
The investigation carried out by the Turin Management Board after the fire in 2015 found that the most damage was suffered by cutting @-@ edge panels and insulation - decriminatory panels and insulation of foreign space .
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenportfolio Tower and the embassies could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that took place there in June , which killed almost 80 people .
See : These phones are likely to receive sales cards in the autumn
In theory and coal , it is time for televisions , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
In the spring , Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia Premium came to sale , and new hitt telephones are expected for poelers in the autumn .
According to the Tele2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Semother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by an innovative design , an eye @-@ shandner , serser @-@ servani 4K resolution , a screen and a fast process .
Samsung Galaxy S8 , which has also reached the top of Estonia &apos;s smartphones &apos; sales table , gave high visibility in the world of technology .
In the autumn , smart aircraft will allow even more haste , more resistance , more quality camera and more water and more pollination .
He added that , on the basis of rumours , you can already speculate and predict four top @-@ level models , which are likely to conquer today &apos;s sales tables .
These four smart phone top @-@ level models will reach poashers in the autumn of this year .
The lonamed iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach boys by mid @-@ September .
However , the rumours which the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are spreading a lot .
If iPhone 7 did not give rise to significant differences between iPhone 6s , Apple &apos;s 10th birthday is expected to fully identify the new model with previous ones .
There has been talk of four colours : Black , White , Swedish cup and croreom .
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers all the telephone front , has been lost , and the fingerprints have been built into the screen .
Apple &apos;s design director JonyIve demands that the new iPhone model look like a glass .
There has also been talk of an iPhone version .
In addition to the head @-@ up , the unmanageable charging and the even higher quality camera , we can expect a faster A11 process .
This is certainly one of the most expected smart phones in the year .
The outsourcing of the new model Galaxy hood 8 will begin on 23 August .
Although there have been many rumours of what new Galaxy Plan 8 will look like .
Admittedly , even more business users are meant , and S pen allows even greater functionalities .
The telephone fund should have two cameras , one of which is a lainurt and one with a narrow view to teleobjects .
Nobody yet knows what the two rebells are capable of , but in any case it is the first test of Samsung , which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8 for quality .
However , we are looking forward to 23 August .
Although Nokia has sold sales this year with three smart phones headed by Nokia 6 , their flagship vessel , Nokia 8 , which is already being presented on 16 August , is still missing .
We are waiting for a screen stretching from 5.3 to the bottom of the barrage and an extraordinarily fast Qualcomm Sscarce dragon 835 processes and more durable agitation .
Nokia also talks about aluminium corps and about significant levels of water and customs security IP68 .
Like Samsungone , Nokia &apos;s new model has two stunning camera , an optimist produced by Zeiss .
Once the Sony firm flagship has been XZ Premium so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future there will be at least two smart phones with even more innovative functionalities .
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than XZ Premium , but at least as good or better .
For the new Sony model , it has been speculated that this screen is at least hot .
What the reality is , we can already see right now , because traditionally , Sony has unveiled its autumn flag vessel at the International Technology Forum IFA , which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year .
According to transcripts leaked by telephone calls , Trump of Mexico pressed for payment of the border wall
The Washington post unveiled telephone calls between US President Donald Trumpi and Mexican and Australian heads of state .
On 27 January , Enrique Pena Nietole , the Mexican President , went to the Trump telephone call for the latter to stop public proclaiming that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
The American President warned him about his public condemnation of the wall , saying : &apos; You must not say this to the press &apos; .
The Trump set out his presidential campaign &apos;s promise to build a long wall and age on the southern border of the United States that Mexico would pay for this project .
The transcriptors were also published in his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turmes , which reveals a tense debate .
The Trump said to Turunele that the agreement whereby the United States takes on refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; nervous &apos; and &apos; rum &apos; . He stated that the agreement that was made during the Obama Administration would give him the impression &apos; guide &apos; , because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
The Trump ended the speech by telling the Turunele that &apos; this was the day &apos;s most unpleasant speech &apos; .
The national court did not take a complaint against the city of OC MRP Liine in the event that the city of Tartu rejected their offer for bus and coach transport between July 2019 and 2029 .
This is a letter rejecting the supply of OC MRP to Tartu buses and buses , as the offer did not meet the requirements , Anneli Aputin , President of the Tartu City Service , explained .
This is the procurement of public transport within the Tartu city for the period 01.07.2019 @-@ 30.06.2029 .
MRP city Liine referred to the Supreme Court of Justice to the decision of the District Court .
The national court did not act .
Although many people in the social media complain that their night is disturbed by the cut off from the Weekise festival , and the entire city is full of drink @-@ driving officers , there are also many who do not have any negative words to say about a permanent festival .
I am even positively surprised that the brakes were so polite in the shop .
I did not see any disapproval or courtesy .
Even so , I saw &apos; , a wonderful wave .
&quot; It is nice that the winds , the winds are , and the joy of the Persian , which has been left like winter , is attached with pleasure . &quot;
A wave of flames is not destroyed by the Ranny monster .
If , when living in the city of the centre , he was still hearing that music is being played on a beach , then the music has not yet arrived at his home ethos .
&quot; But I hope I hear , &quot; he says goodbye .
The Agnes , who talked with a fire , also says that the Grand Festival is rather good for the Perter - it is a great contribution to the turnover of local merchants .
He also welcomes the fact that so many houses have come to the visitors &apos; capital in the summer .
The woman of Peollian melu does not .
Although I am no longer on the coast , it is nice that rand has revived .
And it is good that the people are moving , and this has been the case three times &apos; , the woman says .
I think it was a little worse for the first time .
Then perhaps there were complaints , he is wondering .
However , what he said is that what is happening on the ground is normal for the capital cities in the summer .
&quot; This Weekise is a very good prophmo for our small city , &quot; says Harri , who is on the park .
Life and möll have not put his life into the möll .
But for it ?
We should all pull together .
Think about how it would be better to communicate between nations .
After all , the music man is not wearing .
This does not happen , although I live near it .
&quot; Good people can save and have nothing to do , &quot; he says .
Visitors coming to the Persian Republic are , according to him , courtesy .
&apos;With the bottles , of course , they have joined a little , but young people are young people and heroes God - give you a hand , but be people and we can do it &apos; .
Painful residents have travelled to somewhere by then , whether to relatives or to acquaintances .
&quot; However , overall , the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this medal , talking to the University with the children of Persian .
His family &apos;s Festival , too , does not disturb , even though last year it went even further than it was today .
Last summer , the ground was the second one , we heard more .
We live outside the city that , in fact , it goes a long way to the River Persian , &apos; he talks .
Pearson cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revive business
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that he will cut 3 000 more jobs and reduce his interim dividend by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with business @-@ threatening distress .
These jobs , which , according to John Fallon , are likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , will be accompanied by the loss of 4 000 posts during the previous restructuring .
Pearson announced in May his plan to cut expenditure by another GBP 300 million ( USD 394 million ) under the third expenditure reduction programme in order to try to revive a business that has been hit by the transition to high @-@ speed digital learning .
A company that agreed to sell last month a company in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann said that their expectation for a year had not changed since the sales income increase was announced to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
On Sunday , the rainforest continues som .
In Estonia , on Sunday , the rainfall comes from the sun with the rainforest , and the wind outbreaks are sometimes very strong .
The Ecolabel comes out of the explanations in Estonia .

Caption in Kabul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
The suicide bomber , according to officials , attacked military convoys in the capital of Afghanistan , Kabul , killing one NATO soldier and wounding several other .
In NATO &apos;s statement , five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
Despite local reports , three civilians were killed in an incident in the city of Qarabaghi .
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herati mosque attack on Tuesday .
On Monday , two people were killed by suicide bombers in Kabul near the Iraqi Embassy .
NATO &apos;s statement said that an explosion took place on Thursday evening when the Afghan army of Joint patrol was attacked by &apos; man @-@ made explosives &apos; .
The statement states that everything has been injured in a stable state and is treated on the US military hospital Bagram flight .
According to the Correspondents , the Taliban and group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( in Chad ) , are a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabagh , NATO , Baghdad .
According to UN data , in the first half of 2017 , at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan , about 20 % of them in the capital city .
At the end of July , the car bomb in Kabul was killed mainly by at least 30 people in the Shi &apos;être .
According to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
On 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the central city - the most deadly military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
This violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country and the police .
According to the Correspondents , the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf .
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the regulation after sharks
The United States Environment Protection Agency ( United Nations Environmental Protection Agency alis EPA ) annulled the decision to delay the adoption of the Obama regulation , which obliges states to limit emissions from flying , one day after 15 states referred the Agency to the courts for its conduct .
The EPA announced a decision to proceed late on Wednesday 2015 , saying that it demonstrates the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; We believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our national partners and listen to them , &quot; said the President of the EPA in his statement , Scott Pruitt .
The Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the rates of ostility content in Peru , which measure pollution in the various parts of the country , in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year on to arrival in 2050 , to the highest air quality standard .
15 mainly democratic states , together with the Colombian community , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President Donald Trumpi &apos;s government has tried to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to Mr Trumpi , is part of a broader agenda for growth .
However , these efforts have led to reactions among the groups of democrats and nature conservation who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
The EPA website states that the breathing of ozone @-@ containing air &apos; could reduce the ability of Copts to work and increase the risk of dying in respiratory diseases , such as asthma .
German cigarettes may have pipes .
German pigs and cattle can come to pipes because heavy rain threatens the yields of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union , Banimal berg writes .
This year , it can be said that centuries of saturation before harvest may mean that fruit intended for bread production can only be fed into animals .
&quot; The quality of content is far worse than the price of the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; the analysis of Agravis Raiffeen , Mr Bernhard Medicines , said .
This year , up to 40 % of German nicotine can go to animal feed , which is from feed to the usual one , in Agratis .
German farmers , like their European counterparts , have been exposed to any weather this year .
First of all , the winter was too dry .
Then came the cold spring , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
In July , Germany was hit by the German drama , which has continued in August .
Many eyes have been placed on northern Germany , where the rain hints on harvesting .
So far , only five per cent of nicotine has been repeated .
Most of the regions have not yet recovered , notified the local buyer of catches in Ceravis .
&apos;There are quite difficult days &apos; , Mr Frank Deckert Rendsburg , senior traders in Ceravis , said .
Consistency in everything , that is , the rock of the internal design of Finns
Nature plays a part in the internight of mesh homes because , through big windows , Saimaa &apos;s finite views reach many ( life ) rooms .
Every step will be marked by our attempts by our northern neighbours to create both shellfish and perfect ( energy @-@ saving ) homes .
Deforestation , and also compliance , are worthy of the wood use of Finns in the production , furniture and beauty materials .
Virgised techniques and smart solutions are found in mesh houses both as a builder and ( home ) architects .
It highlights that black , white and grey collections , if supplemented by wood rapes and carature plants , can be very disturbing .
Good ideas will be available for a week to come , because the air will run until 13 August .
Tarvians and spices suggest that this kitchen is often copied .
The Ööl adopted today &apos;s line on Weekise Festival Balticen , and Martin Garrido did all he can to remember the last speaker .
The people were truly revolving at the time of Mr Simpson &apos;s speech - songs , hubs , tanks were stunned .
When lunch stopped , a common mastery of the Spanish city was dispersed .
We will bring together the photographers that attempted our photographs for three days in the space of Weekise .
You are certainly also in your search for yourselves .
Müry Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
Mr Vasyl Lomachenko and Mr Garcia , who should be on a collision course to face up to 66.7 kg of boxing in the most attractive shop in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
They were in the ESPN office in LOS Angeleles , until Garcia , the unwinning World Boavian Council lightweight champion , walked off the other side of the corridor in order to welcome Lomachenkot , World Boеzationi sulgweight cheque .
Following a unanimous decision by Garcia , the victory achieved by the former four @-@ time world champion , Adrien Broner , on Saturday in Showerial , both combatants belong to the top of the ranking .
Garcia extended its hand better and said : &apos; How will the summer go , the champion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
Lomachenko is defending his belts against Miguel Marriga on Saturday evening at 19 ESPN .
When a couple of photos appeared , the leader of Lomachenko &apos;s memory , Eg Klimas , stated that there would be a &apos; perfect yardstick &apos; to possible confrontation between the fighters .
&quot; I am former chaotic , &quot; said Garcia .
&quot; I called on Bronger &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 63.5 kg .
I want to move downwards .
And he has to move up to half the easy weight &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
The Fans have asked for this .
Let us help them then . &quot;
Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; The world needs this fight . &quot;
In the climate , the question raised was whether it should be worthwhile looking at it , which is part of his strategy of allowing Lomachenkol to debate at the end of this year at 61.2 kg of class in order to make it possible for the meeting with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 novans ) , which is also interested in fighting Jorge Linarese Linarese and Luke Campbelli &apos;s match match winners after the easy title of 23 September .
&quot; Looking at this fight could be worthwhile , because fans have asked for this opposition , &quot; said Garcia , later , that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial packages .
&quot; We are key players .
No other name can get so much attention .
Whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Garcia said that she considers Lomachenkot a &apos; armed fighter &apos; and could go to his Saturday &apos;s match .
However , Lomachenko was modest in praising Mrs Garcia , saying that she felt that the three divisjon champions from Riverge were &apos; very slow ; sorry , Mseley ... you wanted it nodistant &apos; .
According to Garcia , the aim was to show the strength of the blows and then to boy .
Both have confirmed that they feel that the tension to try to reach them is increasing .
&quot; This is a fight that awaits realisation .
No other confrontation arouses so much attention and slander .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Garcia .
Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters , and Maey is precisely that .
This will be a good fight . &quot;
What world pressures are being moved from to Estonia ?
The soil was extended and issued by the police and border control authorities ( PPA ) record more than 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work , study or family .
When , for example , soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit for 6702 foreigners , Madagascar &apos;s number was 4928 .
The services cannot tell us how many migrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia , but such an analysis will be prepared by the Ministry of the Interior .
While nearly 500 Ukrainians were home to Estonia 10 years ago , in recent years this figure will reach 2 000 close .
The number of applicants for renewal rose dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis , with 1087 people receiving fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , up from 675 in the previous year .
In Estonia , the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing most , with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia in excess of their generosity .
&quot; The Ukrainian community has always been big in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that employment and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already in front of the family , said Kristin Ramallah , the spokesman at the Ministry of the Interior .
Soil and Kabila had the number of Ukrainian people who had fixed @-@ term residence permits even higher than that of Russian citizens , even though in ten years the longest @-@ term residence permits have been issued to the latter .
When Ukrainians come to work mostly here , Russian citizens for family migration .
&quot; Given the historic Russian community here , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said Helina Mea , an internal protection agency .
&apos;When you look at where the citizens of Russia who have been admitted to live , Harjumaa is now Eastern Virgland &apos; , he added and pointed out that about 40 % of them have been married with the citizens of the European Union .
Soil was granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
At the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permits decreased .
&quot; Compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending residence permits , a new residence permit has been requested for permanent entry into Estonia , &quot; the journalist &apos;s spokesperson at the Ministry of the Interior , Mr Ramallah , explained that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonian residence permits has remained rather stable for years .
A new residence permit for Estonia to reside permanently will allow foreigners who have lived here to apply for at least three years from the previous year .
Its aim is to encourage the reticence of people who have been adapted .
However , a long @-@ term resident &apos;s residence permit requires five years , for example .
The extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased because of the new residence permit .
For example , soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years .
The Ukrainians will now be able to exchange their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be able to point the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
This residence permit became popular - applications were still made by holders of a grey passport ( 1029 ) , Russians ( 487 ) , Indians ( 54 ) and nigerans ( 36 ) .
A total of 1968 people were able to live in Estonia for entry , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese .
With the first half of this year , the total number of such applications is already 1269 .
In 10 years , surprisingly Nigeria has become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residency .
When three residence permits were issued to Finns in 2007 , soil was 200 .
Nigeria comes to learn from this university .
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular , for example , among Georgians , the Chinese and the Turks .
The number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen mostly thanks to learning games .
They , too , have the rule that where the community has been set up , there will be more easily others , &quot; added Ramallah .
Over ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , just as much from Laos and Madagascar .
Ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four Uruguay .
If around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , this is about 0.46 % of the total population .
Even if we look at the citizens of the European Union , migration will remain around a percentage , &quot; the mafia commented that the figures are actually small .
A total of 14 822 people died in Estonia , according to data from the statistical office , 13 792 .
This means that immigration transcends migration for a second year .
Most extraditions and movements are Estonian citizens , but more of them are among those who leave them .
Therefore , Estonia &apos;s citizens &apos; migration secret with 2 000 people was in decline .
The Estonians are particularly travelling between Finland and Estonia .
Mlong Couture Princssimde with sats , weeds and tarrogance
However , in the northern wave of ideas , there is a history for Mrs Tammeoru - old paints and defendants : &apos; I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire the thieves and crats of the old era .
If you do something with a piece of stone , you will study and learn from it every day .
This is a pleasure in finding out .
A modern world of MMMouture Couture may seem like some alien , but the designer does not think so .
You yourselves decide how much soul your life !
As a friend , I have a whole sail full of the wounds I have created , couture .
Because it is not , nor is it his fault , that he is not living in Hollywoos and does not go on a red whim every day ; he wants to wear the most beautiful brokers and it is suffering !
You can live your own special life !
The Moeira does not recognise the gap between the shining events and the grey day .
It was this reasoning that put forward a plan to move higher in Estonia into rural areas , between forests and fields , between people who often do not reach them .
For example , a joint collegiate was presented a long time ago , comparisons , Jatis and Perlo moealleel , where 45 mosques were wearing the Queen &apos;s entire street .
There is often a hang in the city of Tallinn , with dignity , but there is more emotion elsewhere - slogans , bbavo , stand up , you want to be thanked .
A large proportion of the audience was just news , but now they are the fans of Mammu Couture .
If you overshoot people &apos;s expectations , they are spirited !
And I like the feeling that I am with my motive like the summer .
Pernus had a 50 @-@ metre red carpet , a whole street full of stickers , it seemed they would not come to an end .
Mrs Maria also does not recognise the motive that nature must be presented by a superimperialist superb , she will be happy to bring ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always come with pleasure .
After all , this is a lax of experience , a wonderful piece of shod in the Gulf .
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own play , and I am always behind the ground to give the unhopeless mercy of things .
My nervous would not allow a calm watch on the floor .
Mrs Maria Maria is this kind of moelogy , who wants not only to play a representative role , but also to be involved in everything .
I have my sister in the core , most of the collections are carried out by myself .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to discover .
I am never far from my nature and I am not afraid of work .
It is not limited , but it is also a matter of injection , logistics , organisation , organisation - everything has to jump off the days of a woman of one temperment .
The fanatics still have a huge amount of work to do .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a happy day !
I am still very lucky - it is like an unstoppable joke : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compliments .
It has been said several times that my brokers have a land grace - they make themselves feel like a printing tag .
The guerrilous , ultrullibery lines that Maria talent made known overnight are long overdue signals from Couture to date .
Martin Myrsep U18 boys : The army of the Estonians was now turned against us .
The damage , the fairy tale , ran out .
The first thing came to an end was that we were not able to get our tables on the table .
And when so much difference comes in the table , there is nothing to do , &quot; said Estonia U18 corvpallipos 61 : 75 drop @-@ out to Britain , our only Korvpalte , BC Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsep .
Opponents took 28 requests from the south @-@ west and were so much more attacks as a result .
We were also not prepared to protect them aggressively and not to attack them , which created it .
Many of the attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
In defence , however , they were able to keep their hands between them everywhere , we could not combine .
It created the team from its feet .
The work of the opponents was better done .
According to Myrsepa , Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to withdraw the anti @-@ missile fire .
The last quarter had a mistake - we had a zero error , but opponents have already received a number of quick flames .
Atlessness and a heavy offensive , which was our weapon on the alagropiturnir , all now turned against us .
Today we did not have the power against their aggressiveness .
The finger remained stuck with its negligent Kalevis , Matthias Tass .
Security in general can say good words about the whole team ; to date , there was a united shock .
It is a pity that this aggressive response had not been met before .
Tass have always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but he seemed to have been tired - he has borne a huge burden .
But he made some very nice gestures , which I have seen before in trenches , adding a guide .
Horrendous figures : In the EM @-@ turnir concentration , EM @-@ turnir threw three less than 10 points with a quarter ...
The U18 age class does not only apply to the young men em B @-@ divisjon corvpallitinir in Tallinn , she started in Dublin the day after yesterday .
And Estonia &apos;s game with Poland was , unfortunately , drifted into the area of anti @-@ queues .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but even after the third quarter , the situation was 9 : 49 , or only in the last 10 minutes , opponents took their feet from the gas beet and 16 were left : 16 .
In both the first and the second quarter , Estonia dumped 4 , the third point ...
At the same time , in the first two minutes , the Estonians caught two pieces of four minutes , but they played out 25 pieces , then one yellow , and then another 21 queues ...
Perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 fingers were left one .
In addition , 2 points came from four open roofs .
The losses were a reasonable figure of this time , 12 .
At the end of the game , Poland &apos;s surface hit 33 % and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , with 83 out of 56 improvements in Portugal on the opening day .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement supplies
Today , NATO arrived at a permanent &quot; no @-@ fly &quot; group for a weekend in Tallinn to complement vessels &apos; stocks and prepare for prospective practices .
In the course of the visit , ships are preparing for landing on the sea , thereby giving crews the opportunity for a paarial holiday .
Following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonia &apos;s waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations to search historic explosive remnants .
&quot; The participation of indigenous people in the NATO unit and the coding they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the alliances , &quot; said the chief captain Arto Reinland , the overseas fleet Commander .
As of 29 June , NATO will chair the Latvian Navy Captain Captain , Gvido Laudups , a permanent &quot; no @-@ fly group &quot; group , which took over the task of a group of Task Force officers from Estonia , Johan @-@ Elias Seljab , at a ceremony in Riga .
The group &apos;s flagship vessel is LVNS Virsaitis , a Latvian naval force which also has a group leader .
This semester , the Estonian Navy Museum Museum is also a member of the International unit .
As one of the four submissions of NATO naval management groups , NATO is the first permanent group of low @-@ speed actors to be sent to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - To 13 August , the Pirita kooter &apos;s refreshments will once again become a place where Burma , called Birgitta Festival by Maestro Er Kans , will be held down 13 years ago .
This year , Mrs Festival , the city of Tallinn , the artistic leader of the philosopharonia , Mr Jootis ( 36 ) , will be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented .
&apos;Traviita &apos; and Tosca , balletilalagic answers from Bolerost , Karlssonin , and nor is there a lack of own production of the scheme , this time Joseph Haydni &apos;s wonderful oradage , by the same international team of creators who brought him to the Piriladen Hague in 2015 .
Birgitta Festival has much more than just concerts and theatre replies .
This is higher than any music theatre in its usual form .
It is a festival that takes power and never gets rid of .
Because the experience that the listener receives in this superior and salvable environment puts humanity brighter and concerns human beings in a way that cannot be described .
To the risk , Burma is the first year leader of Festival art .
Did the Maestro Eri Klaskins not feel a little big ?
Of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been helpful .
He went through me all my student career and also supported the restoration at the start of his diaphrase career .
Perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work .
A team of Birgitta Festival has had so much prosperity in different Klas and , of course , all of this goes to me .
It was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going to go .
It was the great heart of Eri Klasts who gave me the power to move ahead very well with Mrs Festival in Tallinn .
And here I am , and I can , !
What could be pumped into the public at today &apos;s festival , what are you offering in particular ?
We have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , surprisingly , we have the first ballery written on the speech by Mrs Lindgreni , among other things .
This is &apos; Karlsson lb &apos; .
And one notorious nuance in this regard is that the author of this ballel is the Latvian composer , Juris Karlinning , who himself expressed a wish to write it .
Apparently she has already been living in the breath of Karlsson .
To the risk , how are you all timid ?
My life @-@ sponsored compass is certainly thanks .
Such work requires a system of support and a lot of love , and I am luckily cured of it .
And I have noticed that my personal emotion does not depend so much on other people as I myself , in other words , how I oppose every new day .
And this awareness of keeping the tone , maintaining the positive and , in fact , smiling ourselves into the mirror of the morning rose by a significant percentage of my joy .
Especially now this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen on this and it is working .
To laugh itself is hurting the brain and raising the tone .
That is simply not a word .
I think that people do not yet know half the things of their own body , which the universe offers them , but it is gradually accepted by everyone .
Now , this is an important moment .
Is there a ritual before the dirigend was taken ?
There is still a need to replace clothing with more comfort .
This is a small moment for ourselves .
But , generally speaking , I do not have the opportunity to pump or make a little cool before I have a great deal of speaking .
In fact , I even like to talk to people actively , even before they take dirigendium .
But come all to Birgitta Festival , what is also to be detected here , not least for a big manager and a ballet friend .
See a stark video with the risk of Joostiga !
New results of tests for assessing the age of Swedish asylum seekers were published
In Sweden , the latest results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the houses were assessed as older than 18 , but not all believe in the accuracy of the results .
The Swedish National Institute for medicine ( Rasyts129 inalvert ) started the tests later this year .
The tests were set up to assess the age more accurately during the application of the asthma , after criticism of the Swedish Authority for Migration ( IPPC ) for failing to correctly appoint a number of allegedly juvenile refugees .
From March 2017 until 31 July 2017 , Migration has sent 680 cases of testing , and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 24 81 tests .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) was assessed for 18 years old or 25 more cases , and the Institute for Legal medicine estimated that the &apos; testing may be 18 years old &apos; .
In 432 cases , it came to the conclusion that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
The tests will only be used if the age of the person is questioned .
According to Johan Göransson , who works in the Institute of Justice , the results are consistent compared with those of previous months .
&quot; We do not see a big difference compared to the statistics of previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &quot; he said to the newspaper The Local .
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed on average than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been elected for their age .
In May , the EIT issued the results of the 581 test and said that in 442 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person examining is 18 years old or older &apos; .
However , when the newspaper Svensson ska Dagblad investigated the results of their 581 test , it became clear that , in 243 cases , the person had stated directly that he would receive 18 this year .
This medical age assessment method , whereby fabull @-@ toothmeted röntgeniid images and exotic MRT are carried out , after which dental doctors and radiologists are allowed to analyse them , has been criticised in some circles .
One of the sceptics is the endokrinology of the Karolinska Institute , Claude Marcus , whose task is to assess people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through the audience sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the method of measurements currently being used should be used .
The designation of biological age in this way is very precarious .
If we cannot say it firmly , we should not pretend that we get , &apos; said to the newspaper , he said forestry .
But Johan Göransson of the Institutional Institute for medicine defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; In general , it can be said that the risk of pumping the baby inadequately into adulthood is low .
Perhaps the biggest risk , at around 10 % , is if you are in a little under 18 . &quot;
9 sign that you could forgive you for more expensive .
You were more expensive on Friday and spent a night with someone else .
It is painful because you have so many nice times and memories together .
I would like to reassure him , but is it time ...
Your Tango lists nine signs which show that the cost of your action is twofold and could be forgiven .
It seems more expensive to understand the seriousness of the situation and to work hard to resolve it .
Your more expensive deal deals with the problem of bringing him into the bed with another compass .
Pay is no longer a more expensive defensive position .
It sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for its actions .
He is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
He agrees that he has made a serious mistake and is sincerely trying to improve the situation .
He is attentive and he is trying to communicate with you in a pleasant way .
At the same time , without pressure , you are rushing to get over the matter .
They are not denying what has happened , nor are they trying to make it unnoticed .
It is more expensive for you and for you to understand why intransigence arose .
You talk about this , and also about how to avoid it in the future .
You need to communicate better and assess each other &apos;s needs .
Your more expensive attitude and action have helped you to develop our condolences against his miscarriage .
Your more expensive commitment and behaviour have created the basis for your proximity to return .
As a couple of you have made progress to believe again in your unity and relationship .
The 20 @-@ year @-@ old newer , Anna Maria Orel , made a beautiful debate in London , receiving 67.37 places of good 18 seats .
After that , MM noorim was a female jungle and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for medals in the future .
The contest went well and gained a good experience .
With the first test ( 64.80 ) , I immediately took away my average result , the second ( 62.80 ) risk too much and the third one ( 67.37 ) I was able to keep it very clear . &quot;
I had hoped for my emissions , and I am very pleased that I found it .
Ms Anna Maria Oreli MM &apos;s debate ended in a good 18th place .
Vihmasadu Orelit did not mix , as he is , after all , training him through the TEC stage .
&apos;I am afraid &apos; , he said a little bit more .
The London Olympic Assembly had almost a full house of the people , did the people , or were they able to turn themselves off ?
I came to Tajani , but in a positive sense .
Everyone says that this will add - that is the case .
If you compete on your own , you can experience it .
He then confirmed that he will be satisfied with the MM debate and he is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 32nd outcome of this season , in other words the last one , ended in 18 places .
This is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and More - that is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of the medals .
Western Virgina kuberner announced party change
The Western Virginia Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President Trumpa , that he would change political parties .
&apos;Whoe it or not , but the democrats walked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; Today I say to you , having pushed a lot and thought for it ... today , I say to you , the Western peaches , that I can no longer help you as a democratic Governor . &quot;
Explanations of joy were grubbed in the mixing .
&apos;Thereafter , I will be a Republican , &apos; added Justice .
&quot; As a engineers , I would say to you that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
The Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Virginia .
Trucher won 42 points in Western Virginia and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats , Hillary Clinton .
Justice , which , according to Forterai , is the only billion star of state , proved to have been elected in 2016 .
In the Alpine , it notes that it has coal mines in five states and that coal business is completely out of its own .
Its value is approximately USD 1.59 billion .
At the same time , on Thursday night , the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) published a declaration that &apos; the party exchange of Governor Justice is yet another blow to the democratic party park , which would rather prevent the country from being improved again rather than working for it &apos; .
&apos;Over 15 months of enquiry and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent wake @-@ up to parks that are out of the beginning and cannot find a positive and united message , &apos; said RNC representation , Ronna McDaniel CS Newsi .
It is hardly surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
Urmet , who is in office at the Weekise medical axis , told the girl yesterday that posters had had to be distributed quite a lot .
Grandes and marbles are fundamental , excuses and easy failures .
Of course , the main , left and foot @-@ and @-@ mouth .
According to Urmeti , visitors come to the festival with false footwear , and so there will be problems .
The media have also had to help those who visited a few major injuries - there have been some scaremongering practices , and there have been also one footballs .
We have also made slogans when a person has put his hand or the finger at us .
We are doing less rubbish here , we are sending more to hospital .
See the videos as to whether the brakes on the media for the treatment of potaclone would also ask the painkiller .
Coe praised the Russians for their fair apologies for the Dingushall .
The international rallied Sebastian Coe , who said , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apology from Thursday &apos; for the horror of doping , was praised , but repeated that now is not the time to allow the country to return to sport .
The Russian stranglehold ron Dmitry Shycehtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup that the competition ban imposed on his country is the right one and has a firm aim to fight doping .
He apologised for &apos; all the lighter turnout from the golden and silver medals in competitions &apos; .
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on competition in force , which was introduced in November 2015 , after the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) report found evidence of state @-@ sponsored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think today it was a very honest response , a very honest presentation , saying to the press the President of IAAF , Mr Costa .
&quot; The entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognised that they had had had quite difficult times and that they would do their utmost to reform the alunion . &quot;
According to Coe , he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own restoration .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the proposal of the working group that now is not the time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; We must do everything possible over the next few months to normalise the situation .
We are always guided by the principle that we want to separate clean sportsmen and sportspeople from the system that was breached , &quot; he added .
One of the hundreds of Russian lighters who meet the strict criteria of IAAF are competing with the lighter entry into force in London on Friday as neutral athletes in the World Cup .
The head of the IAAF working group , Rune Andersson , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet several rehabilitation criteria .
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that lecturers who have been banned are still operating freely .
The electric car revolution significantly changes the demand for metals .
Who are the winners and losers ?
The fact that the electric car revolution significantly changes everything from the fuel market to infrastructure is also creating new winners and losers in the metal market .
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that they win from one place to another , smaller mining firms do not help .
Glencore coal and oil currently serve , but in the era of electric cars , the demand for cobalt , lithium , copper , aluminium and nickel will increase .
This year , governments in the United Kingdom , France and Norway have increased their contributions to the spread of electric cars , which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades .
Therefore , Volvo has already knew that he is planning to give up an internal combustion engine , and Tesla will bring to the market a cheaper blue 3 electric car .
Banimal berg &apos;s New Energy Finance Facility estimates that , for two decades now , electric cars will be sold more than those using oil @-@ fired fuels .
&quot; For some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Simona Gambranin Boob , the raw materials analysis of Capital cracy .
We have already seen a huge impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium , which have been growing demand for years .
Electricity cars have approximately three times more copies than the conventional car , publishing Glencore .
Even more answers are needed at charging stations , which is why Exane BNP Paris estimates that this will increase demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
The increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for lithium , cobalt , graphite and manganans .
Glencore derives from the rising trend in electric cars and the fact that there is the world &apos;s largest cobaltier producer , predicted by Jeffila &apos;s group .
According to this broker company , the winners of the Freexport @-@ McMoRan and First Quanma Minerconventions are other winners of the electric car race .
The market is reacting to a changing trend .
This year , 70 % of the London metal stock exchange line has landed .
The price of the soil was 37 % .
The reply has also dropped by 14 % this year , mainly due to economic growth .
Glencore shares rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price rise to rival Rio Tonipa Group , BHP Billitoni and Anglo Stream .
On the side of the losers , there are lead companies such as Recytechx and Campine , who have to adapt to a new era .
The main end @-@ use of the Prince is the batteries supplying the start @-@ up of cars with a diesel engine .
Electric cars use liitiumines .
&quot; This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael Widmer , Governor of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch metal Market analysis .
There is still no sign of the impact of the split in the form of price movements .
The Plic has reached 17 % this year , with the best methane in London among the main industrial metals .
Investors will see problems for metals in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive , &quot; said Herwig Schmidt , a metal company Triland Metalia .
If lead demand falls , it will be slow .
Perhaps this will happen in about 10 years &apos; time .
Up to now , however , stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which are more frequent dependent on advanced lead @-@ based batteries , will be assessed by the international lead and by the investigative body .
Lagons like aluminium replace steel , as a lighter car can drive less electricity .
This explains an additional 1.6 million tonnes of closed minimum demand between 2013 and 2016 .
This represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s output of aluminium .
This trend is likely to grow , says Widmer .
Aluminium has increased by 13 % this year , as growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market shortages .
Steel manufacturers do not .
He is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful car lights .
ArcelorMittal is also trying to develop a lighter meltdown from steel to oppose the minimum .
&quot; A strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris analysis , Sylvain Brunet .
We see some progress in Europe .
The end of the oil era can also lead to suffering for plaice .
Soil took about half of this precious metal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , and was announced by the metal finer Johnson Matteries .
&quot; Many of the raw materials that are currently demanding , such as oil and plate , may not have a high demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard Dahdah , the Natixan raw materials analyst .
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will change within 15 years .
Plaatinatine producers believe in the continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc Grynberg , leader of Uncore power , said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 .
In the 10 @-@ year perspective , Toyota Motors and Hymuni Motos have been developed on hydrogen @-@ based cars dependent on a poster in order to generate electricity from hydrogen .
Until now , however , this technology has not yet legislated commercially .
&quot; The Diet appears to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris from Brussels .
German car manufacturers received a major setback in July , as the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the cities of Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche .
How the monetary rules for football affect Neyra &apos;s transition to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing the rampant spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neyra from making a record shift from the Spanish football club to the French club Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
Any consequences for UEFA , the governing body , which dominates the European game and which has the power to ban teams from participating in the security of the prestigious League of Meists , are still awaiting Paris Saint @-@ GerMay .
The financial rules for fair play ( FFP ) , introduced by UEFA in 2011 , mean that the PSG must prove at some point that the shift to Neyra was financed without huge losses .
EUR 222 million were paid to Barcelona ( USD 262 million ) for the fact that the Brazilians were able to buy out his contract , and Neyra &apos;s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year .
Here there are some aspects of Neyra &apos;s transfer to the French club .
PSG will undoubtedly be able to extract such money for recruiting Neyra and adding its stars to the cloak , given that the team is funded by a family governed by the Katar energy pipeline .
Clubs have been allowed to spend a great deal on recruiting players , but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that enable them to come up with them in football .
FFFP formed the basis for Michel Platini following his election as UEFA in 2007 .
This former French player believed that clubs , which are falling into debt in search of success , are actually engaged in fraud and risk swamping if the banks or owners were to give up support .
From 2011 , the FFFP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of the debts of clubs .
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 in Chelsea - buying a club with potential and then spending heavily to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement .
During the current three @-@ year evaluation period of FFFP , which runs until 2018 , clubs can bear up to € 30 million in losses .
And despite the rejection of the presidential office by Platini in 2015 , his successor to UEFA , Alexander Ceferin , remains committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; FFFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said last week The negotiator , Andrea Traverso , who is UEFA &apos;s FP Supervisor .
Although the PSG tadus Neyra for the overpurchase clause as one full payment , they will be able to allocate this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the agreement .
Mrs Neymar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , so it will be possible to indicate a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years .
For the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , the PSG , together with Manchester Cityga belonging to Abu Dhabi , received the most severe penalties .
A fine of EUR 60 million was imposed on GPS ( USD 82 million at this point ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million , and a club called for the crew of the League of Meisters to be restricted to 21 players during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of the usual 25 .
UEFA seeks clubs that can try to override financial institutions by exposing their revenues through companies linked to owners of the club .
The Katar company may sponsor the PSG , but if the value of sponsorship is considered to be over @-@ standard market levels , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of Qatar tourism support to the tourist Authority PSG was inextrictable .
It has been said that a certain part of the Kirimari PSG service could come from Qatar through contributions by the Management Committee for the World Cup in 2022 .
However , the PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neyra could become a world championship and say that UEFA regulators would easily be able to quash such a manoeuvre .
The penalties previously imposed on GPS mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition pro @-@ actively with PSG .
They spoke to the press on the condition that their anonymity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PSG .
Latest reports show that the PSG made a profit of more than € 10 million during the 2015 @-@ 2016 season at around € 542.4 million .
Data from the last financial year have not yet been published .
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have a positive impact on sponsorship transactions , trade and snus .
The club expects a minimum of 30 % increase in turnover in relation to the conclusion of the contract .
Spain , too , having clearly upset the departure of one of the biggest football stars , sought to block the move by saying that the PSG is in breach of the FP .
&quot; This is a clear case of &quot; financial doping &quot; with a club and a country , &quot; said President Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS , referring to the fact that the PSG belongs mainly to Katarias .
Arsenal mänejer ArţWenger , whose club belongs to the American sports magnage , shares with La Scotland the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; This is the result of property rights and has changed the whole football landscape completely over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger on Thursday .
&quot; If the club belongs to the state , it will be possible .
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player in the country . &quot;

Today 50 years ago : The Orchopian storm in Estonia , which was knocking on houses and windows .
The orchestra , which was designated as the stormy of the century , raging on 6 and 7 August , caused serious damage , particularly to the West , Harjuria and the Black Sea .
In the north @-@ west of Estonia , during these days , the wind was over 30 m / s .
In my old ametrio in Bavaria , one of the charting trees ran to another and fitted with hands to support them .
Everything was blind and ragne , like the world stage .
Taamal has already withdrawn from houses , in 2002 , the old Mrs Linda Kurova , reminded her of the magazine Estonian nature in this interview .
The wife of Linda was able to see his own planted tour collapsed .
But what kind of support do you still have with your hands , where do you stand up against such a storm ?
The sea came under the window , when it came to water in the windows , &apos; Haapsalus Kalda , who lived on the streets , spoke of Mrs Linda tone .
The fact that the roads were full and that the cabin coverage of the railway station had been flying 20 to 30 metres , Linda most shark stores , just like next morning .
According to the local authorities , the cage behind Paralepa was behind the sun , some were completely lengths , some boys .
Everyone saw it very frustrating , the storm went through the beautiful old trees as radar and pragmatism as a war .
Western Viruland was not particularly severely affected by August 1967 compared to Western Estonia , but the losses were also high there , the Virumaa theatre wrote in 2007 .
The Batsalu Lfossil Park and the Padise Park were wiped out from the ground , but our cabin parks were also severely affected .
In Tallinn , the wind was measured by up to 35 metres per second , or approximately 130 kilometres a hour .
In Tallinn , Meritteal , one of the few lead chambers had swords on the evening of 6.August : &apos; Mother , mother !
The Canaries are in the air and will no longer be signed ! &apos; , wrote Virumaa Official .
The generation building in Viljandiland was destroyed so much during the storm that it was decided to be demolivated later .
The design of the Türi District mountain , which was no longer restored later , was not opposed to August .
On 12 August 1957 , the newspaper Red Turot wrote that the refurbishment of towns and cities and settlements was slow and their vehicles is progressing slowly , and the population could be involved in corps .
Grains were also severely affected in Turin , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party organisations must be both on corps and on fertility corps as an incentive and guidance &apos; .
Orkaans will be able to speak when average wind speeds exceed 32.7 m / s .
The watertight wind in Estonia will remain on 2 November 1959 , when Ruhnul was measured as a speed 48 m / s .
The Vaindstory on the island was broken by a metre , so it was not able to record the strong wind radiation it measured accurately .
Secret of holiday areas : Night coral work and poor coastline
Sameters in the summer will also mean smaller corroments in the beaches of Tallinn .
&quot; If there is no , people are on the ground , and if there are no people , then there will also be no people &apos; , the quarer will be recognised as a beacon .
The city of Northern Tallinn in Stroom &apos;s beaches is being torn up by rocks .
They are offered meoloous competition by a pigic tractor on low turns , which is falling behind the platinist triipe .
In fact , the last seven centimetres of gross rubbish is blowing out seafood and people &apos;s shelved crosses : Bottles , cigarettes and so on .
People are still coming to rank , regardless of whether the water is warm or not .
When it is beautiful , people are on the ground and , if not , there are no people , &apos; the management of the private company hospital hospital as a beacon is said by Alexander Usov .
There are 6.30 p.m. , and there is a bitter corrotation on the coast , because at 8 : 00 a plate must be in order for people .
It is already at four o &apos;clock .
Apart from Stroom , he is still watching on the coast of Pirita , Harta Lake , Kakumäe and Palaraare Pikakari .
The amounts of Prüm have fallen .
Years ago , it was much more .
People are now entitled to assess what is being done for them , &apos; Usov talks about who has corrupted the migrants for 15 years .
It was the case that , when something new had been stood up , it was already over the next day .
Now it is kept to what is on the ground .
Price of clean beach
One of the biggest jobs on the Estonian coast is the repetition of the rubbish , the adru .
For example , in the Pirita coast , it must be transported by 400 000 tonnes of coastline .
&apos;This is an incredible amount &apos; , marks Usov .
Another large category is municipal rubbish , that is , all that people are leaving behind .
There are eight large rubbish lines in Stroom coastal zones at one and a half kilometres , which need to be scrapped three times a week .
So much will come from rubbish .
However , the cold summer days have meant that rubbish is five per cent less than otherwise .
The third species is abandoned .
In most cases , they are children &apos;s TV spots .
This time , the Usov Embassy has pulled out ten metres of sludge from the sand .
They are left to owners to wait for a floating wood route .
&quot; Usually they will be more out of them , but it is normal harvests , &quot; which is already known that he will soon find them again from the sand .
Children come to rank and take toys to reinvent them .
Landfill is broken down
Erika Scholler , a representative of administrative services , has admitted that the work of the tractor is being disrupted by local authorities .
Noise , which lasts from hours to hours , is mixed up by people living in the neighbourhood .
On the day , however , this work is impossible .
In one month , rand will have to travel twice .
&quot; If we do not do so , we will be fined by the city &quot; , Scholler will mark .
However , like Pirita , Pikakka and Savary , the aim is to get Stroom rand below the international flag .
&quot; Compared to Europe , there is much more work in Estonia to care for beaches , &quot; says Scholler .
We have more administer and more stone and it is harder to have a sand war .
But there is less rubbish in our beaches than elsewhere in Europe .
When I hear that there is talk of rubbish , the conversations between the journalist and corrogation staff living near Stroom are taking place inexorably , highlighting current bottlenecks .
There is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
The problem is birds and bottomless slaves who have hijacked rubbish bags , &quot; said Martin .
Although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the city Government will do something with rubbish slogans and , for example , put them on the roofs to prevent at least birds from taking news there .
In general , however , Martin Stroom is satisfied with developments .
We can see that the city takes care of this .
It has become more pleasant with children &apos;s fields , enlightened and newly asphalt roads .
It was once the case that only one way could travel on the runway , &quot; Martin notes .
Stroomis : Coins , only coins
A 40 @-@ year @-@ old Dimitri , who is wearing the coastline with metallic depression , has had to be exploited as a bacterial .
He does not believe that , today and in the future , something is found to be worth .
Sea angles are not good enough to do so .
&quot; I have been dealing with this for one year , and nothing has been done so far , &quot; says Dmitry .
As a refrigeration , in Dmitry , there are some euro coins , bottles and also dangerous pounds that later throw in the dustbin .
Normally , there are still coins .
&quot; Culture , the finger and the rest of this is usually not the case , &quot; they are owned by the armies .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain on the previous level , as unprofitable economic growth and the easing of inflation have cushioned speculation in relation to the increase .
Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain a loophole , as household incomes have put interest rates on standby .
Decision makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MPC ) have voted 6 : 2 in favour of 0.25 % retention and fewer members this month require an increase , as slow growth has weakened support for the upsurge .
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank cut its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
However , the Bank also signalled that the increase in rates is necessary to contain inflation from Brexon over the next few years and that the expected increase in lending costs on the financial markets could be necessary .
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package , which was launched a year ago as a result of Brexti .
The Bank will terminate its fixed @-@ term cash scheme in February , which provides banks with cheap funding , although it said that it is now up to GBP 15 billion more to be offered under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
In the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; The average forecast of MPC will remain gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the near future , since the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
As regards the rates , it was reiterated that , in order to mitigate inflation , a &apos; tightening of the fiscal policy &apos; was necessary , to a somewhat greater extent than expected in the markets .
The Eurostars is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
However , the Bank stressed that any jump is gradual and limited .
The Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecasts in May .
The forecast for growth of 1.8 % in 2018 remained .
After this news , the pound fell in the course of the dollar and the euro .
Women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.31 and 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .
The decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to an increase in expectations concerning the increase in GDP in Cotonou , from 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the second quarter .
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will mobilise a little bit of momentum .
The Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice households with rising inflation and a pitiful wage increase , saying that the situation would go a little worse before improvements were made .
It was added that monetary policy cannot avoid a blow to income in the next few years , but a significant recovery is expected towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
The pound sterling also encourages the economy to increase demand for British produce , partly compensating consumers for lower costs .
The decision will come one year after the rate was reduced by 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the pound .
The Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to completely inject life into prices and into the economy .
Before the Bank &apos;s last decision , there was a feeling of increasing demand for higher levels , as inflation had increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
Inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the Bank &apos;s message was expected and there will be a return in the coming months .
The Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak pound .
Andrew Montlake , head of Coreco mortgage brokers , said : &apos; In the light of the recent downturn in exchange rates , the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again , as borrowers are losing their jobs and hoping to finish the year in a positive way .
The Böge exchange appears to be particularly favourable for those whose current transactions are due to the fact that refinancing , often without service and low rate , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
NHS writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV
Patients have since September had access to &apos; transformative &apos; treatment for HIV prevention after the battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the drug .
NHS England announced that public health will now make it available for an estimated 10 000 people during the initial three @-@ year clinical trial to pre @-@ contact ( PrEP ) - a tablet that is manned before the incident and has shown a reduction of approximately 86 % in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people .
The NHS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported last year &apos;s ruling that the NHS would be able to pay the bill for PrEP , despite its own claims that the drug should be financed by local authorities .
The Executive Director of NHS England , Simon Ste186 , welcomed this on Thursday as a &apos; sweeping new intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NAT ) described it as &apos; momentous moment &apos; .
Sexual health clinics in London , Bright ton , Manchester , Liverpol and Sheffield are among the first to register people , and in October , further clinics will be added before the programme is introduced anywhere in England by April 2018 .
&apos;PrEP &apos; is a hotchpotch of HIV drugs that is taken before the incident to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
Clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection .
PrEP prior to taking action means that there is a sufficient number of certain medicines in the body that prevent HIV infection .
Such medicines can take place on a daily basis or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure .
The right candidates include lesbian or bisexual men , transgender people and people whose partners are HIV @-@ infected and do not receive treatment .
They identify suitable people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , transgender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment .
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their willingness to participate in the local sex health clinics which participate in the programme .
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed the contract to get medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
The clinical test aims to assess the true potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who is treated and how it is consumed and implemented in a large cloud .
Ste186 said : &apos; This new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and enhance the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
This is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of mankind &apos;s biggest health problems . &quot;
Deborah gold , Chief Executive of NAT , said : &apos; This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
PrEP , if it is properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk level , offers an opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic .
Since September , people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on the negotiations with the partner , thereby improving many lives , through this clinical trial funded by the NHS .
We warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
The Managing Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation , ian Green , said : &apos; It is now essential to ensure that a clinical trial is launched quickly across the country and that no members of the HIV risk group remain excluded .
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been received , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
The Minister for Public Health , Sharon Hodgson , said : &apos; The beginning of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the census of government shoes .
Evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
This clinical attempt will lead us a step closer to a complete understanding of the benefits of PrEP .
It is now important that a clinical trial is carried out as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV and to move us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
Electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
The difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.94 , compared with EUR 7.71 in June this year , Elering .
The main reason for the price gap is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
In Estonia last month , the average electricity exchange rate was set at EUR 34.33 per megavage hour and the price rose by 12 % compared to June .
In Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five percent to EUR 36.27 per megavage hour .
In Finland , the price was EUR 34.17 , while the electricity exchange rate was EUR 26.37 per megavage hour .
Prices rose by 12 and 7 % respectively .
Between Estonia and Finland , electricity moved from 75 % last month to Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
The remaining nine % of the two @-@ hour transactions between the two countries did not take place next day .
Between Estonia and Latvia , electricity was mobile from Estonia to Latvia at 99 % and 73 % of hours had full transmission capacity .
According to transactions in the Nasdaq OMX market on July &apos;s latest trading day , the electricity exchange price in August could reach around € 34 and € 37 per megavage hour in September .
The carbon price affecting electricity production prices came up last month and transactions took place at 5.04 @-@ 5.47 € per tonne .
Living a higher life - half @-@ order and smart designers have turned it into a house for the small Earls Court of Justice .
Joanne Leigh , a former banker who is a passionate building innovator , changed his home of Knightsbridge in 2014 against the Earls Court &apos;s koruna .
This is in the first order of Queen Anne Terţi , and the fact that Joanne has not brought his bags together and sold the flats has been a tribute to the new design .
&quot; Before that , I lived together with a former life @-@ rich compass in Knightsbridge , &quot; said Joanne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tantamount to the price I have offered .
It was shown to me by the Earls Court of Justice , which had the same high waves .
I was wondering about it and I made an offer on the same day . &quot;
Since the first visit , this 93 @-@ metre corps have gone through a complete innovation gap .
At the beginning , it was a sleeping cort and a complex beacon - it had to be sleeping through kitchen to reach a sleeping wall , and Joanne wanted to add savings and quasi @-@ regulation to exploit high levels of talent .
&quot; I wanted high , big windows , a lot of light .
These were my demands , &apos; he said .
He is asking Erfan Azad Notting , the architectural and design headline Duck &amp; Order , to take advantage of the 3.8 m deserts and to create a home that is not just a development site but a place where Joanne can live .
It was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a quasi @-@ order to stand up .
The Erfan had to take a creative approach .
&quot; Aquaculture is rather complex , &quot; he explains .
&quot; We had to reorganise the premises so that they were located on one another without having to bow to each other .
It was not just about building a platform , but using steel design to make sure that both the upper and lower space is right . &quot;
This emphasis allowed Mrs Erfans to create two flambles with complete arrogance alongside each other in the room , with a lot of dramatic elements .
One @-@ and @-@ a @-@ one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ all lighting is the Retrouvius window for the glaciers under the carpet .
The golden furniture , silver details and retropacilian Serge Mouille &apos;s lighting underline the style of space .
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of communications , space and traffic lights .
Both sides of the short corridor have been included in the corridors so that it appears longer .
In the Knight , the mirror is giving the impression of a second @-@ step window .
In the course of this exercise , the census provides a reflection of the deposit for all the eating disorders and glass requirements of Joanne .
Housing is accompanied by a false opportunity to close the vegetables if it is not used , creating an image of a more densely populated space .
Cumulative kitchen is nothing new .
However , with this kitchen , it is unique that it is a plug of uprisings of garage .
&quot; It did a little bit of design , &quot; explained by Erfan terastronomical spouse of MDF .
&quot; This has a counterweight , which is why it is very simple to reject it . &quot;
Thanks to the smart use of space and maintenance , Joanne now has 16 additional computers , additional sleeping rooms and better flats .
After all , the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to property - &apos; says Erfan .
&apos;Kinnismineral land kler takes an outdated form of tup and makes calculations based on an underground area &apos; .
Here they have been able to increase surgery , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to the space .
&quot; Materials are what you have to do and thus help to create emotional links with your home , &quot; says Erfan .
&apos;You do not love the electricity cables in my sein .
It is important , but it does not put heart languages ringing . &quot;
This shows that a good design and an increased area of land helps to do something astonishing from a rather normal corps .
In fact , they can even create a desire not to leave , as was the case with Joanne .
The chief figure , Jensen , is Chicago , a petroman in a pilot night who is competing with his colleague for his professionalism .
No more than the amount of money that has been earned , apart from which any ethics is forgotten .
His wife and three children only see his husband on his property and at the late hour .
In the first part of the film , I find myself in the idea that it is a version of the business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler &apos;s speech .
What the film goes on , the less well @-@ established element remains , and the moralising intention of film @-@ makers is beginning to appear more and more .
Life @-@ changing experience leads to cancer for the main contractor .
A choice must now be made between work and family life .
The poet dreaming the father &apos;s feet at the Chicago Large buildings to think about matters of real importance such as religion , welfare , love ... , without even mentioning the disaster of the twin sectors .
After the third stomach , where the son &apos;s father &apos;s eyes are opened , there is a feeling that film @-@ makers are certainly exposed to the target , because even the most predatory consciences are unable to keep tears back when they see the suffering of the cum boys who are ill .
If the poet falls into the House and his situation seems to be almost hopeless , father will finally understand the moral nature of his work and do a good job for the elderly .
Now , in my own sense , I am lucky - if the film has its own , then I reward my sense of vision after the film coffee , if I am wrong , then the standle may be praised for at least one surprise .
For a moment , there is a suspicion that the ice coffee will be lost - when a husband calls a sick hospital and a man drives a sicken route .
However , the Poeg has been amazing , and although his father has just lost his job , it is even positive , because now , after all , it is time to deal with the family .
I can also feel very well - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well .
In truth , film is well constructed , with all the elements required to do so .
There will be a Council , there will be laughing , illustrators will be a good and moral beauty : Money is not the most important thing in life .
This film is well introduced by surprise .
The new Staff Commander of the Trumpm intends to limit President &apos;s media consumption .
Others have tried and failed .
Perhaps John F. Kelly will actually manage this .
In that case , it would be the first .
Politico writes that the new staff chief of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President Trumpin , including news , in the hope that it will keep the excess in a more balanced way .
There is a full report here from Josh Dawseyl :
&quot; When John F. Kelly met high officials on his first day of work , the White House revealed a key problem with President Donald Trumpi Valges Main , which he plans to solve the poor flow of information into President Assad &apos;s hands .
Mr Kelly told officials that information must be channelled through him , either on paper or at meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have also tried to do so and have failed to tame Trumpi by monitoring its media consumption .
President Trumpi &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades , and even now that he is in White Main , his telecommunication habits have not gone anywhere .
&quot; When the candidate Trump was a pause for unfair media coverage , to show him that he was also fairly reflected in the statements affecting him , &quot; the former campaigner Sam Nunberg told Polititz in February .
Politico tara Palmer wrote at the time that , &apos; according to six former campaigners , Trumpi Twitter is the key to controlling the behaviour of the ter @-@ habits , in order to ensure that her individual media consumption is also accompanied by a stable piece of praise &apos; .
OK .
But the idea that the habits of using Trumpi Twitter have once been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
Perhaps those campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know is that the Trumpi tag would have been even more heartening without these interventions .
We will probably never be able to know about the allowances that the Trump did not disclose .
If she was helpless able to rescue the scams a few times , his efforts were worth doing so .
However , no one has been able to prevent Trumpi from constantly creating controversy .
Part of the problem is that in White Main , which consists of competing tactics between them , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception by transferring materials to the Truel that support their world views , but which may not always be reliable .
Policy tico , which reflects the whole evolution of the story , wrote in May the tendency of advisers to provide the President with strategic questionable information .
One of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows :
&quot; The current and former Trumpi are subject to the Trub saying that the Trump can react to the negative press , particularly the harmful effects on information devices , exploding as a obsession with identifying their source of origin .
This was also the case at the end of February , when someone gave the President a cheerfully copy of the Internet provocation to Charles C. The website of GotNews.com belonging to Johnson , which accused the chief officer , Katie Walshi , of being a white house &apos; source of multiple leaflets &apos; .
It goes without saying that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter , or that he did not provide any specific evidence , or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
The Trump read the article and started asking the subordinate Walshi . &quot;
Goldmacher added that Rob Porter , the then staff chief of Reince Priebus , and the head of the White House , had attempted to establish a system for managing and documentation documents reaching Trumpin . &quot;
How did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Priebuss , but the Trump is still an impulse and his assistant will still compete for influence .
These irrevocable factors make the mission very difficult .
Street musicians who have come from abroad to the capital will not be able to obtain a bitter speech .
There is a lot of foreign affairs in the city of Tallinn .
Those with whom the girl came to the fire acknowledged that he played in the old city without the permission of the municipal government .
The first thing we found was the three street musicians who had participated in the same number of houses close to Viru gates .
It was clear to see that musicians with slogans and sleeping clothes were ruins of absentia , to whom one duš marches would be taken away .
Despite the humiliation , the only woman in the company played a trail in acordiation , while one man , alongside him , was in gestures with three faces and called the furniture closer .
The third man had sat on one of his dogs alongside them and smoked a coral of self @-@ prepared farce .
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people that have passed .
Mr Bob , who has played with Mr Noemi and the palliates , said that he was wearing the streets for both fun and money .
The purpose of the event was to collect ticket costs for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day .
On the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for rotation , Noemi and Bob were shaking their heads .
Firstly , we did not know .
Secondly , we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a few days and , in most cases , we will be given permission for one month or another .
It makes no sense to pay for this , &quot; explained by Bob .
When we returned to the gates of Viru some 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in the hands of musicians and are driving them away .
It was with sambers and bags in absentia to try to get to grips with Viru crossing the centre .
Three Polish young men were also present on Viru street , one of whom played a fifth , another knife , and the third had even contributed electronic glass .
&quot; We are here to offer people entertainment in order to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and life , and the trio pipe Mivosh explained .
According to Mivoshi , they are aware that there must be permission from the City Government .
&quot; Of course we do not have it , &quot; he said it joke .
But we hope that , when people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
Of course , if the police comes , then we go elsewhere , but you have to try , &apos; he added .
The Bank of Estonia purchased bonds worth EUR 149 million in the public assets programme of central banks in the euro area , with a bank bond portfolio of EUR 4.36 billion .
The Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
The President of the Bank of Estonia , Hardo Hansson , has made it clear in the past that the assets of central banks in the euro system cover three different purchasing programmes : Covered bonds of the financial sector ( SIS II ) , asset @-@ backed bonds ( ABS ) and public debt ( PSPP ) .
The Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
The impact of purchases reduces the production of lower @-@ risk assets and encourages investors to take greater risks .
As a rule , in the public sector bond exchange programme , each central bank buys its own government bonds , the bonds of other countries are not purchased .
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is making so @-@ called &apos; replacement purchases &apos; within the amount allocated to them .
Central Banks also shop in those countries where the offer of bonds to the purchase scheme is limited .
The Estonian bank generally buys the bonds of the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank bonds , confirmed by Hansson .
The Estonian bank purchases bonds under the asset buy @-@ up scheme as of March 2015 .
In the meantime , Elempire bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian bank no longer bought Election bonds by June 2016 .
In the name of the central banks in the euro area , both Elem and Estonia will buy energy bonds from the Bank of Finland from June .
Migrants ignore degrees and return to a &apos; million business base &apos; .
Some of the West Midlands &apos;s most affluent home owners have once again found themselves in a fierce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the unelected bureaucrats of the county to win back their walls .
Migrants have parked their 20 trailers to the brink of a wealth of millions of business in the vicinity of the Sohatulli street .
They have returned , together with the army of horses , children and lorries , after they were blowing out there only in May , without being thrown away from the cradle of the bureaucracies that the Council was complaining about to block their invasion .
The active group found a weak place in the limits of protection , turning its vehicles through the unblocked part that had been left to football .
The people of Maruangry have surpassed the Someat ulli Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless to deal with the problem &apos; .
A anonymous person said : &apos; They copied there on Monday evening after their expulsion from Bentley Heathy , where they refused to stoning .
The Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
The migrants were there in May , they were delayed and now they are back again .
They came to more yesterday evening , probably more today . &quot;
He added : &apos; Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect his parks .
I live on the road of street etsbrook , and I am not happy that I must continue to pay a total of authorisations if the Council is not even able to block such a thing . &quot;
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said : &apos; It is ridiculous ; we have just seen the last of these migrants leave , and a new offensive is already under way .
This time , there has been an increase in the number and even a horse has been seen in the grassland . &quot;
The Someat Council representative said : &apos; We are aware that in the land near the street etsbrook road , there is an unacceptable camp and we are working with the Sohatulli police , we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
The gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by phone number 101 .
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them . &quot;
The Weekna festival will also visit , among others , the Minister for Culture , Indrek Saar , who is pleased to have been able to bring real world top names to Estonia .
The question of why so important for the Estonians at the Weekise festival is Saar that this should be asked of all those who enjoy three days at the festival .
However , he will admit that the real players in his own area have arrived in Persia .
&quot; Looking at the level of artists that we have been able to bring home to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music jungle - often not in our ranking - are spoken of a Minister for Culture .
Which festival , however , are artists who speak to Saart itself the most ?
I consider myself to be relatively old and , for some of the older people , one of the most experienced doctors , Armin van Bnewren , who stood up last night .
After all , according to his poster , all of us have complicated our own feet at some point , &apos; he says .
However , he also highlights a number of names , such as ChainRoure i , Deadmau5 , Knifebels .
Of course , our own Estonian players are also : Starting from NOţP , and they can be read in a whole series .
In reality , this concentration of well @-@ known names is very high , &quot; he says .

Audi upgrades up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the light of criticism by car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement , BMW said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles .
According to the Chairman of BMW , the company believes that &apos; there are smarter alternatives than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the BMW home city of Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be upgraded to reduce emissions of diesel engines .
No company described these operations as a &apos; provocation &apos; .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
However , nitrogen oxide , which drives from diesel engines , is considered to be carcinogenic and could lead to asthma .
The cost of equipment installed for neutralising emissions from diesel vehicles will also increase for car manufacturers , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
While German car manufacturers are under an in @-@ depth investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of ringing powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs referring to the problem .
Companies are trying to prevent Volkswagen from repeating the mistakes of the Volkswagen , who was silent about the use of &apos; petrolery &apos; that allowed emissions fares to be adapted to regulations when testing a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
The former head of the Audi engine Development unit in Germany was arrested last month .
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
At the beginning of this year , Audi in Germany was relegated to a criminal investigation into Volkswagen when the authorities accused the installation of the Audit System in order to evade the requirements of European emissions volumes , thereby extending the investigation that had previously been focused on the United States .
The inclusion of the Audi in the investigation may be a major blow to the Volkswagen holder Frontivist cars , disproportionately generating the profits of a large proportion of Volkswagen .
Estonian schools receive EU flags for € 20 000 .
The Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags by 1 September for Estonian schools to mark the Presidency .
A total of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union &apos;s flag will be 570 education institutions .
Flags are intended to invest in indoor communications , they must also be carried out in high quality printing techniques with a sense of attestation in indoors , and the ERR news portal will be facilitated .
On the label , the text reads : &apos; Kingitus to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education , with a flag costing EUR 35 .
Murder of journalist highlights growing threats in Mexico
The workers of the weekly newspaper , Riodoce , usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Blue authorisation , which is sown by organised crime , corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars .
But today they have gathered in the shadow of their personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
They are told that it is important to change their routine .
Two of the parents &apos; authors are discussing which seems safer : Whether to bring children to their offices , which were the target of the grandiose attack in 2009 , or leave them home .
Security experts have written three words to the leader of the space : &apos; Enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
They ask reporters to provide the names of each water in each of them with evidence from theory is unnecessary , impressions and inner feelings are enough .
The presence of government or cartels is suspected of being drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists alike of a whole list of paperwork that makes it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
Violence is not a stunt , and the more dead people are accumulating across the country , the majority of which are journalists from Yemen , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists , since the resignation of President Enrique Pena Şto at least 25 in December 2012 . 589 journalists have been under public protection following attacks and threats , and this year at least seven journalists have still died in seven countries .
The most recent deaths include their editor and source of inspiration , Javier Valdez Cardenas , co @-@ founder of Riodoce .
&quot; The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Valdez wrote in one of his many reports on drug @-@ related violence .
His absence makes it felt deeply , even though his presence can be felt anywhere in Yemen Riodoce Building a big picture of the Valdezest , which shows the average finger at Valdez , and two of the 30nines reporters , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , carries T @-@ shirts , which have been portrayed by his wife @-@ private glasses or the face of his petroleum .
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death , and pasters will be discussing common trauma , their nightmare , their hopelessness , their paranoia .
Although , in 2010 , a separate public Prosecutor was set up to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
Like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders , which amount to thousands , the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
The editorial action of Riodoce will continue to reflect the violence in Sinaloa , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
Without the data and justice of murderers , the security meeting Ibarra says that much will be useful .
&apos;It is very nice to waste your time in this meeting , &apos; he says .
&quot; As long as the reason is not known , everyone will be divided . &quot;
Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital of the State , Culiacan , on 15 May morning .
He was able to travel just a few quarters before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla , forcing him to exit the car and shot him 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which means &apos; twelfth river &apos; in translation .
An armed man went to the Valdez car and made an accident near it .
Valdez was 50 years old .
She was left behind by a woman and two adult children .
People who have been flooded are spreading freely in Culiacan .
However , the Valdez issue mainly lies in silence .
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition to the United States in January , the Blue Card has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country , as rival fers are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
It goes without saying that , on the streets of your permission , a few people , or even several , are thrown down every day , or that the dead are grinding from the gruesome two @-@ fold sweets of drug gangs , which are more than many homes living .
Let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one cartel is headed by a sea state with valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
Despite all this , and despite the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Riodoce &apos;s co @-@ founder and president , IsMay Bojorquez ( 60 ) , feels an enormous embarrassment that he was unable to defend his friend .
He believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
The first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Guzman &apos;s sons in the face of the Sikamehe Damaso Lopez pocket .
This piece of correspondence could have been alluded to by the supposedly suspect gang members , all the copies of the publications were bought as soon as they were reached in the newspapers .
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security , after the crackdown took place in another newspaper that was equally respected .
Valdez was legally in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
He had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to exist forever .
He served as a veteranreporter in the Noroeste newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce , sold 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bojorquez said that in your blue &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without touching on the drug problem &apos; .
The newspaper took time to know about its courageous and honest labels , and sales and advertising grew .
Reporters were keen to publish vigorous studies without fear of censorship and readers sleep in a print of which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect .
Eight years after the launch of Riodoce , the newspaper won the prestigious award of Maria Moors Caboti for his reports in Latin America .
In the same year , Valdez &apos;s Committee for the Protection of journalists ( AKK ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow Mexican drug creation wherever it takes .
He admitted openly that he was afraid .
&apos;I want to live on , &apos; he said when he received the AKK Prize .
Last October , he said in an interview given to the television channel Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa .
&apos;To take up the task of assuming a second chance of playing a fool with the media office .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not talk about what is going on . &quot;
Riodoce collelova strives Valdez , a joke who roppered like madrus , a friend who generously divided embryos and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
They gave their support to his routine .
He always weed his own village .
He went across the office to El Wogau yabo bar and was always on the same desk .
Now they ask whether his stubbornness became fatal .
His death has also cast them in doubt about how best to do his job and stay alive .
&quot; They do not like the arrogance of their women , their children , their legitimate businesses , their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; These things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bojorquez .
The result , even in the best times , is strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination .
Trusted your instincts .
If it is a matter of suspiciously framing , it is a hole away .
According to the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal , the problem is that &apos; fragrance can be deceived ... , and so it was Javierga &apos; .
He and others say that you no longer have old rules , just as they do not apply in Denmark , Veracruz , Guerreros or other states , which are home to the toxic composition of profitable smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
The landscape is constantly changing .
In the space where Riodoce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only the button sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
In front of the house , two police officers sought a relaxation of 40 degrees .
They were appointed by the government to a more orthodox state office in the Culiacan central class in the Culiacan building .
Some of the reporters wondered in a semi @-@ joke whether these police officers were among the 50 % of the police officers whose Governor himself has searched untrustworthy .
Several months have passed since reports have been travelling to mountainous rural areas where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gangs .
Riodoce &apos;s publication this week dealt with three main features .
One of them was the murder of former poxomallego Julio Cesar Chavez venna in Sinalo .
Moreover , they had a revealing story of spending government funds on the city of the Governor &apos;s home city .
A group of people was kidnapped from Culiacan , one of the most expensive restaurants .
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened , so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of Leicrestauran , both for drug traffickers and for public authorities .
Reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered as a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Party ( IRP ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
Recently , several IRP Governor has been accused of widespread coverage of cases of corruption .
In Villarline , the reporter asked her to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Guzman , who wear the name of El Chapo , escaped military betration .
Just a few months earlier , readers would have been seeking a copy of Valdez to obtain information about kidnapping from the best sources .
&apos;In the past , we would have known what happened , &apos; said 46 @-@ year @-@ old Villarline , whose body construction has earned him a banner called El Flaco .
&quot; Now all the channels of communication have broken down with our sources . &quot;
The Valdez office has become a reservoid of bridges and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the editorial workers have become something they never expected to wait for activists on behalf of the press .
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few eyes and direction next morning to the local public Prosecutor &apos;s office for another journalist .
Mr Salvador Ava disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the killing of Valdez .
It has been found to be a dead body and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
Journalists have become more popular across the country and are crippling the words &apos; SOS press &apos; as organised protest on pavements and buildings .
On this day , President Bojorquez is in Washington , trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case .
A day after the death of Valdez , when he met with the Your licence Governor , Ramirez accused the authorities of crying out journalists and killing them for telling the truth .
After that , he asked for his or her to be diverted from the government &apos;s activities elsewhere , concerned that hatred had affected objectivity .
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ culpable state officials and indifferent society .
In his last book &apos; drug media &apos; , he wrote that reporters are not only killing drugs gangs , but also under the command of politicians and security forces who are at the mercy of organised crime .
Articulo 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , awarded more than half of the attacks by journalists on the police and public officials last year .
&apos;In Mexico you happen , because you want to keep quiet , &apos; Ramirez said .
There are obviously bloody effects .
No one will forget the death of the blogger , Mrs Elizabeth Macias , in the northern border state in Tamaulik six years ago .
He was found dead with a letter which was probably signed by the cartel LOS Zetas : &apos; I am here for my reporters &apos; .
The computer glass offices and elephants were found alongside his painted head .
Some of the publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the northern border state of El Norte , Chihuahuahua , following the killing of their correspondent philosopher Pubslava BPosition , in March .
Others will continue as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their president in 2004 .
In 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with the editorial &apos; What do you want ? &apos;
Some journalists have fled their home states , or even their country .
This is a nervous decision .
In theory , it is difficult to find work and they still have to find out today in order to avoid dangers .
And sometimes they are being persecuted , as probably happened with the photograph Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered three months after the Veracruz break in 2015 with four women in one of the cities in 2015 .
Those who remain in the lurch and continue to work will have to refute risky decisions on a daily basis .
The Ibarra , who once wanted to become a poet , recognises that it is frightened to reflect the drug business .
&quot; Mexico is on the way to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &apos; he said .
At a recent midnight of Friday , when the latest number had already been thrown off , the editor of Riodoce was walked in front of the office and beating beer when all telephone lines suddenly started to be calibrated .
19 people were killed , according to confirmed in the fire exchange between rival gangs and security forces in Mazatlanis .
The war continued to escort , as did a number of messages from cartels found in the area .
According to the same pavements , reporters made news on the Riodoce site using a mobile phone .
A change was needed in the front of next day .
The scenes seized another fire exchange in the region .
Bojorquez piilla stood up for the police to see whether they are vigilant .
If they were afraid , they did not at least show this .
Workers in Riodoce were posted in his footsteps by the founder who fell in a massive portfolio , where his average finger is visible to the whole blue man .
&apos;How could you think about closure at all , &apos; said Bojorquez &apos; on the same day that Javier Solana was killed , a traineeship asked me to send a report to the streets ? &apos;
Dinosaurus used protective colours to avoid enemies
At first glance , it looks like a form , albeit rather frightening .
Scientists have now made public the first findings concerning the hypothetical size of the unbelievable rubbish that has been discovered by a Canadian minster , which has so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; dinosaur Mona Lisa &apos; .
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to find out that the skin covered by his sooms was a red @-@ boy colour , and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
A report published in the press published by Health Biology described the present status as &apos; the best preserved soomdium surgery ever &apos; and &apos; one of the best Curriculum readings worldwide &apos; .
In the case of fossil fuels , it is a new category of nodosage that lived in the middle of the seasonage , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
Its incredibly good retention in Raba was carried out by theatres who describe it as &apos; truly significant &apos; .
The plant feed covered by soys has , according to National Geosian , been the best preserved in the type of phosphorus that has ever been found .
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn functional when he extracted Suncor Millenium in Fort McMurray near Northern Albertas in Canada .
It hit something that did not remind the surrounding kids and decided to look into more detail .
The advertised phosphate was sent to the Royal Tyrrell paleontology museum .
For the next six years , an animal was designed to extract 2 500 pounds ( 1100 kilometres ) from a land unit .
After all this hard work , the end result is now finally ready to bring the public to the table .
&apos;Even to paraphrase a little eyes , you can almost believe he sleep , &apos; said Caleb Brown , a leading author , a theatre in Royal Tyrrell , the museum in which he is stunned .
&quot; This goes down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaur - dinosaur Mona Lisana . &quot;
When studying her skin , she found out that this vegetation , which is covered by soaps and resembles divisive tank , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food dinosaences .
This horrendous dinosaur used red and white protective colours to hide from predators and applied sheltering techniques , which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
This made it possible , according to the experts , to enter the dinosaur better into the surroundings and to avoid enemies , as the major dinosaurs were likely to hunt him .
This figure of 110 million old @-@ year @-@ old family of nodosatologists first came to news in May and is now visited in the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology museum .
The theatres have now investigated the existence and given it the name of the Borealopelta Marmitchelli museum mark Mitchell , who was a team that spent more than 7 000 hours in order to reveal the suffering .
Thanks to the amazing high quality of his father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the sooms .
They found refuge - the method of protection in animal species , which means that the title of existence was the harshest as the lower .
Although disapproval is common , the findings come as a surprise , as Borealopelta is much greater than the animals with responsibility today .
This suggests that dinosaur pressure was sufficiently keenly hunted by other musical compounds , that the evolution was preferred to be a policy of survival rather than a confrontation .
However , most of the animals using modern forms of objectivity - such as fear , seals or armadweather - are far smaller and more vulnerable as an island , indicating that nodosaurus had had to make a real effort to survive .
&quot; The vigorous hunting of the dinosaur , covered by massive and abundant soaps , shows how dangerous the endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered dinosaences could have been , &quot; Brown said .
The chemical analysis of organic compounds of diabetes also revealed that a dinosaur &apos;s skin was a red bag .
Scientists will continue to provide an investigation to get an indication of this life , including the retained content of this salt style , in order to find out what the animal is the last word .
They believe that the dinosaur has fallen into the dead rivers , thereby entering the sea , where it was sunk in the ocean .
At the time , Albertas was just as warm as now in South Florence , and rivers and oceans were probably far beyond the internal land .
&quot; This nodosaurus is truly significant , since it has fully preserved soustic skin , but it has also remained three dimensions , while preserving the original shape , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; As a result , the animal today sees almost the same thing as in the seasonic age .
To reconstruct this , it does not need to have much imagination to use - it is enough simply to run bridges and it seems to be like sleeping . &quot;
The crisis era was the time when huge sweets of meat feed - heterostores - were stunned in the countryside .
Although their Queen Tyrannosaurus rex lived many millions years later than Borealopelta , some of his daunting predecessors could have hunted this sorely .
These include Acrocanthosaurus , a long and six @-@ tonne monster with 38 legs ( 11.5 metres ) .
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta uhuta was stunned after death in the sea and that this muzine was mutualised .
On 21 March 2011 , Shawn functional was detected when he extracted from Fort McMurray in the Millenium mine in Northern Albertas in Canada .
By the way , it has remained the most prevalent soomomalment in the world , including skin and sooms , and it is comprehensive from concentration to pumps .
These assumptions were on average 18 legs ( five metres ) long and up to GBP 3 000 ( 1 300 kg ) .
Two 20 customs miles came out of it .
Scientists believe that , through the current Western Canada , the site covered by soaps , was marvelled up to its pride in the open sea .
However , the landing site of the dinosaur was instrumental in maintaining its characteristics in an excellent detail .
The glaciers of this particular father , coal , have so well preserved that the mygarchical Eomomomalate ceilings are still covered by skin glaciers .
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geosian magazine : &apos; Such statehood is as rare as lotovictory .
The more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
The burnt skin glaciers are still covered by mysterious sodium stores based on the yellow .
A better front is lying alongside him and the way in which he streamed up .
I will be able to list the soyings at his winter . &quot;
How did one activist find an answer to the question of &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell became a complete shock .
Just a day after the trip to New York , that was the birthplace of St. Louka Airbnb on a leaked dose , travelling on Facebook a phone .
He came on top of the post of his former school companions .
It said : &apos; The police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old adolescents , and he is still on the streets &apos; .
He was confused as to why nobody else had outsourced this information from his bed , so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
Pidega @ TheePMilah &apos;s user had repeatedly been handed over on his line of time .
St. Syrippar , from the Louise region , gave real @-@ time comfort to Michael Brown , the death of an unarmed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson Missouris .
He gave an image of the life of Brown , a body that was found in the street , living there for four hours .
&apos;It is crazy , &apos; said Ferreira &apos;s additions .
However , death was nothing new for him or for the community .
He put his phone off , but later this evening he looked back to the tag , which this time announced the arrival of people in Canfield Drive .
The Jagati photographs of the police and the harsh people and a man who claimed himself to be the father of Brown and kept the &apos; Ferguson police killed just my unarmed boy &apos; .
He watched in real time a stream in which the police officer stood before a group of protesters with a graves home .
In another video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Mr Ferrell will remember how he has caught up in the thought : &apos; It is unusual &apos; .
&apos;This is not a murder of this kind that we are accustomed to and which we could describe as typical &apos; .
I felt frightened at that point .
I was angry and advised . &quot;
He booked a return flight and was travelling home next day .
Having buried at 23 : 00 , he went to his father for his six @-@ year daughter and decided that they would travel to Ferguson next morning .
What took place in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson will be the central issue of the new documentary &apos; Whose street &apos; ? ( &apos; Whose thanks ? &apos; ) , which will be present in cinemas on 11 August .
It is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who took up their streets in demanding responses .
When Mr Ferreira , coupled with a daughter - who had a lipsy sticker and a chat with it - went on to Ferguson , they once again talked about a subject that had come to their knees many times before this morning - the experience and living conditions of black people .
&quot; Remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &quot;
&quot; We are currently travelling to Ferguson because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys , and that is not right . &quot;
&apos;I could not take him on board , &apos; said Ferrell later .
&apos;What is happening now is ... the culmination of what happened in the past .
It must know and see this and grow in the middle of it .
It must learn about the organisation of a activists and , at the same time , know the different layers of experience and living conditions of the Muslim people , and what we must do to be free and free .
Even if I manage to raise him in such a way that he does not personally copy brutal racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel I would be doing him a disservice if I were to protect him from this world . &quot;
The first stop they did in the vicinity of Fergusoni was by the South Florissanti - the police station in the remaining place , which had become a kind of camp plate , where activists were waiting for news about the police officer Darren Wilson , who was not ultimately charged with charges .
There , Mr Ferreira and his daughter united forces with the local business owner who prepared lunch tables .
They brought together food homes and helped to divide them to the protesters .
For Ferrell , a new type of activist was slowly started to take shape .
&quot; My activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at the Missouri @-@ St. Louad University , he was the President of the Alliance for Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organisation .
All of this was just laissez &apos;être &apos; .
Weeks later , during the Ferreira evening demonstration , she met a film co @-@ director , Sabaah Folayana .
Folayan said that he and the film operator , Mr Alvarado @-@ Farrar , simply wanted to document what is happening .
In the face of Ferrell , the question came : &apos; Are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
Such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to take advantage of its protein and resilience .
Folayan explained in a recent interview : &apos; We had heard that the voice of people born and growing in Ferguson would not be heard , and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Folayan had already put his hand in hand with Damon Davati , a man in the region who was well @-@ known for activists in connection with prisoners who were sentenced to death .
His involvement made the project attractive to Ferrell and the other six local cities who were watched for years following the shooting of Brown .
&quot; In this documentary , nobody is talking to us or to us , but we are speaking to ourselves , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; It was important for me how these people are portrayed , because that is how I am portrayed . &quot;
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell - the intention was to show that the Movement is not a &apos; donor leader , but a community bringing together &apos; , as outlined by Folayan - he was the most open to the film .
As a result , &apos; Whose street ets ? &apos; , surprisingly personal aspects of the life of Ferrell , such as ruthfulness and marriage with their wife .
&apos;I felt as if I had started , &apos; said Ferrell , singing from the first time that he saw the city .
&quot; However , I realised that there was a need for a certain vulnerability to carry out this work and to humanise black people . &quot;
Moreover , the Ferrell affair emphasises and puts the role of the black LGBT woman once again at the centre of the wider Black Sea Lives Matter movement .
Two of the three initiators of the movement , who thought in the social media about the killing of the black teenagers , Trayvon Martin , in 2012 , of the hashtag # BlackLivesMatter , are homosexuals .
&quot; The leading role of Muslim women has kept the movement in the overall field , &quot; said Ferreira , and this is precisely because we must constantly fight on a number of fronts .
Mustanabad homosexuals must bear all this burden . &quot;
Folayan agreed , stating that &apos; movement is indeed alive for black women , and many of them black homosexuals &apos; .
He says , however , that &apos; this is not something of a kind of equal opportunities &apos; - Ferrell was not chosen as a film centre for his identity .
&quot; He was someone who evening the right energy , &quot; said .
&quot; However , it is not a coincidence that he was on the frontline , as black LGBT women are at stake when living in such hubs .
His energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
At the same time , news cameras Ferguson have long disappeared , but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile .
The conditional sentence imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the road lasts for 2.5 years to come .
He describes the social @-@ political climate in the region he calls home simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
Nonetheless , he still considers the mantra he has been eating memory since his entire three years ago on the streets of Ferguson .
&quot; It is our duty to fight for our freedom .
It is our duty to win .
We must love and support each other .
We have nothing other than our chains to lose . &quot;
7 examples of how to overcome the Weekise du potaclone
Some of the more frequent measles find , after a little bit of noise , that they are suffering from , hence help .
Or the term &apos; Beyond potall &apos; , the cradle of the Nazis .
But this is only an inevitable postponement and a decent blessing for health .
What can you do to make sure , after today and tomorrow &apos;s Weekise trall - or other pipes - that you feel better on this morning and get rid of poppy as painfully as possible ?
Joo Water .
To alcohol , after a great deal of pipe in the morning ... or possibly even alcohol .
As the body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it must somehow be recovered .
Minerals are also thrown out of the body together with water , and sestap is a good hair to mineral water .
Since the sweetener has often been annoyed after the metal , it is particularly good to have a bubble or a little bit reduced .
Let us walk away .
It would certainly not cost a boy to split trees into the grandmother - it could prove fatal a wrong decision .
But a simple walk @-@ out helps the body to recall once again what sense it is in life .
Sleeping in Telgis and sleeping poppy is a more time @-@ consuming way to get a full .
Give poor energy back gradually and cautiously .
If you are on the verge of overdrinking yesterday , then it is certainly not worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
Without , for example , a fresh pipe containing fruit fans as a body is on the verge of silencing .
If health is already suffering in the South , the wedding could be attempted , for example .
And a little later , the Panorama .
A referee was avoided .
This diure tag will free the body from the last water .
As has already been said , water and volume are your friends .
Reparing painkillers .
If you are to be painkiller in order to prevent potaclone on the evening , you will have to deal with paratsetal or ibuprophet , not only alcohol , but you will have to deal with it , and you will lose so much .
So many more hits and , in the future , boys will be worse .
In addition , painkillers do not remain in the coffee for a long time .
If you take a painkiller in the morning , you will do it with a blot - it annoys your already tired sweat .
Or if the partner is not to take it , then it will be well with itself .
There is something like walking , but there will be no quantum leap when you walk .
However , too active a pace and an outrageous bet were avoided - the physical effort should be moderating during the poppy .
The road joke .
The words of friends of the time with friends of friends of friends of the past , the path to simple foods and Nazis friendly about himself and others ( suffering ) .
Nali and laughter may not make a pocket , but it is certainly easier for them to follow up .
Once again , the boy goes over anyway !
University of Northwester and Oxford &apos;s staff are sought as suspects in murder .
The police say that a professor of the University of Northwester and the University of Oxford are being sought nationally , who have received suspicions after deadly petty petty wolves , to find a team of men in one of Chicago &apos;s luxury basins .
According to judicial documents by Cook County , on Monday , arrests were issued for the arrest of the 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni accused of being murdered at first instance because of their alleged association in Trenton H. Cornell @-@ Duranhanu .
According to the documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Duranhanu died after repeated seals .
According to the warning that Chicago &apos;s police station issued to the community , the body was found to be dead on 27 July .
Police officers received telephone calls and found a victim whose body had several storms in the Grand Plaza Corterhouse .
According to the officials , Cornell @-@ Duranhanu was admitted to death and investigators are treating rape as a murder , while the police are actively seeking two suspects .
Lavid has been working as co @-@ professors of micro @-@ biology and immunology at the University of Northwester since 2007 .
In a statement sent as e @-@ publishing , Alan K. Cubbage , Vice @-@ President of University Public Relations , said that Lavid has now been temporarily removed from the workplace and is forbidden to enter the towns of the University of Northwester .
&quot; This is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of Northwester works with the investigators , &quot; said Cubbage .
Warren is a senior assistant at the University of Oxford .
The representative of the University of Somerville College said in an e @-@ mail statement : &apos; We have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist the US investigation authorities in every way possible &apos; .
Furthermore , the statement stated that Warreni colleagues would be shocked and would like to be extradited .
Anthony Guglielm , Head of the Communications Department of Chicago , urges the authorities to give themselves , with suspicion .
&quot; The police have an idea where they are , but we are increasingly intensively defining the exact whereabouts , &quot; said Guglielm .
According to Guglielm , suspects are helped by local , regional and national authorities .
Guglielm said that the police had received telephone calls from the Grand Prix Corterhouse , who had just received a kryptic allude that something had happened in Corps No 1008 .
According to the police , this was a spectacular spectacle .
According to Guglielm , it is not clear whether the event itself was also taking place on 27 July .
He said that the security cameras confirm the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building .
&quot; We believe that Professor Lathares and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
The Grand Chilean leadership sent a letter to the people : &apos; The police is currently working to find a background to events and victims , and will examine various motives , including the possibility of a family dispute . &apos;
Firms that help your businesses avoid getting next UbB
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ up company , but the surveys were unprofitable .
The answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
And even if he promised anonymous , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; This system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Errett , who is leading the company Madison Reed , which sells e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees in San Franciscos .
So he called on external actors to help .
Start @-@ ups with new types of human resources are disappearing , helping businesses to find out what their workers feel .
By developing and licensing software that aims to measure the involvement of workers , they enable companies to carry out flash surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , offer anonymity for workers and complaint hotlines and , in some cases , allow artists to bypass the C level management and address the Bureau directly .
&apos;There are now tools such as the Strava and Fitler , which are meant to monitor health , but where is Fitbi for your company ? &apos; Asked Jim Barnett , co @-@ founder and CEO Reding City start @-@ up Glint , whose software analysts use companies to measure the inclusion of workers .
According to Erretti , he has received a much better overview of what he thinks and knows about in three years when he has used Glinti .
In addition to investigations and specific teams , it provides a company &apos;s heating card , which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support , enabling them to identify the causes .
Companies have started to understand that they have to stay in touch with their culture of work , so as not to become the next Ubbar , which has been torn up in scandals since the former worker published a bloggermail , which described the harassment of those who had the courage to speak .
For start @-@ ups such as Glint , the desire to have an overview is a profitable business option .
Global governance , regulation and conformity can be worth more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020 according to the website of financial ethics statistics , Let &apos;s talk translations .
The Denveris Colorado start @-@ up company SR , which helps companies to prevent and identify inappropriate behaviour , noted this year interest and an increase in activity against the background of the dubious reputation of Uberia .
FIFcentil has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
Uber recently registered himself as a customer .
Like Glinles , coalition companies will be able to send tailor @-@ made impulse polls , collect confidential answers in real time and look at the problematic areas of heat cards .
It also offers a anonymous textbook which allows workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
And when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; Public opinion has anchored regulators , &quot; Chris Quinlan , founder and CEO , said Agenda centi .
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act unethically , it could face serious consequences , such as consumer boycotts , the departure of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ruby flu , restaurant , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of business , has used modulation for more than a year to ensure workers &apos; awareness of the rules and procedures and to offer an easy way of communicating with the corporation headquarters .
When a worker wanted to announce the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address at the corporation headquarters , he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously .
This was often a damning and inconvenient process , saying James Vitrano , a general adviser , who said that there was no good way of monitoring workers &apos; complaints .
However , at a time when the company makes use of modulation , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices , which did not previously reach management managers operating in other cities or states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I can get away to the hollow experience of the workers of 360 degrees , &quot; said Vitrano , who chairs Ruby hood &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; And we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and employee involvement more seriously in 2002 , after the collapse of the audit company Arthur Andersen &apos;s ethical violations in relation to the Enron scandal .
However , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they cannot prevent their black washing from being hijacked online .
&quot; Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
Both Glint and Acccent offer their software as a service by making companies pay periodically for the use of their products .
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been in support of both start @-@ ups .
3.4 centi financed USD 10 million in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by USD 47 million .
The Glinti invested USD 10 million in November Bessemer Venture partners , increasing the company &apos;s total funding to USD 60 million .
Such investments will not come as a surprise if we take into account the interconnectedness of companies , culture and venture capital .
More and more research shows that today &apos;s workers expect more jobs than before .
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high wages and interesting projects are just on the table .
Workers want to feel they are accepted and valued and devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; If people are happy in the company , they feel they are listening to them and the work they do is satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said Nina McQueen , Vice @-@ President Linkedin , who has a general benefit and experience of staff in the staff department , both Integration cenpti and Glinti .
Investors will make a profit if companies which belong to their portfolio do well ; businesses will do well if workers are committed and involved .
If the analysts on the third side promise to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , then we are not sure that they will receive support .
Data on worker inclusion is important , according to experts in the professional culture .
However , these data will be useless if the company &apos;s monitors do nothing to do with them .
In fact , when a company asks its employees for feedback , it can lead to expectations that changes are ahead of us .
And if the changes do not take place quickly or at all , they could cause disappointment and decrease the involvement of workers .
&quot; When you ask 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conversations , &quot; said Kotter International President Russell Raath , who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&quot; Because if things do not stop , then workers will think : &apos; Did you actually listen to me ?
Do you care ?
And if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
According to Erretti , the Madison Reeval , which is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via Glinti .
And , after receiving feedback from workers disappointed by the pace of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems .
However , Ruby hood is collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will result in a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in industry known for its large turnover .
&quot; If you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vitrano .
&quot; If you lose people , you will lose customers .
And if you lose customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
Euro area stagnating mark is Baltics : Incomes grow rapidly
Although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe , Banimal berg , with reference to the ECB report .
According to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
There is a low debt burden , fast @-@ growing institutions and business @-@ friendly and free market @-@ friendly policies behind success .
&quot; The Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where the EU average has been substantially closer to the purchasing power of a reactor per capita . &quot;
Although the aim is for the overall output of the economy to be equivalent to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2 / 3 / 15 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
Low wages have led the balloers to seek better wages abroad .
Although the European Central Bank sees Baltic in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic .
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only one quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are going very well or rather well .
In the Czech Republic and Poland , it was thought little less than half of those questioned about the economies of their countries .
NCAA &apos;s decision to cancel two @-@ day trends makes Bruinsi &apos;s days long
It is almost 23 o &apos;clock when thrombond UCLA football clubs stop talking at the end of a new exercise in the city of a team .
Some of them have put a burden on the back of their company by revealing their efforts for the first day of the training camp .
For a large part of the team , these gang minutes offer midday couples .
The players taking part in cucumbers will go back to the common scene three hours , before returning to meetings at 6.30 next morning at Wandarman &apos;s football level .
&quot; The next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mora , the Bruinsi treghter , a little before the Monday took Tuesday .
NCAA &apos;s decision to cancel two times a day to reduce the burden of players has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end of the day - to one side of the bargain on Friday .
For this reason , the three first operations of UCLA were prompted to start at 19.15 in order to fit players into an already tight timeline .
Moving from two to two strikes a day means more one day - the beginning of the Bruinsi training camp was increased almost a week ahead compared with the previous season , and for the first time Mora &apos;s six Westwood season is taking place during summer courses .
They intend to have 18 trendars up to 20 August before starting formal preparations for the opening game against Texas A &amp; M in September .
According to Mora , he is in favour of a change in the NCAA rule , although it adds another item to the close schedules of players .
&quot; They have a huge burden three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; And they break through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are a nice young person .
I believe that when the Saturday comes and we have more time , it is really a little bit . &quot;
When the camp is closed , UCLA &apos;s tour operations will be closed , which is not an easy task , however , given the clear view of the parking record close to their fields and the bypassing Luskini centre , the high @-@ class hotels that have already escaped from the net of protection around the gates .
Since this weekend , hotel Bruinsi players are occupying , but Mora recognised that there could be problems with free tobacco during the season .
&apos;We are implementing security measures , &apos; said Mora .
&quot; This is a real cause for concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can filter about a dozen and a tour .
If you have a record of a train , you can do quite a good deal with it .
But we use the security team there and the 8 parking stations .
We are doing our best by using our existing ones .
I will try not to be very concerned about this .
We have a plan in place . &quot;
To address the issue of the election union of Saduare @-@ Ivanova , who was expelled from the Reform Party , Kristiina Ojuland forced to leave the forces of Maria Kaljete , who was forced to withdraw from the Natiina and ECB , in the presence of our Tallinn and the parties in Temes , which creates an electoral union for businessmen in party politics , it seems to be as much as political parties this year to be participating in local elections .
However , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointing voters for them all .
Who is staying on the island ?
If the support office of Edgar Salevare reduced , events may be expected to honour his electoral union .
One member of the national assembly , a few former and present central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
And why is it that some of those who stand shoulder to stand shoulder to stand up in Tallinn and those who are crèches and sisters can look for a company &apos;s &apos; Saduare list &apos; , led by corruption and suspicion of corruption , to become a reality ?
On the Russian poem of a film @-@ made music cameras , which takes part in the urban part of the Lasnamäe ; and , in all ways , the original computer play in which Prime Minister Jüri Rata , Prime Minister , has to avoid lomnipe and hurricans who are on his way when travelling , does the central party , for the first time , seek the votes of the 16th and 17th year @-@ old voters to be allowed to the ballot boxes ?
We look forward to seeing the views of other political parties on the youth election campaign .
If the Kanal 2 or TV3 viewers are confronted with black hall from the beginning of August , there will be two options : To accept that , in future , only ETV , ETV2 + , Tallinn TV and English @-@ language France24 channels or to donate ten @-@ monthly TV operators .
There are probably also those who openly rejoice about advertising @-@ free television experience at the beginning , but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and advertisements .
Innumerical music , folding people and rubbish left on the streets are unpleasant by almost every major music filter .
However , if you do not want to take part in the night , it is worth leaving the festival for the heroes instead of painting at home - and sleeping .
Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
Media publications are quoted by President Donald Trumpi , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card .
The plan provides for a 50 000 @-@ year reduction in the number of legal immigrants , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
The new rules have been proposed by Republican and supported by the President .
The bill goes to the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; This law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money because it will change the way in which green cards are issued to US citizens .
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
The new application process will give priority to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and to the skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Trump in the US media publications .
Siberia seto young people are moving to the city , pensioners back to the land .
Jevseyev Anatol continues the famous seto gold miners along the River Maana .
She works 140 kilometres away from home to Maana tributaries at Kuvai as a motor driver .
This is a tough job : Two months in a row , 12 hours of work without rest days , and then only 10 days at home and again .
During the three years of the Archtel , Anatol has seen the culmination only once .
&apos;There is a resounding procedure : When you go in , you will check thoroughly that you do not lead to a viral , and if you turn out that you do not take it &apos; , you will speak Anatol .
Mare Piho , speaking in the village of Haida , to the local seto Jaga , who has spoken a great deal to him about the memory of his family in Siberia .
The archaic culture still preserved by Siberian setoses will also have an impact on the home seals , because it is just so shocking , is of the most comprehensive view of Piho Mare .
His first investigation trip to Siberia will be 30 years later this year .
During that time , he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year .
How much was missing out to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here ?
This is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I have taken this into account in the words of Siberian seto men who have thought about it themselves .
It is difficult to say exactly that , because up to 30 people could come to one group at that time , but the passport was only given to a man .
The passport was given only one thing , but was children , sisters and others Nazi children .
Look at how much the territory was here .
It was many times greater than that of the historian .
After all , it was necessary to educate , manage it in some way .
Setinos came here as farmers , but their lives changed because they came to areas that were not only linked to agriculture but also to the river ( palgiparation ) , gold mines , industry .
For example , in New @-@ Petseris , many pigs later entered the city of Krasnojarsk @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P. ) when it was formed .
Did the setos form the majority of the population in this region at that time ?
Yes , they lived in a compacket .
In addition , the tradition continued to marry one another for a long time and a lot of child abduction .
Seven to eight children in the family were common .
How many cultures of Siberian setopes differed and different from that of mother land ?
They are different , although what was said here was once the same .
They gave rise to a great many popular ideas .
They then also made a difference ( ideas of the people ) , but they always made the difference that had been brought about and what had been done here .
Climate change has had a major impact on the traditional rivalry of seals , because there is a cold crop here .
The proposed changes have changed .
For example , Setomaal meat was skinned , but it was simply frozen here .
Where are the villages of Siberian setopes and what life is living there ? / graphics : Alari Paluends
The link with the mother country was spiritually strong , it was considered very important .
It seems to me that now this Setuony will return to it , it will affect them .
Those girls who have lived in families have listened to amazing stories .
Piho is thinking of the people of the Estonian delegation , who came to the Queen of Haida at the beginning of July and lived in homes for four days - J. P .
What is still here is shocking .
&quot; It is all too easy to come and go , too , because the city has an excellent location : Railway hubs and roads at the crossroads , &quot; says Reigo Tamm from Tapy .
The city is no longer just a military capital , we have a lot of nature , sports and cultural places , and the carpet gets anywhere .
Tapa is a tip @-@ pop of the city !
The Linera through the White River is a small island where the tablets tend to be hijacking .
&quot; This beautiful place does not appear on the train window , &quot; don Reigo .
Anyone who does not fear cold water can flood in the river , because the river is full of resources .
I have been there , you can do it !
The river &apos;s water can keep a long time and just do a romander - it can look at the river and think about life and behind it .
I , too , have been there with my brilliant words .
Ooperisolist Tampere has , after everything else , visited the river basin to get used to its aarians : &apos; That place is along the city , no one can come to answer if I say my own stories &apos; .
&quot; There is a wonderful view of the Tapy mountain , but there are also health private players where you can drink , skip the winter and play , for example , Sgolf playing - golf tracks have been made , chains can borrow from sports centres , &quot; Reigo is leading .
Old people are , of course , there with their own system , but I have not yet been able to play there .
Mrs Rasmus Goll Tapale obviously has to be invited because she has experienced a discgolfenthr and she has the chains .
Perhaps he will lend me credit .
Reigo and Männikull mountains were inextricably inseparable from the current anomaly .
At least during hours .
There have been many tears left to this memory , many fraudsters , and you can in my sport .
Not to mention the broken belts and sleeping bells .
&quot; The entire city of the city is now full of construction works , all of which will become unknown , &quot; praised Reigo .
However , the old and tired stick building is a very attractive place to play oral discoveries .
I am pleased that , in 2012 , the head of R.A.A.A.A.M adopted a note of my idea and had to be made to the summer theatre with his theatre .
Even though this year &apos;s theatre &apos; Alegai Karenin &apos; has just passed , on 11 August , the railway station &apos; Elluwake &apos; is in the railway station when the old building is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; Between 11 and 13 August , the city of Tapa has Day , which has opened up open doors and clothes of cultural activities , including a popular tour , will be speaking to Reigo , who is proposing to visit the city from 9 to 11 in just a few days .
In the tiny three houses of 1 May , the museum is already in 1994 .
&apos;The house is small , but there is a great deal of publicity and information , &apos; rejects Reigo &apos;s place , which is full of the history of the city of Tapa , most of which focuses on railways and sisters .
Reigo muds that , if you go through all the recommended sites in Tapal , you will lose a lot of hot air but , fortunately , the small city is full of coffee .
&quot; We have such good eating places and sometimes , when you sit in cafés , you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad , you describe him .
Educated and young soldiers coming to Tapy spend a great deal of time in bottle cafés , sestap there is a curious feeling that you are in Estonia and your home city , but that is the interlocutor together .
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or American people .
The wars , yes , we are moving a lot .
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering
Telecanal bTV quoted a foreign minister who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering .
In the morning of 1 August , the police arrested people who illegally ordered a group on the Sithonia Peninsula , including two Bulgarians .
They were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulgarians were later released .
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone who is caught up in a place where there is no provision for it .
Checks will continue throughout the season .
According to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
The wolves that teach the people are breaking the sheep .
Finn farmers will have to give the wolves their carpet &apos; educational material again after year - the wolves that apparently teach the wolves have already broken a number of sheep .
This year , the wolves in Hiiu &apos;s county have broken sheep three times , 23 sheep and eight have been injured , signing the Hiiu page .
Soil was only three , one year earlier , 124 .
There are also data from the Environment Agency in the syndrome , where soil was not born in Hishells and the information from the How hunting Council was obtained that two wolves were fixed on the island this year .
In the Ööl on Monday , the wolves unleashed 15 sheep in the village of Emtens Kabina and injured the 18 survivors .
In the afternoon of Wednesday , the wolves in the village of Rehebasla were burnt up as one sheep in the pasture and badly injured the other , who had to be made an emergency .
Rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms to the environment ( GMOs ) and a law amending plant protection products .
The amendment to the law removes the creation of a separate collection of data for both genetically modified ( GM ) crops and operators , using the plant health register in the future .
In addition , the GM crop management operator is changing the obligation to have prior agreement with the designated person dealing with beekeeping .
Although there is currently no increase in GM crops in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
This is at least as long as there are no decisions to declare Estonia GM @-@ free , &quot; Sigmar Suu Kyi , President of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs , said .
&quot; However , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors , in the Annex .
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of GM crop sites and business operators in the EU , introduces requirements for the management of GM crops and for starting economic activities .
Specifically , as regards beekeeping , the current obligation to inform beekeepers of the cultivation of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeepers before starting cultivation .
The draft law has been sent to Ministries to coordinate .
All interested parties will have the opportunity to find out about this in the draft information system and , if they so wish , to present their views to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
The proposed changes will affect , in particular , those operating in the plant farming sector , beekeepers and the agricultural profession .
In the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 810 - has been authorised to grow .
However , so far no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops .
The reason is that in Estonia there is no mammoth , no European media Observatory , which is resistant to land line mon 810 .
There are also the ordings of this magic line that have been extended to the southern regions , and this in May is not appropriate to our climate conditions .
In order to be secure , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect potential contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various suicides , maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia .
The analysis of the samples made showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soybean varieties in Estonia were not included in genetically modified organisms .
The above may , in turn , conclude that in Estonia GM crops are not deliberately cultivated , and it was also confirmed that there had been no random contamination .
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United in the form of Nemanja Maticu , &quot; genius &quot;
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United Kingdom has colluded in the form of Nemanja Maticu , &apos; genius &apos; , after having given his debate against the central player , Samlov , on Wednesday evening .
A player bought over GBP 40 million from Chell in Dublin started a last seasonal game in the UEFA Super Cupi line against Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 in the form of a football match , while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on attacks .
However , having sidelined the Aride seasonal Asian architecture , Maticl was badly needed to bury and only have adopted 45 minutes , which , according to Mourinho , must be corrected by a firm before the Premier League season commenced .
&quot; He needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genious nonsense - he has the courtesy of football , &quot; said Mourinho .
&quot; We will help him to get a shape as soon as possible . &quot;
Like Geneva , at the Aviva stage , other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romeva lu Diamandouros were inaugurated and Mourinho suddenly started to put his novel man in place at the start of the season .
The Independent public this week said that Mourinho still wanted to recruit three football clubs , but he confirmed that the club had already done a &apos; excellent job &apos; by concluding contracts with three of its four priority languages .
&quot; I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four , &quot; he added .
&quot; I am even happier if they can carry out four four of them , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
Another warm poet took the floor on the GSM Embassy on 1 August and this time in Muhus .
Mati Martinson , living in Shuves , has received the first battery poet in SCarves , and this washing cell is flying around , leaving the washing ground and joining the Large Task Force in the Mullutu @-@ Great Gulf .
This is because there are no fertility fields in SCarves , the island &apos;s voice is written .
This Tuesday , in order to beat the Kurds , it was a little bit too late for the fate of another boy to come to the island of Muhu .
According to Martinson , the installation of accompanying persons is , in fact , an international project carried out by Aundr Leito and Ivar Ojete .
Soil was supplied by a cutshell called Mati GSM Embassy in Shuves Turkey .
&quot; His activities are all on the internet : How he went to Spain in winter , went back a long time on the German @-@ Polish border and then the Saareland came , Martinson spoke .
The British inventor was able to install a microchip in his own body in order to get away with hand @-@ hand houses and cars .
The British inventor received the first person in a country to be installed microchip so that he can only open his own edge , get to the office and even launch a car .
33 @-@ year @-@ old Steven Northam children are tempted to install a small chip between their pöp and the finger of the name , and will now provide this service to businesses and private individuals who wish to make their lives easier through their own company , through BioTeq .
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson , a consultant @-@ anestesiologist of the Royal County of Hampshire in Winchester Hants , to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards .
Technology is similar to that of micro @-@ chip installed on cats and bags , and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure .
The Northam company is also changing the songs of houses and cars so that they are compatible with a chip , asking for one snow GBP 300 .
This child &apos;s father has installed a technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4 , which will start when he has his hand in the rol .
The White House &apos;s audit cost to taxpayers of thousands
According to military documents printed in the magazine , the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicopter last month to the southern American production event cost taxpayers as much as USD 24 000 .
The green and white colour Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , termed Marine One , during President &apos;s office , was a central feature of the event in the American construction programmes in White Main on 17 July .
President Donald Trump , Vice @-@ President Mike Pence , and senior officials of the White House , unveiled industrial products from all 50 countries on their move .
The helicopter built in Connecticutis was sponsored with a clone from the repute , a fire @-@ fighting car from Wisconten and a walker made in Miscellub .
According to the documents of Mrs Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX @-@ 1 ) , the chief cabinet responsible for the operation of the HeliCopter ordered the presence of a helicopter in the military office of the White House to take a little 36 hours before the helicopter for the &apos; extraordinary &apos; event on the southern horror .
&apos;I wanted you to be aware of this , because this is an unusually high @-@ profile event , &apos; said HMX @-@ 1 komandör a day before the event was launched in an e @-@ mail for your superiority , the chief officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
The message stated that the helicopter would come to the southern horror on 17 July morning at 7 : 00 : 00 , and will remain there until the same night between 18 and 21 .
It was included that , if the departure from the White House were to be present , a second epathy is needed because of the restrictions on working time .
The original flight team was at helicopter during the event , and the security team of the estur remained close to the aircraft throughout the period of stay on the ground .
It was not possible to read out from the documents provided by the magazine whether or not the other ethos were eventually needed .
The Hatch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political ends .
Documents show that HMX @-@ 1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; We asked whether this would violate Hatch &apos;s law and we were told that &apos; the commander wrote &apos; .
&apos;You seem to have no choice , &apos; responded to a senior officer .
The White House declared the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; event to be a formal event , and Hatch &apos;s law would not have covered it .
But even official events have political undertones .
The President backed the efforts of the Health Reform at the time in the Senate and praised attempts to keep government regulations in check .
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon .
The Presidents must use them to travel .
However , the requirement to use them purely photographic is unusual .
His first campaign event in Floridas Melbourne in February attracted the President &apos;s flight to the background , and he spends Twitter &apos;s account on messages which complain about how his predecessor &apos;s flight was used .
&quot; White l Mal is very pleased with the exhibition &quot; made in America , where products were represented in all 50 countries produced by American workers from American materials , &quot; said conscientier Lindsay Walters , the spokesman of the White House .
HMX @-@ 1 teams often carry out tests around Washington and in the southern horror in order to get down to the White House of the President of the United States with a centimetres of precision .
When the Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , the HMX @-@ 1 White House ordered 58 samples .
According to the Commissioner , the flight flight to the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; flight crews was considered to be the norm for a month &apos;s study flights .
The first armier helicopter flying another 11 hours for &apos; non @-@ President &apos; support missions &apos; on that day .
According to the White House , no other actor in this event burden the taxpayer &apos;s wallets .
According to the representative of Sikorsky , the company was not involved in carrying out filtering on the southern horror .
HMX @-@ 1 will not maintain the budgetary documents of President flights and it will be difficult to identify the exact costs of the event .
However , at the hourly prices of the defence Ministry for the financial year 2017 , VH @-@ 3D will be reimbursed at USD 24 380 per hour .
In the Eskaadr documents , the flight was extended by 30 minutes from its main base , de Quantico , from Virginian airport to both directions .
The White House claims that the actual cost of using helicopter is well below that amount .
&quot; The calculation of taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated reimbursement rates is very misleading , &quot; said Walters .
&quot; These estimates of compensation include staff , maintenance and many other irrevocable expenditure , which will be taken into account for annual appropriations . &quot;
According to the 2015 winter study , the Ministry of Defence does not include staff costs , although they cover fuel , maintenance and contract costs .
The former press officer of the White House , Sean Sharier , defended the use of helicopter at that time at the event .
&apos;The point is to show things made in America this week , &apos; Sstoper said .
&quot; And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticuti are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds , if not even thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
And I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on .
So it is right , of course , to highlight this . &quot;
It is not clear whether or not the Trump was involved in the deployment of a helicopter in the southern horror , or not , but the fire @-@ fighting car behind the wheel .
Within the White House , Trump Sikorsky addressed representatives by handing out media outlets about company products in his personal aircraft fleet .
&apos;I know Sikorskis very well , &apos; said the President , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .
Gari Šadeiko - Very arrived through tears of peace and joy
In 2011 , MMil Daetis hit Sadeikot in the last area , 800 m beverages took the footwear , and the stage was taken away with the beach .
Just before that , he had been able to get zero on China &apos;s university @-@ faire .
In 2012 , the Helsinki Helsinki Wall was a violation of cheap injuries , but in London , it received 613 items 23 .
However , I have continued to do so .
After the opening day 2013 , Moscow MF received a carnage injury on Estonia &apos;s track .
Two years later , he became the 15th seat of Beijing and was in the Olympic Games , but that was more than what he wanted for sportsman .
Sadeiko was only a bubble through the most pressing patrons if the outcome of the Amsterdam Embassy was not recorded at the beginning .
I would just like to put together one proper multilogue once .
Once &apos; , sprayed Sadeiko .
Worse still lies ahead : A month later , his Olympic contest in Rios on account of his resignation was already covered by the first obstacle .
Time had to be taken down - was it necessary to continue the 7 competition at all ?
Is the two @-@ day effort still worth all this ?
Neiu thought a long time , but found peace .
I could think twice !
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
Fortunately , there was time for us to treat ourselves all and to think about it head on .
&apos;You know that I am not wearing a cocktag &apos; , Šadeiko is talking about his self @-@ determination .
I was able to turn a clean page and move on with a new momentum .
Treener Anne hill said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of negligence , but he realised that , above all , the sportsman himself had to get to the bottom .
After all , he had been so repressed by everyone .
It was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; The Gard said , however , that he is not giving up and he wants to prove what he is worth , says remember .
Now it is going to have some kind of peace .
It is doing so to joy .
The contest came back in May , when the Šadeiko set 6280 items in the new Estonian Reports at the GFjellzthemselves multilateral competition .
In a high @-@ level competition , he improved his personal top class with almost a metre ( 13.89 ) and drinks a record @-@ close @-@ time barrier .
Then there was a multicompetitive feeling that it was not at all a ceiling , but only a hunger in the first competition .
She has been instructed for years by Nagories that Sadeiko is a Muslim student .
She is ready to be sportsman ; she is well trained .
If something does a problem or is wrong , then he says it immediately .
He feels his own body and he is confident in his sense .
That is what we must do .
I cannot say what exactly must and will follow .
The new approach has also been found in Šadeiko .
&apos;I am not the one who makes the best of the trend &apos; , he says and says that it is most important to have the right sense , because it also provides a good result .
Baby walkers of young children are happy to do so .
The good emotion has also offered the words of close proximity to the Šadesian Chamber .
Both his former teacher , Maris hill and sister Grete , has recently become grandparents and has received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;It has been rather interesting &apos; , says Sadeiko .
One alcohol whose drinking equals &apos; training &apos; .
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is an elephant so great a wine game that believes that wine can train better than any other thing in the world .
Sheperd is a neuroscientist of Yale University .
His message is not about alcohol , or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
When we sleep , wine was complicated by tailing , enjoying it and perceived the aftertaste , we are putting our brain in order to create a taste for wine .
In the words of Sheperd , the bovine olecules do not actually contain a taste , but a taste arises from the way wine stimulates the brain .
He points out how the brain &apos; sees &apos; colours &apos; .
&quot; Taste is not wine ; taste creates wine as a sweet , &quot; says Sheperd .
Things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , the number of our age , summer and even sylje produced by man .
Sheperd , of course , admits that wine is not full of Jews .
&apos;There must be more &apos; , he says .
If you are too big a longer , the system will be over @-@ saturated .
Excess wine drinking can do no harm to the brain - according to a study in 2004 , people who drink more than three glass products with wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced spiritual capacity .
10 % less pay for ICT workers in Estonia than colleagues
Figures from the staff search company fund reveal that 10 % of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less than their colleagues .
The 10 % pay gap is between men and women , writes the portal Geenius .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay survey .
A total of 8 577 posts was examined .
63 % of posts were employed by men .
&quot; Although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of businesses considered that there is no pay gap , in reality , the average annual salary of men is 10 % higher than that of women and men aged 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said Foncrates analysts Ilmar Majala .
&quot; Narcos &quot; 3rd season advertising clip : Now that Pablo Escobar has gone , Netflix hittsars is at the heart of the Cali cartel .
Despite the fact that in the second season of the &apos; Narcos &apos; , the killer of Pablo Escobari was exposed , the Netflix sari is far from over .
The third and fourth season has been confirmed by the quota @-@ handling service , and the first one has already been produced by a clip of advertising that is stranglehold the horns .
In the third season , DEA will turn its attention to the richest drug business organisation in the world - the Cali cartel .
They are acting under the leadership of four powerful Christian fathers , such as Ford 500 companies , simply with more bribery to the government and more violent acts .
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is a leader of the cartel , with Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) its brain , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) running links with Mexico and Chepe Santaţz London ( Pepe Rapazote ) operating in New York .
The advertised advertising clip sees Pedro Pascali return to Javier Penana as a person recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement assistance in the war against drugs .
Other new players include Matias Varela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt Whell , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .
The third season of the &apos; Narcos &apos; will be open on 1 September .
According to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics .
On Wednesday , the head of the UN mission for Afghanistan said that elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
Nicholas Haysom , head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , said that hundreds of women stand for election to local councils , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; By underlining the importance of women &apos;s role , it cannot be exaggerated , &quot; he said in a statement made on Wednesday .
Elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process .
The local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
For its part , the Taliban have threatened the electoral process , which coincides with the transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
This year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is given calmly to one democratically elected government to the next .
According to Mr Haysom , women &apos;s strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan increases .
According to the independent Election Commission in Afghanistan , 1.2 million registered voters are women .
The joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both for large and small .
There is always too little common time , but the trend with the paste is a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you were sleep in the summer , live loved ones are always on the ball and come out with your fine voice with an impatient reminder : &apos; Let us now also be a trendy ! &apos;
Aelta insulation - It is a very good thing to have a normal gold game or a flag on the coast .
A piece is the foundation for persisting in the form of footwear and tuna - who would then like to take the form of sandy @-@ sleeping excesses over the summer ?
It is wonderful to use children instead of a chicken !
Firstly , it is secure and convenient , and the difficulty is gradually increasing at the same pace as the training staff .
It is also possible to make villages with quite a large number of children .
The child teaches the balance , counts the sentences and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
Larger children can , at the same time , make their own villages .
The extent of the movement lies in the scarcity of land and in the cleansing of hands .
Keeping the finger straight , the Palu miniablis , properly .
A child can read the flames and feel like a lecturer .
The planet is an extremely exciting but hopeless exercise for the child .
But it is easy to do it .
Play @-@ plank : Take a long planguColonn to get through .
In fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much easier to do if , in the meantime , a friend can hand his hand .
If you add the burden , you can keep a planade , you can keep a little on the market , and you can walk around it .
Additional care may be made to plant a child &apos;s bottles , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
While the crabs join the sand , the triggers , the ash and the cane meat burden , such as the infection , are becoming ripe .
The child walks to the shoes in such a way that his body is distributed equally in advance and behind .
For security , you can keep your hands closed .
All the legs and sisters of the knife .
It is possible to fly , cut off , strike a balance and be difficult .
A little lecturer &apos;s life is an exhortation if he gets little in every fire .
There is a further burden in front of your feet .
Check that the back door would remain in a neutral position .
It is much easier for children themselves to make crons and plagues .
A bull with a hand and a wedding .
Following the child &apos;s safety , the burst , and the hotel in a neutral position .
The favourite and big fun of all children !
For the elderly , however , the whole body trend is truly effective .
The sports tools were Ott ( 10 ) , Säde ( 8 ) , luck ( 4 ) .
From the Philippines to the heart of mopeds
Booked bags are the summer clash , which has become a lump product in recent years , which even has to be hanged at the top of the hand in one of the correct summer auctions , and has been able to display price labels in the shop , despite its modest origin .
A piece of rubber @-@ red cows is probably one of the things that has existed once in the life of the law and which has not been aroused with particular emotion .
That is simply there and , if there is no , there is nothing at all .
Now , however , lungs are entering a real race , and mopedestrian bags have replaced their mushrooms against simple bureaucrats by summer months .
This is not only a coastline , but today it is also just as popular as a street , and more courageous women even walk it to the office .
Here , however , it is worth making it clear whether you are sitting in the summer , or whether you are still worth postponing the Embassy and the laptops to a little more official .
However , the wealth of tolerance has made beer bags a real love of women in the summer .
For example , when we read foreign momotives , the first thing is that moeoghurers are bringing their holidays to the local market as the first thing , and buying some beer bags , which are then the truck of a whole holiday period , and which goes hand in hand with the market and also as a friend on the city .
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a bigger wolf and sell or give them to their loyal readers .
In doing so , it is worth noting that there is a demand among readers for women in the real world ( and men ! ) to probably involve each other in the fishing ground in order to become a happy owner of some homes .
In some ways , this madness is also understandable , because the rare are the times when , in the fashion of yesterday , a few pieces of hijacking have been able to buy for just a few decades .
It is true that white traders have also discovered a simple way of earning money here , and so more luxury brands are sold up for a few hundred or a thousand euros .
Obviously , in order to ensure that rich customers do not have to feel easy to die who proclaim with some cheap dogs .
For example , it is possible to buy Dolce &amp; Gabbana hand over EUR 1 000 .
However , for the interpretation of Changel bregkot , a sum of EUR 6 000 can be found in the circulation .
In contrast to most motives , however , lotteries do not inherit at all with a few great mosques , but their story began in a far more distant way .
Admittedly , the beer bags come far from the Philippines , where they have been carried out on a large scale .
The bunch of rubbish bags is there , in particular , export trading , and there is very often no mention of local relocations .
Admittedly , the adage technique dates back to the 14th century and is rather a series of normal corps .
However , as the beer does not need to be as hard red as corps , they will be accompanied by muscles and other materials that make the copper more personalised and , by extension , more reactive .
For example , recently , there are particularly trendy dogs , where paints or skins have been packaged .
However , the full print can be sent by the addicts first and foremost to the actor , Jane Birkini , the biggest bundled beer of whom had not been seen before .
Namely , he sued the House of Translation with all sorts of clothing packages and did not even have to go much to the Cannes Film Festival .
However , today &apos;s popularity of the applicants does not play a smaller role in ensuring them is a hot head and , unlike all other summer productions , does not have to care for them by means of special funds , but it also deprives the water and the wet .
As is still the case with &apos; trendy robbery &apos; initiatives , in addition to classical navy , brands have come out with all possible interpretations .
For example , if they want to be able to obtain a hardliner bottle or a little bit of a boom .
At the same time , it is worth remembering that the classical beer will never go away with a mosque , but with beer flu .
But what is the classical beer , then ?
For centuries now , a bunch of beer @-@ red cows has been classified as classical , reminiscent of its style , is on the wall , and there are short , as well as lenders , pitfalls .

A man who disappeared in the island three days ago was found .
Aare left in his home town of Kärla on Wednesday evening in an unknown direction .
The brain had the last hand on the phone yesterday , on Friday evening , and positioning the phone was the site of the man to the west island , the village of Myles , who was sought with helicopter to the heart of the night and the homes .
His phone was then empty , and the location of the man was therefore no longer possible to identify .
The police continued to search this morning .

GMB is concerned about investments at McVitie &apos;s Glasgow plant
The company expects the managers of the mature producer and McVitie to confirm long @-@ term production plans at the company &apos;s Glasgow plant .
According to GMB Scotland , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment .
More than 500 people are employed in the case of Hobnobsi and rich know @-@ how and other products .
McVitie &apos;s owner Plas said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years .
There were workers and trade union chairmen who have been paid there &apos; are the first to hear &apos; when something changes change in the operation of the factory .
In a letter sent to the manager of the company , GMB Scotland , McVitie , addressed a request to &apos; allay the concerns about the lack of funding for modernising production lines &apos; .
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said : &apos; The fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the object on the customs / VIS business needs and the future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned .
Several generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow , an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social housing .
Therefore , in terms of jobs , pay and well @-@ being in the eastern part of Glasgow , Brexti , the rise in living costs and the sustained fall in production , the top @-@ up production company in McVitie is badly needed . &quot;
The Pladise representative said : &apos; At the time , he received a letter from the GMB Scott only yesterday , and he is directly answered by the company , since we value active engagement with workers and trade union representatives .
Two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers in Rabat and the representatives of the GMB , which openly discussed a number of issues .
We then discussed with workers that , like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are reviewing our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
He added : &apos; In recent years we have invested over GBP 5 million on the site of Customs , most of which have gone to production lines and to improve procedures .
We fully understand the heritage of customs as a production object , and if there were any changes to the activities of the object , then workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach to Neyra ?
La vie can regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not give up in its efforts to attract Neymar to his ranks by offering an offer of GBP 189 million to be stolen , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquest ?
This bold approach has opened summer as a transitional window , and the Ligue 1 club is ready to demolish more than twice the current world record , which was set up in the previous season with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester Unitetle for GBP 89 million .
Once completed , Neyra will become the world &apos;s most expensive player and , at the same time , the most paid professional sportsman in the world , who will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from PSG .
Barcelona is also an indication of the way in which we approach ourselves and of the breaking down of Neyra , even though the source close to the Catalansi leadership confirms that the club has always taken the best care of its arrival in Turin in 2013 .
But did the PSG President warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago ?
When Manchester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blair Matutis Agreement in 2014 , the Nasser Al @-@ Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who think about recruiting some of the best players in the PSG .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they are concerned about some of our players , we are going to accept them and contact them , &quot; said Al @-@ Khelaif .
&quot; We respect all clubs .
But if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appears to have moved beyond this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the PSG central player , Marco Verratti .
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow an Italian to leave , under any circumstances , and that Barcelona could be a setback as a result of this interest , removing one of its precious assets in the form of Neyra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges and not borders after Brexitit .
&quot; Brexit is in serious danger of breaking the wool between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Varadkar during his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
Cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods , said Varadkar .
&quot; It is our vision for the future : Building bridges , not borders , &quot; she stressed .
According to Varadkari , Britain would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as this cannot be achieved , it will remain part of the European single market .
It would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
Another way to make Britain &apos;s departure smoother would be to create a European Union @-@ United Kingdom Customs Union , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
Noting that there was such an agreement with Turkey , Varadkar said : &apos; We could certainly have this with Britain . &apos;
The alternative to this would be a return to customs points , which would declare historical division and political failure .
&apos;Ensuring trade , prosperity and peace &apos; said the Irish Prime Minister .
He called Brexitit a &apos; challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that the result could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland .
The Irish Prime Minister met leaders of the main Irish parties when visiting Belfast .
