four members of Cape Verde Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to Mr Posselt , the police in Spain detained the leader of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape K@@ alli@@ ro@@ vo Group &apos; in Estonia , S@@ pin@@ Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , who is known as S@@ dra K@@ Cape K@@ Cape v@@ ski in the criminal world .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch arrested in Spain was arrested at the Court &apos;s trial .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
it is suspected that the so @-@ called &apos; Cape ro@@ vo &apos; criminal community is aged between 27 and 57 years of life , who commit mainly to drug crimes .
in Spain , the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained in M@@ ala province Mi@@ ja@@ s .
in Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of which has been collected according to the criminal community &apos;s data , and two are members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicate that tasks and roles were clearly divided into the criminal community .
the purpose of criminal activities was to commit drug crimes and thus serve the proceeds of crime , &quot; commented on the head of pre @-@ trial proceedings , Public Prosecutor Va@@ me Ver@@ te .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; added the Prosecutor .
it is people who have also been involved in the law enforcement authorities in the past , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Ver@@ te stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common@@ place for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; commented on the Prosecutor Ver@@ te .
the head of the central criminal police service , ago in Le@@ is , said that the detention was preceded by nearly half a year of preliminary examination .
&quot; in the first half of the week , we had a long history of work and , at the same time , in Estonia and Spain , suspected of committing crimes , &quot; said .
it added that central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have a good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil card .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are yet another message to criminals that we also get them in the hands of another Europe , &quot; said Le@@ is .
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that , in the absence of a suspicion , men can continue to carry out new crimes , which is why the prosecution service requested their arrest and the Court also approved it .
the man arrested in Spain expects his surrender to Estonia .
in this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation .
the criminal proceedings are carried out by the Office for organised crime organised by the central police and led by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the city of Tallinn was convicted of blackmail by Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch in 2005 and punished him with a five @-@ year imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ Å¡@@ it was held the second most important in the Estonian criminal world following the Alliance of Gu@@ el@@ les , Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , from Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , from Cape Verde , came to the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Ad@@ mittedly , he was tax@@ ing tax@@ i drivers and prostitution and calling for a monthly ro@@ tation tax on business@@ men .
international joint operations , the confiscation of criminal proceeds and the judgments in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest court rulings , the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ a@@ i crime community , eight accused persons who seized EUR 80 000 of criminal proceeds , or the judgment against nine persons in 2006 , that Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v created a criminal community aimed at illegal trade in cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in East Vir@@ u@@ land and southern Estonia .
there is a total of around EUR 71 500 of recorded criminal proceeds .
in these criminal matters , it has ensured that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and , if necessary , carry out operations in any country of the European Union .
civil rights group war@@ ns of Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ se travel
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ ancient People of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ MA ) has warned people of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State of the State .
the Group &apos;s statement states : &apos; Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i State in the NA@@ SR , which applies until 28 August 2017 , calls on all American travellers , visitors and sou@@ ri@@ ans to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious when moving around the state , given the whole of the Roma &apos;s dubious racial events , which have recently taken place in the state and at this point &apos; .
according to NA@@ P , the group urged the group to issue a travel warning both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that the state of law @-@ enforcement targets are largely minority targets .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
they are being drawn up because of their sk@@ in colour , beaten or killed , &apos; said NA@@ la Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , President R@@ od Cha@@ pel , The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints before . &quot;
this is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for the US State .
the group referred to events such as racist insul@@ ts of black students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of 28 @-@ year @-@ old black S@@ and@@ er@@ si .
S@@ and@@ ers died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , after he had run through the state of ben@@ petrol and the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police cap@@ tured him , without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the comment refers to the recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i Prosecutor , which shows that the national flag state is likely to halt the cars of black drivers by 75 % more likely than those of white drivers .
&apos;@@ The comment is for people to be aware and to warn their families , friends and collabor@@ ators for what might happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is , &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it is to be spent on bail @-@ in money or to inform relatives about the fact that they cross the state . &quot;
the latest figures from F@@ B@@ I hate crime were documented in the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is in 2015 at 100 hate crime , which puts the state in the state of 16 places similar to the number of offences in the country .
the travel warning is also a response to the new law of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which makes it difficult for the company to be brought to court for reasons of discrimination in search of housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had previously issued travel barriers for T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona , following the adoption by these states of immigration laws obli@@ ging local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences , because , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , it increases racial profiling .
usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or inc@@ in@@ eration , may be caused by five different - A , B , C , D and E @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis .
all these vir@@ uses provo@@ ke a fier@@ ce combustion of the li@@ ver .
however , the worst cost is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B and C , which can develop further into the cir@@ cus of the cir@@ cus , and pay for cancer .
the epidemi@@ ology of the Health Agency , Ku@@ mar@@ r , is saying that acute he@@ pati@@ tis disease events are the same for all types of li@@ ver inc@@ in@@ eration - f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ gue , pl@@ undering , E@@ as@@ per@@ ation , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic emissions , horse mackerel , meat and swe@@ eten@@ ers , and s@@ wine and li@@ mas@@ ters .
the last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of the li@@ ver bur@@ n .
children can go through he@@ pati@@ tis without disease .
the various types of heat can be determined only on the basis of laboratory research data .
tackling he@@ pati@@ tis can go to chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and for decades without disease phenomena , which means that man may not know anything about his or her dangerous disease .
Mr Ku@@ rel points out different forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their cul@@ mination more closely .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread from a disease to humans and infec@@ t us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , se@@ als , emissions of infected human beings and hands on food , soil , objects , sugar and drug consumption .
a he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis was carried out by family members and carers , people who suffer from chronic pay , sex people with men , sex men , drug users , countries with he@@ pati@@ tis A high levels of he@@ pati@@ tis .
the infection can be prevented by vaccination , in particular by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot of travel and he@@ pati@@ tis A .
in addition , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands , before eating food , to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread sick people in contact with blood , drug injec@@ tion , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic treatment , au@@ g@@ mentation , blood @-@ contaminated sites ( too@@ th@@ p@@ aste , pregnancy tools ) , the use of don@@ ating blood , he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , sex sex and he@@ pati@@ tis suff@@ e@@ rers / he@@ pati@@ tis .
the he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis infection is accompanied by drug addi@@ cts , the sex partners of infected human beings , sex men , the mother @-@ born , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , and passengers visiting the health , rescue workers and police officers and countries with he@@ pati@@ tis B high disease .
in order to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis , it is possible to vacc@@ in@@ ate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vacc@@ in@@ ate people from risk groups and , in addition to chronic pay @-@ related diseases , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
he@@ pati@@ tis is other preventive measures : avoiding the hygiene and man@@ ure of stran@@ gers , other sharp resources and sy@@ stal@@ gic @-@ coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ot@@ teries , and the use of th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic and au@@ g@@ ili@@ ation , and the use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection , or preventing sexual risk @-@ taking .
vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis is part of the national immunity scheme and free of charge for children in Estonia .
He@@ pati@@ tis C vir@@ uses spread sick people in connection with blood , drug injec@@ tion , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic , au@@ g@@ mentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated sites , donor blood , he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , person sex and he@@ pati@@ tis disease to animals / new@@ born babies .
C @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ infected infections are accompanied by drug users , sex partners of infected people , sex men with men , inf@@ ant inf@@ ants , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , health care , rescue and police officers , HIV @-@ infected infections , and passengers travelling to countries with he@@ pati@@ tis C .
prevention of he@@ pati@@ tis C is : non @-@ ref@@ ra@@ ining from hygiene and man@@ age@@ able devices , other sharp resources and sy@@ stal@@ stal@@ gic @-@ coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ot@@ teries , ly@@ ric@@ ation and au@@ g@@ mentation , and the use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infections .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
the he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis virus is caused by the D@@ he@@ pati@@ tis virus , which is growing in the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
as a result , D@@ he@@ pati@@ tis B infections , combined with he@@ pati@@ tis B or super@@ inf@@ ants , occur in chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading exposure to blood and other body liquids , contaminated with need@@ les @-@ coun@@ ters , sexu@@ ally and sel@@ dom infected animals .
the he@@ pati@@ tis risk group is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B infections and people who do not have immunity from he@@ pati@@ tis B .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis B , which also protects people from infection with he@@ pati@@ tis D .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread by fe@@ e@@ ble means of drinking water and food , including little hot @-@ treated beef , fish and marine car@@ b@@ ons , donor blood , joint sy@@ ch@@ es@@ ses and more infected animals .
passengers can be infected with high levels of E he@@ pati@@ tis in countries .
E@@ he@@ pati@@ tis preventive measures are the enforcement of hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands after slaughter , prior to food production and feed , after hospital care .
F@@ ru@@ its and vegetables are was@@ hing before consumption , avoiding eating little hot @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , only safe drinking water and avoiding drug consumption .
although the last round of competitors tried to printing four times the Olympic winner , 34 @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ara@@ h final hu@@ b took power and won 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
the F@@ ara@@ h did not mean long , bringing the hus@@ band T@@ ania and children into the road after the fin@@ alists .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much support my family .
being with them was wonderful , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h inten@@ ts in London the fifth edition of 5 000 and 10 000 metres of a gol@@ den du@@ mp .
everything is possible if it is believed .
despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ norm in Da@@ am gold , G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti , A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , the extraordinary story of the birth of one art of the 19th century and Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century .
but even more in the history .
the inf@@ lam@@ matory information on the subject would perhaps have been watered down , a narro@@ w@@ ly subject would have been allowed to have more influence on the extraordinary nature of the title .
at the moment , there would be a patchwork of two books : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti and his pain@@ ting &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , the story of A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , and a much larger and more comprehensive history of H@@ on@@ ourable families and the German occupation , along with its subsequent effects in Austria .
the first third of the book leads to a thri@@ ving cultural life in the middle of Vienna , and who is himself in the capital of Austria , may well imagine the way in which more than a hundred years ago , life around R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ es went around , or how all the head of the Cen@@ tr@@ ali coff@@ ee turned when the climate inva@@ ded .
the concentration of cultural charac@@ ters was high in one of the rich@@ est cities in Europe , and the name familiar with the book was known as a gram of cultural heritage .
at the same time , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a city where un@@ treated inno@@ c@@ ence and the highest level of suicide in Europe will not add anything to development .
or perhaps , however , every couple of couples are adding to the cultural life of the 20th century in Vienna .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in the last decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had explo@@ ded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
the S@@ aj@@ an@@ di@@ g was almost one in ten inhabitants of Vienna .
parents were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by then , when the A@@ rad marriage itself was opened twice by the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ te Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch@@ every and the customer in his famous pain@@ ting , his father had become the seventh largest bank in the H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg E@@ mp@@ ire .
however , the whole life of A@@ de@@ let has not been drawn up .
if you look at the &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end @-@ of @-@ life infection was a kind such as soci@@ alism and dream of a trip to the Soviet Union .
for 19@@ 0@@ 3 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s luggage from the Kli@@ m@@ mer , the last moment was the pain@@ ting mak@@ er in Vienna .
a subscri@@ ption paid at that time 4 000 kro@@ ons , a quarter of the price of a good @-@ place rural house .
the fact that there was a suspicion of the mo@@ del@@ li of the mas@@ ters of sugar in the case of some spor@@ ts@@ men was not discoura@@ ged .
as far as the dele@@ tion is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between the mo@@ del@@ li and the ar@@ tist created in the course of work continued to reach the end of life .

shortly before the start of the work with A@@ dele@@ m , the climate had been visited by Ra@@ ven@@ na San V@@ ita@@ le , and the investi@@ g@@ ators think that it was precisely there that the wonderful mo@@ sa@@ ic countries of the Grand front na The@@ o@@ dor@@ f , The@@ o@@ dor@@ t , gave an artificial idea of making a gol@@ den portfolio called A@@ dele@@ dele@@ dele@@ r .
the Kli@@ m@@ t presented his &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; in Vienna in 19@@ 08 and at the same time ( 19@@ 07 @-@ 19@@ 08 ) , one of the gol@@ den land &apos; S@@ novel &apos; was born .
art his@@ tori@@ ans did not notice the simil@@ arity of two women .
how is Hitler connected with nature ?
&quot; I think I owe it to him to make his work available to the public , &quot; said A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer a few years after the departure of the ar@@ tist ( Kli@@ m@@ t died in February 19@@ 18 ) to the Director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere muse@@ um and wanted their family to go to the Kli@@ m@@ ti colle@@ ctions of mus@@ eu@@ ms .
six years before the death penalty , the Kli@@ m@@ l had produced each other .
he also asked for her hus@@ band to leave her two sports courses and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti &apos;s landsca@@ pes to Austrian Gal@@ special .
his founding fathers , Mrs Mari@@ ana and Mr Lu@@ da , are mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous .
one year after the climate had completed the &apos; Austrian Mon@@ a lisa &apos; , Vi@@ ini Ka@@ w@@ art de A@@ ka@@ de@@ mine had attempted to escape 17 @-@ year @-@ old Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , but failed in the drawing up .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is considered to be the reason for the fact that Jewish profes@@ sors did not accept him in the a@@ ca@@ de@@ mine , none of his cul@@ min@@ ers were actually Jewish .
in any case , the Austrian Gal@@ eri@@ i task , referred to in the case of the Austrian Gal@@ special , had changed considerably by 19@@ 39 , which had become important for the rich Jewish arts in Vienna to find decent work .
Hitler &apos;s personal art mus@@ ici@@ ans also had some work at home , but not that of the Kli@@ m@@ ti .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the night of Nazi art , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute between the Austrian Government and B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ kers was born .
it should be noted here that if &apos; S@@ novel &apos; sees the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle in Vienna , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ er , the &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; , must be seen as a trip to New York Ne@@ ue Gal@@ special .
and before the Vienna War , the aforementioned book will also be read .
even if you do not plan to look at the climate &apos;s work , because at least my emo@@ tion , after the closure of the book , the subject of laugh@@ ing and Jews was sold more than USD 135 million and mode@@ ll A@@ dele del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer .
so there is not so much enter@@ tainment , but rather a very moving story - and a very moving story .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , in the event of events , the sex of Bauer was facilitated by the start of the book .
17 @-@ year @-@ old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonia .
in E@@ elu@@ cheese , gold was very close to the personal record of its own 200 m , which was sw@@ am@@ ped by 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 .
the Ti@@ pp@@ mark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ old pi@@ les every week since the Canadian cheese Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships received 2.@@ 16@@ 16.@@ 58 , the Pri@@ it A@@ av@@ ik U@@ ju@@ gation blo@@ g .
gold last esca@@ ped , or a decade , A @-@ fin@@ alist .
in Fin@@ ally , she went through a distance of 2.@@ 15@@ ,@@ 76 and achieved a good 7th seat with a new powerful peak .
A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or@@ n , a Estonian re@@ ba@@ te ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) , remained a little over half a second .
in Estonia &apos;s ever @-@ old Scoreboard , gold rose and its fresh personal top @-@ mark is the fifth ever result of Estonia .
the young hope of the future lies in the launch of Canadian adults &apos; champi@@ on@@ ships of 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in bal@@ fire , and 200 m@@ m and 400 m in bun@@ dling .
last week in Tor@@ onto , Canada took place at the University of je@@ wel@@ le@@ ry , and gold was also successful .
he won 200 m in a sil@@ ver me@@ dal in 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
so quickly , it was sw@@ am@@ ped by a distance leader in 2008 .
the Gol@@ f has gone through more quickly than ever , in Estonia , only a record Estonian B@@ elt , E@@ lina Par@@ evi@@ ka .
in Canada , a vibran@@ t champion won a wonderful personal record of 100 m v@@ ouch@@ ers and 5@@ 6.@@ 66 of the new Estonian season .
for example , his year &apos;s old Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k has distan@@ ced it by just one century more quickly .
in his personal excellence , he arrived at another 100 m in the opening of a notice of 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 .
on a longer distance , he gained only the seventh seat when he became a fin@@ alist 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
gold is currently leading the Estonian momentum to four different distance .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics insu@@ red teet@@ h
the holiday season is in the hands of the US President , Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ le .
however , as the T@@ ru@@ mp has so far been one of the President who has taken the most holiday days , critics are already we@@ aring teet@@ h .
according to the US VIS and the CN@@ N , the President intends to have 17 @-@ day leave in the B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , which is located in New Jer@@ se@@ ys .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , the anti @-@ T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i leave has already been spoken for weeks .
they are asking the Olympics for too much treatment .
it is precisely the President who is entitled to spend a week in his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey in cotton .
by the way , the T@@ ru@@ mp has not clean@@ ed the President for its 19@@ 6 working days .
for example , Mr W@@ . Bush was able to have 67 days on holiday in this period , Barack Obama , but only 21 days less than the T@@ ru@@ mp .
however , the Olympic Games tend to forget things quickly .
a few days after becoming President , when he received the T@@ ru@@ mp , he said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; that there will be no time left for a long holiday in his wife , because there is a great deal to be done .
he also expressed his outra@@ ge about Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
the current President wrote on Twitter : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , plays gol@@ f , the brak@@ es and the j@@ arg@@ on concer@@ ts are on the street , journalists from the sun &apos; .
according to the officials of the White House , 17 @-@ day gol@@ f club visit was not a bet@@ ra@@ p .
it is officially referred to as &apos; labour leave &apos; , during which T@@ ru@@ l has no time to read or other forms of action .
in addition , there was another reason for working leave .
in particular , the White House will be replaced by a special system for the western part of the White House , and that is why all staff had to leave it .
the West Bank is also located in O@@ val@@ ka@@ c@@ abinet and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West in August , if there are 38 degrees and no con@@ glom@@ era@@ tes , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , who stressed that the President will continue to work during the holiday period .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp will spend 17 days , you will get an idea of video .
blocking of critics from Facebook to do not stand for the state of office if you do not tolerate the criticism of the voters .
the father of our country knew a great deal about the unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to bul@@ ly him for everything from internal politics to his political principles .
of course he was anno@@ yed by the criticism .
but he did not forced his critics to remain silent .
because , in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and , in dar@@ k@@ ness and silence , we could be chaired by sheep in slaugh@@ ter@@ houses &apos; .
this brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land Governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who is struggling to be more in Washington .
the organisers &apos; sub@@ missions have blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their views on their official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the Union for Freedom of American Civil Liberties ( AC@@ L@@ U ) is therefore to court .
the Ku@@ ber@@ ner officer &apos;s office pa@@ ved the action empty and web commen@@ ta@@ tes s@@ lide from reactions in a style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos; .
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many .
but that is what counts .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
it is an ama@@ zing popular Re@@ publi@@ can state of the democratic state .
his approval percentage is the second highest ranking among the country &apos;s 50 months .
Ho@@ gan is not an un@@ wise reaction .
it has led the state firmly and remains strictly firm in its principles .
in addition , he has used a major tool in communicating with his constituents quite deliberately Facebook , for example , after the first time in che@@ mis@@ try , after the first time he presented his or her ug@@ ly head .
it is therefore a public forum with a formal label that is managed by the staff of taxpayers &apos; dollars , who are paid by the C@@ ub@@ ans , which is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in the interview given to Washington Posselt , the spokes@@ person of Ho@@ gan , defended the behaviour of the Governor , arguing that blocking comments was nothing other than mode@@ ling .
however , it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet cl@@ ou@@ ds online , spa@@ w@@ ers or people full of hatred .
the post spoke to a number of people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and that is precisely what they are really the people who are in contact with their elected leaders , the teacher , the owner of the company and the pas@@ tor , not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were dis@@ respectful , thought @-@ out and not ro@@ p@@ ts .
Pas@@ tor quoted milk in his post , by op@@ pressing the K@@ ho@@ gan Catholic movement .
the lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ m Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not insti@@ gate hatred , but rather hate crimes .
&quot; I was poli@@ tely that I am disappointed , because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &apos; he wrote a news story in the Annex to the E@@ mail .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , when many people comment on the same subject , some of them are in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably calling it a collective effort , rather than acknowledging that this is a great deal of concern with citizens . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s officials called &apos; targeted spa@@ m attack &apos; would probably call others &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era allows messages to be easily mat@@ ised by simply blocking criticism or dele@@ ting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than the old one when the workers had to be sent out to do the same , so that they gather newspapers with critical edit@@ orial edit@@ orial newspapers and bur@@ n them or arrest protest@@ ors and forced them to remain silent .
however , that is exactly what is happening now , just digita@@ lly .
the Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to criticise the too@@ th of Facebook and other social media .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has brought to court Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter .
one of the first signs of court rulings on this matter was made last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
Judge James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is decided in Alexand@@ ria that the Chairman of the Man@@ aging Board of Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i land violated the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the vo@@ ter on his Facebook page .
in K@@ tu@@ ck@@ y , AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter also visited the Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in@@ it ( R ) .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar impact on the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters da@@ red in his way of leadership .
and even then Washington had to deal with anon@@ ymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers such as Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , Washington decisions .
according to the historical documents that have been compiled in the framework of the Water @-@ based George Washington magaz@@ ine project , he bur@@ ns a c@@ abinet under the petitions criticising his views on the British friendship , trade and shipping agreements .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , special opinions and debates are the foundations of our country .
and proper management means acceptance of this .

&quot; this is a very special feeling , &quot; said Se@@ th@@ por@@ tis &apos;s be@@ ating player .
&quot; I could not defend my Ex@@ t@@ rema@@ du@@ ra O@@ range &apos;s title because it was taken away from my competition calendar one year after my victory .

this was a very special time , which we will always be at the heart of the day . &quot;

it may be dangerous to work late , however , most of the men of the village are unemployed and many of them are running hard , and there are still soldiers here .
&quot; no one dare to go around after five o &apos;@@ clock in the village , &apos; he says .
this is a rare pil@@ o@@ qu@@ ery in Papua mountainous , which is a former Dutch col@@ ony , which was incorporated into Indonesia in 19@@ 69 after a referendum that was triggered by controversy in which only 10@@ 26 older people were forced to vote in front of the troops .
the movement in the direction of the Dutch sup@@ rema@@ cy of the Netherlands , which has urged the movement of its ra@@ vi@@ es to the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta Government , which is still holding the region under its strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into the P@@ ope and the Western P@@ ope , so that independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island .
the majority of the Roma is both remote and abandoned , and in order to arrive here , 90 minutes from the capital of the province , Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ u , and then through a five @-@ hour journey with a ren@@ tal car .
there is no public transport .
the city of approximately 19 000 inhabitants is made up of wood , surrounded by ro@@ of@@ s and cover la@@ in@@ ous iron ro@@ cks , which have been transformed by different tone into the tri@@ cks .
very few indicators have taken place here , not to mention journalists , and there has been almost no foreign matter here .
prior to the arrival of Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago pa@@ ints a God called T@@ ame@@ e .

&quot; we were not used to we@@ aring such clo@@ thes , &apos; says De@@ ge@@ i , referring to the marketing of your colour co@@ ded hand , the fire to the plu@@ g and the private sector .
&quot; before that , we have only had a plant cow . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
however , it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
just 100 km away from the P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , which is the mountainous province with 153 000 inhabitants of New Jer@@ sey , is the world &apos;s largest and most profitable gold mine , G@@ ras@@ berg , which belongs to the F@@ bet@@ e Mc@@ Mor@@ an company operating in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x@@ is .
in 2015 alone , F@@ bet@@ e extra@@ cted approximately USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ ies .
in addition , it can be reconci@@ led with the supply of raw wood , which is estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are a source of suffering for boats , as they result in the suff@@ oc@@ ating presence of a powerful Indon@@ esi@@ an army .
the New York Times study in 2005 showed that F@@ re@@ export payments in the years 1998 to 2004 to local military and military units amounted to approximately USD 20 million , including USD 150 000 to one of the officers .
the attempts of the P@@ ope to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den and is se@@ am@@ lessly bet@@ ra@@ yed .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 69 and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esi@@ an army .
according to the Asian Committee on Human Rights , the mass killing of the genocide in the 1970s was a measure of genocide in the 1970s .
last year alone , more than 3@@ 900 peaceful protests were arrested by the Iranian police in the region .
the 2016 report of the Grand bis@@ ho@@ p of Bir@@ s@@ b@@ ane , entitled &apos; We lose all &apos; , contains testi@@ mony to the atrocities committed last year , such as non @-@ judicial executions , torture ( one of the other reports , rape and electric shock ) and the brutal suppression of peaceful protests .
&quot; the number of victims is difficult to read , because such incidents will take place every week , &quot; says Andreas Human Rights Watch &apos;s Indonesia investi@@ g@@ ator and Andreas Har@@ son@@ o .
the nu@@ ances are even more strongly closed because Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new set@@ tle@@ rs from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing because of the Muslim economic migrants arriving in the islands of Indonesia , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ es .

the President of Indonesia J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , who is well known among the people as Jo@@ ko@@ w , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in P@@ ope .
the former pu@@ p@@ pet won the presidential Pal@@ ace of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta in Papua 29 constituency 27 , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
however , the P@@ ope has changed very little and the local feel chea@@ ted .
&quot; our hearts have been broken , because in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes in terms of restoring justice , &quot; says .
in fact , only two months after the resigna@@ tion of Jo@@ ko@@ w October , the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i was in a low position .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the Swe@@ des s@@ inging on Christmas , when two Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers wo@@ ke the dar@@ k@@ ness of the dar@@ k@@ ness .
children who have met told them that they should be included in the front lights .
according to the local pas@@ tor Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ eba@@ i T@@ eba@@ i , one of the soldiers insul@@ ted the tone of their votes and later returned to four soldiers .
according to the victims and specta@@ tors , in drink @-@ driving soldiers , children were driven by children and beaten them with their gun@@ s .
then one of the soldiers shot among children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , was beaten so cruel that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , the building of the near electoral Commission was bur@@ nt down , and the next day things es@@ c@@ ala@@ ted further .
about 1 000 young people , women and children gathered in a football pit@@ ch in front of the local police and military management centre to claim justice .
they were we@@ aring hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous buses and putting in place a le@@ af@@ let in Papua me@@ e pa@@ go , a wa@@ ita @-@ tan@@ ts@@ u in which poultry s@@ ongs were bu@@ ried and bu@@ ried .
some prote@@ sters started to le@@ cture the police and the military .
&apos;@@ I@@ f the crow@@ ds show more than three times resistance , let them down , &apos; the official document , which has seen a magaz@@ ine for time , but which has not been issued to local media publications .
the city of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , the city of Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ me ( 56 ) , felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained , asking for a crow@@ d to go home .
nobody had the will to listen .
&quot; turning me back to the left , I was suddenly shot into the left , &apos; he said time at the time of a t@@ ree in his German col@@ ours on the ver@@ ge of the ca@@ ge .
we still do not know who the fire was , but it says that the soldiers &apos; ri@@ gs gathered in the month came from .
&quot; there was a lot of people , a lot of children in the House , &apos; add him .
the local man , Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , has been shot at the wall three times .
&quot; I would like to wait for him and in his body to make sure that it is her , &quot; said a magaz@@ ine at a time of birth in Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who uses only one name in many of the indicators .
&apos;@@ I saw that he has died ... S@@ novel le@@ w . &apos;
the Chief Supervisor of Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said to repor@@ ters that he was subjected only to the security of his department , as it was attacked .
&quot; we need to protect ourselves if we are threatened to kill , &quot; said Vice @-@ President P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , the spokes@@ man of Papua police , in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prote@@ sters were killed and many injured .
the news about the killings reached J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta@@ il only on the next day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ wi Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ras made a passion@@ ate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses to be dealt with by the P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
the security minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that he would establish an ADR mechanism to tackle human rights crimes .
however , almost immediately the ex@@ cus@@ es were also followed .
&quot; most of the crimes happened a long time ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and the early 200@@ 0s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
on 5 June in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas , however , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to with@@ drew his words by saying that he had no intention of creating a P@@ ope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything will be resolved according to the law &apos; .
the W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been accused by the UN of committing more than 1 000 deaths in the context of the bloody independence referendum in East Timor in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in P@@ ope , including what happened in P@@ ani@@ a@@ is .
the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i have adopted such statements with a g@@ loom@@ y mistrust .
&quot; I have been heard four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that he is still living in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I am afraid that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I am shot . &quot;
his bro@@ ther d Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed his opinion that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are afraid of this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after helping to bur@@ y four victims .
&quot; after the bur@@ ying of the bodies , the army had to look at me , &apos; he says .
the celeb@@ rations have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the inhabitants of the Egyptian police were shot in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ is , a neighbouring P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
one person was killed and 17 injured , including children , when he went to the head of the village and the construction company , who refused to transport an un@@ conscious man to hospital .
this man &apos;s people , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ w@@ ned into a ne@@ ar@@ by sea , died on the road to hospital .
the recent inhabitants of villages prote@@ sted at the construction site of a company office .
according to the police , the people of the village were st@@ oring the police , which the latter responded with warning visits .
however , according to the local authorities , mobile British people ( Indonesia &apos;s military police ) were shot at the people , killing one person .
&quot; we were a great panic , we are afraid of reven@@ ge , &quot; said 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ da Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives close to the hospital and saw the in@@ se@@ ct of those injured .
&quot; I have beaten myself two days in my own house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of police mobile bri@@ ga@@ des from the region .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ c has always been a problem for the Indon@@ esi@@ an Government .
the lack of meaningful development fe@@ eds the dis@@ satisfaction of the me@@ als , m@@ oni , dan@@ n and da@@ m@@ mal tri@@ bes living in Papua bad .
many of them have signed up to the army of Papua gene@@ ity ( V@@ PL ) , which , according to its own , protects the rights of boats , by organising attacks and kid@@ napp@@ ings among the Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers .
some of the V@@ PL &apos;s leadership comes from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , over the last few years , under the pretext of protecting national sovereignty , the army has arrested the P@@ ani@@ a@@ is and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them never appear again .
P@@ ani@@ ans are known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; among the people .
poverty fe@@ eds dis@@ satisfaction .
the little ri@@ ce that is sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
the Lei@@ b is the same un@@ available .
people are growing all their food themselves , mainly from the Bah@@ Ã¡ , in addition to some fruit and vegetables .
farming is women &apos;s work , each of whom is able to care for four or five ba@@ il@@ outs .
they usually keep most of the recei@@ pt of the family , the rest is sold on the local market .
ten Bah@@ a &apos;@@ s cost only 10 000 Indon@@ esi@@ an sites ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have been exacerbated by heavy boats and new migrants , who have arrived in a wide range since the opening of new routes for the N@@ ab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
the speculators themselves often do not have the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the village because there are no jobs and no money , &apos; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , President of the Council of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ bes .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from the P@@ ope .
in addition , strict restrictions on foreign media remain .
French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ bridge L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were sent to the P@@ ope at the beginning of this year , because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they had been given a rare film licence .
the Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch , P@@ com@@ m K@@ ine , said that the election pledges made by Jo@@ ko@@ w have not been implemented to lift the restrictions on transparency and development reports .
&quot; in Indonesia , journalists from the most eastern provinces and Western P@@ ope reports are threatening new threats to the rejection and black@@ listing of a visa , &quot; said in his statement .
the lack of a satellite watch on the press means that international pressure on the government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua near neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries were encouraged by T@@ on@@ ga , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ valu , Mar@@ shall Islands and Sol@@ om@@ on Islands to examine the &apos; various wide @-@ ranging crimes &apos; in the UN Human Rights Council , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the same countries have historically supported the V@@ PL .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , the spokes@@ person of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , thre@@ w out the accusations of a group by saying J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas to journalists : &apos; there is still a democratic regime and freedom of the press in Indonesia , so that evidence of human rights cases would be difficult to bur@@ y &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to notice .
when the Dutch official delegation visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ rat on 4 May , the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , Mr Van B@@ aric , the local people were cut off at the meeting , but the anon@@ ymous source said they wanted to remain silent , urging : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , there will be new presidential elections in 2019 , but boats do not believe that they will vote in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w again .
&apos;@@ Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man with good intentions , but surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i &apos; says &apos; Ho@@ ba@@ i , President of the Council &apos; .
he wants to give Jo@@ co@@ w@@ en to realise that , in addition to the fact that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are constantly living under the threat of a pre@@ da@@ tory army , they are suffering from poor education and health services .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , like other boats , regard their voice to Jo@@ ko@@ w as a debt that has to be paid .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and intimidation , the families of the victims of the fire in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i were able to cope with the last symbolic objection to Madagascar , which swe@@ pt one victim to the death of a police unit and the army to the country in question .
knowing that justice can never be put on its feet , they will not at least allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
ne@@ eding Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch &apos;s pil@@ ots for the second time
on Friday , hundreds of people in the world &apos;s largest housing storm in Du@@ ba@@ i had to be ea@@ ten , forcing hundreds of people to escape from this 3@@ 37 me@@ tre and 79 cra@@ zy buildings .
this is the second fire that has been ra@@ va@@ ged in just two years from a high level , which is called the case for Tu@@ rin , or T@@ us@@ vi@@ ku@@ r .
the building was evacu@@ ated , none of the injuries were reported and no direct fire @-@ related causes were submitted .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and wake up to the fires and people &apos;s fears .
we would wait for the t@@ our and we had about 10 minutes to get down to the 50@@ th order , &apos; said to the Re@@ u@@ ter@@ ans one person who called himself a George .
according to Du@@ ba@@ i &apos;s civil protection officers , fire fighters were also deleted at around 4 o &apos;@@ clock this morning at local level ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and ja@@ ked the building .
the government said that they were working to ensure shelter for those affected .
this incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on high @-@ level external soil throughout the world .
during the investigation carried out in the aftermath of the Tor@@ ch Management Board 2015 , it was found that the most damage was suffered by a fa@@ Ã§@@ ade , de@@ cor@@ al panels and insu@@ lation .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London G@@ ren@@ portfolio T@@ ow@@ er and a fa@@ Ã§@@ ade could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fires in June , which killed around 80 people .
see : these phones are likely to receive sales cards in the autumn
language and sy@@ na@@ ge are a waste of time for technology , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peripheral a X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , are expected to be expected in the autumn in the autumn .
according to the Tele@@ 2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Se@@ mother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by innovative design , eye @-@ fast s@@ hand@@ n@@ ner , ser@@ ser @-@ servan@@ i 4@@ K resolution on the screen and the ultra @-@ fast process .
Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , which is also at the top of Estonia &apos;s smar@@ t@@ phones &apos; sales table , gave rise to a high degree of visibility in the world .
the autumn will allow cle@@ r@@ ty people to be even more ti@@ red , more resilient , better camer@@ as and more water and customs security .
he added that , on the basis of rum@@ ours , there can already be assumptions and predi@@ ctions of four top @-@ level models , which are likely to be con@@ qu@@ ered by the streets .
these four smart phones top @-@ up models will reach the shop in the autumn of this year .
the long @-@ awaited i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach boys by mid @-@ September .
however , the rum@@ ours that the new Apple model looks like , and what can be done , are spreading .
if the i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not bring significant differences between the i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , Apple &apos;s tenth birth@@ day is expected to be a new model completely different from previous ones .
there has been talk of four col@@ ours : black , white , ro@@ ck and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the entire telephone front , has been lost at home and the fingerprints are built on the screen .
Apple &apos;s design director J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve calls for the new i@@ P@@ hone model to look like a glass .
there has also been talk of the i@@ P@@ hone version .
in addition to the e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant , the un@@ man@@ age@@ able charging and a more high @-@ quality camer@@ as can be expected to accelerate the A@@ 11 process .
this is certainly one of the most expected smart phones in the year .
the outs@@ ourcing of a new model , G@@ ala@@ x@@ y , begins on 23 August .
however , there have been many rum@@ ours of what new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y are going to see .
Ad@@ mittedly , even more business users are meant , and the S will allow even greater fun@@ ction@@ alities .
the Tele@@ fon@@ t should have two camer@@ a , one of which is the la@@ x and the other with a narrow view of television content .
at the moment , no one knows what the two re@@ configu@@ rations are capable of , but in any case it is the first test of Sam@@ sun@@ g , which is certainly comparable to the i@@ P@@ hone 8 .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August .
although Nokia has sold three smar@@ t@@ phones in this year with Nokia 6 , there is still a lack of their flag vessel , Nokia 8 , which is already being presented on 16 August .
we are looking forward to a scre@@ ens stret@@ ching from 5.@@ 3 to a bottom @-@ up screen and ultra @-@ fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ nap@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and more resilient a@@ venues .
Nokia also talks about alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and a significant level of water and customs security IP@@ 68 .
like Sam@@ su@@ ng@@ every , Nokia &apos;s new model has two camer@@ a , which is produced by an opti@@ mist company Z@@ e@@ iss .
if S@@ ony &apos;s firm flag has been X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smar@@ t@@ phones will be added in the near future , with even more innovative functions .
we expect a smar@@ t@@ phone that is slightly more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least the same good or better camer@@ as .
there has been speculation on the new S@@ ony model that its screen is at least hot .
what the reality is , we can already see the right thing , as traditionally the S@@ ony of its autumn flag vessel has published IFRS , which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September .
according to trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts le@@ ak@@ ed by telephone calls , T@@ ru@@ mp Mexico pressed for the payment of the border wall .
the Washington post unve@@ iled the telephone calls between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i and Mexic@@ an and Austr@@ alian state leaders .
on 27 January , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ o , the Mexic@@ an President , went to the President of Mexico , to stop public pro@@ claiming that he does not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President , with him , warned of the public condemnation of the wall , saying : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ mp was set up in his presidential campaign to build a long @-@ term wall and age on the southern border of the United States , so that Mexico is paying for this project .
trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts were also published in his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turmes , which reveals a ten@@ se debate .
the T@@ ru@@ mp told Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l that the agreement whereby the United States of America takes on refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; stu@@ pid &apos; , claiming that the agreement that was made during the Obama Government would give him the impression &apos; guide &apos; , because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the T@@ ru@@ mp ended the speech by announcing to the Tur@@ une@@ le that &apos; this was the day &apos;s most un@@ pleasant speech &apos; .
the Court of Justice did not take a complaint on the matter of the O@@ C MR@@ P in which the city of Tar@@ tu rejected their offer for bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 20@@ 29 .
this is a letter rejecting the O@@ C MR@@ P in the town of Tar@@ tu buses , as the offer did not meet the requirements , An@@ neli A@@ pu@@ tin , the President of the Tar@@ tu City Legal Service , explained .
this is the procurement of public transport within the Tar@@ tu city for the period 0@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 @-@ 3@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
MR@@ P city Li@@ ine referred to the Court of Justice of the Mun@@ ici@@ pality of Tar@@ tu .
the national court did not act .
although many people in the social media complain that the We@@ ek@@ y F@@ esti@@ val is disrup@@ ting their night and the entire city is full of the brak@@ es , there are many who do not have any bad words on the subject of a lasting festi@@ val .
I am even positively surprised that the brak@@ es were so poli@@ te in the shop .
I did not see any ambigu@@ ity or cour@@ tes@@ y .
even the Gulf I saw &apos; says a nice wave .
&quot; it is nice that it is coming , and it is known to be happy to have the Per@@ sian , which is a winter like winter , &apos; , he will gla@@ dly add .
the cu@@ mber@@ some wave of a do@@ se is not a disgrace .
if , in the middle of a city , he was still listening to mus@@ ici@@ ans playing on the be@@ aches , then the music has not yet arrived at his home .
&quot; but I hope I hear , &quot; he says .
the Ag@@ nes , too , talks that the Grand F@@ esti@@ val is a good thing for the Per@@ rer , which will make a significant contribution to the VAT of local merchan@@ ts .
in addition , it welcomes the fact that the summer capital has come up with such a large number of pain@@ ts .
the woman of Pe@@ ol@@ ives does not .
although I am no longer on the coast , it is nice that rand has revi@@ ved .
and it is good that the people are moving , and this has been the case three times , a woman says .
in the first time , I think it was a little worse .
&apos;@@ The@@ y there were complaints &apos; , he is wondering .
however , what is happening on the ground is normal , according to him , for the summer capital cities .
&quot; this We@@ ek@@ ise is a very good pro@@ ph@@ mo for our small city , &quot; says Har@@ ri , who is on the park .
life and m@@ Ã¶@@ ll have not been s@@ ounding his life .
but for that ?
we should all pull together .
think about how it would be better to communicate between nations .

Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts 3 000 jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revita@@ lise business
the British educational company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that more than 3 000 jobs are being cut and reduced by 72 % , by launching another restructuring programme to tackle the challenge of business .
the jobs that are being sacrificed , according to John F@@ all@@ on , are likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , will be accompanied by 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced in May a plan to cut costs by another GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) in the framework of the third reduction programme , in order to try to revive business that has been hit by the transition to high @-@ speed digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell last month &apos;s participation in the Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House to its partner companies Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , said that their expectation in relation to the year has not changed since the 1 % increase in sales revenue was announced to 2.@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year .

K@@ abu@@ l : suicide attacks killed by NATO soldi@@ er
the suicide bom@@ ber , according to officials , attacked military con@@ vo@@ ys in the capital of Afghanistan , K@@ abu@@ l , killing one NATO soldi@@ er and inju@@ ring several of you .
in the NATO statement , five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to local reports , the city of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi was also killed by three civilians .
this bom@@ bing is the last acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Her@@ ati mos@@ que attack on Tuesday .
on Monday , two people were killed by suicide bom@@ b@@ ers in K@@ abu@@ l .
the NATO statement said that an explosion took place on Thursday evening when the Afghan army of Joint pat@@ ro@@ l was attacked by &apos; man @-@ made explosives &apos; .
according to the statement , everything has been injured in a stable state and is treated in the US military hospital in Bag@@ ra@@ m airport .
according to the Cor@@ respondents , the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( in Chad ) , are a serious source of concern for the forces of NATO in Bag@@ h@@ dad .
according to the UN , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital city .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l was killed mainly by at least 30 people in K@@ abu@@ l .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the central city , which has led to the most deaths in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , President of the United States , is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country and the police .
according to the Cor@@ respondents , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
EPA annul@@ led the decision to postpone the regulation after the shar@@ ks .
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA ) annul@@ led the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama @-@ Time Regulation , which obliges states to limit their emissions , one day after 15 states compla@@ ined to the Court of Justice due to its conduct .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday 2015 , saying that it shows the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our national partners and listen to them , &quot; said the President of the EPA , Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t in his statement .
the P@@ ru@@ it@@ t had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the rates of os@@ tility content in the Sahel , which measure pollution in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year by one year in order to meet the highest standard of air quality .
15 mainly democratic states , together with C@@ olum@@ bia , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
the government of President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has tried to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to Mr T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , is part of a more comprehensive agenda for growth .
however , these efforts have led to reactions among the democrats and nature protection groups who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that the brea@@ thing of ozone @-@ containing air &apos; could reduce the ability of Cop@@ ts to work and increase the risk of a res@@ pira@@ tory disease , such as as@@ th@@ ma .
German pigs can come to a pi@@ pe .
Germany &apos;s pigs and cattle can come to a pi@@ pe , as heavy ra@@ ins threaten the yields of the European Union &apos;s second largest wheat producer , wri@@ tes B@@ SE .
this year , it can be said that weeks of sa@@ tu@@ ration before harves@@ ting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry can only be fed to animals .
&quot; the quality of the content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said A@@ gra@@ vis R@@ ai@@ ff@@ e@@ en &apos;s analysis of Mr Bern@@ hard Chil@@ la .
this year , up to 40 per cent of German nic@@ ot@@ ine can be used for animal feed , which is fed by feed compared with the usual forecast in A@@ gra@@ tis .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have been exposed to all the weather this year .
first of all , it was too dry .
then came the cold spring , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
in July , Germany was hit by the German volcano , which has also continued in August .
many eyes have been placed on northern Germany , where the rain is an obstacle to harves@@ ting .
so far , only five per cent of nic@@ ot@@ ine has been repeated .
the majority in the region has not yet been harves@@ ted , and the local harvest bu@@ ried in C@@ era@@ vis .
&quot; this is a very difficult day , &quot; said Frank Dec@@ ker@@ t R@@ end@@ s@@ burg , a senior trader in C@@ era@@ vis .
consistency in everything , in other words , the ro@@ y@@ alty of the internal design of Fin@@ ns
nature plays a part in the inter@@ night of mes@@ h homes because , through large win@@ dows , Sa@@ ima@@ a &apos;s fin@@ ite views reach many ( life ) rooms .

I@@ w@@ ol@@ ence and also respect for the use of wood for Fin@@ ns as building and finishing materials , fur@@ ni@@ ture and beau@@ ty .
Vir@@ gu@@ dable techniques and smart solutions can be found in mes@@ h houses , both as a buil@@ der and ( home ) .
it is clear that the theft of the black , white and grey fields , if they are supplemented by wood ton@@ es and vege@@ tation , can be very enter@@ prising .
good ideas can still go for a week , as the F@@ air will run until 13 August .

M@@ Ã¼r@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
Mr V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and Mr Gar@@ cia , who should be on a col@@ lisi@@ on in order to face up to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg in the most attractive shop in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in the ES@@ P@@ N office in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ les , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ winning World Bo@@ y Coun@@ c@@ il ligh@@ t@@ weight champion the other side of the corridor , to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , World Bo@@ assies , to the Con@@ gus@@ z@@ ation@@ i sul@@ g@@ weigh@@ ch .
following the unanimous decision by Gar@@ cia , the victory of the former four @-@ time world champion , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er , on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ ever , both comb@@ at@@ ants belong to the top of the ranking .
Mr Gar@@ cia extended his hand better and said : &apos; how do you go , champion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko will protect his bel@@ ts against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 ES@@ P@@ N .
when a couple of photo@@ graph@@ s appeared , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko &apos;s memory , E@@ g Kli@@ mas , said that there would be a &apos; perfect y@@ ard@@ stick &apos; between comb@@ at@@ ants .
&quot; I am former sul@@ tative , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I called for B@@ ron@@ ger &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move down@@ wards .
and he needs to move up to half the easy weight &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the F@@ Ã¤n@@ ds have asked for this .
let us give them the help . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
in the climate , the question raised was whether it should be worthwhile looking at it , which is part of his strategy , which he wants to allow the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to debate the end of this year at 6@@ 1.2 kg in order to make it possible for the next summer to meet with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ vans ) , who also have an interest in fighting Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ li &apos;s match with the winner of the E@@ mb@@ assy , following their ligh@@ ter weight on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as f@@ ans have called for this confrontation , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , saying later that he is open to fighting any channel offering the best financial package .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name is able to attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Mrs Gar@@ cia said that she considers L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t &apos; a &apos; force fighters &apos; and can go to his des@@ k on Saturday .
however , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was modest in pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia , saying that in his opinion , three di@@ vis@@ j@@ on champi@@ ons from the Ri@@ ver@@ pool were &apos; very slow &apos; ; I apologise , M@@ lon@@ y ... you wanted this no@@ distant &apos; .
according to Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show strength and then to bo@@ w .
both confirmed that they feel that the tension is growing in order to reach them .
&quot; this is a fight that looks forward to realising .
no other confrontation aro@@ uses so much attention and s@@ lan@@ der .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters and M@@ ae@@ y is exactly that .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
what world sin@@ ks are going to Estonia ?
it extended and issued a record of more than 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia , study or family .
if , for example , the soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit to 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , then the figure was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the agencies cannot say how many immigrants will finally remain permanently in Estonia , but such an analysis will be drawn up by the Ministry of the Interior .
while nearly 500 Ukrainians per year in Estonia ten years ago , this figure will be close to 2 000 in recent years .
the number of applicants for authorisation rose dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis , with 10@@ 87 people in 2014 receiving fixed @-@ term residence permits , up from 6@@ 75 in 2014 .
in Estonia , we have the highest number of Ukrainian citizens , with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia in excess of their generosity .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been very high in Estonia all the time and , due to difficult circumstances , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already in front of the family , the spokes@@ person of the Ministry of the Interior , Kris@@ tin Ram@@ alla@@ h .
the number of Ukrainian citizens who had fixed @-@ term residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens , even though the lon@@ gest @-@ term residence permits have been issued in ten years .
if Ukrainians come to work mostly here , Russian citizens will have family migration .
&quot; given the historic Russian community , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with the people living in Russia , &quot; said Hel@@ ina Me@@ use , the Internal Protection A@@ ca@@ de@@ my .
&quot; if you look at where the Russian citizens who have been able to live in a residence permit in Estonia , Har@@ ju@@ maa is now in East Vir@@ g@@ land , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them have been mar@@ ried by the European Union &apos;s citizens .
soil was granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 16@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permits decreased .
&quot; compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested for a permanent stay in Estonia , &quot; explained by the press spokes@@ person at the Ministry of the Interior , Mr Ram@@ on , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years .
a new residence permit for Estonia will be able to apply for at least three years for foreigners who have lived here .
its aim is to encourage the attra@@ ction of people who have been adapted .
however , the long @-@ term residence permit requires five years , for example .
the extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased as a result of the new residence permit .
for example , soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to change their work and the Estonian state will no longer be pointing the finger at whether the pay criterion has been met .
this residence permit was popular for the lever - the holders of the grey passport ( 10@@ 29 ) , the Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , the Indi@@ ans ( 54 ) and the n@@ ig@@ er@@ ans ( 36 ) .
a total of 19@@ 68 people , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and the same number of Chinese , were able to live in Estonia .
with the first half of this year , the total number of applicants is already 12@@ 69 .
in 10 years , surpris@@ ingly , Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residency .
when three residence permits were issued in 2007 to Fin@@ ns , soil was 200 .
Nigeria is coming to learn from this university .
the Estonian higher education institutions are also popular , for example , among Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has been rising largely thanks to learning games .
for them , too , the rule is that where there is a community in front of the community , there will be others more easily , &apos; added Ram@@ alla@@ h .
in ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , just as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , this is about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if we look at the citizens of the European Union , migration will remain around a percentage , &quot; the mafia commented that the figures are , in fact , small .
in total , according to the statistical office , 14 8@@ 22 people died in Estonia , 13 7@@ 92 .
this means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration .
most of them are Estonian citizens , but more are among those who leave them .
that is why Estonia &apos;s citizens &apos; migration secret , with 2 000 people , was in decline .
Est@@ oni@@ ans are particularly emig@@ rating between Finland and Estonia .
M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture Pr@@ inc@@ s@@ sim@@ de with sa@@ ts , chic@@ k@@ ens and t@@ arrogance
however , in the North West of ideas , Mrs Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u , there is a history - old pain@@ ts and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream of a few hours somewhere in the muse@@ um and ad@@ m@@ ire the old thi@@ ev@@ es and cra@@ ts .
if you do something with a piece of stone , you will study and learn about it every day .
this is a pleasure !
the modern world of M@@ ou@@ ture C@@ ou@@ ture may seem to be some alien , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much s@@ oul is in your life !
as a friend , I have a whole sa@@ il full of the w@@ ounds of cou@@ ture that I have created .
because , and it is not his fault , he does not live in the Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ oo@@ s and does not go on a red @-@ shir@@ t every day , he wants to wear the most beautiful bro@@ kers , and that is what it is suffering .
you will be able to live your life special !
the Mo@@ e@@ artificial ar@@ tist does not recognise the gap between the bri@@ lli@@ ant events and the grey day .
it is this reasoning that put the rolling stock in Estonia into rural areas , between forests and fields , people who often do not reach them .
for example , the colle@@ ctions were presented , for example , by comparison , J@@ air and Per@@ lo mo@@ e@@ alle@@ el , where 45 mo@@ del@@ l Ro@@ yal de@@ fi@@ le@@ e filled the whole street .
in Tallinn , there is often a han@@ g , a no@@ vel@@ ty , but there is more emo@@ tion elsewhere - s@@ log@@ ans , b@@ ars , stand up , you want to thank you .
a large part of the audience came just as news , but now they are the f@@ ans of M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture .
if you over@@ shoo@@ t people &apos;s expectations , they are spiri@@ ted !
and I like the feeling that I am with my mo@@ tive like the summer .
Per@@ nus was a 50 @-@ me@@ tre red car@@ pet , a whole @-@ day bro@@ kers full , it seemed that they would not come to an end .
Mrs Maria does not recognise the mo@@ tive that nature must be presented by a super@@ ficial super@@ ficial , she will be happy to bring ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always been happy .
after all , this is the la@@ x of experience , the island of the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g !
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own play , I am always behind the ground to give a gli@@ m@@ mer of hope as a mer@@ cy to things .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow me to look cal@@ mly on the floor .
Mrs Maria is this kind of motto , who does not just want to play a representative role , but to be involved in everything .
I have my sis@@ ter in the wind , most of the colle@@ ctions I myself carry out .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to discover .
I am never far from my animal and I am not afraid of work .
the only thing is not limited , but also the style , logistics , organisation , organisation - all the women of one tem@@ per@@ ment have to reach the day .
these hours of work are still huge for the fana@@ tics .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a day full of joy !
I am still very lu@@ cky - it is like an un@@ stop@@ p@@ able jo@@ ke : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compli@@ ments .
it has been said several times that my bro@@ kers have a land of land - they make themselves feel like a printing .
the gu@@ ise of the gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ las , which Maria talent made known overnight , has long been a signal to the Senate of C@@ ou@@ ture .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p U@@ 18 boys , a weapon of Est@@ oni@@ ans al@@ ag@@ re , now turned against us .
the damage , the fair@@ y@@ tale , was running out .
the first thing was that we were not able to get our table .
and if there is such a big difference in the table , there is nothing to do with the Estonian U@@ 18 cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ po@@ s 61 : 75 in the UK , our only bas@@ ket@@ ball in N@@ B@@ RA , BC Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p .
opponents of the attack took 28 Pal@@ ace and received so much more attacks as a result of it .
we were also not prepared to protect them agg@@ ressi@@ vely and not attack , it created .
many of the attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
in defence , however , they were able to keep their hands between them , we could not combine .
it created the team from the bottom .
the anti @-@ home work was better done .
according to M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ pa , Estonia would have had to make more tac@@ tical mistakes in order to withdraw the anti @-@ missile fire .
the last quarter - we had a zero error , but the opponents have already received a number of quick harves@@ ts .
A@@ tle@@ ss@@ ness and a close offensive , which was our weapon on the al@@ ag@@ re tur@@ n@@ ines , now all of us were opposed .
today we did not have the power against their agg@@ ressi@@ veness .
the M@@ y@@ r@@ na@@ p remained satisfied with its neg@@ ligent Kal@@ ev@@ is , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s .
security in general can say good words about the whole team , to date there was a united shock .
it is a pity that such an aggressive response had not already been met before .
it has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but it seemed that he was ti@@ red - he has borne a huge burden .
but he made some of the fine ges@@ tures that I have seen earlier in the tr@@ en@@ ni@@ des , adding a guide .
hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous figures : E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ iri@@ l thre@@ w three quarter fewer than 10 points ...
the U@@ 18 age class does not only apply to the young men &apos;s B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ tin@@ ir in Tallinn , she started over yesterday in Dublin .
and Estonia &apos;s game with Poland was , unfortunately , an area of anti@@ qu@@ ity .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but even after the third quarter , the state of play was 9 : 49 , or only in the last ten minutes , opponents took their feet and the period remained at 16 : 16 .
both in the first and the second quarter , Estonia du@@ mp 4 , third point ...
at the same time , in the first two minutes , the Est@@ oni@@ ans caught two pieces of four minutes , but there are 25 pieces of play , then one y@@ el@@ low , and then another 21 to wait ...
perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 fin@@ gers were found .
in addition , 2 points came from four non @-@ negoti@@ able rooms .
there was a reasonable number of losses in this time , 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland was hit by 33 % and Estonia by 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , with the opening day to be recognised 83 : 56 on the right of Portugal .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement supplies
today , on 1 October , NATO arrived at a permanent port visit to Tallinn for a week , in order to complement the stocks of ships and prepare for pre @-@ presu@@ med habits .
in the course of the visit , ships are preparing for the landing of the sea , giving cre@@ ws the opportunity to holiday on a daily holiday .
following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonia &apos;s waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations for historic explo@@ sive rem@@ nan@@ ts .
&quot; the participation of children in the NATO unit and the co @-@ operation in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the alli@@ ances , &quot; said the chief cap@@ tain Ar@@ to Rein@@ maa , the overseas operation and planning department in the Com@@ pli@@ ance of the fleet .
since 29 June , NATO will be led by the Latvian naval cap@@ ter , G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , who took over the team &apos;s duties from the Estonian naval officers Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as Sel@@ ja@@ b at a ceremony in Riga .
the group &apos;s flag vessel is L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , a Latvian naval force , which also operates as a group leader .
this semester is also part of the Estonian naval mine mine mine hun@@ t .
as one of the four groups of NATO naval forces in NATO , NATO is a permanent group of land@@ mines in the primary speed response unit , which may be sent to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - On 13 August , the P@@ iri@@ ta k@@ ni@@ fe will once again become a place where Burma has been carried out by Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ ards 13 years ago .
this year , Mrs F@@ esti@@ val can be a beautiful , powerful and unprecedented leader of the Risk to J@@ oo@@ st ( 36 ) of the city of Tallinn .
the risk of J@@ oo@@ st : listening to the people of the world &apos;s class clas@@ s@@ room , &apos; Tra@@ vi@@ ita &apos; and &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; , bal@@ le@@ ti@@ la@@ e answers by the club of B@@ ole@@ ro@@ st &apos; , &apos; Kar@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ in &apos; , as well as its own production , this time Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ni A@@ asta@@ se , is not lacking , is the response of the same international team of creators who brought him to the Hague in 2015 . &apos;
Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val is much more than just concer@@ ts and theat@@ re answers .
it is more than any music theat@@ re in its normal form .
it is a festi@@ val that takes power and never gets rid of .
because the experience that the lis@@ ten@@ er receives in this sup@@ erior and sal@@ va@@ ble environment puts human s@@ oul ring@@ ing and concerns human beings in a way that cannot be described .
the risk is the first year of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val &apos;s art leader .
did the Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ las@@ kin@@ s not feel a little big ?
of course , as I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , there has been a lot of help .
I am going through a whole of my student career and also supported the restoration career at the beginning .
perhaps it is thanks to me that it is easier for me to continue his work .
in K@@ las , so much good and , of course , all of this is passed on to Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going .
it is the great heart of E@@ ri K@@ las@@ ts who also gave me the strength to go ahead well with the Mayor of Tallinn in harmony with Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
and here I am and I can do it .
what could be brought to the public at today &apos;s festi@@ val , what special offer do you offer ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , as a surprise , the first bal@@ ler , written on Mrs L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i &apos;s cheese , will be the first .
this is &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson l@@ b &apos; .
and one of the no@@ torious nu@@ ances in this regard is that the author of this bal@@ le@@ it is the com@@ po@@ ser of Latvia , J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ inning , who himself expressed a desire to write it .
apparently she has already lived in the b@@ reat@@ h of Kar@@ l@@ sson .
to the risk , how are you all the nu@@ ances ?
thanks to my support for life , I am sure .
such work requires a system of support and a lot of love , and that is something that I am fortuna@@ te to have .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tion does not depend so much on other people as I myself , in other words , how I am going to go against every new day .
and this awareness of the tone , the keeping of the positive and , in fact , s@@ mil@@ ing ourselves into the mir@@ ror of the morning , has made a significant increase in my happy percentage .
especially now this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen on this and it is working .
the na@@ ming of itself is an act of a@@ mus@@ ing and raising the tone .
it is not just a word .
I think that people do not yet know the things of their own body , which the univer@@ se offers them , but it is one that everyone will be able to do so slowly .
now , it is an important moment .
is there any kind of ri@@ tual before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ d took place ?
it is still true that clothing has to be replaced more convenient .
this is a small moment for itself .

new results of tests on the age of Swedish asylum seekers were published
in Sweden , the latest results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the constitution was assessed as a parent than 18 % , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for Legal medicine ( R@@ ele@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ t ) started with the tests at the beginning of this year .
the tests were set up in order to assess the age of age more accurately when the Swedish Authority for Migration ( Mig@@ ran@@ s@@ ver@@ ket ) was criticised for failing to correctly define the age of a number of allegedly minors .
to date , Jordan has sent a test of 80 cases and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 24 81 tests between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July 2017 .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed for 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older cases , and in 25 cases , the Institute of medical medicine assessed that the &quot; test &quot; could be 18 years old . &quot;
the 4@@ 32 cases concluded that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if the age of man is questioned .
according to Joh@@ an GÃ¶@@ rans@@ son , who works in the Institute of medicine , the results are consistent with those of previous months .
&quot; we do not see a great difference in comparison with the statistics of previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &apos; he said to the newspaper The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been able to choose their age .
the Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that in 4@@ 42 cases &apos; there are references to the fact that the person examining is 18 years old or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson ska Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the results of these 581 tests , it became clear that in 2@@ 43 cases , the person had stated directly that it would be 18 this year .
the method of assessing the age of medical age , which makes smart me@@ ters and rub@@ ber @-@ gen@@ i@@ ids , and then allows dental doctors and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts to analyse them , has been criticised in some circles .
one of the sceptics is the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute &apos;s endo@@ k@@ rin@@ olo@@ gist Claude Mar@@ cus , whose task is to assess people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through the normal audience sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measuring method currently being used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very precarious .
if we cannot say firmly , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he said to the newspaper , &apos; .
but Joh@@ an GÃ¶@@ rans@@ son &apos;s trial of the Institute of medicine defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that the risk of a child being in@@ accurate to adul@@ th@@ ood is low .
most of the 10 % risk is perhaps the case if you are a little under 18 . &quot;

Y@@ our Tan@@ go lists nine signs that show that the cost of your action is tw@@ o@@ fold and could for@@ give him .
it seems more expensive to understand the seriousness of the situation and to work hard to resolve it .
your more expensive deal deals with the problem that led him to the stream of another .
you are no longer in a defen@@ sive position .
he sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for his actions .
he is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
it agrees that it has made a serious mistake and is sincerely trying to improve the situation .
he is attentive and trying to intera@@ ct with you .
at the same time , he is forcing you to get over the matter .
they do not deny what has happened and try to change it un@@ noticed .
it is more expensive and more expensive for you to understand why in@@ consistency with you arose .
you are talking about this and also about how to prevent it in the future .
you will better communicate and assess each other &apos;s needs .
your more expensive attitude and actions have helped the summer to develop its condolences against his mis@@ carriage .

the 20 @-@ year @-@ old new@@ er , Anna Maria O@@ rel , made a nice debate in London , receiving 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7@@ with a good 18 seats .
after that , M@@ M no@@ ori@@ m was a woman &apos;s wife and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for med@@ als in the future .
the contest went well and received a good experience .
with the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , I immediately took away my medium @-@ term result , the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) risk too much and the third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) I was able to keep it clear , &quot; said after the contest .
I had my own emissions and I am very pleased that I found it .
Anna Maria O@@ re@@ li M@@ M &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 seats .
the Vi@@ h@@ mas@@ ad@@ u O@@ reli@@ u did not mix , as he will be training the winter through the TEC .
&apos;@@ I am afraid &apos; , he said a little bit .
the London Olympics had almost a full house of the people , did the O@@ rel re@@ integrate people or have been able to turn off ?
I came to Tajani , but in a positive sense .
everyone says that this will add - that is the case !
if you compete , then you can experience it .
he then confirmed that he will be satisfied with the M@@ M &apos;s debate , and he is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 3@@ 2nd outcome of this year &apos;s season , the last one , I closed 18 .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and M@@ il - that is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of the med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina ku@@ ber@@ ner announced party exchanges
the Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ a , that he would change political parties .
&apos;@@ M@@ any it or not , but the democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today , I say to you , having veto@@ ed and thought ... today , I say to you , the Western peac@@ hes , that I can no longer help you as a democratic Governor . &quot;
explanations of joy were g@@ lu@@ ed in the mi@@ xing .
&quot; so I will be a Re@@ publi@@ can tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a engine@@ er , I would say to you that it is time to play a second game . &quot;
the T@@ ru@@ mp had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
T@@ ru@@ mp won 42 points in Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ as and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
justice , which is the only billion sta@@ r in the state , according to the Ford , proved to be elected in 2016 .
in the wilderness , it notes that it has coal mines in five states , and the coal business is quite his father .
his value is approximately USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday evening , the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) published a statement that &apos; the party exchange of Governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic par@@ ade that would rather prevent the country from improving again than working for it &apos; .
&quot; only 15 of the 15 months and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent saying to you , which is a guide to the end of the day and cannot find a positive and united message , &quot; said R@@ N@@ C representation , R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ Daniel C@@ B@@ S New@@ si .

Co@@ e praised the honest apolo@@ gies of the Russians for the anti @-@ doping scandal .
the international r@@ allies of Ker@@ ge@@ ania , S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , praised , according to his words , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apolo@@ gy &apos; on Thursday , but repeated that it is not time to allow sport to be allowed back .
on the eve of the World C@@ up on the eve of the International Council on the eve of the S@@ hy@@ ry S@@ hy@@ ce@@ h@@ tin fri@@ vol@@ ta@@ um , Russia has said that the competition ban imposed on its country is right and has a firm aim to combat doping .
he apolog@@ ised for &apos; all the ligh@@ t@@ weight classes who have been thrown away in competitions by gol@@ den and sil@@ ver med@@ als &apos; .
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on entry into force , which was introduced in November 2015 after the report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think it was a very honest answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said to the IA@@ AF President Co@@ e journalists .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognised that they had had quite difficult times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Union . &quot;
according to Co@@ e , he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for self @-@ determination .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the proposal for a working group that it is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything possible in the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want to have clean spor@@ ts@@ people separated from the system , &apos; he added .
one of the hundreds of Russian b@@ os@@ ses who meet the strict criteria of the IA@@ AF will compete with neutral ath@@ le@@ tes in London on Friday .
the head of the IA@@ AF working group , R@@ une Andersson , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of criteria for forecas@@ ting .
following a presentation by the IA@@ AF to the Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that the trained engineers who have been banned are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution makes a significant difference to the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
little of the fact that the revolution in electric cars significantly changes everything from the fuel market to infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although mining gi@@ ants like G@@ len@@ core can say that they will win from one place and lose another , smaller mining companies will not help .
G@@ len@@ core coal and oil are currently serving , but in the age of electric cars , there will be a growing demand for co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ kel .
this year , the decisions of the UK , France and Norway , which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades , have contributed to the spread of electric cars .
therefore , Vol@@ vo has already knew that they are planning to abandon the combustion engine and T@@ es@@ la will bring to the market a cheaper country of 3 electricity vehicles .
B@@ animal berg , according to the New Energy Finance predi@@ ctions , electric cars are already sold over two decades , more cars than those used by oil @-@ produced fuels .
&quot; for some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ in B@@ animal ber@@ g , the raw materials analy@@ st of the Capital economy .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as co@@ balt and li@@ thi@@ um , which have increased demand for years .
in electric cars , there are approximately three times more cop@@ ies than in the ordinary car , the G@@ len@@ core announced .
more answers are needed in the charging stations , which is why the Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that this will increase the demand for cop@@ per by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ gan@@ ese demand .
G@@ len@@ core can be obtained from rising electricity from cop@@ per prices and from the fact that it is the world &apos;s largest producer of co@@ balt , the forecast J@@ eff@@ ila Group .
according to this bro@@ ker company , the winners of the F@@ bet@@ e @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ tum Min@@ er@@ als are the winners .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of the London me@@ tal stock exchange line has been mixed .
the price increases in the soil were 37 % .
the answer has also been 14 % this year , mainly due to economic growth .
the G@@ len@@ core excise duty rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the ri@@ val in Rio T@@ into Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ oni and Ang@@ lo , respectively .
on the side of the losers , lead companies are like Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine , who have to adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ use of the P@@ li@@ i is the bat@@ teries supplying the start @-@ up of cars with petrol and diesel engines .
electric cars use fil@@ ter mines .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael W@@ id@@ mer Lyn@@ ch , Governor of the Bank of America Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ ch .
the impact of the P@@ li@@ i price movement has not yet been seen in the form of a se@@ am@@ less trend .
the P@@ li@@ i has grown by 17 % this year , with the best methane me@@ tal in London among the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems for the metals in the future .
&quot; I am not sure that it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil is keeping ordinary cars competitive , &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the head of the me@@ tal bro@@ ker Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ s .
if lead demand falls , it will be slow .
perhaps this will happen in about ten years &apos; time .
meanwhile , more stringent emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which is more frequent dependent on advanced lead @-@ based bat@@ teries , will be assessed by international lead and by the research organisation .
Ker@@ g@@ me@@ tal , like alu@@ mini@@ um , is replaced by steel , as a ligh@@ ter car can drive less electricity .
this explains an additional EUR 1.6 million tonnes of closed minimum demand between 2013 and 2016 .
this represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s total output .
this trend is likely to grow , says W@@ id@@ mer .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um is responsible for 13 % this year , as the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to market deficits .
steel producers do not .
the blockade is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful cars .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and S@@ lan@@ Europe are also trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down from steel in order to withstand the minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris , Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to a pla@@ te .
the soil took around half of this precious me@@ tal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , and was announced by the me@@ tal re@@ fin@@ er Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ ta .
&quot; many of the raw materials , such as oil and pla@@ te , may not have high demand in the future , &quot; said Na@@ ti@@ x@@ ourselves &apos;s raw materials analy@@ st Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will change in 15 years .
Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ makers believe continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Mr Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , leader of the Un@@ core , said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 .
the great hope for Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ makers in the 10 years perspective is To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ mun@@ i Mo@@ to@@ s , based on hydrogen @-@ based cars that depend on a pla@@ te to produce electricity from hydrogen .
until now , however , this technology has not yet justified itself commercially .
&quot; it seems to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris from Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers received a major set@@ back in July , as S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art &apos;s court banned diesel in the city of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how the monetary rules of football affect the transition of Ney@@ ra to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the ram@@ pan@@ t spending of European football clubs do not prevent the world record transition from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona club Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences for UEFA , the governing body , which domin@@ ates the European game and in which it is possible to ban teams from the pres@@ ti@@ gious League of Me@@ is@@ ters from participating in the Security Council , are still awaiting the Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ May .
the financial rules for the fair play of UEFA in 2011 ( F@@ F@@ P ) mean that the PS@@ G will have to prove at some point that Mrs Ney@@ ra &apos;s transition was funded without a huge loss .
EUR 2@@ 22 million were paid to Barcelona ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) alone for the fact that the Brazili@@ ans were able to buy their contract , and Ney@@ ra &apos;s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars per year .
here there are some aspects of the transfer of Ney@@ ra to the French club .
the PS@@ G will undoubtedly be able to take up such money for the recruitment of Ney@@ mar@@ ry and to include its sta@@ rs in the wake of the fact that the team is funded by the ruling family in Ka@@ tar &apos;s energy .
clubs have been allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players , but they have to balance it with the legal sources of income that allow them to come out of a football business .
F@@ F@@ F@@ P was set up by Michel Pla@@ tini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that the clubs , which are falling into debt in search of success , are actually engaged in fraud and risk buying when banks or owners should give up support .
from 2011 , the F@@ F@@ P club will focus on monitoring their losses instead of their debts .
this change means that the business model used by Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch was first used in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ sea - to buy a club with potential and then to spend heavily to improve the team and to create a global brand - is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of the F@@ F@@ P , which runs until 2018 , the clubs will be able to bear the losses of up to EUR 30 million .
and despite the fact that Pla@@ tini was dismissed in 2015 , the successor of UEFA , Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , is still committed to preventing excessive over@@ spending .
&quot; F@@ F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said last week The negotiator , Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is UEFA &apos;s F@@ F@@ P Supervisor .
although the PS@@ G ta@@ g for the over@@ purchase clause of Ney@@ ra , it will be possible for them to distribute this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the agreement .
Mrs Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it is possible to demonstrate a transitional fee of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
for the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G , together with Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , received the most severe penalties .
the PS@@ G was fined EUR 60 million ( currently 82 million dollar ) , which was reduced later to EUR 20 million , and the club was required to limit the team of the League of Me@@ is@@ ters to 21 players during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of 25 .
UEFA is looking at clubs who can try to over@@ turn the financial institutions , blow@@ ing their income through companies connected with the owners of the club .
the Ka@@ tar company may spon@@ sor the PS@@ G , but if the value of spon@@ sorship is recognised as standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
this was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar tourism Authority &apos;s PS@@ G support was inf@@ lated .
it has been said that a certain part of the PS@@ G service of Ney@@ mar@@ i can come from Ka@@ infrastructures through contributions from the World C@@ up Management Committee for 20@@ 22 years .
however , the PS@@ G and Q@@ a@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Mrs Ney@@ ra could become a world champi@@ on@@ ship and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulators are capable of easily ex@@ posing such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on the PS@@ G mean that UEFA is even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not been proactive in discussing the transition with the PS@@ G .
they talked about the associated P@@ Congress , provided that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PS@@ G .
the latest reports show that the PS@@ G 2015 @-@ 2016 will generate more than â¬ 10 million in profits from around â¬ 54@@ 2.4 million in turnover .
the figures for the last financial year have not yet been published .
the PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ ra will have a good impact on spon@@ sorship transactions , trade and s@@ nus .
the club looks forward to an increase of at least 30 per cent of turnover in relation to the agreement .
Spain too , having clearly upset the departure of one of the largest football sta@@ rs , sought to block the move by claiming that the PS@@ G is in breach of the F@@ F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with a club and a country , &quot; said La vie President Javier T@@ eb@@ as to the Spanish newspaper AS , referring to the fact that the PS@@ G belongs mainly to the Ka@@ tari@@ as .
Ar@@ sen@@ al mÃ¤@@ ne@@ er , Ar@@ ch@@ ger W@@ en@@ ger , whose club belongs to the American sports mag@@ na@@ te , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights and has changed completely the whole football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to the state , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , since the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player . &quot;

the or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra of the century , which took place on 6 and 7 August , caused major damage in particular to the West , Har@@ ju@@ land and Rap@@ la@@ land .
in the course of these days , the wind was more than 30 m / s in the north @-@ west of Estonia .

now , what is on the coast is already being kept .
price of clean be@@ ach
one of the biggest jobs in the Estonian be@@ aches is the repetition of the rub@@ b@@ ish , the ad@@ ru .
for example , in the P@@ iri@@ ta coast , it must be transported by 400 000 tonnes of coast@@ line .
&apos;@@ This is an incredible amount &apos; , notes the U@@ so@@ v .
the second major category is municipal waste , or all that people leave behind .
there are eight major rub@@ b@@ ish lines in S@@ tro@@ om coastal zones , which need to be watered down three times a week .
so much is the waste .
however , cold summer weather has meant that rub@@ b@@ ish is a fifth less than otherwise .
the third category is abandoned .

&quot; if we do not do this , the city will be fined , &quot; notes Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
however , like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ak@@ r and Savary , the aim is also to get S@@ tro@@ om rand below the quality of the international flag .
&quot; compared with Europe , there is much more work to be done in Estonia to care for the be@@ aches , &quot; says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more ad@@ da@@ r and more ki@@ ds , and it is more difficult to join the sand .
however , our be@@ aches have less rub@@ b@@ ish than elsewhere in Europe .
listening to the fact that there is talk of rub@@ b@@ ish , the conver@@ sa@@ tions between Mr Martin , who is living near the S@@ tro@@ om coast , are taking place in@@ ex@@ or@@ ably in the inter@@ views of the journalist and cor@@ ro@@ gation staff , highlighting the current bottlenecks .
there is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is birds and bot@@ tle sla@@ ves , who have pul@@ led the rub@@ b@@ ish bags , &apos; Mr Martin .
although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the city Government will do something about the rub@@ b@@ ish and , for example , put them on the f@@ ring@@ es to prevent at least birds in the news .
in general , however , Martin S@@ tro@@ om is satisfied with developments .
it can be seen that the city is taking care of this .
it has become more pleasant , enligh@@ tened and fresh as@@ ph@@ alt roads .
it was never the case that only one way could be taken in the event of a roll @-@ out , &quot; said Martin .
findings of S@@ tro@@ om@@ is : coins , only coins
a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Dimit@@ r , who , as a tre@@ asu@@ rer , is sa@@ iling the coast@@ line with metal@@ lic de@@ pression , has had to be used .
he does not believe that , today and in the future , nothing will be found in the price .
marine God is not generous enough to do so .
&quot; I have been dealing with this for one year and has not found anything worthwhile so far , &quot; says D@@ mit@@ ry .
as a ref@@ rig@@ eration , the D@@ mit@@ ry Islands have some euro coins , bot@@ tles and also dangerous p@@ ounds which later throw in the dus@@ t@@ b@@ in .
normally , there are still coins .
&apos;@@ Gol@@ den , the finger and other such practices are usually not &apos; , &apos; they are owned by the tre@@ asu@@ ries .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain on the previous level , as un@@ be@@ arable growth and inflation relief have cus@@ hi@@ oned speculation on the increase .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain a lo@@ opho@@ le , because household incomes have put interest rates on expectations .
decision makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MP@@ C ) have voted 6 : 2 in favour of 0.@@ 25 % retention and fewer members this month require an increase , as slow economic growth has weakened the support for growth .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank cut its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 and from 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in rates for the next few years is necessary to curb inflation from Bre@@ x@@ on from Bre@@ x@@ men , and that the expected increase in lending costs in the financial markets could be necessary .
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package , which was launched as a result of Bre@@ x@@ ti a year ago .
the Bank will termin@@ ate its fixed @-@ term cash scheme in February , which provides banks with cheap funding , even though it said that it is now GBP 15 billion to wait for the scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; the central forecast of MP@@ C will remain gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the near future , as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption . &quot;
as regards the rates of inflation , it was reiterated that a &apos; fiscal effort &apos; is needed to alleviate inflation , and this &apos; somewhat higher &apos; than expected in the markets .
the Eurosta@@ rs is now predi@@ cting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any ju@@ mp is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % for the next year .
the forecast for 1.8 % growth in 2018 was maintained .
after this news , the p@@ ound of the dollar and the euro fell .
women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.@@ 31 and 0.@@ 4 % to EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to growing hopes of an increase in GDP in the second quarter , from 0.2 % to 0.@@ 3 % in the previous three months .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will be able to collect a little momentum .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave rise to little reason to re@@ jo@@ ice in the households suffering from rising inflation and ab@@ ject wage increases , saying that the situation would go a little worse before an improvement .
it has been added that the monetary policy cannot prevent a fall in income in the next few years , but the three @-@ year forecast is expected to result in a marked recovery of wages .
as a result , the economy is also encouraged by the growing demand for British production , which is partly compensa@@ ting for lower costs for consumers .
the decision comes one year after the rates were taken by 0.@@ 25 % last August , following the shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the p@@ ound .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to brea@@ the life into the prices and to the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last decision , there was a growing demand for higher levels , as inflation had increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak p@@ ound .
Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , leader of Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ ga@@ ges , said : &apos; in the light of the recent downturn in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market will again become increasingly competitive , as creditors want to work and hope to end the year in a positive way .
the BÃ¶@@ rs seems to be particularly favourable to those whose transactions are coming to an end , as re@@ financing , often without service and low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
10 000 people have been written out by the N@@ HS as a drug of HIV conflict .
patients have since September had access to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; HIV @-@ preventive treatment after the battle in the Supreme Court over whether the N@@ HS should finance the medicine .
N@@ HS England announced that public health care is now estimated to make 10 000 people available during the initial three @-@ year clinical trial for pre @-@ e@@ min@@ ence ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t that is man@@ ned before the incident and has shown a reduction of approximately 86 % of the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people .
the N@@ HS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the Court of appeal supported the ruling of the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS is able to pay for the Pr@@ EP , despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Ste@@ vens , the Executive Director of N@@ HS Eng@@ land , welcomed this Thursday as a &apos; new large @-@ scale intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &apos; pivotal moment &apos; .
sexual health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ oli@@ s and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to register people in October , and further clin@@ ics before the programme is introduced in England by April 2018 .
the pre @-@ Pr@@ EP is a hot@@ line for HIV drugs , which will be taken before the incident , in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that Pr@@ EP will significantly reduce the transmission of HIV among people with a risk of infection .
the Pr@@ EP &apos;s adoption before the mid @-@ term means that there is a sufficient number of certain medicines in order to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure .
the right candidates include L@@ GB@@ T men , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment .
they identify suitable people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their participation in the local sex health clin@@ ics in the programme .
the programme will cost GBP 10 million and N@@ HS England signed an agreement to get medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the clinical test aims to assess the actual potential of the Pr@@ EP by collecting clinical evidence of who is treated and how it is consumed and implemented .
Ste@@ ven said : &apos; this new large @-@ scale intervention should complement and enhance the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV proliferation .
this is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of the greatest health problems facing humanity . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , the Man@@ aging Director of NA@@ T , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
the Pr@@ EP , if targeted correctly to those who need it and belong to the risk line , offers an opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic .
since September , people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
the Man@@ aging Director of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Foundation , ian Green , said : &apos; now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is launched quickly and that no HIV risk group is excluded .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of HIV infection .
the Minister for Public Health , Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , said : &apos; Pr@@ EP clinical trials are very welcome and very late after months of delay and the cen@@ sus of government sho@@ es .
evidence shows how much changes this drug can bring to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical trial will lead us a step closer to full understanding of the benefits of the Pr@@ EP .
it is now important for a clinical trial to be introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV and lead us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
in July , the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.@@ 94 , compared to EUR 7.@@ 71 in June this year , Ele@@ ring .
the main reason for the price difference is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , the electricity average was â¬ 3@@ 4.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour last month and the price arose by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five per cent to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 17 , and the electricity exchanges in Nord half of the systemic price was EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ ble hour .
prices rose by 12 and seven per cent respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity was mobile by 75 % last month from Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine per cent of the two @-@ hour transactions between the two countries did not take place .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity reached 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the hours had the full transmission capacity .
according to the last trading day of July , Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X on the market may turn into an electricity exchange price of 34 and â¬ 37 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ ble hour in August .
the price of carbon dioxide produced by electricity prices came up last month and transactions took place at 5.@@ 04 @-@ 5.@@ 47 per tonne .
life of higher life - half @-@ order and smart de@@ sig@@ ners have made it a small Ear@@ ls of the Court of Justice in the home
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker who is a passion@@ ate property innova@@ tor , swit@@ ched his home to the Grand K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in 2014 against the Ear@@ ls Court of Justice .
it is in the first order of Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ Å£@@ i , and that Jo@@ anne has not brought his bags together and sold the fla@@ ts , is a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived together with a former com@@ pass in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tanta@@ mount to the price that I offer .
it was shown to me by the Ear@@ ls Court of Justice and had the same high waves .
I am wondering about this and I made an offer on the same day . &quot;
since the first visit , this 93 @-@ me@@ tre has passed a full innovation gap .
at the beginning , it was a s@@ lee@@ ping and a complex s@@ lee@@ ping cor@@ t - a s@@ lee@@ ping wall had to go through kit@@ chen , and Jo@@ anne wanted to add space and qu@@ asi @-@ regulation to exploit high levels .
&quot; I wanted high , big win@@ dows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he is asking Er@@ fan Az@@ ad N@@ ot@@ ting Hil@@ lis , the archite@@ ctural and de@@ sig@@ ner of Du@@ ck &amp; Order , to take advantage of 3.@@ 8 m e@@ ars and to create a home that is not just a development site but a place where Jo@@ anne could live .
it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create a qu@@ asi @-@ order in which to stand up .
the Er@@ fan was supposed to be a creative approach .
&quot; aquaculture is quite complex , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise the premises so that they are located on each other , without having to bo@@ w to each other .
it was not just about building a platform , but we used steel construction to ensure that both the upper and lower space is right . &quot;
this place allowed the Er@@ fan@@ il to create two full @-@ blo@@ wn elements in the room , with a great deal of dramatic elements .
one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ one @-@ stop @-@ shop is opening up the old @-@ fashi@@ oned light of the R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us window to the gla@@ ci@@ d@@ ity of R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us .
the gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture of Pe@@ e@@ gel@@ li , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ spe@@ ctive Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille , highlight the style of space .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in the inclusion of theat@@ re , space and lighting .
both sides of the short corridor have been included in the mir@@ rors that this would appear to be longer .
in the K@@ night , the mir@@ ror is giving the impression of another accompanying window .
in the course of a return , the s@@ nap@@ shot of the deposit of all Jo@@ anne &apos;s and glass claims will be reflected .
housing is accompanied by a false possibility of shu@@ tting down the vegetables if it is not used , creating a more den@@ se space .
the cu@@ mber@@ some kit@@ chen is nothing new .
however , with this kit@@ chen , there is a unique fact that this is a plu@@ g of u@@ pris@@ ings of the type of gar@@ age .
&quot; this went a little in the design , &quot; explains the presence of Er@@ fan ter@@ as@@ stronger spo@@ use of M@@ D@@ F .
&quot; this has a counter@@ weight , which is why it is very simple to reject it . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne now has 16 additional metres , additional s@@ lee@@ ping rooms and a better harves@@ ter plan .
&quot; after all , the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to property , &apos; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ Kin@@ nis@@ a takes an outdated form and makes calculations on the basis of land area &apos; .
here they have been able to increase the sur@@ faces , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to the space .
&quot; materials are what you are missing and thus help to create an emotional link with the home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ You are not in the electricity c@@ ables that are in my se@@ in .
it is important , but it does not put the heart of the languages ring@@ ing . &quot;
this shows that a good design and an increase in the area will help to make something aston@@ ishing from a rather normal cor@@ ps .
in fact , they can even create a desire not to leave , as was the case with Jo@@ anne .
the main figure , Jen@@ sen Jen@@ sen , is Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s pil@@ l @-@ mak@@ er , who is competing with my colleague for his profession@@ alism .
no more than the amount of money that has been earned , apart from which any ethics is forgotten .
his wife and three children can only see a man on his property and late this evening .
in the first half of the film , I find myself in the idea that this is a version of the business world - even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s speech is similar .
what the film goes on , however , the less well @-@ established element remains , and the mor@@ alising intention of film @-@ makers is beginning to appear more and more .
a life @-@ changing experience will be the main player in cancer .
a choice must now be made between work and family life .
the po@@ et of po@@ pp@@ y cen@@ sus makes a father look at the big buildings in Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s big buildings , just like religion , welfare , love ... , without even the disaster of the twin tow@@ ers .
after the third , where the son &apos;s father &apos;s eyes are opened , there is a feeling that the film @-@ makers have certainly been able to obtain the audi@@ ences of the purpose , because even the most pre@@ da@@ tory view of the heart is unable to keep te@@ ars back in the face of the suffering of the cu@@ m cancer patients .
if the po@@ et falls and his situation seems to be hope@@ less , the father will once and for all understand the moral nature of his work and do a good job for the elderly .
now , in a sense , I am lu@@ cky with myself - if a film has been in possession of it , then I will reward my sense of vision after the film coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , then at least one surprise may be rewarded .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ice coff@@ ee will be lost - when the hus@@ band calls a sick man and a man dri@@ ves a motor@@ way along the road map .
however , the Po@@ e@@ g has been ama@@ zed at all , and although his father has just lost his job , it is also positive , because it is now time to deal with the family .
I can also feel well - I can predict the end of the American dra@@ ma quite well .
in truth , film is well constructed , all the necessary elements are in place .
it will be the Council , it will be a laugh@@ ing actor , it is a good and moral beau@@ ty : money is not the most important thing in life .
this film is well introduced by surprise .
the new Staff Com@@ man@@ der is planning to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F@@ . Kelly will actually be able to do so .
in that case , it would be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff chief of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope that it will keep the upper hand in a more balanced way .
there is a full report here from Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ lt :
&quot; when the new staff chief of the White House , John F@@ . Kelly , met with high officials on his first day of work , he highlighted the key problem of President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ ges Ma@@ in , which he intends to address in the hands of the President Assad .
Mr Kelly said to the officials that information must be carried out , whether on paper or in meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried to do so and have failed to tame T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i by monitoring its media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades , and now that he is in Val@@ dis Ma@@ in , his television observation habits have not gone anywhere .
&quot; when the candidate T@@ ru@@ mp was dis@@ honest about dis@@ honest media coverage , he had to show him that he was also fairly reflected in the publications affecting him , &quot; said former campaig@@ ner S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg in February to Poli@@ ti@@ co .
Poli@@ tic@@ o tara Pal@@ mer wrote at the time that &apos; according to the six former campaig@@ ners , T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter is a key tool for controlling the behaviour of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter , to ensure that his personal media consumption also has a stable record of praise &apos; .
good .
however , the idea that the habits of using T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaig@@ ners know something that the rest of us do not know that the v@@ ouch@@ ers of T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i would have been even more hear@@ tening without their intervention .
we will probably never know about the v@@ ouch@@ ers that the T@@ ru@@ mp did not postal .
if he was hel@@ ple@@ ss able to save him or a couple of times , his efforts were worth doing so .
however , no one has been able to prevent the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i from constantly creating controversy .
part of the problem is that , in the White House , which is composed of competing cli@@ cks , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception , by transferring material to the T@@ ru@@ g , which supports their global views , but may not always be credible .
the whole story of policy @-@ making policy tic@@ o wrote in May the tendency of advis@@ ers to the President of feed @-@ related information with a strategic question .
one of the examples described by the repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is as follows :
&quot; the current and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i will say that T@@ ru@@ mp can react to the negative press , particularly the harmful effects of the le@@ af@@ lets , explo@@ sive , taking as a ob@@ session with the identification of their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone gave the President a che@@ er@@ fully copy of the Internet provocation to Charles C. Joh@@ n@@ son &apos;s website , G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com , which accused the staff de@@ pu@@ ties Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , that he was a white house for a number of le@@ af@@ lets . &quot;
it does not matter that Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked by Twitter , or that he did not provide any specific evidence or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
the T@@ ru@@ mp read the article and started to ask Wal@@ sh@@ i . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that Ro@@ b Por@@ ter and the head of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , have tried to set up a system for managing and docu@@ menting the documents reaching T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but T@@ ru@@ mp is still an impul@@ se and his assis@@ tant will continue to compete on the basis of influence .
these un@@ changing factors make the mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans who have come from abroad to the capital of the capital will not be able to obtain permission to do so .
there is a lot of foreign affairs in the city of Tallinn .
those with whom the le@@ af@@ let came to recognise that they played in the old town without the permission of the urban government .
the first thing we found was the three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who had taken the same co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il in the vic@@ inity of Vir@@ u .
it was clear to see that mus@@ ici@@ ans with ro@@ ckets and broken ri@@ gs were the mus@@ ici@@ ans of ab@@ sen@@ tia , who would be taken away by one of the de@@ ser@@ ts .
in spite of the humili@@ ation , the only woman in the company played a fer@@ ry in the a@@ partment , while one man , alongside him , was in ges@@ tation with three bal@@ ls and fur@@ ni@@ ture .
the third man was sitting in ab@@ sen@@ tia alongside them , and he himself smo@@ ked a warm @-@ hear@@ ted w@@ ag@@ on .
their three do@@ gs did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the people of passing .
Mr Bo@@ b , who has played with Mr No@@ emi and the pal@@ lia@@ tes , has said that he is we@@ aring the streets both for fu@@ n and for money .
the purpose of the event was to collect ticket money for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day .
on the question of whether or not they asked for permission from the town for ro@@ tation , Mr No@@ emi and Mr Bo@@ b have shak@@ en their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never remain in one city for more than a day or a few and , in most cases , permits for a month or something like this .
there is no point in paying for this , &quot; explained by Bo@@ b .
when we returned to the gates of Vir@@ u some 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in mus@@ ici@@ ans and are going to go .
this pa@@ per@@ work for the Vir@@ u crossing of the virtual centre with sa@@ cks and bags in ab@@ sen@@ tia .
Vir@@ u street has also represented three Polish young men , one of whom played a fifth , another k@@ ni@@ fe , and the third had even been transported by electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people enter@@ tainment in order to spread music and joy , and to earn money for fuel and living , &quot; tri@@ o pi@@ pe M@@ iv@@ os@@ h explained .
according to M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there must be permission from the City Government .
&apos; of course we do not have this &apos; , he said it jo@@ ke .
but we hope that if people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
of course , if the police comes , we will go elsewhere , but we must try &apos; , he added .
in July , the Estonian bank bought bonds worth â¬ 149 million in the public assets programme of central banks in the euro area , with a bank bond portfolio of â¬ 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , has explained in the past that the assets of the central banks of the Euro@@ system are covered by three different purchasing programmes : the bonds covered by the financial sector ( VIS ) , the bonds guaranteed ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public debt ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases will fall in the production of lower @-@ risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks .
as a rule , in the framework of the public bond programme , each Central Bank bu@@ ys its own government bonds , and the bonds of other countries are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank will make a so @-@ called &apos; replacement shop &apos; within the limits allocated to them .
the central banks also shop in those countries where the provision of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian bank generally bu@@ ys the bonds of the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian bank will buy bonds under the asset programme from March 2015 .
in the meantime , Ele@@ round bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian bank of June 2016 will no longer buy bonds from June 2016 .
in the name of the central banks of the euro area , both Ele@@ round and Estonia will buy energy bonds from the Bank of Finland from June .
migrants are ignoring degrees and returning to the &apos; millions of business &apos; .
some of the West Mid@@ lands &apos;s most aff@@ lu@@ ent owners have once again found themselves in a fier@@ ce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the une@@ le@@ cted bureaucra@@ ts of the Council in order to win back their walls .
the migratory movements have par@@ ked their 20 tra@@ ilers to the brink of a wealth of millions of business in the vic@@ inity of the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ li street .
they have returned , together with hor@@ ses , children and lorries , to the army , after they were thrown out in May , without being thrown out of a degree of bureaucracy that was complaining to the Council to prevent their invasion .
an activist group found a weak place in defence limits , turning its vehicles through un@@ blocked parts that were left to po@@ ke .
the people of M@@ aru@@ ang@@ ry have conta@@ cted So@@ lih@@ ul@@ li Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless in dealing with the problem &apos; .
one anon@@ ymous person said : &apos; they cop@@ ied there on Monday evening after their exclusion from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ from , where they were st@@ oring the fur@@ ni@@ ture .
the Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migratory movements were there in May , they were delayed and now they are back again .
they came to last night , probably more today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect their par@@ ks .
I live on the road of street et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k , and I am not happy that I must continue to pay the full charge if the Council is unable even to prevent such a thing . &quot;
one local resident who also wanted to remain anon@@ ymous said : &apos; it is ridiculous , and we saw the last of these migratory movements left , and there is already a new offensive .
this time , there has been an increase in the number and even a horse has been seen in the grass@@ land . &quot;
the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ li Council representative said : &apos; we are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the land near the street et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k , and we are working with the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ li police , and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
the gathering of evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling the number 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ na F@@ esti@@ val will also visit the Minister for Culture , In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is pleased to have been able to bring real world top names to Estonia .
the question of why the We@@ ek@@ ise festi@@ val is so important for the Est@@ oni@@ ans , Sa@@ ar , that it should be asked of all those who enjoy three days at the festi@@ val .
however , he is aware that the real players in the area of Per@@ sia have come to pass .
&quot; looking at the level of artists , which has been brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music director will be brought home - often not in our hands , the Minister for Culture is speaking .
however , what festi@@ vals are the artists of Sa@@ art himself all the most telling ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person , and it is certainly one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ new@@ re@@ n , who stood up last night .
after all , all of us are at some point in their own feet , &quot; he says .
however , he also highlights a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ thia , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ bels .
of course , our own Estonian players : starting from NO@@ x , and they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , this ren@@ owned concentration of names is very high , &quot; he says .

Au@@ di upgra@@ des up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of criticism by car manufacturers
the day before the Au@@ di &apos;s announcement , B@@ M@@ W said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of B@@ M@@ W , the company believes that &apos; there is a smarter option than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the B@@ M@@ W home city of Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles will be upgra@@ ded to reduce emissions from diesel engines in Europe .
no company has described them as a call for withdrawal .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , the cost of equipment installed for neutr@@ alising vehicles em@@ itting diesel vehicles is increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under a thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of ring@@ ing powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to prevent Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen from repeating the mistakes of the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , who was silent about the use of so @-@ called pe@@ tro@@ le@@ ry devices , which allowed emissions to be adapted to regulations when testing a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
several Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former president of the Au@@ di engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
former President Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Au@@ di in Germany was drawn into a criminal investigation into Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , when the authorities accused the installation of the audit system in order to evade the requirements for European gas emissions by extending the investigation , which was previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Au@@ di in the investigation may be a major blow to the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , a producer of luxury cars , a disproportionately large proportion of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen &apos;s profits .
Estonian schools will have 20 000 euro of EU flags .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency .
a total of 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 c@@ enti@@ metres of the European Union &apos;s flag will be 5@@ 70 education institutions .
flags are intended to in@@ sta@@ ll in@@ door doors , they must be carried out in high @-@ quality printed techniques with a sense of quality assurance in in@@ door communications , the ER@@ R news portal .
there is a text on the label : &apos; Kin@@ gi@@ tus Estonia &apos;s schools for the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags is EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , or one flag will cost EUR 35 .
murder of journalist highlights growing threats in Mexico
the workers of the weekly newspaper , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , usually gather on Wednesday , in order to review plans for the most recent chaos in the State of Y@@ a@@ oa , which so@@ ws organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ stop@@ p@@ able drug wars .
however , today they have gathered to discuss their own security in the shadow of a personal tragedy .
they are told that it is important to change their rou@@ tine .
two of the parents will be discussing which seems safer : either to bring children into office , which was the target of the gran@@ dio@@ attack in 2009 , or to leave them home .
security experts have written three words , &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutral &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask repor@@ ters to be able to provide the names of the river bas@@ ket , and they do not need the impres@@ sions and internal feelings .
the presence of government or car@@ tels is suspected of being drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists , a whole list of people who are making it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
violence is not a b@@ reat@@ h , and the more the bodies of the country accumu@@ late , the majority of which are journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists , from President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena , to the appointment of at least 25 in December 2012 , 5@@ 89 journalists under public protection following attacks and threats , and this year , at least seven journalists have been killed in seven state states .
the most recent deaths include their edit@@ or and inspiration , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce co @-@ foun@@ der Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez one of his many reports on drug @-@ related violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though his presence can be felt anywhere in the theat@@ re of the River Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Bu@@ il@@ ding , a great picture of Val@@ de@@ z@@ an , which shows an average of the finger at Val@@ de@@ z@@ ist , and two of the 30@@ n@@ ines repor@@ ters , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , carries T @-@ shir@@ ts , which have been portra@@ yed by his wife @-@ s@@ lee@@ ping glas@@ ses or the face of the ama@@ te@@ ur .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death , Re@@ por@@ ters will be discussing a common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , their hope@@ lessness , their paran@@ o@@ ia .
although in 2010 , a separate public prosecution service was set up to address journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee on the Protection of journalists .
as in the case of the most annual drug trafficking and organised crime , the number of murders amounting to thousands , the kil@@ lers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
the edit@@ orial in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce will continue to reflect the violence in Sin@@ al@@ ina , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and justice of the murde@@ rers , there is a lot of benefits , according to I@@ bar@@ ra .
&apos;@@ It is very nice to waste your time here at the meeting &apos; .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , there will be a mistrust of everyone . &quot;
Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the capital of the State , Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , on 15 May morning .
he was able to travel only a few quarters before two men stopped the red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ rol@@ la , forcing him to go out of the car and shot 12 times , and this is expected to be because of the name of the newspaper , which means &apos; the twel@@ f@@ th river &apos; .
the armed man travelled to Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s car and made an accident in the vic@@ inity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adults .
the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely spread freely .
however , the Val@@ de@@ z issue is essentially dominated by silence .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition of the United States in January , one of the bloo@@ di@@ est bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country has been one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country , since ri@@ val@@ ries are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
there is no difference that a person or even a number of people are du@@ mped every day on the streets of your oa , or that the dead are w@@ rap@@ ped with the gru@@ es@@ ome two @-@ fold swe@@ eten@@ ers of nar@@ co@@ tics , which are more than many homes .
let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one car@@ tel is headed by the state of the sea with valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and the President , Is@@ May Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , have a huge inno@@ c@@ ence that he was unable to defend his friend .
he believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
the first was the publication in February of an interview with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons with a competing and military car@@ tel .
this piece of correspon@@ dence could have been allu@@ ded to by the wealthy members of the suspect who bought all the cop@@ ies of the publication as soon as these newspapers were reached .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country for its own security , after the ra@@ va@@ ge took place in one of the other &apos;s newspapers , which has been reflected in the same story .
Val@@ dez was leg@@ alised both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had remained in life for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he existed forever .
he served as a ve@@ ter@@ an@@ repor@@ ter in the newspaper No@@ ro@@ l in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , sold 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said that it was impossible to deal with the media without tou@@ ching on the drug problem . &quot;
the quantity of time spent by its courageous and honest publicity , and sales and advertising increased .
Re@@ por@@ ters were keen to express vigorous studies without fear of censorship and read@@ ers , in which they could read stories that no one else da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspaper won the pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ oti Award for the demonstrations in Latin America .
in the same year , the Committee for the Protection of journalists in Val@@ dez ( AK@@ K ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow the Mexic@@ an drug creation wherever it takes .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said the AK@@ K award .
last October , he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in the Y@@ our .
&quot; the mayors will accept the task that the journalist office is accompanied by a second chance to play .
I do not want to ask me that what I did in the face of so many deaths , or why I did not talk about what is going on . &quot;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ ctives will miss Val@@ de@@ z , a jo@@ ke who ro@@ p@@ pered like mad@@ r@@ us , a friend who divided embry@@ os and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their support to his rou@@ tine .
he always we@@ ed his own village .
he went across the office to El Guatem@@ y@@ ab@@ o bar and was always in the same des@@ k .
now they ask whether his rou@@ tine love became fatal to him .
his death has also cast them in doubt about how best to do his job and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the arrogance of their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result , even in the best times , is strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination .
tr@@ usted your in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
if it is a matter of suspi@@ cious fra@@ gran@@ ces , the hotel .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce edit@@ or And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ ali said that the problem is that &apos; fra@@ gran@@ ce can be dece@@ ived ... and this is the case with J@@ emp@@ era &apos; .
he and others say that you no longer have old rules , just as they do not apply in Thailand , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ ros or other states , which are home to the toxic combination of lu@@ cra@@ tive smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in a space where Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only a pu@@ pi@@ l sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in front of the house , two police officers were seeking a rela@@ xation of 40 degrees of heat , hiding behind the pu@@ mps .
they were appointed by the government to the office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , which is located in the middle of the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an centre class in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
some of the repor@@ ters won@@ dered whether these police officers are among their 50 % of police officers , whose Governor himself has been un@@ reliable .
several months have passed since repor@@ ters have been travelling to mountainous rural areas where controls are de facto drug gan@@ gs .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edition this week addressed three main pillars .
one of them was the murder of former po@@ x@@ leg@@ s Ju@@ li@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez ven@@ na in Sin@@ al@@ o .
in addition , they had a reve@@ aling story of the spending of government funds on the home city of the Governor .
a group of people was kidna@@ pped from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , and a public Prosecutor &apos;s c@@ abinet .
there was no formal announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how it happened , so there was a need to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of a restaur@@ ant , both of drug dealers and of the authorities .
the Re@@ por@@ ter became aware of public documents that a restaur@@ ant is registered as a politician who belongs to the ruling Institu@@ tional Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
in recent times , several IR@@ P Governor has been accused of corruption in the context of widespread cases .
in Vil@@ lar@@ line , the repor@@ ter asked her to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Gu@@ z@@ man po@@ et El Chap@@ o was saved by the army .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have been looking for the Val@@ dez co@@ ck@@ ta@@ g to obtain information on kidna@@ pping from the best sources .
&quot; in the past , we would have known what happened , &apos; said 46 @-@ year @-@ old Vil@@ lar@@ line , whose bro@@ ker body construction has earned him a slogan El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all channels of communication have broken up with our sources . &quot;
the Val@@ de@@ z office has become a reser@@ vo@@ ir to bridges and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the edit@@ orial workers have become something that they never expected to wait for activists on behalf of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez took a few eyes and direction next morning to the local Prosecutor &apos;s office for another journalist .
Mr Salvador , in the western state of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an , three days after the killing of Val@@ de@@ z .
it has been found to be a dead body and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists have become more popular across the country and are cri@@ pp@@ ling the phrase &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; in the form of organised prote@@ sters and buildings .
on this day , President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington , trying to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
a day after the death of Val@@ de@@ z , the Ra@@ mi@@ rez authorities accused journalists of the bul@@ lying and killing of journalists because of the truth .
after that , he asked him to be diver@@ ted from the government &apos;s activities elsewhere , concerned that hatred has affected objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists are &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ cul@@ pri@@ ts and indifferent society .
in his last book on the &apos; drug press &apos; , he wrote that the repor@@ ters are not only killing drug gan@@ gs , but also under the command of politicians and security forces who are at the mer@@ cy of organised crime .
Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , awarded more than half of the attacks by journalists on the police and public officials last year .
&quot; in Mexico , you are going to be silent , &quot; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
there is obviously a bloody impact .
no one will forget the death of the blo@@ gg@@ er Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state in Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ sis six years ago .
he was found dead with a letter , which was probably signed by the car@@ tel in L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my repor@@ ters &apos; .
in addition to his bel@@ o@@ ved head , computer glass and e@@ lep@@ han@@ ts were found .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state , Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , following the killing of their correspon@@ dent in the Vir@@ sla@@ va B@@ oh@@ h in March .
others will pass on as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do after the murder of their President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug car@@ tel with the edit@@ orial &apos; Mi@@ da do you want us ? &apos;
some journalists have fled their home states or even their country .
this is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
in theory , it is difficult to find a job and they still have to get to the streets in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes they are being persecuted , as was probably the case with photo@@ graph@@ i Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered three months after the arrival of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z in 2015 , together with four months after Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
those who remain in place and continue to work will have to refu@@ te risky decisions every day .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to become a po@@ et , recognises that it is frigh@@ tening to reflect the drug business .
&quot; Mexico is on the road to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
one of the recent mid@@ night of Friday , when the latest number had already been s@@ nat@@ ched , was the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s office in front of the office and pl@@ undering the be@@ er when suddenly all phones started to be cal@@ ib@@ rated .
19 people were killed , according to confirmed in the fire exchange between ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ is , 19 people .
the war es@@ c@@ ala@@ ted , as did a number of messages from car@@ tels found in the region .
according to the same pa@@ vements , repor@@ ters made news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website using a mobile phone .
in the front of next day , a change was needed .
the massac@@ res were seized by another arrival in the region .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pi@@ il@@ us towards police officers on the alert to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not at least show this .
workers in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , who have fallen on the ground under the massive cab@@ in of their fin@@ gers , where their average finger is to be seen as a whole , were carried out by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers in his foot@@ steps .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w can you think about closure , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; whereas , on the same day , Javier killed , a trainees@@ hip asked me to make a report on the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur used to protect enemies
at first sight , it seems like a form , albeit rather frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now unve@@ iled the first findings in relation to the presence of un@@ beli@@ evable rub@@ b@@ ish numbers detected by Canada , which has been so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; din@@ osa@@ urs Mon@@ a &apos; .
it has been so well preserved that it was even possible to as@@ certain that the lea@@ ther covered by his Fin@@ ns was col@@ oured with red lig@@ ni@@ te and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the report published in the magaz@@ ine Bi@@ ology described the status as the &apos; best preserved so@@ om@@ unit &apos; , which has ever been found , and if &apos; one of the best parts of the world &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ ry that lived in the middle of the seas@@ ons , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
its un@@ beli@@ eva@@ bly good retention in Rab@@ a , which describes it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
this so@@ rely covered plant feed is the best preserved , according to the National Ge@@ o@@ sian magaz@@ ine , on the type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus that has ever been found .
it was found on 21 March 2011 by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he extra@@ cted Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um in For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
he has struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into it .
the ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus found was sent to Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um .
for the next six years , it was developed to ex@@ tri@@ cate the animal from 2 500 na@@ vi@@ es ( 11.@@ 100 @-@ kilometres ) .
after all this hard work , the end result will now finally be ready to bring the public to the public .
&quot; if a little eyes are tor@@ n up , almost believe he is s@@ lee@@ ping , &quot; said Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , the leading author , Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell , in the muse@@ um of the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell .
&quot; this goes down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most preserved din@@ osa@@ urs - din@@ osa@@ urs Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &quot;
when he looked at his sk@@ in , it was reported that this vege@@ tation , which is covered by so@@ aps and rese@@ mb@@ les a di@@ r@@ ty tan@@ k , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food din@@ osa@@ urs .
this high @-@ level din@@ osa@@ ur was used by red and white defence col@@ ours to hide from pre@@ da@@ tors , and applied shel@@ tering techniques , which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
this allowed experts , according to the din@@ osa@@ ur , to enter into better surroun@@ dings and avoid enemies , as the major din@@ osa@@ urs were likely to hun@@ t him .
this was the first time in news in May and is now visited by the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um in the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ ace .
the theat@@ re has now investigated and given it the name of the Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta Mar@@ mit@@ chel@@ l M@@ use@@ um mark Mitchell , who was a team that spent more than 7 000 hours to expose more than 7@@ 000 hours .
thanks to the ama@@ zing good survival of the father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the so@@ oms .
they found dis@@ approval - a common method of protection in animal species , which means that the intr@@ usion of the status was a dam as a alu@@ ter .
although there is widespread dis@@ approval , the findings come as a surprise , as Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta is much greater than those who are currently living in the sha@@ dows .
this suggests that din@@ osa@@ ur pressure was sufficiently actively hun@@ ted by other mus@@ ici@@ ans , so that the evolution preferred to be over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed rather than the confrontation of the survi@@ v@@ ors .
however , most of the animals used today , such as fear , se@@ als or ar@@ mad@@ il@@ ls , are far smaller and more vulnerable , indicating that no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us had to really work to survive .
&quot; the strong hun@@ t of the din@@ osa@@ ur , which is covered by huge and abundan@@ t so@@ aps , shows how dangerous the pre@@ da@@ tory of the inf@@ an@@ cy of the seas@@ ons could be , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds of organic comp@@ ounds also revealed that the din@@ osa@@ ur &apos;s sk@@ in was red .
scientists will continue to set up an investigation to get ang@@ les about this life , including the retained content of this gender style , in order to find out what the animal would have for its last summer .
they believe that the din@@ osa@@ ur collapsed in the death of rivers , thereby entering into the sea , where it turned its back to the ocean .
at the time , Alber@@ tas was just as so@@ e as it is now in South Flor@@ ence and rivers and oceans were likely to go far beyond the internal land as they are now .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us is truly remarkable , as it has been fully covered by so@@ d@@ den sk@@ in , while it has also remained three @-@ dimensional , maintaining the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal today sees almost the same as in the age of the s@@ tun@@ ning .
to recon@@ stru@@ ct this , there is not a great deal of imagination to use - it is enough simply to pre@@ ach bridges and it seems to be a s@@ le@@ ep . &quot;
the era of crisis was the time when the enormous two leg@@ s of meat feed into the countryside - he@@ tero@@ han@@ ts .
although the Qu@@ e@@ en Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x lived millions of years later than Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , some of his hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous predecess@@ ors could be hun@@ ted out of this so@@ d@@ dled din@@ osa@@ ur .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ sa@@ ur@@ us , 38 leg@@ s ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) , a long and six tonnes mon@@ ster .
scientists whose recent findings have been published in the Journal in Bi@@ ology believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta was killed after death in the sea and that this mu@@ tu@@ ality was mu@@ ted .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn functional , when he extra@@ cted from For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near the mining of Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um in Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
according to the Mu@@ use@@ um , it has been best preserved in the world &apos;s so@@ om@@ om@@ al@@ ment , including sk@@ in and so@@ d@@ oms , and this is a comprehensive concentration up to the pu@@ p@@ pet .
these assumptions were on average 18 leg@@ s ( five metres ) long and up to GBP 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .
there were two 20 customs qu@@ eu@@ es on this shoulders .
scientists believe that this so@@ rely covered vege@@ tation comp@@ ound through the current Western Canada , until the river floo@@ ded through its opening sea .
however , the landing place in the sea of the din@@ osa@@ ur helped to maintain its characteristics in an excellent detail .
the gla@@ ci@@ ers of this particular father , coal , have so well maintained that the head@@ lines of the my@@ ster@@ y so@@ om@@ nis are still covered by the head@@ lines of the din@@ osa@@ ur .
as Mr G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote in the National Ge@@ o@@ sian magaz@@ ine : &apos; such sta@@ teh@@ ood is as rare as a lo@@ opho@@ le .
the more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
the sk@@ in @-@ lea@@ ded lea@@ vers still cover the creation of my@@ ste@@ rious so@@ di@@ um sto@@ res .
a better front is lying alongside him , and the way in which he has been st@@ olen up@@ wards .
I will be able to list the so@@ y@@ ings of his winter . &quot;
how did one activist find a response to the question of &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll became a full shock .
just a day after the trip to New York , this St@@ . Lou@@ ka resident , via Airbus , was ren@@ ted in a to@@ wed bed , travelling on Facebook on the phone .
he came to the post of his former school@@ ing compan@@ i@@ ons .
it said : &apos; the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ents and he is still on the streets &apos; .
he was confused as to why no one else was writing this information on his stream , so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
the P@@ ide@@ ga @ The@@ e@@ P@@ suc@@ ah user had repeatedly been divided on his time@@ line .
Mr St@@ . , Mr Brown , who was killed by Mr Fer@@ gus@@ on Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is , the death of an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by a white police officer in the Fer@@ gus@@ on region .
he gave a picture of the life of Bro@@ w@@ n , which was found in the street , for four hours .
&quot; this is cra@@ zy , &quot; said Ferreira .
however , death was nothing new for him or for the community .
he put his phone off , but later this evening he saw the ta@@ g of people &apos;s assembly in Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
J@@ ag@@ ati photo@@ graph@@ s of the police and the people of fear , and a man who claimed himself to be the father of Bro@@ w@@ n and kept a label with the &apos; Fer@@ gus@@ oni police killed just my un@@ armed son &apos; .
he watched in real time a stream in which the police officer stood up to the protest group with a group of gra@@ ves .
in another video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Mr Fer@@ rell will remember how he struck himself from the nonsense : &apos; it is unusual &apos; .
&quot; this is not a murder of this kind , which we are ac@@ custo@@ med to and which we could describe as typical . &quot;
I felt frigh@@ tened at this point .
I was ang@@ ry and I had to say . &apos;
he boo@@ ked a return flight and travelled home on the next day .
having bu@@ ried at 23 : he went to his father for his six @-@ year da@@ u@@ ghter and decided that they will travel to Fer@@ gus@@ oni next morning .
what the Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ ga took place over the next three years is a central issue in the new docu@@ mentary &quot; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &quot; ( &quot; whose thanks ? &quot; ) , which will be presented in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who have than@@ ked the answers .
if Mr Ferreira , together with the da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a li@@ ps@@ y stic@@ ker and a ch@@ ro@@ ck in this way - has travelled to Fer@@ gus@@ on , they once again talked about a subject that had come before them several times before this morning - the experience and living conditions of black people .
&quot; remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &quot;
&quot; we are now travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ oni because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on board , &quot; said Ferreira later .
&quot; what is happening now is the cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it must know this and see it and grow in the middle of it .
he must learn about a activists and organisation and , at the same time , feel the different la@@ yers of experience and living conditions of the Muslim people , and what we need to do to be free and free .
even if I manage to raise him in such a way that he does not personally copy the brutal racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel I would be doing him a dis@@ service if I would protect him from this world . &quot;
the first stop they did in the vic@@ inity of the Fer@@ gus@@ oni was by South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ ti - a police station in the middle of a certain kind of camp , where activists were waiting for news about the police officer Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who did not end up being charged .
there , Mr Ferreira and his da@@ u@@ ghter joined the local business owner who prepared lunch .
they put together food homes and helped to divide them to the prote@@ sters .
for the Fer@@ rell , a new type of activist was slow to take shape .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ ad University , he was the President of the Union for Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organising .
all of this is simply ab@@ hor@@ rent . &quot;
weeks later , Ferreira met a film director , Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ i , at the time of the festi@@ val .
Fo@@ lay@@ an said that he and the film operator , Mr Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , simply wanted to document what is happening .
in the face of Fer@@ rell , the question was : &apos; are you trying to record what is happening or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to reap the benefits of this generosity and resilience .
Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Fo@@ lay@@ an had already put his hands on a co @-@ director D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ ati , the artificial father of the region , who was well @-@ known for prisoners who have been sentenced to death by activists .
his involvement made the project attractive for Fer@@ rel@@ li and the other six local groups , who were watched by the film &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; for years after the shooting of Bro@@ w@@ ni .
&quot; in this docu@@ mentary , nobody is talking about us or with us , but we are speaking to ourselves , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; it was important for me how these people are portra@@ yed , because I am also portra@@ yed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rel@@ li - it was wanted to show that the movement is not a &apos; donor leader &apos; , but a community &apos; , as outlined by Fo@@ lay@@ an - it was the most open participan@@ t in the film .
as a result , &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ets ? &apos; , surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of the life of Fer@@ rel@@ li , such as ru@@ th@@ lessness and marriage with their wife .
&quot; I felt as if I were to be , &quot; said Ferreira , the first time that she was ready to see the city .
&quot; however , I realised that the human vulnerability of this work and the people of black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the story of Fer@@ rell emphasises and re@@ focuses the role of the black L@@ GB@@ T woman in the wider Black Sea Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three initi@@ ators of the movement , who thought in the social media about the killing of black teen@@ ag@@ ers Tra@@ y@@ von Mar@@ tini in the social media in 2012 , are homo@@ sexual .
&quot; the leading role of homo@@ sexual women has kept the movement in general , &quot; said Ferreira , and this is precisely because we have to fight on a number of fronts .
Mus@@ tan@@ a@@ bad homosexu@@ als must bear all the burden . &quot;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed , stating that &apos; movement really keeps alive black women and many of them black homosexu@@ als &apos; .
he says , however , that &apos; this is not a matter of creating a level playing field &apos; - Fer@@ rel@@ li was not chosen as a film centre for his identity .
&quot; he was a man who evening the right energy , &quot; he said .
&quot; however , it is not a coincidence that it was directly located on the front@@ line , as black L@@ GB@@ T women are at stake when living in such hu@@ bs .
his energy can be perceived as a screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news camer@@ as Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ ist has long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the conditional sentence imposed on Fer@@ rell during the demonstration for blocking the road las@@ ts for another 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region he calls home , simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
nonetheless , it still attaches importance to the man@@ tra which it has been eating memory since the time when she went to the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ on for three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose apart from our chains . &quot;
7 ni@@ ps on how to overcome the We@@ ek@@ ise du po@@ tu@@ el
some of the most frequent me@@ ters are found , after a little bit of time , that they are suffering from , and also help .
or in the light of the words &apos; Be@@ yond po@@ t &apos; , the cra@@ dle of the Naz@@ is .
however , this is only an inevitable postponement and a decent ble@@ s@@ sing for health .
what can you do to ensure that , after today and tomorrow , Mrs We@@ ek@@ ise &apos;s trend - or other pi@@ pes - to be better felt this morning and to overcome po@@ pp@@ y as pain@@ fully as possible ?
Jo@@ o water .
to alcohol , after a great deal of pi@@ pe in the morning ... or , if possible , even rather than alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when using alcohol , it must somehow be recovered .
with water , miner@@ als are also being thrown out of the body , and se@@ sta@@ p is a good ha@@ ir of mineral water .
since the swe@@ eten@@ er has often been irri@@ tated , it is particularly good if it is soil @-@ free or easy to legislate .
let us walk .
it would certainly not be a cost to go to the grand@@ mother to bur@@ y trees - it may prove fatal for the wrong decision .
however , a simple foot@@ wear will help to remind the body once again what the feeling is in life .
T@@ el@@ gis and s@@ lee@@ ping boys are a more time @-@ consuming way of getting healthier .
give poor energy back slowly and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are on the ver@@ ge of over@@ drinking yesterday , it will certainly not be worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
for example , a fresh pi@@ pe in which the lion &apos;s share of the trees can be qui@@ et@@ ly placed on the market as a body .
if the health of the South is already suffering , it would be possible to try , for example , w@@ ed@@ dings .
and a little later .
a coff@@ ee .
this di@@ ame@@ tri@@ c ta@@ g will be released as a body from the last water .
as has already been said , water and volumes are your friends .
there is a commitment to pain@@ kil@@ lers .
if you were to be pain@@ kil@@ ler in order to prevent po@@ t on this evening , you must not only deal with alcohol , but also par@@ at@@ se@@ als or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ um and lose so much .
so ri@@ ders are paying even more and , in the future , boys will be worse .
in addition , pain@@ kil@@ lers do not remain in the coff@@ ers for a long time .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler this morning , you will do it with a blan@@ k che@@ que - it irri@@ ta@@ tes your already di@@ r@@ ty ma@@ ils .
or if a partner is not to be taken , it will be well with itself .
it is just like wal@@ king , but wal@@ king does not get a org@@ ary .
however , too active a pace and an outrageous bet were avoided - the physical effort should be moderate .
a jo@@ ke .
the story of the friends of the friends of the time , the easy to@@ pes of the road and the na@@ era of the Naz@@ is , both for themselves and for others ( suffering ) .
N@@ ali and laugh@@ ter may not make a po@@ t , but it is certainly easier to tolerate them .
once again , the po@@ et will go over anyway !
University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and Ox@@ ford University workers are being sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , the university profes@@ sors of North@@ w@@ ester and the University of Ox@@ ford , who have received suspects after death row w@@ ounds , are being sought as a result of a single university of Ch@@ ic@@ ago .
according to the C@@ oo@@ k Coun@@ ty T@@ ren@@ ton H. Cor@@ nel@@ l , a 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i were issued on Monday for arrest , accused of death in the first instance of their alleged association due to the death of T@@ ren@@ ton H. James Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u .
according to the documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u died after repeated se@@ als .
the warning that the Ch@@ ic@@ ago police station issued to the community was found on 27 July as a dead body .
police officers received telephone calls and found the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house in arrival for a victim whose body had several tor@@ ture@@ rs .
according to the officials , the Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u event was recognised dead and investi@@ g@@ ators in the murder , while the police are actively seeking two suspects .
I have been working as a co @-@ profes@@ sor of micro @-@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at the University of North@@ w@@ ester since 2007 .
in a statement sent as e @-@ publishing , Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations , said that La@@ ke has now been temporarily removed from work and has been banned from entering the city of the University of North@@ w@@ ester .
&quot; this is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of North@@ w@@ ester will work with the investi@@ g@@ ators , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ arre@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant at the University of Ox@@ ford .
the representative of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist US research authorities in every possible way &apos; .
in addition , the statement stated that the War@@ ren@@ i colleagues were shocked and wish him to present himself .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , President of the C@@ ic@@ ago Police Department , urges the authorities to give themselves to the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea of where they are present , but we are increasingly engaged in defining the exact location , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , suspects are helped by local , regional and national authorities .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police received a telephone call from the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house , who had just received cru@@ el@@ ty rain , that there has been something happening at Cor@@ vel No 10@@ 08 .
according to the police descri@@ ptions , it was a ma@@ gic specta@@ cle .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , it is not clear whether the event was also taking place on 27 July .
he said that the security camer@@ as confirm the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ mil and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the Grand Pla@@ za leadership sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police is currently working to find a background to events and the background of the victim &apos;s background , and will examine the various mo@@ tives , including the possibility that this was a family dispute . &apos;
companies that help your businesses to avoid receiving the next U@@ b@@ B
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were lu@@ cra@@ tive .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is headed by Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , a company selling e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees in San Franc@@ is@@ co@@ s .
he therefore called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups with new types of human resources , which will help businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licen@@ sing software that aims to measure the involvement of workers , they enable companies to carry out f@@ lash surveys , to target firm teams and demographic groups , to offer anon@@ y@@ mity and the submission of complaints to workers and , in some cases , to allow manufacturers to by@@ pass the leaders of the C level and to turn directly to the Bureau .
&quot; there are now tools such as Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ ers , which are designed to monitor health , but where is F@@ it@@ bi for your company ? &apos; asked Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O Reding City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ sts use companies to measure the inclusion of workers .
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , he has received three years in which he has used G@@ lin@@ ti , a much better overview of what he thinks and feeling .
in addition to surveys for intervention and specific teams , it offers a company &apos;s heat card , which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , enabling them to identify the causes .
companies have started to understand that they have to stay in touch with their culture of work , so as not to become the next U@@ b@@ bar , which has been insur@@ moun@@ ted in scandals since the former worker published a blo@@ g , which described the har@@ as@@ sing environment for those who da@@ red to speak .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , the desire to have an overview is a business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and conformity area can be worth more than $ 118@@ .@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the website of financial ethics statistics .
the Den@@ ver@@ is Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o start @-@ ups , which will help businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , noted this year in the light of the dubious reputation of U@@ b@@ ber , an interest and an increase in activity .
the coalition has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
the U@@ ber has recently registered himself as a customer .
like G@@ lin@@ les , the label allows companies to send adapted impul@@ ses , to collect real @-@ time confidential answers and to look at the problematic areas of heat cards .
it also offers anon@@ ymous messages in a way that allows workers to report un@@ suitable behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has been an@@ cho@@ red by regulators , &quot; Chris Qu@@ in@@ lan , foun@@ der and CE@@ O Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act une@@ th@@ ically , the company may face serious consequences such as consumer boycot@@ ts , leaving workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by flu , restaur@@ ant , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of activity , has been used by more than a year in order to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and offer easy ways of communicating with the corpor@@ ation headquarters .
when a worker wanted to report the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email addressed by the corpor@@ ation headquarters , and I hope that it will be taken seriously .
it was often a deterrent and in@@ convenient process , Mr Vit@@ ran@@ o , a general advis@@ er , who said that there was no good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , now that the company is used cen@@ sus , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices , which did not lead to more rapid identification and treatment in other cities or states .
&quot; I have the opportunity to get closer to the hol@@ low experience of the workers &apos; 3@@ 60 degrees , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who is headed by Ru@@ by &apos;s &quot; Risk Management Group . &quot;
&quot; and we will protect our shareholders from liti@@ gation with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and employee involvement more seriously in 2002 , after the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen collapsed due to ethical violations in the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; , companies realised that they cannot prevent their black was@@ h from being hi@@ jac@@ ked online .
&quot; before using the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and the Rhine offer their software as a service , taking advantage of companies &apos; perio@@ dic fees for the use of their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors who have been in favour of both start @-@ ups .
the FIF@@ A was funded in February 10 million dollars by companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and the Capital of Customs , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by 47 million dollars .
the G@@ lin@@ ti invested USD 10 million in November , B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , increasing the total funding of the company to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise if we take into account the interdependence between companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more research shows that today &apos;s workers are waiting for more jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are just on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy in the company , they feel that they are heard and that the work they do is satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , who has a general benefit and experience of staff , in both the cen@@ sor and the G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors earn revenue if companies belonging to their portfolio do well ; businesses do well when workers are committed and involved .
if the analy@@ sts of the third party allow us to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , we are not sure that they will be supported .
the possession of data on the involvement of workers is important , according to experts in the culture of work .
however , these data will be useless if the company &apos;s supervisory authorities do nothing to do with them .
in fact , if a company asks its employees for feedback , it can create expectations that changes are ahead of us .
and if the changes do not take place quickly or not at all , it could cause disappointment and decrease the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; said K@@ ot@@ ter International President R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who has seen how companies are making a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&quot; because if things are not brought to the end , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Mad@@ ison Re@@ e@@ val , which is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via G@@ lin@@ ti .
and , following the speed of decision making and the quality of the communication , it was possible to re@@ organise several teams in the company and to provide communication training to deal with the problems .
however , Ru@@ by @-@ by @-@ Procedu@@ res will collect new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will lead to the longer @-@ term commitment of workers in the industry , known as its large turnover of labour .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&quot; and if you lose your people , you will lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
euro area ben@@ ch sta@@ r is Bal@@ tics : incomes are growing rapidly
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , B@@ SE , referring to the report by the European Central Bank .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
there is a low debt burden , fast @-@ track institutions and business @-@ friendly and market @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , in one of Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where a reactor @-@ GDP @-@ per capita has been significantly approached by the EU average . &quot;
while the aim is to ensure that the overall output of the economy is equal to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2 / 3 of the average of 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led the bal@@ lo@@ ans to seek a better wage abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are going very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was slightly less than half of those questioned about their economies .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to lift two times a day &apos;s trends makes Bru@@ in@@ si &apos;s days long
at almost 23 o &apos;@@ clock , it is almost 23 that the football club of U@@ C@@ L@@ A stops talking at the edge of a new exercise in the city of a team .
some of them have been burdened by a company , reve@@ aling the efforts of the first day of their training camp .
for a large part of the team , these gang minutes offer mid@@ day pa@@ irs .
the players taking part in cu@@ cu@@ mbers will go back after three hours to the common sense of life , before returning to a meeting at 6.@@ 30 p.m. next morning , to the W@@ W@@ man football front .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Bru@@ in@@ si tre@@ er , Jim Mor@@ a , shortly before the Monday was Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel the burden of players on a two @-@ day basis , has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end of the day - to one side of the bar@@ gain on Friday .
for this reason , the three first operations of U@@ C@@ L@@ A were prompted to start at 19.@@ 15 , in order to fit into the already tight time@@ tables of players .
the transition from two to two strikes a day means more than one day - the beginning of the Bru@@ in@@ si training camp was increased almost a week ahead of the previous season and , for the first time in Mor@@ a &apos;s six W@@ es@@ tw@@ ood season , there are workshops during summer courses .
they are scheduled to have 18 tr@@ en@@ ching until 20 August , before starting formal preparations against the T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M , which will be launched in September .
according to Mor@@ a , he is in favour of a change in the N@@ CA@@ A rules , although it adds another item to the close schedu@@ les of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they break up with this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that if there is a Saturday and we have more time , it is really a little bit . &quot;
when the camp is closed , U@@ C@@ L@@ A will be closed down , which is not an easy task , given the clear view of the par@@ king record and by @-@ stand@@ by from the L@@ us@@ kin@@ i centre , a higher class hotel , which has already esca@@ ped the ga@@ te@@ way from the net of protection from the gates .
since this weekend , ho@@ tels are occupied by the Bru@@ in@@ si players , but Mor@@ a acknowledged that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&quot; we are implementing security measures , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real concern , and it is not exagg@@ erated to think that people can get a do@@ se and a fil@@ ter from there .
if you have a record of a train , you can do quite a good deal .
but we are using a security team there and 8 par@@ king stations .
we are doing our best to use it .
I will try not to be particularly concerned about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
in the case of Sa@@ du@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , who has been expelled from the Reform Party , Kris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ and and the ECB , Maria Kal@@ j@@ s , who has been forced to leave the forces of the central party , will be able to show the business union of business@@ men in Tallinn - it seems to be the same as the political parties that have been set up this year in the local elections as much as the political parties .
however , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether they are all too disappointed by voters .
who will remain in Sa@@ du@@ are@@ ga ?
if the support office of the Ed@@ gar Sa@@ du@@ are has been reduced to a small extent , he can anticipate the events organised by his electoral union .
one of the Member States , some former and present central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and is there any reason why some of the sea@@ we@@ ed fai@@ th@@ ful fai@@ ths and sis@@ ters are prevented from standing in Tallinn , and why is it that the list of &apos; Sa@@ du@@ are &apos; , which is the subject of corruption and corruption , is becoming a reality ?
the municipal@@ ity of the city &apos;s music camer@@ as to the Russian po@@ g , which takes part in the city of Las@@ na@@ mÃ¤@@ e , and in every sense the original computer play , in which the Prime Minister , J@@ Ã¼@@ ri Ra@@ tas , has to avoid l@@ om@@ ni@@ pe and or@@ ch@@ es@@ ts who are on the road to the ballot bo@@ xes for the first time , will the Central Party seek votes to be promised by the 16@@ th and 17@@ th year old voters ?
we look forward to seeing the views of the other parties on the youth election campaign .
if the Kan@@ al 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 look at the black r@@ ally , instead of the beginning of August , there will be two options : to accept that , in the future , only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn TV and English , Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels or to surrender each month to a few TV operators .
there are probably also those who , at the beginning , openly re@@ jo@@ ice in advertising @-@ free television , but in the end - albeit reluc@@ tantly - pay for television and advertise@@ ments .
the de@@ af@@ ening music , the black people and the rub@@ b@@ ish left on the streets are the un@@ pleasant side @-@ effects of almost every major mus@@ ical .
however , if you do not want to be part of the me@@ al , it is worth helping to move home rather than being pain@@ ted at home - and leave a s@@ lee@@ ping place for the hero@@ es of the festi@@ val .
Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
media publications are quoted by President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan envisages a reduction of the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by Re@@ publi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill goes to the two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , as it will change the way in which green maps are issued to citizens of other countries in the US .
the law reduces chain migration and will replace the current programme .
the new application process will provide an advantage for candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp America &apos;s media publications .
Si@@ b@@ erian young people move to the city , pensioners back to the land .
J@@ ev@@ se@@ ye@@ v A@@ na@@ tol continues the famous tradition of gold mine along the River Ma@@ ana .
she is working 140 kilometres away from home to Ma@@ ana , an additional nur@@ se in Ku@@ vai , as a motor driver .
this is a tough job : two months in a row without rest days , 12 hours of work and then only 10 days ago at home and again .
during the three years of the Ar@@ tel , A@@ na@@ tol@@ y has seen only one time .
&apos;@@ There is a res@@ ounding procedure : there is a thorough check of the way in which you go , so that it does not lead to a vi@@ ral , and when it comes to doing so &apos; , A@@ na@@ tol is speaking .
M@@ are Pi@@ ho &apos;s conver@@ sation in the village of H@@ ai@@ da with the local se@@ to Ja@@ ga , who has spoken a lot about the memory of his family in Si@@ beria .
the archa@@ ic culture of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ als is also beginning to influence the homes of the home , because it is simply so shocking , thinks the most far @-@ sighted mix@@ tures of Pi@@ ho M@@ are .
his first investigation trip to Si@@ beria will be 30 years since this year .
during that time , he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year .
how much was the case for Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8@@ 000 .
I have taken note of this in the words of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to men who have also thought about it .
it is very difficult to say , because at that time up to 30 people could come to one group , but the passport was only given to a man .
the passport was given only one thing , but it was children , sis@@ ters and so on .
look at how much this territory was here .
it was a number of times greater than that of the his@@ tori@@ an .
after all , it was necessary to educate , manage it in some way .
S@@ et@@ in@@ os came here as farmers , but their lives changed , because they came to areas that were not only involved in agriculture but also in rivers ( pal@@ gi@@ par@@ ation ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New Pet@@ ser@@ t , many pigs went to work later in K@@ ras@@ no@@ jar@@ sk @-@ 45 ( where the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P@@ . ) when it was formed .
did the do@@ ses form the majority of the population in the region at the time ?
yes , they lived in a com@@ pac@@ ket .
in addition , a long tradition continued to mar@@ ry between one another and a lot of childhood .
seven to eight children in the family were common .
how much is the culture of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ ins different and different from that of mother land ?
they are different , although what was said here was once the same .
they brought about a great deal of money .
they then made themselves ( the shadow ideas ) , but they always made a distinction between what had been done and what was done here .
climate change has been severely affected by the traditional ri@@ val@@ ry , because there is a cold cold here .

two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal ten@@ dering in Greece
Tele@@ can@@ al b@@ TV quoted a foreign minister who announced that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ dering .
in the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of people who illegally ordered a group on the island of Si@@ th@@ onia , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free ten@@ dering and are already imposing heavy fines on all those who are caught in a place where there is no provision for it .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
the w@@ ol@@ ves that teach the professionals are breaking down sheep .
the fin@@ ite farmers have had to give the w@@ ol@@ ves once again the car@@ pet &apos; educational material &apos; - the w@@ ol@@ ves that have taught the w@@ ol@@ ves , apparently , have already broken a number of sheep .
this year , the w@@ ol@@ ves in the Hi@@ i@@ u Coun@@ ty have broken sheep three times , with 23 sheep and w@@ ounded eight , the Hi@@ i@@ u page .
soil was the number only three years before 124 .
there are also data from the Environment Agency in syn@@ dro@@ me that the soil was not born in the Hi@@ tel and the Hi@@ iu@@ maa hunting Council &apos;s information that this year , two w@@ ol@@ ves were fixed on the island .
in the Ã@@ Ã¶@@ l on Monday , the w@@ ol@@ ves unle@@ as@@ hed 15 sheep in the village of Em@@ mes Kab@@ una and injured the 18 survi@@ v@@ ors .
in the early days of the morning , the w@@ ol@@ ves in the village of Re@@ he@@ mas have broken a sheep in the pas@@ ture of one sheep and w@@ ounded the other , who had to be made an emergency .
rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment ( GMOs ) and the amendment of the plant protection law .
the amendment to the law remo@@ ves the creation of a separate data collection for both GM ( GM ) crops and operators , using a plant health register in the future .
in addition , the GM crop management obligation will be amended to have prior agreement with the designated radio ap@@ para@@ tus .
although there is currently no cultivation of GM crops in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as there is no decision to declare Estonia GM @-@ free , &quot; said S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , President of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
&quot; however , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both private and public sectors , in the Annex .
the draft law repe@@ als the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of GM crops in the EU &apos;s GM crops and operators , establishes requirements for the management of GM crops and the requirements for starting economic activities .
specifically , with regard to the beekeeping sector , the current obligation to inform bee@@ keepers of the cultivation of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with bee@@ keepers before starting cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to minis@@ tries to coordinate .
all interested parties have the opportunity to access the draft information system and , if they wish , to present their views to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , those operating in the area of plant farming , bee@@ keepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10 .
so far , however , no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops .
the reason is that in Estonia , there is no ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h , a European media Observatory , on which mon 8@@ 10 is resistant .
it has also been extended to the southern regions , and it is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
in order to obtain certainty , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect potential contamination of GM organisms in Estonia in seeds , maize and soya vari@@ eties .
the analysis of the sam@@ ples carried out showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soya vari@@ eties in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms .
in turn , it can be concluded that in Estonia , GM crops are not deliberately culti@@ vated , and it was also confirmed that there has been no random contamination .

however , having been left behind in the White Year of Asia , Ma@@ tic@@ l was badly needed to bur@@ y and only 45 minutes , which , according to M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , must be corrected before the start of the Pre@@ mi@@ er League season .
&quot; he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , gen@@ i@@ ous thinking - he has the cour@@ tes@@ y of football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to achieve a form as soon as possible . &quot;

&quot; I am even hap@@ pi@@ er if they are able to deliver four four , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
another warm son received a sho@@ g on the GSM E@@ mb@@ assy on 1 August and this time in M@@ uh@@ us .
Mr Mar@@ tin@@ son , who is living in S@@ fragile , has received the first bat@@ son with the accompanying S@@ fragile , and this was@@ hing cell is already flying around , and has left the was@@ hing ground and joined the great night of the Mul@@ ti @-@ Grand Gulf .
this is because S@@ fragile does not have fruit crops , the voice of the islands is written .
this Tuesday , in order to bur@@ y the Kur@@ ds , is already relatively late , and yet another son of the E@@ mb@@ assy came to the island of M@@ uh@@ u .
according to Mar@@ tin@@ son , the installation of emb@@ assies is , in fact , an international project carried out by A@@ iva@@ r Lei@@ to and I@@ va@@ r O@@ j@@ ete .
So@@ il was supplied with a son called M@@ ati GSM to Turkey .
&quot; his activities are all on the internet : how he went to Spain in winter , coming back to the German and Polish border , and then Sa@@ are@@ maa came , Mar@@ tin@@ son spoke .
British inven@@ tors to in@@ sta@@ ll micro@@ chi@@ ps in their own body in order to get their hand in houses and cars .
the British inven@@ tor became the first person in a country to be installed micro@@ chi@@ p in order to be able to open up its preroga@@ tive , to get to office and even to launch a car .
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Ste@@ ven North@@ am children will be able to in@@ sta@@ ll a small chi@@ p between their fin@@ gers and their fin@@ gers , and will now provide this service to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier through their own company .

the technology is similar to the micro @-@ chi@@ p installed in ca@@ ts and bags , and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure .
the North@@ am company will also replace houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chi@@ p , asking for a lu@@ mp sum of GBP 300 .
this child &apos;s father has installed a technology both at home and in his car B@@ M@@ W Z@@ 4 , which will start when he has his hand in the whe@@ el .
the White House &apos;s audit cost to taxpayers of thousands
according to military documents announced in the magaz@@ ine , the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicop@@ ter last month to the southern American production event cost taxpayers as much as USD 24 000 .
the green and white col@@ ours S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , ter@@ med Marine One , during President par@@ don , was a central feature of the event that took place on 17 July in Val@@ dis Ma@@ in .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence and the White House were news of industrial products from all 50 countries in the world .
the helicop@@ ter built in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ tis was spon@@ sored by a ban@@ ner of reputation , a fire @-@ fighting car from W@@ is@@ con@@ ten and a Mis@@ cel@@ lu@@ ta@@ um .
according to the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) document , the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on , the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on , the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ is , called for the presence of a helicop@@ ter in a military c@@ abinet , or F@@ AR@@ G@@ O @-@ ga , a little 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter for the &apos; extraordinary &apos; event on the southern hor@@ ror .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 kom@@ com@@ and@@ Ã¶@@ r , day before the event , in the e @-@ mail , the chief officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
the message stated that helicop@@ ter arri@@ ves in the southern hor@@ ror on 17 July morning at 7 : 00 at 15 : 00 , and will remain there until the clock between 18 and 21 of the same evening .
the fact that , if the departure from the White House were to be present , a return flight is needed due to the restrictions on working time .
the original flight team was at the helicop@@ ter at the event and the es@@ c@@ ill@@ ary security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its entire time .
it was not possible to read out from the documents provided by the magaz@@ ine whether or not the second e@@ tho@@ s were eventually needed .
the H@@ at@@ ch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes .
the documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked whether this is a violation of H@@ at@@ ch law , and we were told that it would not ri@@ ce , &apos; the com@@ man@@ der wrote .
&apos;@@ It seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to a leading officer .
the White House declared the &apos; official event &apos; in America , and the H@@ at@@ ch law would not have covered it .
however , even official events have political under@@ ton@@ es .
the President supported the efforts of health reform at the time in the Senate and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in check .
the use of the aircraft known as &apos; Marine One or Air Force &apos; for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them purely photo@@ graph@@ s is unusual .
in February , the T@@ ru@@ mp came to the attention of his first campaign event in Flor@@ idas Mel@@ bour@@ ne , President of the President , and Twitter from the messages that complain about how his predecessor &apos;s flight was used by his predecessor .
&quot; the White Ma@@ l is very pleased with the exhibition &quot; made in America , where products were represented in all 50 states made up of American workers , &quot; said the White House &apos;s press spokes@@ man , L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often carry out tests around Washington and the southern hor@@ ror in order to exercise the US President &apos;s White House with a c@@ enti@@ me@@ tre .
when the T@@ ru@@ mp was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House held 58 sam@@ ples .
according to the official , the flight flight was considered to be the norm for the &apos; American &apos; flight crew of a month .
the Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r helicop@@ ter was flying for another 11 hours , in addition to that day , for &apos; non @-@ support missions &apos; with the President .
according to the White House , none of the other forms of this event were burdened by the taxpayer &apos;s w@@ alle@@ ts .
according to the representative of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , the company was not involved in carrying out fil@@ tering on the southern hor@@ ror of the helicop@@ ter .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 does not maintain the budgetary documents of the President &apos;s flights and the precise costs of the event are difficult to find out .
however , at the time of the defence Ministry for the financial year 2017 , the V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D compensation rate is set at USD 24 380 per hour .
in the Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r documents , the flight was extended to 30 minutes for the main base of the flight from Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o to Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a airport in both directions .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using helicop@@ ter is well below that amount .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates of compensation include staff , maintenance and many other irre@@ vo@@ cable costs , which will be taken into account in annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 winter study , the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation rates for staff costs , but they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
Se@@ an S@@ pic@@ er , former spokes@@ woman of the White House , defended the use of helicop@@ ter at the time .
&quot; the point is to show the things that have been made in America this week , &quot; said S@@ pic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that the State of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ ti is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds , if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the T@@ ru@@ mp was a helicop@@ ter in the southern hor@@ ror of the event , or not , but the fire @-@ fighting car was hiding behind the whe@@ el .
in the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky was approached by representatives of the media ou@@ tle@@ ts on the company &apos;s products in his personal aircraft fleet .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ skÃ¡ very well , &quot; said President , &apos; I have three products . &quot;
G@@ ari Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o - Ver@@ y arrived in peace and joy
the 2011 M@@ M@@ il D@@ ae@@ tis hit Å @@ ade@@ i@@ ko@@ t in the last area , 800 m be@@ ver@@ ages and a sta@@ di@@ um was taken away from the sta@@ di@@ um .
just before that , he had been able to go away from a glass of zero in China .
the Helsinki Helsinki formula in 2012 was a violation of cheap injuries , but in London , it received 60 13 points 23 .
however , I have continued to do so .
in the wake of the Moscow M@@ M@@ il 2013 opening day , Estonia received a fer@@ ry injury as a guide in a remote way .
two years later , he became the 15@@ th seat of M@@ il in Beijing and fulfilled the Olympic Games , but this was more than a disappointment to spor@@ ts@@ people .
S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o was only a bub@@ ble in the past , when the outcome of the Amsterdam E@@ mb@@ assy was not received at the beginning .
I would just like to put together one proper multi @-@ contest once .
once &apos; , spra@@ yed Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
worse still lies ahead : a month later , his Olympic contest in Ri@@ os re@@ i@@ ev@@ ig@@ as@@ tery was already covered by the first barrier .
time had to be taken down - did the seven @-@ year competition continue ?
is the two @-@ day effort still worth all this ?
Mrs N@@ ei@@ u won@@ dered at length , but found peace .
I had to think about it .
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time for us to treat ourselves all and to think about it .
&quot; I knew that I am still not putting a c@@ ool on the picture , &quot; Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o is talking about his self @-@ determination .
I was able to go ahead with a clean hand and a new momentum .
T@@ re@@ en@@ er Anne hill said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of neg@@ ligence , but he realised that , above all , the spor@@ ts@@ man himself has to get to the bottom .
after all , he was so repres@@ sed by all .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; the G@@ ard said , however , that he is not giving up and he wants to prove what he is worth &apos; , says remember .
now there is some kind of peace .
he is doing so to my joy .
the contest came back in May , when the Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o set a 6@@ 280 point in the new Estonian Re@@ ports in G@@ Ã¶t@@ z@@ itself .
in a high @-@ level competition , he improved his personal top @-@ class syn@@ thesis with almost a me@@ tre ( 13.@@ 89 ) and drinks a record @-@ close @-@ time barrier .
then there was a my@@ ri@@ ad feeling that it was not at all possible , but only a hunger in the first competition .
she has been instru@@ cted for years by Nag@@ or@@ no , that S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o is a Muslim student .
she is ready to be spor@@ ts@@ man , she is well trained .
if something is wrong or wrong , he says it immediately .
he feels his own body and he is confident in his sense .
that is what we must do .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we follow it .
the new approach has also been found in Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
&apos;@@ I am not the one who is going to make the most of the trend &apos; , he is talking and saying that the most important thing is to get the right sense , because it also guarantees a good result .
baby baby wal@@ ks will be happy to see !
the good emo@@ tion has also been offered by close to Å @@ ade@@ i@@ ko@@ u .
both his former teacher , Mar@@ is hill and Gre@@ te , has recently become grand@@ parents and has received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;@@ It has been quite interesting &apos; , says S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
one alcohol whose drinking is equivalent to &apos; training &apos; .
Li@@ ves@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is a father of so great wine games that he believes that wine can be trained better than any other thing in the world .
She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist at Y@@ ale University .
his message is not about alcohol or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
when it comes to the fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ness of wine , in the complexity of wine , in the enjo@@ y@@ ment and the sense of after@@ taste , we are putting our brain work in order to create a taste for wine .
in the words of the She@@ per@@ d , there is no real taste , but taste in the way in which wine is stimu@@ lated .
he will bring about a comparison between how the brain &apos; sees &apos; col@@ ours .
&quot; taste is not wine ; taste creates wine as a taste , &quot; says She@@ per@@ d .
things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , our age , gender and even sy@@ l@@ je , which man produces .
She@@ per@@ d , of course , is that wine is not in order to be full of Jews .
&apos;@@ There must be more &apos; , he says .
if you are too big a lon@@ gest , the system has been over@@ crow@@ ded .
excessive wine drinking may be detrimental to the brain , rather than the benefits of the 2004 survey , people who drink more than three glass wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced spiri@@ tual capacity .
10 % of staff in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less salaries from colleagues
the figures reveal that 10 % of Estonian ICT workers receive lower salaries from their colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , the portal Ge@@ eni@@ us wri@@ tes .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay study .
a total of 8 5@@ 77 posts were examined .
63 % of posts were male .
&quot; although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies considered that there is no pay gap , in reality , the average salary of men is 10 % higher than that of women per month and men per year is 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said Fon@@ crates analy@@ sts Il@@ mar North .

according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
on Wednesday , the head of the United Nations Mission for Afghanistan said that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , said that hundreds of women are standing in local Soviet elections , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women in stressing the importance of women cannot be exagg@@ erated , &quot; said in a statement on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have , for their part , threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with the transitional period , when the role of international military operations is becoming advis@@ able .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is given cal@@ mly to one democratically elected government to the next .
according to Mr Ha@@ ys@@ om , women &apos;s strong role will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the Afghan In@@ dependent Ele@@ ction Commission , 1.2 million women have registered from 3.@@ 6 million registered voters .

for the elderly , however , the whole body trend is truly effective .

B@@ oo@@ ked bags are the summer clas@@ s@@ room , which has become a pe@@ anu@@ ts in the last few years , which , even in one of the time , has to be han@@ ging at the top of the hand and has been able to display a price label in the shop , despite its modest origin .
there is probably one such thing that has existed once in the life of the law , which is one of the things that has not been aro@@ used at all times and has not been given much emo@@ tion .
that is simply there , and if there is no , there is nothing at all .
however , there is now a real victory for be@@ er bags , and mo@@ ef@@ ists have swit@@ ched their mus@@ h@@ rooms against the summer months instead of simple cop@@ ies .
it is not only a coast@@ line , but today it is just as popular as a street , and more courageous women are doing it even in the office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear whether this summer &apos;s summer is sitting , or whether it is worth postponing the stamp and the lap@@ top@@ s to a more formal summer .
however , the wealth of tolerance has made a real summer love for women .
for example , when we read foreign mo@@ tives , the first thing is that the mo@@ e@@ y@@ o@@ gh@@ ur@@ ts are going to be the first thing to do with holiday travel on the local market , and to acquire some be@@ er bags , which are then the tru@@ ck of entire holiday , and which are accompanied by rigour , on the market and also as a friend to the city .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are so generous that they are buying from the market a bigger w@@ ol@@ f and selling them to their loyal read@@ ers .
in doing so , it is worth pointing out that there is a demand for read@@ ers so that women in the real world ( and men ! ) are apparently involved in each other &apos;s fishing zone in order to become a happy owner of some homes .
in some ways , this mad@@ ness is also understandable , because it is rare for them to be repeated when , in the fashion of yesterday , it is possible to buy just a few of the ten euros in the hi@@ jac@@ ket .
it is true that white merchan@@ ts have also discovered a simple way of ear@@ ning money here , and so more luxury br@@ ands are sold for a few hundred and a thousand euros .
obviously , the richer customers should not feel easy to feel that they are pro@@ pel@@ ling around with some cheap bags .
for example , it is possible to buy D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a , for example , over EUR 1 000 .
however , for the interpretation of Chan@@ gel bre@@ g@@ ko@@ t , 6 000 euros can be found in the circulation .
in contrast to most of the mo@@ tives , however , l@@ ot@@ teries do not inh@@ eri@@ ted some of the great mos@@ ques , but their story origin@@ ated in a far more distant way .
in particular , the bre@@ w@@ ers are allegedly coming from the Philippines , far from where they have been subjected to a wide range .
the bun@@ dle of red bags is there , above all , the export trade , and there is very often no room for the local authorities to do with them .
Ad@@ mittedly , the 14@@ th century of the T@@ rus@@ hing technique has been born and is quite a whole series of normal cor@@ ps .
however , as the be@@ er does not have to be as hard red as cor@@ ps , they can be accompanied by mus@@ ici@@ ans and other materials that make their homes more person@@ alised and , by extension , more active .
in recent times , for example , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y bags where pa@@ ints or s@@ kin@@ s have been installed .
however , the full print can be sent to the be@@ er , in particular , to send an ac@@ tress , J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , the largest red be@@ er of whom was not seen before .
it was precisely that she su@@ ed the be@@ er with all sorts of clothing packages and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
however , the popul@@ arity of the applicants today does not play a smaller role , but also that caring for them is a hot head and , unlike all other summer produc@@ tions , they do not have to care for them with special funds , but also water and mar@@ ty@@ r .
as is still the case with the trend rob@@ ber@@ y , the br@@ ands of the classi@@ cal force have come out with all possible interpretations .
for example , if you want to have a red ri@@ ce , you can buy a red ri@@ ce or a little bit of a la@@ x .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classi@@ cal be@@ er is never going to be a mo@@ ck@@ ery , but a be@@ er .
but what is the classi@@ cal be@@ er , then ?
for centuries , there has been a classic ca@@ pping of red @-@ shir@@ ts , which rese@@ mb@@ les a repetition of its style , is open , and it is short , as well as be@@ er , cri@@ pp@@ ers .

G@@ M@@ B is worried about investment in the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e plant in G@@ las@@ go@@ w
the trade union expects the leaders of the mature producer and Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to confirm long @-@ term production plans in the G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment .
more than 500 people are employed in H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich knowledge of the mature and other products .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e , the owner of Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e , said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years .
the workers and the trade union chair@@ men who have been employed there are &apos; the first to hear &apos; when something changes in the operation of the plant .
in a letter sent to the company &apos;s site , G@@ M@@ B Scotland , Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e , called on the company of Scotland to &apos; alla@@ y concerns about the lack of funding for modernising production lines &apos; .
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the object on the customs / future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely made up of local communities and the people around G@@ las@@ go@@ w , as an essential pillar in ensuring decent employment in a region where high unemployment is high and social housing .
therefore , in the context of jobs , wages and welfare in the east of G@@ las@@ go@@ w , and Bre@@ x@@ ti , the rise in living costs and the chronic damage to production , a thri@@ ving production company in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e is badly needed . &quot;
the Pla@@ dis@@ e representative said : &apos; the head of the customs seat only received a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ ch yesterday and the company responds directly to him because we value active interaction with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers and the representatives of the G@@ M@@ B at the time , which discussed a number of issues openly .
we then discussed with workers that , like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we look at our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested over GBP 5 million in the object of Customs , most of which have gone to production routes and improvements .
we fully understand the heritage of customs as a production site , and if there should be any changes in the activities of the object , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago for convergence ?
la li can regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti
the Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main does not give up in the attempt to attract Ney@@ mar to his ranks by making an offer of GBP 18@@ 9 million , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record con@@ quest ?
this bold approach has opened summer as a transitional window and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of buying , which was set up during the last season by Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returning to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ ba for GBP 89 million .
if the transition is completed , Ney@@ ra will become the most expensive player in the world and , at the same time , the most paid professional spor@@ ts@@ man in the world , who will be able to pay over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from the PS@@ G .
Barcelona is also an indication of the way in which we approach it as well as of the liber@@ ation of Ney@@ ra , even though the source close to the C@@ tal@@ ans@@ i Board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of its arrival in San@@ to@@ ise in 2013 .
but did the PS@@ G President warn the football world for such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Bla@@ ise Ma@@ tu@@ tis Agreement in 2014 , the N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all clubs who think about recru@@ iting some of the PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that if they are concerned about some of our players , we will accept them and contact them , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have taken over this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the PS@@ G central player , Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they would not be allowed to leave and that Barcelona could be a set@@ back as a result of this interest , removing one of its precious assets in the form of Ney@@ ra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t .
&quot; Bre@@ x@@ it threatens to seriously blow the w@@ ool between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r during his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; he stressed .
according to the former , he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as this cannot be achieved , he will remain part of the European single market .
it would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
the second option to make Britain more flu@@ id would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said : &apos; we could certainly have such a British &apos; .
the alternative to this would be to return to customs points , which would be a historic division and a political failure .
&quot; bring about trade , prosperity and peace , &quot; said the Irish Prime Minister .
he called Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that the result could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met Bel@@ fast visiting the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland .
in its first half @-@ long tri@@ ath@@ on , Av@@ ja : I@@ ron@@ man will be able to go through everyone .
today , the biggest tri@@ ath@@ on in the capital of the winter , O@@ te@@ rescue , was held in Bali , when nearly a thousand tri@@ ath@@ le@@ tes took place in more than three out of ten countries .
7@@ 0.@@ 3 miles of design consis@@ ted of 1.9 km of flooding , 90 km of cy@@ cling and 2@@ 1.1 km of cy@@ cling .
among others , the first tri@@ ath@@ on of her life has also dropped a note of Av@@ an .
&quot; I thought it would be difficult and , finally , it was difficult to do so , &quot; saying Av@@ our fin@@ gers .
despite the complexity of Mrs Doyle , she said that it is actually a tri@@ ath@@ on that is affordable for all .
&quot; not dance kills , but the pace kills , &quot; he said , suggesting that , at a comfortable pace , almost everyone will reach the finishing line .
except for O@@ tt Se@@ pp : &apos; it is fine , but , unfortunately , it is not able to swi@@ m &apos; .
Mrs Doyle had already taken a keen lead since February .

although Av@@ ja lost both R@@ ai@@ o Pi@@ iro@@ t ( time 04 : 59 : 53 ) and J@@ Ã¼r@@ gen L@@ ig@@ ali ( time 05 : 06 : 37 ) , he won other &apos; prominent classes &apos; .
last year , Tan@@ z@@ el Pa@@ da@@ r lost A@@ van@@ le in seven minutes ( time 05 : 41 : 54 ) , journalist S@@ ten Te@@ pp@@ an 16 minutes ( time 05 : 50 : 23 ) , Kal@@ e@@ v K@@ r@@ new and Ra@@ iv@@ o E. Tam@@ m ( times according to 06 : 31 : 53 and 06 : 45 : 18 ) .
I@@ ron@@ man &apos;s general winners of the ranking of O@@ te@@ pÃ¤@@ Ã¤ , a German , Johannes Mol@@ dan , were chron@@ ised with 3 : 58 : 27 : 27 , Est@@ oni@@ ans were the best I@@ vo initiative in 04 : 14 : 09 .
among women , the Danish Hel@@ le Fre@@ der@@ ik@@ sen won 04 : 24 : 01 , Est@@ oni@@ ans , Maria J@@ Ã¤n@@ ese , who lost nearly half a hour to Fre@@ der@@ ik@@ sen and obtained 04 : 58 : 58 .
