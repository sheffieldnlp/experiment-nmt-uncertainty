four members of Cape Verde in Estonia and Spain
according to Mr Posselt , the police in Spain considered the leader of the so @-@ called K@@ Cape ro@@ vo group of Gu@@ ade@@ ro@@ vo group , who is known as S@@ r@@ ro@@ v@@ ski , who is known in the criminal world .
in Spain , Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch was arrested by the Court of Justice .
yesterday , the Court also took three of the suspects detained in Estonia .
according to the suspicion , the so @-@ called K@@ Cape ro@@ vo criminal Community members of the 27 @-@ 57 lives of the 27 @-@ 57 lives who are mainly committed to drug crimes .
in Spain , Mi@@ FID was detained in the province of the criminal Community .
in Estonia , three men were detained in Estonia , one of them has been collected according to the criminal community , and two are members of criminal Community members .
the data collected indicate that the criminal community was clearly divided and roles in the criminal community .
the purpose of the actual Community activity was to commit crimes against drug crimes , and thus serve a criminal offence , as the head of the pre @-@ trial procedure , the Head of State Prosecutor , Ver@@ te Ver@@ te .
&quot; we do not exclude that the circle of suspected of criminal matters is increasing in the annex to the Prosecutor .
this is the people who are also in the past , and some of them have borne the penalty for crimes against drug crimes .
Mrs Ver@@ te stressed that there has been a significant number of cooperation with Spanish colleagues throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become a normal way for us , and the operation of the week &apos;s week shows the success of cooperation &apos; , commented on the Prosecutor Ver@@ te .
the leader of the Environment Police Office , Le@@ Le@@ in , said that the detention was preceded by a half @-@ year preliminary examination of the detention .
&quot; a long @-@ term work in the first half of this week and , at the same time , held in Estonia and Spain for crimes suspected of crimes . &quot; said he said .
in the event , officials in the Centre for criminal police officers were helpful in detention in Spain .
for years , we have a good contact and understanding between the Spanish police and the civil card .
these arrests are yet another message to criminals that we will also be able to take the hands of the rest of Europe . &quot; said Le@@ at .
the information that has been collected so far indicates that there can be a suspicion of men in the non @-@ free stay in the case of the new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s Office has requested the prosecution of the prosecution and the Court also approved it .
the men arrested in Spain are waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
in the context of this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash will be seized in order to ensure the confiscation of the confiscation .
the criminal proceedings procedure will lead to a regular prosecution of the criminal police in the centre of organised crime , and is headed by the state Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the city of Tallinn in the city of Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch in 2005 was sentenced to blackmail and punished him for five years of imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gu@@ le@@ v@@ v , Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v , was held in Nico@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v , in the context of the Estonian criminal world .
K@@ Cape ro@@ vo@@ o from Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch rose in the beginning of the Republic of Estonia in the beginning of the 1990s , when he started to address blackmail in Tallinn .
Ad@@ mittedly , he has been acting in the various ho@@ tels , and the prostitution of men and women demanded a monthly tax on business .
international joint operations , criminal proceeds confis@@ cated and the decisions taken into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the last court decisions , the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ a@@ ye@@ i criminal practice of the eight accused persons who have been confis@@ cated in the form of 80 000 of the proceeds of criminal proceeds , or the judgment on nine persons in that , in Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v , created in 2006 in the criminal community , which was aimed at illegal trade in cigarettes , which was aimed at illegal trade in secret cigarettes and to commit crimes related to human trafficking in East Vir@@ u@@ land and South Estonia .
there are almost EUR 71 500 of the proceeds of criminal proceeds .
in these criminal matters , it has ensured that poli@@ ce@@ men exchanges with foreign colleagues on the daily basis of information and prosecutors , and if necessary , together with operations in any EU country .
civil Citizens &apos; Group war@@ ns a Mis@@ tral travel .
the organisation National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ tes of C@@ olo@@ ves People &apos;s ( NA@@ MA ) has warned the country &apos;s discriminatory policy and racist attacks on the State of the State .
in the declaration of the resolution , the &apos; Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i State of State issued in the NA@@ P , which applies until 28 August 2017 , calls on all the passengers of the African Americans , visitors and their sou@@ ri@@ ans , to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious in the state of the whole country , given the whole range of suspi@@ cious racial events that have taken place at the last time and here , and here &apos;
in the case of NA@@ Ps , the group urged the group to issue a warning to a &quot; Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law &apos; , which makes discrimination against cases of discrimination , as well as the fact that the state of the State of State cor@@ ners &apos; targets are unequal in terms of the same minorities .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
they will be drawn up because of their colour colour , they are beaten or killed , &apos; said NA@@ Ps &apos; , the President of R@@ od Cha@@ pel , the President of The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r , the K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&quot; we have never received complaints so closely . &quot;
this is the first warning that the US state has issued on the state of the US .
Mrs RÃ¼hle referred to these events as racist insul@@ ts in the vic@@ inity of the mar@@ ches of the tanks , and the death of 28 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old @-@ year @-@ old S@@ and@@ er@@ si of S@@ and@@ er@@ si .
in the light of this year , Mr S@@ and@@ ers died in all dubious circumstances , when he had a war on petrol and a Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police carried out in the state of arrest , without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the comment indicates the recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of the Solidarity Fund , which shows that in the State of the state , the cars of drivers are being stopped by 75 % more likely to be the case of white @-@ fa@@ res .
&apos;@@ The point is to say that people are aware and warn of their families , friends and working partners for what might happen , &apos; said Cha@@ vez .
&quot; people are ready to be ready , it will be the case for the inclusion of the money , or to inform relatives that they are carrying out in the state . &quot;
on the basis of the latest data from F@@ B@@ I hate crime , a fund was documented in 2015 , which puts the country with similar violations in the state of cross @-@ border 16 of the state .
the warning is also in response to the new law of the Solidarity Fund , which makes it difficult to prosecute housing or work on the basis of discrimination against the company &apos;s court .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( AC@@ L@@ U ) ( AC@@ L@@ U ) was issued earlier in the case of T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona on how these countries were adopted by the immigration laws , which oblige the local authorities to arrest the people of immigration , because the AC@@ L@@ U says that it increases racial profiling .
normally , the warnings on the foreign Ministry of the other countries , however , have started to make use of this measure as a response to the laws and trends in the United States .
Mr pati@@ tis : what could everyone learn from different forms of illness ?
Mr pati@@ tis , it may have been caused by five different - A , B , C , D and E he@@ pati@@ tis virus .
all these types of virus call on the he@@ ight of the bur@@ n .
however , the worst cost is chronic B and C he@@ pati@@ tis , which can be developed in a cir@@ cus , or pay for cancer , and pay for cancer .
the Health Agency &apos;s epidemi@@ ology advis@@ er , Mr Ku@@ usa@@ r , is telling us that the phenomenon of he@@ pati@@ tis disease is the same for all the species of inc@@ iner@@ ation , the same - a fa@@ ti@@ gue , ti@@ gue , a s@@ ounding , a s@@ ble@@ matic , o@@ me@@ tre , be@@ at@@ ty , be@@ at@@ ty , be@@ at@@ ting , me@@ chan@@ ts , c@@ oo@@ k and co@@ in@@ objects , and na@@ il and li@@ m@@ es@@ ts .
the last point of disease also comes from the pa@@ tho@@ lation of the ro@@ ck of the ro@@ ck .
children can live in he@@ pati@@ tis .
the various species of inc@@ in@@ eration can be identified only on the basis of the data on laboratory research .
let me talk about he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , and for decades , for decades without disease , which means that the person may not know anything about the harmful disease that is harmful .
Mr Ku@@ usa@@ r will find out different forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their way forward .
an he@@ pati@@ tis virus spread from hospital and infec@@ tious food for food eating or drinking water , on the roads , on the shel@@ ves of people , and to those on foods , soil , objects , contact , and drug consumption .
a very he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , family members and carers , who are suffering from chronic pay , are suffering from gro@@ tes@@ y people , men who are sex sex men , men , drug trafficking , the high spread of he@@ pati@@ tis .
it can be prevented by vacc@@ inations , particularly for people who are to be vacc@@ inated , and the people of he@@ pati@@ tis &apos;@@ he@@ pati@@ tis &apos;@@ he@@ pati@@ tis &apos; Group .
in addition , it is important to comply with the right to hygiene requirements : was@@ hing or dis@@ infec@@ tants , before the consumption of the consumption of the fruit and vegetables , all of the fruit and vegetables .
he@@ pati@@ tis anti@@ vir@@ als are spreading to the blood of man &apos;s blood , drug @-@ style , par@@ enth@@ ood , au@@ g@@ h@@ ance , blood @-@ contaminated pollution ( too@@ th@@ th@@ nic , pregnant means ) , the use of donors with blood , he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , child sex and he@@ pati@@ tis / w@@ ig@@ born .
in he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , the sex partners of human beings , the sex of people , men who are sex sex men , the mother @-@ born people who live , sick family members and carers , ver@@ b and other bodies are exposed to health , rescue workers and police officers and B @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis countries visiting passengers .
he@@ pati@@ tis prevention is possible to vacc@@ in@@ ate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vacc@@ in@@ ate people in the north @-@ based group and , in addition , chronic pay @-@ related diseases , HIV @-@ infection , relatives and diabe@@ tes , and diabe@@ tes .
he@@ pati@@ tis &apos;s other preventive measures are : avoiding the hygiene of stran@@ gers , hygiene and man@@ ure , other acute resources , and the use of sy@@ stal@@ les @-@ advice , he@@ pati@@ tis and g@@ oo@@ king , and the use of con@@ do@@ oms , and the avoidance of sexual risk risks , or avoiding risk of sexual risk .
in the case of he@@ pati@@ tis vaccination , vaccination is a part of the national immun@@ isation scheme and for children free of charge .
C @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis &apos;s virus spread to the blood of man &apos;s blood , drug @-@ min@@ ding , par@@ enth@@ ood , au@@ g@@ h@@ ance , blood @-@ contaminated pollution , the use of donors with blood , he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , sex sex and he@@ pati@@ tis / U@@ ig@@ born .
C @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis &apos;s HIV @-@ based group , the sex partners of human beings , the sex of man who are sex sex men , the mother @-@ born people who live , sick family members and carers , blood and other bodies are exposed to health , rescue workers and police officers , HIV @-@ infection persons and C @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis countries visiting travellers .
C @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis preventive measures are : avoiding the hygiene and man@@ age@@ able tools , other acute resources , and the use of sy@@ stal@@ les @-@ advice , as well as the use of h@@ our@@ ning and au@@ ctions , and the use of con@@ do@@ oms in the event of dangerous mix@@ tures of infection .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
d &apos;@@ he@@ pati@@ tis &apos;s vi@@ si@@ tis virus , which is a lot of B @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis &apos;s presence in the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
in this regard , the D he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis B or super @-@ le@@ af@@ aran@@ ces , in conjunction with B , are experiencing a chronic B of he@@ pati@@ tis or super@@ ch@@ Ã©s .
d &apos;@@ he@@ pati@@ tis &apos;s virus spread by exposure to blood and other body liquids , with contaminated coal @-@ advice , sexu@@ ally and rarely infected animals .
there are chronic B @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ ers and the anti @-@ fraud of he@@ pati@@ tis B@@ he@@ pati@@ tis &apos;s anti @-@ proliferation virus .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis &apos;s vaccines , which will protect people from the infection of he@@ pati@@ tis virus .
In@@ he@@ pati@@ tis &apos;s virus spread on e@@ he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ on @-@ water drinking and food , including low @-@ processed animal meat , fish and sea pota@@ to , fish and se@@ af@@ ood animals , with blood , joint life py@@ stal@@ ts and infected animals .
passengers may be infected with the high incidence of he@@ pati@@ tis in the countries .
the prevention of he@@ pati@@ tis preventive measures is to comply with hygiene requirements : was@@ hing or dis@@ infec@@ tants , or dis@@ infec@@ tants , before the existence of the food and feed , after the care of the hospital .
the fruit and vegetables of fruit and vegetables before consumption , avoid low @-@ treated animal meat , fish and marine an@@ af@@ ood , only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption .

the F@@ ara@@ h did not thought long , after the re@@ fin@@ ing of the fin@@ alists , the hus@@ band T@@ ania and children .
that was a special moment for me .
I am very much in favour of my family .
they were a wonderful word , said F@@ ara@@ h on journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h is targeted at the fifth title in London , and 5 000 metres of a gol@@ den du@@ p of 10 000 metres .
all of it is possible if there are things .

however , more closely in the history .
on the basis of the car@@ ry@@ ity , the car@@ pet , which is s@@ tun@@ ned in short @-@ night , a more narrow issue would have been allowed in the title of the extraordinary hope of being able to have a more impact on this .
at the moment , there would be two book @-@ xes : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti and his wife &apos; Da@@ am gold gold &apos; , and a much more ambitious and more comprehensive history @-@ based family and the German occupation , along with its follow @-@ up in Austria .
the first one third of the book is in the middle of a f@@ at@@ ty in Vienna on cultural life and who , in the Austrian capital , could not imagine the way in which a hundred years ago , or how the Cen@@ tr@@ ali coff@@ ee , who took all the heads of his head when it was introduced .
the concentration of cultural players was a high @-@ rich city in one of Europe &apos;s rich@@ ness in the city and in the White Paper , with a view to some of the ti@@ tles of the &apos; cultural &apos; more than one gram .
however , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a city where un@@ bri@@ dled punish@@ es and the highest levels of self @-@ suicide were the European highest level of suicide , the development as if nothing does .
or perhaps , however , every couple of couples , too , are adding a col@@ ours to the cultural life of the 20th century in Vienna .
dream of travel to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century , there was an explosion in the number of Jews in Vienna , by changing the largest community in Western Europe .
the S@@ aj@@ an@@ di@@ cal exchange had had to be in 10 in the last half of the Jewish .
in Vienna , parents were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but for the time , when the aid aid for A@@ s is twice opened up to the Czech sugar mil@@ na@@ te , Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch@@ every and the m@@ oo@@ t , he was his father , the bank has already received the first seventh bank bank H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg E@@ mp@@ ers emp@@ ire .
however , the A@@ de@@ let &apos;s entire sense of life , which he was famous , has failed .
if you look at the &apos; Da@@ o &apos; gold las &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the life of the end of the life of the infection is a more powerful pro @-@ socialist and dream of travel to the Soviet Union .
in 19@@ 0@@ 3 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided his hus@@ band from his hus@@ band from the Kli@@ m@@ ti@@ g , the last moment was the last minute to be a half @-@ year @-@ of @-@ house panel in Vienna .
the climate was paid at the time of 4 000 kro@@ on , a quarter of a quarter of the land@@ house of the land .
that is that there was a mo@@ del@@ l of the mo@@ del@@ l of a cre@@ ker in a number of cre@@ ws , the car@@ rot of sugar was not discoura@@ ged .
as far as the dele@@ tion is concerned , the only thing is that the relationship between the mo@@ del@@ li and the ar@@ tist &apos;s close relationship continued to the end of life .

immediately before the start of the work A@@ dele@@ h , the Kli@@ m@@ m has come to the San V@@ ita@@ ga Ra@@ ven@@ ta , and the investi@@ g@@ ators think that it is precisely where the bri@@ lli@@ ant mo@@ sa@@ rs of the g@@ rin@@ ge g@@ rin@@ p in The@@ o@@ dor@@ ant gave an artificial idea to make a gol@@ den piece of Do@@ mes@@ te col@@ ours .

how is Hitler involved ?
&apos;@@ I think that , in my friend &apos;s Kli@@ m@@ man , I am indeb@@ ted to him in order to make his work publicly available to the public , signed the A@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer couple a few years after the departure of the artists ( the director of the Kli@@ m@@ m died in February 19@@ 18 ) and wanted to ask for their family to be a colle@@ c@@ torate of mus@@ eu@@ es .
six years before death was a spa@@ m@@ at A@@ dele@@ t .
in my view , in February 19@@ 25 , he asked him that his hus@@ band would leave her two reports and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti @-@ landsca@@ pes in the Austrian Gal@@ special case .
in his own , Mrs Mari@@ ana and Lu@@ an , he had his own eyes .
after this year , when a spa@@ m was completed by the Austrian Mon@@ a lisa &apos; , it has tried to access the A@@ ca@@ de@@ issu@@ er A@@ ca@@ de@@ issu@@ la in Vienna , and it was a failure in the case of a year when it was carried out .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s late anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is considered to be the reason for the Jewish profes@@ sors to be opposed to the de@@ priva@@ tion of the de@@ priva@@ tion , no one would actually be in July .
in any case , the Austrian Gal@@ special task was referred to in the case of the Austrian Gal@@ special special task of 19@@ 39 , which has become a significant change in the presence of the Vienna of the rich Jewish arts , which has been the very rich in the University of Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal art of artistic life was also a few of the A@@ s at home , but not a cli@@ mb .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the arts of the Naz@@ is , the ten @-@ year @-@ old liti@@ gation between the Austrian Government and the B@@ lo@@ ch Bau@@ tas@@ tes was beginning .
at this point , it is only mentioned that , when &apos; S@@ Innova@@ tive &apos; is in Vienna Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere , the &apos; Da@@ o B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ er &apos; , the &apos; Da@@ am gold let &apos; need to be a look at the New York Ne@@ ue Gal@@ special .
and before you read in Vienna , the White Paper has also been carried out .
even if you were to look at the m@@ oo@@ s work , because at least my emo@@ tions , after the closure of the book , were more na@@ ked than the end of the book , and the cra@@ dle of 135 million dollars , and the mo@@ ll A@@ s B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Edit re@@ on .
so , not so much of the kind of office , if rather a sexu@@ ality , is the living of a sexu@@ ally , and a very move .
in the event , it facilitated the orientation of the Bau@@ tas@@ tes in the early words of the Bau@@ tas@@ tes .
17 @-@ year @-@ old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonia
in the event of life , it was a very close to a private record of 200 se@@ thi@@ li@@ ms in a very close to 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 .
the Spring mark dates from 17 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ olds when Canada &apos;s football champi@@ on@@ ships became 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 , the Pri@@ r A@@ av@@ an @-@ A@@ P@@ P block .

as A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or@@ n , Estonia &apos;s re@@ cor@@ ing of Estonia ( 2.@@ 15@@ ,@@ 13 ) remained a little over half a second .
in the age of Estonia , Estonia has grown and its fresh personal top @-@ mark is the result of the five @-@ time result of Estonia .
young people in the future will be more ambitious in the diplomatic competitions of adults in Canada , 200 m and 400 m in bal@@ ls and 200 m@@ ths and 400 w@@ ins .

the Gol@@ f @-@ time period is only a distance from Estonia &apos;s record in Estonia , only as a year &apos;s record .
in Canada , there has still been a strong advocate of an un@@ stop@@ p@@ able attack on 100 cents for a great personal record , with a new year of 5@@ 6.@@ 66 in the top @-@ year of Estonia .

President T@@ ru@@ m will go on holiday , critics of a too@@ th@@ m
the time has come from the time - that is to say to the President of the United States , Donald T@@ ru@@ y .
however , as the T@@ ru@@ m has so far been one of the last few days , the critical critics have already been taken by the President .
the US @-@ US and CN@@ N reports have been in 17 @-@ day leave for the President of the President of the EU @-@ 17 @-@ day holiday in the B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , which is located in New Jer@@ se@@ ys .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s opponents have already taken the floor for weeks .
they are putting it too frequent on the Olympic order .
it is a President @-@ in @-@ Office for a week of his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey &apos;s cotton .
incidentally , Mr T@@ ru@@ m is not the most pu@@ zz@@ led President of his 19@@ 6 office .
for example , George W@@ . Bush came on holiday in this time to be 67 days , Barack Obama , but less than T@@ ru@@ m , but 21 days .
however , there is a tendency to keep things quickly .
a few days after President , he said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , so that the lon@@ gest holiday in his wife , he will not be able to do so , because there is a lot of need to do .
he also expressed three years ago on the leave of Barack Obama &apos;s leave .
the current President wrote on Twitter : &apos; at a time when Obama is on holiday , it will have a gol@@ f , it goes on the brak@@ es and the group &apos;s groups , in fact , is set out by journalists from the sun .
the language of the White House officials have not been a sign of a few hundred years of c@@ oo@@ king .
it is called officially on holiday , which has no time to read , or other words of action , to be taken into action .
in addition , there was also a second reason for job holidays .
this is an exchange of the white house in the western front of the White House and , therefore , all staff have to leave it .
the West is also located in O@@ wh@@ ka@@ c@@ on and others of the work of the President .
&quot; I do not believe that one of you would like to be in August , when there is 38 degrees and there is no anti @-@ condi@@ tion@@ ist language , said the language of the white house in L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters who stressed that President will continue to work during the course of leave .
where President T@@ ru@@ m is followed by 17 days of water , it will be an idea of video .
blocking of the critics on Facebook : do not stand up to the Head of State when you do not have the criticism of the voters .
the father of our country knew something about the unfavourable media opinion .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but the newspapers did not have a long way to begin to stem him from the internal policy to the political principles of up to the political principles .
of course , it was anno@@ yed by the criticism .
however , he has not forced to remain silent .
because , in the year , Washington states that &apos; freedom of expression can be taken away from us and , in the face and in silence , we can be chaired by sheep . &quot;
this brings me to Mr Ho@@ gan , Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has worked to see that there are more to be in Washington .
it has been blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook website .
the European Union for the freedom of the American citizen ( AC@@ L@@ U ) , and a week ago , is therefore the case for the Court of Justice .
the Governor &apos;s official officer was born in a vacuum and an online comment on the reactions of the j@@ arg@@ on , who are interested in &apos; .
&quot; this is just Facebook , &apos; said many .
however , it counts .
and that is particularly much if it is a sort of thing like Ho@@ gan .
this is an ama@@ zing popular re@@ public@@ y in the democratic state in the democratic state .
the percentage of his approval is the second second stage of the state of the country &apos;s 50 .
I am not thinking of a response to the un@@ determined position .
it has led to a firm , determined state on the state of play , and in the face of its principles .
in addition , it has used the main instrument in communicating with its constituents , for example , by presenting a Facebook page , for example , after the first time in the chemical or the first time .
therefore , the Governor of the Governor of the site is a public forum , which is managed by a public forum to be blocked by the workers of taxpayers &apos; dollars , and , ultimately , dangerous and ultimately dangerous .
in the interview with Mr Ch@@ astel , the representative of the Office of the press , the Washington Congress , in his interview with the Governor , claiming that the blocking of comments was nothing other than a ra@@ ft .
however , it is too easy to extra@@ ct the picture on the online web brow@@ ser , spa@@ s@@ mail or hatred full of the people .
the post was set up by a number of people whose Ho@@ gan is blocked .
it is precisely what they are doing , and that is what they are about to do with their elected leaders , the owner of the company and the passport , and not Internet controls .
they have all said that their comments were dis@@ respectful , thought @-@ out and , at all , not the ro@@ gue .
Pas@@ tor quoted in his postal services , by underlining the H@@ and@@ le Catholic road .
Mar@@ y@@ lan Bo@@ wi@@ e , a lawyer from L@@ ak@@ sh@@ m Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not insti@@ gate anger , but quite ang@@ ry of hate crime .
&quot; I have been in cour@@ tes@@ y that I am disappointed , because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &apos; he wrote the news story of a comment in the six countries .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , if many people comment on the same subject , some of them will be in@@ ex@@ in@@ dly in a collective effort , rather than acknowledging that this is a great deal of concern with citizens . &quot;
what the Governor of the Governor &apos;s officer has called &apos; to call on &apos; spa@@ w@@ ling attacks &apos; would probably call for &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook @-@ era allows messages to be easily fitting , by blocking simply a criticism or dele@@ ting a negative comment .
it is a lot of cleaner than old when the workers had to be sent to the same , so that they would collect newspapers in the newspapers and bur@@ n them or arrest protest@@ ors and forced them to remain silent .
however , exactly this is what is happening , simply in a digital fashion .
the Ho@@ gan is not the first public official who critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has taken the Court of Twitter users who have been blocked by Twitter .
one of the first points of view has been made on this subject in the last week , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ in .
at the US Department , James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is decided , Mr Alexand@@ ria , that a substance of the Committee on Budgetary Control in Alexand@@ ria is an asset for the first revision of the Constitution , when he was blocked by the election and his Facebook .
in K@@ abu@@ y , the AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter use , after Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in@@ i ( R ) .
this should not be so difficult .

if Mr De@@ ge@@ i &apos;s evening , he is not using lead .
it is even rare for the boys .

the De@@ ge@@ on is sitting on the b@@ reat@@ h of the b@@ reat@@ h that he has not yet , and it is also doing its daily domestic work , such as the water , which is was@@ hing to the water .
the role of the ho@@ la is going to be in a ca@@ ter .
since he has four women in his hus@@ band , he has not been appointed to take care of any contempt .
the Pol@@ y@@ ga@@ mia is a normal one here .
it is late to work , however , to be dangerous for the majority of men in the village of the unemployed and many of them are hard to drink , in addition to soldiers .
&quot; no one is bold after the five evening to go around the village , &apos; says he .
it is a rare way to survive in Papua mÃ¤@@ land , with the former Dutch colon@@ ies , which were accompanied by Indonesia in 19@@ 61 , following the controversy that was forced by a referendum in the course of just 10@@ 26 people to vote on the eyes of the troops .
the free movement of children from the centre of the press has encouraged the movement towards its ra@@ pes quickly against the government of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , which keeps the region still under its strong control , keeping away from foreign journalists and the monitoring of human rights .
in 2003 , the province officially distributed the P@@ ope and the West P@@ ope , so that the independence of Papua New Guinea left the island in the East .

&quot; we were not used to bear such ideas , &apos; says &apos; De@@ ge@@ i , referring to our colour co@@ ding to the marketing of the plu@@ g , and the er@@ rone@@ ous plu@@ g .
&quot; prior to this , it was only plant co@@ ws . &quot;
Papua ically is the worst provo@@ cative province in which 28 % of people live below the poverty line and the statistics on inf@@ ant mortality are one of the worst of Asia .
however , it is also a scandal of Indonesia .
just 100 km away from the P@@ ani@@ a@@ era , which is a province of an 153 000 inhabitants of New Jer@@ sey , is the most and more profitable cul@@ min@@ ating in the world , the most and more profitable cul@@ min@@ ers in G@@ ras@@ berg , which belongs to the P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x@@ is operating company F@@ bet@@ g .
in 2015 alone , around 3.@@ 1 billion of the USD 3.@@ 1 billion in gold mining was produced by the F@@ re@@ port .
in addition to this , Papua bluefin tuna can be bo@@ thered with the value of the dollar , which is estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these enri@@ ches are a source of the suffering of boats , as they are due to the presence of a powerful Indonesia military presence .
the New York Times 2005 survey showed that the F@@ bet@@ ma report in the years of 1998 to 2004 to the local military and military units , including USD 150 000 , to one of the victims .
the attempts to ensure greater autonomy are threatening the gol@@ den and they are being put in ru@@ th@@ lessly .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 69 , and thousands of thousands have been ra@@ ped by Indonesia , tortured and imprisoned .
according to data from the Committee on Human Rights , the mass killing in Papua polar states was a flood of genocide in the 1970s .
last year alone , the Egyptian police arrested over 3@@ 900 peaceful protests in the region .
the 2016 report by the B@@ ish@@ ish@@ ops of Burma , &quot; we will lose all the testi@@ mony to the atrocities committed in the previous year , such as non @-@ judicial executions , torture ( one of another report ) , and the brutal suppression of a peaceful demonstrations by peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; the number of victims is difficult to read , because such incidents will take place every week , &apos; the Organisation Human Rights Watch Indonesia study and Mr Har@@ son &apos;s .
the ball is still more strongly in the hands of the private , because the natural resources have caused the influx of neo @-@ settlements elsewhere from Indonesia .
83 % of the province of the province of the province are Christians , but the demo@@ graphy is becoming , because it is becoming a bridge between the population of Indonesia , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ez and S@@ ula@@ w@@ s islands from the islands of economic migrants .
the ru@@ mps sold by Ja@@ is@@ ts are sold in the gallery , and the b@@ ars of the b@@ ars do do wrong , which is recycled together with the surface of the surface .
local cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started to sell a chic@@ ken and vegetables on the traditional market , &quot; explains P@@ ani@@ a@@ is born 24 @-@ year @-@ old @-@ olds in the province of Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ in .
&quot; with the pa@@ int of pa@@ ints to the boats of Papua ma@@ ma &#91; women &#93; , they will therefore lose their market share . &quot;
the President of Indonesia J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , who is known as Jo@@ ko@@ w , has promised to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in the P@@ ope .
the former pu@@ tu@@ um won the President of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta &apos;s presidential front in Papua 29 constitu@@ encies , including the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
however , the P@@ ope has changed very little and the local feeling is beaten .
&quot; our hearts have been broken because in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he fulfils our hopes on the restoration of justice , &apos; says &apos; .
in fact , the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i just two months after the resigna@@ tion of Jo@@ ko@@ wi October .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children were s@@ run@@ ned by more than the blin@@ dness of a motor@@ cycle , with the blin@@ dness of two Indonesia troops .
children told them that they should be included in the table .
in the absence of an insult to the local passport , Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ in@@ i , one of the soldiers in the Chamber , and a woman later , along with four soldiers .
according to victims and see@@ mingly traders , the driving force behind the driving force behind children and pe@@ ves them with their exposure to their margins .
there were then a soldi@@ er in the soldiers .
one of the children , 16 @-@ year Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , beaten so much so that he fell to the ho@@ le .
a couple of hours later , the bur@@ n and the next day of the electoral Commission in the middle of the year will be even more .
around 1 000 young men , women and children in the European Union &apos;s demand for justice , women and the military management centre , are facing a football match .
they have borne the b@@ read@@ ers and presented in Papua me@@ e pa@@ go on the fla@@ ge @-@ han@@ g , in which they live and bur@@ ned the poultry s@@ ong .
some of the protests began in the hands of the police and military forces .
in the absence of a soldi@@ er , a soldi@@ er has been sent to the soldiers , when the mass of the population is more than three times resistance , leave them down , &apos; it was said that the official document , which has seen a letter of time , but what has not been made to local media publications .
the most young city in Kenya , the oldest city of Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ We ( 56 ) felt threatened and called for peace to be maintained , asking for a number of people to go home .
no one was willing to listen .
&quot; with a return to the left of the left , I suddenly had a shot in the left of the left , &apos; he said his time @-@ to @-@ eye &apos; house of col@@ ours in my German ca@@ ter .
we still do not know who was the fire , but it says that the soldiers of the soldiers gathered in the month have been gathered .
&quot; the people had a great deal , the wine lobby , &apos; it will add .
the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w received his shooting , as he said , three times .
&apos;@@ I would like to ask him to him and he was a body of a body , to make sure that it is her , &apos; said the time of the magaz@@ ine Y@@ oh@@ an@@ ta who uses a number of indicators , only one name .
&quot; I saw that he has died ... S@@ novel le@@ ta him . &quot;
the chief inspectors of the police of Papua Police Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende said to repor@@ ters that he was subject only to the security of their shareholders , as it was attacked .
&quot; we need to protect ourselves if we are threatened by killing , &apos; said in 2015 , the spokes@@ man of the press officer in Papua Police S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo .
&quot; this is a question of life and death . &quot;
according to Mr Human Rights Watch , five young people were killed in protest and was a lot of injured .
the news about the killings reached in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ us on the next day .
three weeks later , Mr Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra , a passion@@ ate speech , expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and pledged to deal with the mis@@ treatment of the P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to address this case immediately , so that it will never be repeated in the future , &apos; he said .
the Security minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that it sets out an ADR mechanism to tackle human rights crimes .
however , almost immediately , the apolo@@ gies .
&quot; most of the crimes have been back for a long time .
some of them took place in the 1990s and the 1990s .
it is about that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we must respect certain processes , &apos; said he .
on 5 June , on 5 June , the W@@ ir@@ an@@ to spoke , but his words , saying that he has no intention to create a P@@ ope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything will be resolved according to the law &apos; .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has accused the human rights of the United Nations in relation to human rights crimes more than 1 000 people in the wake of the bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 human rights crime is already resolved , including what happened in P@@ ani@@ a@@ ia .
the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i have taken such statements against the fear of fear .
&quot; I have been listening to four times over the last three years , but there has not been any progress , &apos; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ us .
&quot; I have been ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that , for years , there is still a fear of fear .
&quot; I fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; I fear that the army will arrest me , I fear that I am shot . &apos;
he was bro@@ ther Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ u confirmed that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are afraid of this incident .
he said that the army was beaten by the army after he had helped to bur@@ y the four victims .
&quot; after the execution of the body , the army had to seek me , &apos; he says .
these are not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Libyan people fired the village of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ is .
one person was killed and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , as well as children from four villages and the construction company , who refused to know @-@ how to hospital transport .
this male people , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ ed@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ w@@ ning fish in a lo@@ ved river , died on the road to hospital .
the civilian population prote@@ sted in the construction site in the construction site .
according to the police , the people of the villages were forced by stoning , which , moreover , responded to the warning of the warning .
however , according to the local authorities , mobile British ( Indonesia Mili@@ tary police ) took place at the hands of the people of Indonesia , killing one person .
&quot; we were a large panic , we are afraid of re@@ tali@@ ation , &apos; said 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ n in Ba@@ di@@ i , who live in a hospital near and saw injured in@@ sec@@ ts .
&quot; I have been beaten by two days in my own house . &quot;
D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i &apos;s Parliament has called for the police officers to be held accountable and the withdrawal of the police in the area of mobile British bri@@ gade .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ i is always a problem for the government of Indonesia .
the lack of thought @-@ based development is fed to the dis@@ satisfaction of the me@@ ters living in Papua paraly@@ sis in the middle of the world , and , of course , and the m@@ ire of the m@@ el .
many of them have been joined by the Liber@@ ation Movement ( V@@ PL ) in the wake of the army , which protects the rights of boats , by organising the rights of the Indon@@ ki@@ an soldiers , as well as the attacks on human abduc@@ tions and kid@@ napp@@ ings .
some of the leaders of the V@@ PL are come from P@@ ani@@ a@@ ana , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , the army has arrest P@@ ani@@ a@@ was and had arbitrarily detained thousands of people during the pretext of protecting the sovereignty of the country .
some of these are never more than ever .
in Papua humans , it is known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty is dis@@ satisfied .
the lack of a poor , which is sold in the majority , is too expensive for local purchase .
the Lei@@ b is the same un@@ available .
people are growing in their own food , mainly when it comes to their own food , in addition to a little bit of fruit and de@@ ser@@ ts .
farming is the work of women , each of whom will be able to care for four or five years .
they usually keep the majority of the total family , the rest selling the local market .
ten people are paying only 10 000 Indon@@ esi@@ pi@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
over the time , economic inequalities have been deepen@@ ed between pa@@ ints and new migrants , who have been in the Gulf of N@@ ab@@ ire airport opening routes for new air routes .
these few jobs , which are , will be better educated and richer migrants .
the P@@ ope for a competitive business is often lacking in order to create a competitive business , or the necessary skills .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the sitting , because there are no jobs and no money , &apos; says P@@ ani@@ a@@ i &apos;s Chairman of the Council , John Go@@ ba@@ i .
the privatisation keeps the eyes of the world away from the P@@ ope .
in addition , strict restrictions on external media .
the beginning of this year was sent to the French journalist Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ ku L@@ ong@@ cha@@ l L@@ ong@@ cha@@ l , as &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they were a rare film licence .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of Human Rights Watch , Mr P@@ po@@ m K@@ ine said , has not been carried out by Jo@@ ko@@ w &apos;s election promises to address the restrictions on transparency and development in order to promote transparency and development .
&quot; with Indonesia , the most Eastern provinces of the outermost provinces and the Western P@@ ope report , the journalists are threatening the new threats to the rejection of a visa and a black list , &quot; said in his statement .
the absence of the press in drilling means that international pressure on the government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua &apos;s near neighbours .
in March , six Pacific States were encouraged by T@@ on@@ ga , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ da@@ r , Mar@@ shall Islands and S@@ aal@@ om@@ on Islands , the United Nations Human Rights Council to examine the various wide @-@ ranging crimes , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the same countries have also supported historically the V@@ PL .
Mr Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , the spokes@@ person of the Ministry of Indonesia , Mr Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , the accusations of a group of a group , by saying J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas journalists : &apos; Indonesia still applies democratic procedures and freedom of the press so that the evidence of human rights cases is difficult to bur@@ y . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to notice .
if the Dutch delegation at the head of the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador K@@ ong Van B@@ ari on 4 May Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra , the local people were interrupted by the local people at the meeting , but the anon@@ y@@ mity wanted to remain silent , asking us : &apos; we want freedom . &apos;
in the course of 2019 , the new presidential elections will take place in 2019 , but boats do not believe that they will vote in Jo@@ ko@@ w .
&apos;@@ Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man of good intentions &apos; , but the people surrounding it , who are involved in the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , &apos; says the President of the Council , Ho@@ ba@@ i .
he wants to give the Jo@@ ko@@ w to understand that , in addition to the fact that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are constantly suffering from the threat of the military junta , they are suffering from poor education and health services due to the poor .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i must , as the other boats , the voice of Jo@@ ko@@ w to debt , which will have to pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &apos; says he .
despite the mis@@ fortune and intimidation , the families of the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i were not yet to cope with the last symbolic objection to the death of one victim to the physical police of the victim and the military junta in the country .
knowing that justice may never be put on their feet , they will not allow them to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &apos; Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us has taken a halt .
&quot; what else can we do ? &apos;
it came to Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ chi &apos;s pil@@ vel@@ ist and already in the second time .
on Friday , there was one of the most senior housing plan@@ ners in the world in Du@@ ba@@ i , forcing hundreds of people from this 3@@ 37 me@@ tre and 79 @-@ time buildings .
this is the second fire that has been devastated over two years , which is the case in Tu@@ rin , which is the case in Tu@@ rin , which is the case in Tu@@ rin .
there are no more than any serious damage to the building of the building , and no direct fire will be reported .
&quot; we have been s@@ le@@ ep and sh@@ ine down the fires and the people of people .
we would wait and we had to get around 10 minutes to reach the 50@@ th hour , &quot; said Re@@ u@@ ter@@ ans , one person who mentioned himself in George &apos; .
the fire @-@ fighters , according to Du@@ ba@@ i civilian civil servants , were removed from some at 4 p.m. at the local level ( 00@@ 00@@ G@@ MT ) , and the reconstruction of the building .
the government said that they are working to shelter a shelter .
this incident may once again raise questions on the safety of materials used in the world of high @-@ level external soil .
following the investigation by the Board of Govern@@ ors of the Tu@@ rin Bureau 2015 , it was found that the most damage suffered in the spot@@ light of the col@@ leges - external soil and isolation .
the British police have said that they believe that the London G@@ ren@@ P will have been able to contribute to the ad@@ missi@@ bility of the fires in the T@@ ow@@ er and the amb@@ assa@@ dors in June , in which around 80 people were killed .
see : they will probably be able to see their phones in the autumn .
language and sy@@ m@@ ood are the time for engineering , because the telephone manufacturers will make up their new models of excellence .
in the spring , there came to a my@@ ster@@ y to Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ al@@ a , in the autumn , in the autumn , in the autumn , to wait for new phones .
according to the Committee on Fisheries and Sales Director , we are characterised by the innovation of flags , the innovative design of the street , the long @-@ term , ser@@ t @-@ servan@@ t 4@@ K , with a resolution on the screen and the ultra @-@ fast process .
there was a great deal of interest in the world of Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , which has also reached Estonia &apos;s smar@@ t@@ phone sales tab@@ oo@@ s .
the autumn allows for a more flexible char@@ ter @-@ up , a more robust , high @-@ quality camer@@ as and more water and customs certainty .
he added that , on the basis of hearing , there is already a need to predict and predict the four excellence of the four excellence , which is probably to be inva@@ ded in the streets .
these four smar@@ t@@ phone excellence will reach a half of this year in the autumn .
P@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach po@@ pp@@ ers in mid @-@ September .
however , what the new Apple model does , and what do it can do , is spreading much .
if the P@@ hone 7 did not significantly increase the large differences in P@@ hone 6@@ s , Apple &apos;s tenth birth@@ day is expected to be a new model in the past .
it has been said about four col@@ ours : black , white , rosÃ© , and cro@@ wn .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the entire telephone front , lost their homes and fingerprints are built on the scre@@ ens .
Apple &apos;s J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve calls for the new P@@ hone model to be seen as a glass .
it has also been the case of the P@@ P@@ hone version .
in addition to the long @-@ term , the lead to a free char@@ er and a more high @-@ quality camer@@ as can wait for a faster A@@ 11 process .
it is certainly one of the most ambitious smar@@ t@@ phones in the year .
the new model of the U@@ hi@@ new model will start on 23 August .
it has been a great deal of hearing , which the new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y is going to see from 8 out .
Ad@@ mittedly , it is intended to be even more business @-@ friendly and the S will allow even greater fun@@ ction@@ ality .
the Tele@@ fon@@ er should have two camer@@ a , one of which is the in@@ ner and the other with the same vision .
at the moment , no one is aware of what the two gu@@ ights are able to be able , but in any case , it is a first test that is certainly comparable to the quality of the P@@ hone 8 @-@ ga .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August .
although Nokia has led to the sale of three smar@@ t@@ phone phones in this year , Nokia , however , is still missing from the flag , Nokia 8 , which is already being presented on 16 August .
we are looking forward to 5.@@ 3 @-@ pollin@@ ating scre@@ ens , and ultra @-@ fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ nap@@ dra@@ g@@ is 8@@ 35 processes and a more resilient a@@ vation .
in case of Nokia , alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and significant water and customs security are also talked about as an IP@@ 68 .
like Sam@@ van@@ ng@@ every , Nokia in the new model is two of the camer@@ a , which is opti@@ mised by the company Z@@ e@@ y .
if S@@ ony has been certain flag of flag , Mr Pre@@ mi@@ um , the manufacturer has confirmed that , in the short term , at least two smart phones , which are even more innovative functions .
we look forward to smart phone , which is slightly more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least as good or better .
the new model of the S@@ ony is specu@@ lated that it is at least a hot one .
the reality will be that we can see already the right thing , because traditionally S@@ ony has been unve@@ iled by S@@ ony in its autumn , with IFRS A , which will take place on 1 @-@ 6 September this year .
data from le@@ ak@@ ed by the Tele@@ phone calls , according to the pressure from T@@ ru@@ m Mexico to the end of the border with Mexico .
Washington unve@@ iled a call by the US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i and the European Union &apos;s telephone calls for public leaders between Mexico and Australia .
on 27 January , T@@ ru@@ m , the Mexic@@ an President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ ole , was put to end the last stop to public building that he does not intend to pay for the proposed limit .
with him , the President of the American President , in the wake of the public execution of the wall , is not to say : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; . &apos;
the T@@ ru@@ m set up his presidential campaign to build a long @-@ term US race to the southern border of the United States and the age of Mexico to pay for this project .
it was also published on the first speech by the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l , which reveal an intense debate .
the T@@ ru@@ g has said that the agreement on which the United States will take the refugees in Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; the ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; stu@@ pid &apos; , who said that the agreement was made during the time of the Obama Government , would give him the impression , because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the T@@ ru@@ m ended a speech by announcing Tur@@ ks that &apos; it was the most un@@ pleasant speech &apos; .
the Court did not take a complaint on the case of the O@@ S@@ C MR@@ P in the case of the Republic of Tar@@ tu , which was rejected by the city of the service of coach transport by July 2019 until 20@@ 29 .
this is a lo@@ opho@@ le which was rejected by the O@@ S@@ C MR@@ P in Li@@ tu bus , as the supply does not meet the requirements , explained by Mr An@@ neli A@@ pu@@ tin , the President of the Federal Legal Service of Tar@@ tu .
this is the case for the procurement of the airport in the area of Tar@@ tu City , from 1.@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 @-@ 3@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
the MR@@ P city has been complaining of a decision by the Court of Justice of the Republic of Tar@@ tu .
the Court has not taken this procedure .
although many people in the media are complaining that the We@@ ek@@ graph F@@ esti@@ val is disrup@@ ting their m@@ ood and a whole city of driving brak@@ es , there are also many of those who have no bad word about a lasting festi@@ val .
I am even a positive surprised that there were a brak@@ e for both visas .
I did not see any confusion or cour@@ tes@@ y .
even where I saw &apos; no &apos; , it is a wave of a wave .
&quot; it is good that it is good , and it is known to be the jo@@ ice that has been seen as winter in winter , adding it happy .
a wave of bul@@ lying in the do@@ main@@ s is not an illusion .
when in the middle of the middle , he is still in the middle of a mus@@ ici@@ ans , it is now not the music that he has arrived at home .
however , I hope that I will hear &apos; he says &apos; .
in the wake of the inter@@ lo@@ cu@@ ation , Mrs Ag@@ nes talks that the former F@@ esti@@ val is a good thing for the University , it will make a good contribution to the VAT of local traders .
in addition , he also welcomes that the summer capital is so much as much as many .
the woman of Pe@@ ol@@ ans is not a woman .
even though I do not have a more rigour , but it is nice that rand has revi@@ ved .
and it is nice that the people are moving and that is already three times , &apos; he is a woman .
at the first time , I think it was a little worse .
&apos;@@ then , perhaps it was a complaint &apos; , reflect he .
however , what is happening in the past is the case for the summer , according to the summer &apos;s capital .
&quot; this We@@ ek@@ graph is a very good pro@@ mo for our small town , &apos; talks about par@@ king Har@@ r &apos; .
the lives and m@@ Ã¶@@ ll have not been hi@@ jac@@ ked by his da@@ y@@ thing .
but for the sake ?
we should all keep together .
the way in which it would be better for ethnic communications is to be better .
after all , the music man is not priva@@ tised .
this is not a case , even though I live in the same way .
&quot; good people will be able to save and do not have a pa@@ int &apos; , he will speak .
the visitors who have come from the beginning have said visas .
&quot; with Putin , of course , they also have a little exagg@@ erated , but young people are young people and the courage - to go , but be people and we can do ! &apos; says &apos; .
the extreme people have travelled to this time , whether in the case of relatives or to know .
&quot; however , in general , the F@@ esti@@ val will have a positive impact on the people like such a me@@ ag@@ re , talking about children with children in Ti@@ ina .
his family , too , is not dis@@ illusi@@ oned by the F@@ esti@@ val of his family , even though this House has even further gone on this street .
last summer , we have heard more .
we are living in a town outside that , in fact , there is a lot to be in the middle of the river in the past , he is talking about it .
3 000 jobs are being cut , and it reduces dividen@@ ds to revita@@ lise business .
the British education company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday , that more than 3 000 jobs are being cut and reduces the percentage of its interim dividen@@ ds by the launch of a further restructuring programme to tackle the risk of business .
the jobs that are being carried out are likely to be made in the end of 2018 at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , together with 4 000 posts lost during the next restructuring period .
Mr Pe@@ ar@@ son announced in May the plan to cut costs by EUR 300 million ( 3@@ 94 million ) in the framework of the third cost reduction programme ( 3@@ 94 million ) , to try to revive business as a result of the transition to the transition to digital learning .
a company that agreed last month &apos;s participation in a company Pen@@ al in R@@ and@@ om House of his partner companies in Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , said that their expectation in relation to the year has not changed since the 1 % increase in the first half of this year was announced in the first half of the year of EUR 2.@@ 05 billion .

attack on K@@ abu@@ l : self @-@ suicide attacks on NATO soldiers .
according to the bom@@ b@@ bed bom@@ b@@ ers , the Afghan capital , K@@ abu@@ l military vo@@ id , was killed by a military vo@@ id , killing one of the other soldiers and w@@ ounds of NATO .
the NATO statement was said that five soldiers were injured and translated .

this bom@@ bing is the last acts of violence that have been hit by Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , the death of the Her@@ was mos@@ que attack more than 30 people .

the NATO declaration said that the explosion of Thursday was held when a joint pat@@ ro@@ l was attacked by the Afghan army , &apos; a man @-@ made explo@@ sive body &apos; .
according to the statement , everyone has been injured in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital in Bag@@ h@@ m .
according to the respondents , the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( in times of crisis ) , are becoming a serious source of concern for the forces located in Bag@@ h@@ dad in Bag@@ h@@ dad .
according to the United Nations , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , approximately 20 % of the capital in the capital .
at the end of July , the bomb in K@@ abu@@ l is mainly at least 30 people at least 30 people .
the Taliban said they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , a large bomb attack on the centre of the middle of more than 150 people - this is the most deadly attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant to manage the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the President of the United States , Donald T@@ ru@@ m , is considering whether to increase the number of troops in the country and the US troops assisting the police .
according to the statements of respondents in recent weeks , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l have also led to public confidence in the government of the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
the EPA annul@@ led following a decision on the postponement of a regulation on shar@@ ks .
the United States Environment Agency ( UNHCR ) , the decision to delay the decision of the Obama @-@ old regulation , which obliges states to limit the gas emissions caused by the state , is one day after the 15 state appeals to court in the case of this process .
the EPA announced a decision to continue the &apos; late on Wednesday &apos; in the case of the definition of a &quot; standard of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of Wednesday , saying that it shows the commitment of the Agency to cooperate with state states .
&quot; we believe that we need to hold dialogue with our states with partners and to listen to them , &quot; said the Director of the EPA , the Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t statement .
it was announced by the P@@ ru@@ it@@ t in June to postpone the ceilings of the content of the v@@ ets in which they are measured in different parts of the country in order to determine where the level of this level should be made to meet the minimum quality standards of the year 2018 at the risk of one year by 2018 .
the 15 mainly democratic states , together with C@@ olum@@ bia , submitted an action in C@@ olum@@ bia , saying that this decision is illegal .
the government of President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has tried to withdraw a number of the environmental regulations imposed by the former President Barack Obama , which says that it is part of a more comprehensive plan for growth in growth .
however , these efforts have caused reactions among the democrats and the natural defence groups , who are concerned about the effects of increased pollutants on human health .
the EPA is set out in a letter that the contamination of air pollution &apos; may reduce the labour capacity of lun@@ g and increase the risk of res@@ pira@@ tory diseases &apos; , such as as@@ th@@ ma .

it is a feature of the paper today by the We@@ ek@@ graph F@@ esti@@ val Baltic@@ a , and Mr LÃ³pez Garrido , he is not all , that the last resort to the end of the past .

we are bringing you a blue , which is together with all the images that our photo@@ graph@@ s tried in the We@@ ek@@ graph of the three days .
certainly , you are also in some of them , for them .
for the first time , we will discuss the possible confrontation with the first time , the Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko .
the V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ lon@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should be on the course of a col@@ lisi@@ on in order to face the most attractive boys in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday , for the first time on Thursday .
they were in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ le@@ in , in the office of the ES@@ P@@ N , until Gar@@ cia , won the un@@ won World Bo@@ un@@ t Coun@@ c@@ il ligh@@ tly , the second running of the corridor in order to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , the World Bo@@ g , the World Bo@@ un@@ t .
as a result of the unanimous decision by Mrs Gar@@ cia , the victory of the former two @-@ time world leader , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er , on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ time , both of the kid@@ napp@@ ers of the front of the table .
Mr Gar@@ cia has given his better hand and said : &apos; how do you go , the sha@@ dows ?
I would like to make a close success . &quot;
the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko will protect its bel@@ ts from Mr Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening to 19 ES@@ P@@ N .
if a couple of photo@@ graph@@ s , the L@@ om@@ ch@@ enko moun@@ tains , the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko moun@@ tains , said that it can be &apos; perfect &apos; for opposition fighters &apos; .
&quot; I am a former pre@@ valent , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I have returned to B@@ ron@@ er &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so much .
I am small from 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move below the ligh@@ ter .
and he must move towards a ligh@@ ter weight &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we will be able to fight .
F@@ Ã¤n@@ ans have wanted it .
let us give them this . &quot;
the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
it raised the question of whether its review should be a cost @-@ paid ; it is part of its strategy that he wants to allow L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to put an end to this year to the end of the debate , in order to make it possible for the next summer to be a meeting of Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ ses ) , who also have an interest in the fight against Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ l , following the ligh@@ ter fa@@ res of the For@@ u@@ um on 23 September .
&quot; the review of this fight could be a reward , because the f@@ ans have wanted this confrontation , &apos; said Gar@@ cia , saying later that he is open to the fight against any channel , which offers the best financial package .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name will be able to pay so much attention .
when they are ready ... &apos;
Mrs Gar@@ cia has said that he must be the champion of L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , and perhaps to look at his page on his des@@ k .
however , the L@@ om@@ ch@@ enko was modest in approving the Gar@@ cia , saying that he considered that the three cha@@ mbers of the Ri@@ ver@@ pool was set out in the case of the C@@ ver@@ ties , but I apologise , M@@ ela@@ y ... you wanted it to be a no@@ pe . &quot;
the Gar@@ cia said that the aim was to show strength and then bo@@ y .
both confirmed that they feel that they are growing in the face of the challenge of the tension between them .
&quot; this is the fight that looks forward to realising .
no other confrontation does not bring so much attention and take place .
I am more than willing to work on this , &apos; said Gar@@ cia .
the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been the creators of the best fighters and M@@ lon@@ y .
this is a good fight . &quot;
what is going to be moved from the World War to Estonia ?
a record of more than 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have been travelling to Estonia , who have been travelling to Estonia , have been extended and issued by the police and border guards Office ( PP@@ A ) .
if , for example , the soil was decided to issue a fixed residence permit to issue 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreign , the soil was the figure of 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the agencies do not know how much immigrants finally remain in Estonia , but this analysis will be drawn up in the Ministry of Interior .
as a year ago , around 500 Ukrainians a year ago , the figure in recent years will come to close to 2000 .
the number of applicants for authorisation has increased expon@@ enti@@ ally in the crisis of Ukraine , in 2014 , a fixed @-@ term residence permit , a year of 6@@ 75 .
with the statistical office , we will have the highest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia , the number of EU citizens from Estonia , Estonia , is more than a distance .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been a great time in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many of the family are already in the country , in the Interior Ministry , Kris@@ tin Ram@@ alla@@ y .
according to the soil and the soil , the number of people who have fixed fixed @-@ term residence permits was even more than the number of Russian citizens , even though , over 10 years , the most fixed @-@ term residence permits have been issued .
if the Ukrainians come to work here , Russia &apos;s citizens will be the family of family migration .
&quot; in view of this historic Russian community , they are also most likely to have the greatest family links in Russia , &quot; said the Home Protection Convention on Migration , the Hel@@ ina Me@@ deal .
&quot; if you look at where the Russian citizens of the Estonian residence permit have been able to live in a transplant , Har@@ rum@@ land has now been the case of East Vir@@ u@@ land , he added , and pointed out that around 40 % of them are mar@@ ried in the European Union &apos;s citizens .
the Mul@@ ti @-@ term residence permit was 16@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians wanted to extend the number of Russians .
&quot; this is due to the need for a new residence permit for a permanent basis to be maintained in Estonia , as a result of the possibility of a residence permit , for a permanent basis for Estonia , explained by the spokes@@ person of the Ministry of the Interior , Ram@@ on , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the event of a residence permit was not stable for years .
the new residence permit for Estonia will be able to obtain at least three years of foreign request for the first year .
its aim is to encourage the accumulation of people &apos;s sincere motivation .
however , a long @-@ term residence permit for a long @-@ term resident requires five years .
a new residence permit is expected to have also decreased as an extension of the old residence permit .
for example , the soil was awarded a residence permit for the 146 Ukrainians , which has been working for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to change the work and the Estonian state will no longer be the finger at the end of the pay criterion .
this residence permit was a pan@@ t to be popular - applicants for the bub@@ ble of the soil ( 10@@ 29 ) , the Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , individuals ( 54 ) and n@@ ig@@ er@@ ans ( 36 ) .
the 19@@ 68 people who live in Estonia for a residence permit , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 g@@ Georgi@@ ans and the same like the Chinese .
the first semester of this year is already a total of 12@@ 69 .
in 10 years , Nigeria has been surprised by the country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for the residence permit .
if three residence permits for children were issued in 2007 , the soil in the past 200 .
to learn from the University of Nigeria .
the Estonian higher education institutions are still popular , such as Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has been increasing largely thanks to learning games .
for them too , the rule is that , where there is a community that has arisen , there should be no more easy other words , in the annex to Ram@@ on .
over 10 years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , as much as the North Korea and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four U@@ ru@@ guay .
as a year , around 6 000 third country nationals can receive a residence permit , this is about 0.@@ 46 per cent of the total population .
even if the citizens of the European Union are concerned , migration will be around a percentage of the percentage , &quot; commented on the use of the action that , in fact , the numbers are small .
on the basis of the statistical office , the Greek soil , from 14 8@@ 22 people in Estonia , is expected to come out of 13 7@@ 92 .
this means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration .
most of the winners and those who are relocating are Estonian citizens , but more are among those who are leaving them .
this is why Estonia &apos;s citizens &apos; migration is in mine 2000 &apos; .
the Spanish and Estonia are particularly emig@@ rating .
M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture Pr@@ inc@@ s@@ sim@@ pe@@ ts in the case of the Naz@@ is , ti@@ tles and b@@ ore !
however , in the North Sea , the history of Maria Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u is , however , history - old old and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream of a few times somewhere in the muse@@ um , and the old @-@ old theft and cra@@ ts .
if there is something that you are doing with you , you are watching and learn about it every day .
that is the pleasure of finding it !
a long @-@ term world of C@@ ou@@ ture is one of a few ways of life , but it does not do so .
you yourself decide how much you live in life !
I have a friend , as a friend , who has a whole sa@@ il of the w@@ ounds of mine , which I have created .
because , and it is not his fault , he does not live in the Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ oo@@ d and does not go on a daily basis for every day , he would also want them to bear the most beautiful ones .
you will live in a special life for their lives .
the Mo@@ e@@ artificial nik does not recognise the gap between the events and the bad days .
this is precisely the reasoning of the plan to bring the rolling plan in Estonia in the middle of the world , to the people , to the people , who often do not catch up .
the M@@ long ago was presented , for example , by comparison , J@@ ool@@ s and the University of Al@@ mo@@ e@@ an , where 45 mo@@ del@@ l Ro@@ yal de@@ fi@@ le@@ e was carried out by the whole street .
in Tallinn , it is often carried out , a young people are seen with dignity , but elsewhere , there are more emo@@ tions - s@@ ongs , rise to stand up , want you to thank you .
a large part of the audience was just as news , but now they are in the M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture .
if you had the expectations of the people , they are spiri@@ ted .
and I like this feeling that I am in my motto , as if the summer summer .
Mr Chatzimarkakis , we had 50 metres of red car@@ p , the whole street , with you , who seemed to be the end of the end , it seemed that they did not end up .
Maria do not recognise the motto that animal nature must be presented in a super@@ super@@ super@@ super@@ size , it will be happy to give the wrong ordinary women .
I often call on my own customer - they are always happy to have come .
it is , after all , the experience of the experience , the island of the middle of the ice .
I am sorry that I myself have never seen his role , always , I am , of course , behind the fact that it is un@@ wise to give an un@@ pleasant form of influence on things .
my ner@@ ve would not allow cal@@ mly to look at the Chamber .
Mrs Maria is this kind of motto , who does not just want to play a representative role , but to be in everything involved in everything .
I have my own sis@@ ter machine , most of the colle@@ ctions I do .
I like the whole process , where you are playing with details , discovered .
I have never been far from our animal , and I am not afraid of work .
the only thing is not limited , but also an addi@@ tive , logistics , organisation , organisation , organisation , all of which must be a day @-@ off @-@ off of a woman &apos;s day .
it is up to the fana@@ tics of these working hours to be a great deal .
I cannot say when my day will end , for me it is simply a day full of joy !
I have very much been saying - that is , as a lac@@ ite chain : I am doing something fine , a man can do something fine and , in turn , compli@@ ments .
several times have been said that my bro@@ ker is in the countryside - they are putting them to know .
in the wake of the gu@@ ise of the gu@@ ide@@ line , which Maria talent overnight has made , the M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture sign@@ alling has been left to date .
Mr Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p U@@ 18 boys , a weapon of hos@@ pita@@ lity , has now been turned against us !
it is a pity , the slu@@ gg@@ ers of it were running out .
the first thing was that we did not get our tables .
and if there is a huge difference in the table , there is nothing to do with the Estonian U@@ 18 cor@@ ps : 75 out of the UK in the United Kingdom , the only N@@ B@@ M has played a repetition of the hel@@ ple@@ r , Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p .
opponents adopted an attack on 28 Pal@@ ace and received more attacks on this basis .
we were also not prepared to defend their aggressive protection and attack , it created .
many of the attacks on children ended up to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
however , they agreed to keep all the hand between them , but we could not be combined .
it created a team .
the homeless work has been done better .
the M@@ y@@ r@@ pa estimates that Estonia would have to do more tac@@ tical errors in order to take up the blow to the fight .
with the exception of the latter , we had a mistake , but we have already received a number of urgent times .
the generosity and close pressure that had been al@@ ag@@ pi@@ hed on our arms , now all of us , have now been against us .
today , we had no strength against these aggressive acts .
the M@@ y@@ r@@ der remained in favour of peace , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ si .
in general , there will be good words to be told about the tourism team , to date , to be a united blow .
it is a pity that , in the past previously , this aggressive response has already been taken .
it has been a whole time for self @-@ confidence and played today , but it seemed that he had been ti@@ red - he has made a very large burden .
however , he made a very fine move in some of the things that I have seen in the past , in the annex and .
the terrible numbers : the re@@ ba@@ ti@@ m concentration of the E@@ M @-@ tur@@ n@@ ine E@@ M , with less than 10 points ...
the 18 age classes do not only apply to the T@@ B @-@ di@@ vis@@ o of the Youth System in Tallinn , and , in the city of Tallinn , it started yesterday in Dublin .
and the EU &apos;s game of Poland , unfortunately , is the case of anti@@ ra@@ als .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter of 2012 , the state of affairs was 9 : 49 , only last ten minutes , anti @-@ dumping , and a period left out of 16 : 16 .
in the first and second quarter of Estonia , Estonia , the third 1 point ...
in the same way , in the first two minutes , they hit the first two minutes , but there is a lot of reference to the 25 piece , but then there is a three @-@ day shop , and then 21 to wait for ...
perhaps almost half hours have been tab@@ oo@@ ked in 47 .
in addition , 2 points had to be 2 .
there was a sensible number of losses in this time , 12 .
in the end of the game , Poland was set out by 33 and Estonia in 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , on the day , on the day , to recognise Portugal &apos;s 83 : 56 .
NATO vessels coming to Tallinn
today , NATO , which has been a permanent contra@@ ctor of NATO , arrived in Tallinn for weeks , to supplement the stocks of ships and to prepare for pre @-@ presu@@ med habits .
in the course of smoking , ships are preparing to wear the sea , and give the crew of members of the opportunity to holiday on a daily holiday .
after a visit to NATO , NATO vessels will remain in Estonia to carry out a number of habits and be ready for future historic rem@@ nan@@ ts .
&quot; the participation of children in the territory of NATO and the co @-@ operation carried out by them in local waters illustrates a well @-@ known way of our integration forces , &quot; said the transfer of the G@@ ae@@ r fleet to the operational and planning cycle of the naval fleet , the operation of the naval fleet in the tasks of the Sea .
since 29 June , NATO was chaired by a permanent contra@@ ctor of NATO on the coast of Latvia , G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ pe , who took over a ceremony in Riga at a ceremony in the Estonian naval officer from the coast of the Estonian naval officer in Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as , from 29 June from 29 June .
the flag of the group has been designated by the Latvian naval support ship L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , which will also act as a leader of the group .
in this half the year , Estonia is also part of the naval machine and the anti @-@ house of the Estonian naval force .
the four @-@ group groups of NATO &apos;s naval board in NATO , which are subject to the Association of the Community of NATO on the basis of Monday &apos;s fast @-@ track response , are a unit of primary speed , which the Alliance can send in different parts of the world in a range of days .
4 . - On 13 August , the P@@ iri@@ ta k@@ as@@ tery , once again , has once again been a place where 13 years ago , the T@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ las@@ ta has been put in favour of D@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
this year &apos;s visit to Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val can be a beautiful , powerful and unprecedented way to the Federal leader of the University of Tallinn Film .
the threat to J@@ oo@@ st : Cuba is to reach the clas@@ s@@ est of the world class , &apos; Tra@@ vi@@ ata &apos; and &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; , the C@@ rus@@ ti@@ la@@ answers &apos; Kar@@ l@@ ss@@ ot@@ ine &apos; Kar@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ ini &apos; , and also does not lack the scheme , which is the case of Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ n &apos;s m@@ our@@ ric@@ ch@@ ers in the same way in 2015 , which led to P@@ iri@@ ta in 2015 . &quot;
she is much more than just a group of groups and communications .
it is more than any music mus@@ ter in their normal form .
this is a festi@@ val , which is going to take power and will never be completely open .
since experience , which can be heard in this area and in a secret environment , human beings are taking a more generous , and it is about human dignity in a way that I cannot be described .
the first for the first year in Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
does the ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ las@@ kin@@ s have not seen a little bit about ?
but , of course , because I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been a great deal of aid .
I am in the direction of a whole student career , and also supported a professional career at the beginning of the adjustment process .
perhaps thanks to this , I will have it easier to continue his work .
in the past , there has been the heart of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val team so much good and , of course , it will be all over me .
it was excellent to join the team who knows how things go .
it has just been a great heart to me , Mr K@@ las@@ hed , also given me the strength of the F@@ esti@@ val in the town of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
and here I am now and I can start !
what could be done in a more audience street at the F@@ esti@@ val of the F@@ esti@@ val .
we have the first mus@@ eu@@ es , from Latvia , Lithuania and , as a surprise , the first bal@@ le@@ ans written by Mrs L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i .
in order to do so , &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson will fly &apos; .
and one of the no@@ torious n@@ ung@@ s is that it was the author of the bal@@ le@@ ans of Latvia and J@@ ur@@ s Kar@@ l@@ ne@@ s , who himself expressed their desire to write this works .
it is probably a child who has been living in Kar@@ l@@ Andersson &apos;s car@@ pet .
to the risk of how you are all ang@@ ry ?
thanks to my support , I certainly will certainly be able to support .
this work needs a system of work and a lot of love , and I am thank@@ ful to this .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tions do not depend on the other people , as I do not think I am going to go on to every new day .
and this is aware of the fact that it is being kept , maintaining a positive sense and , in fact , a laugh@@ ing of self @-@ off@@ s in the mir@@ ror , a significant proportion of my disappointment .
in particular , this week , when the most important test is , I have been very keen to have done so , and that is working .
to give ourselves a laugh@@ ing in the act , it is re@@ warding the tone .
that is not just a word .
I think that people are not yet aware of the things that the univer@@ se offers to them , but it is also a case for everyone to get it slowly .
right now , it is an important moment .
is it also a kind of ri@@ tual before the survi@@ ving of the ri@@ gen@@ s ?
there is still a ri@@ val to be replaced by more convenient .
this is a small moment for itself .
however , in general , I do not have the opportunity to make a large number of w@@ ounds or a small ina@@ ter .
in fact , I even like to be able to engage actively with the people , even before the di@@ r@@ ty dro@@ pping .
however , get all the F@@ esti@@ val to the F@@ esti@@ val , which is also to be discovered , not particularly in the great o@@ oper@@ o@@ tive and bal@@ le@@ ans !

new results of the publication of the age assessment tests for the Swedish edition of Sweden
among the various applicants in Sweden , the latest results were carried out by the most recent results in a medical test , in order to show that the latest results show that more than 80 per cent of the old one was estimated to be older than 18 , but not all of us do not believe any clarification of results .
the Swedish National Institute of medical medicine ( R@@ har@@ ts@@ women ) began with tests on this year &apos;s start .
the tests were set up during the first application of the age of age , after the Swedish Republic of Congo , in particular , to criticise the fact that they have not managed to put the age of juven@@ ile refugees properly to determine the age of minors .
to date , the migration of the migration has sent a test of 80 cases , and the Institute for medicine is between the middle of March 2017 , between the middle of March 2017 , and the results of 24 81 tests were issued by the mid @-@ March 2017 test .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) assessed the 18 @-@ year old age and another 25 in the case of cases of medicine , the Institute of medicine , in order to test &apos; may be 18 @-@ year or old &apos; .
the 4@@ 32 cases concluded that the person is &apos; probably a younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests are used only if the age of man is questioned .
the results of the previous few months are consistent with the previous few months in the Office of the Legal Office for medicine .
&quot; we do not see a great difference in the statistics in previous months compared to the figures , the numbers are quite consistent , &apos; he said &apos; The United Kingdom &apos; .
the fact that the vast majority of cases were assessed as a parent , does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been as@@ cri@@ bed at their age .
the Institute was issued in May 581 the results of the test , and said that 4@@ 42 cases are references to the fact that a person is being examined 18 @-@ year or old . &quot;
however , if the newspapers in Mrs Svensson examined the results of these 581 tests , it was clear that 2@@ 43 was a person directly saying that this year will be 18 .
the method of assessing the age of medical age , which is carried out by si@@ x@@ ty @-@ hul@@ l images and blood @-@ related MR@@ T , which will be allowed to analyse them with too@@ th doctors and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts , is criticised in some circles .
one of the sceptics is the H@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute &apos;s H@@ on@@ olo@@ gist Claude Mar@@ cus , whose job tasks include the assessment of the maturity of the people of the people , to identify whether they were in the normal past or later .
&quot; I have had the reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement method that is currently used should be used .
the designation of biological age in such a way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say clearly , we should not be faced with the fact that we can , &apos; said in the history of forestry .
however , in Joh@@ an GÃ¶@@ rans@@ son &apos;s Institu@@ tional Institute of medicine , the accuracy of the tests : &apos; generally , it can be said that the risk of in@@ accurate adults in the child is small .
most of the least 10 % of the risk is where the person is a little below 18 . &quot;

Y@@ our Tan@@ go lists nine signs that show that you are more expensive to regret and could for@@ give him .
it seems to be more expensive to understand the seriousness of the situation and it is working hard to resolve it .
it is more expensive to deal with the problem that he is going to go to another .
the more expensive is no longer a defen@@ sive position .
he sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for its actions .
he is not trying to blame your behaviour .
it agrees that it has made a serious mistake and it is sincerely trying to improve the situation .
he is attentive and is trying to intera@@ ct with you .
at the same time , he will put your blue up to the matter .
they do not deny what happened or try to make it un@@ noticed .
Su@@ ez and you have a more expensive understanding why your un@@ scrupulous dis@@ plays in your respect .
you are talking about this and also how to avoid this in the future .
you better communicate and assess the needs of each other .
the more expensive attitude and deeds have helped to develop its condolences to the mis@@ fortune .
the more expensive commitment and behaviour have created a basis for your proximity to recovery .
you have made progress in order to believe that you can believe again in your unity and our relationship .
the 20 @-@ year old and Mrs Maria O@@ rel made the London M@@ M@@ il fine debate , with 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 7@@ a on 18 seats .
Mr O@@ f was the M@@ M no@@ vel@@ ist , and a warm woman confirmed that it hopes for the future to fight med@@ als in the future .
the contest went well and received good experience .
in the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , I made an immediate end to the end of my average , on the other ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) , at the risk of too much and the third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) I have had to be clear , &quot; said , after the contest .
I was very happy to see my own emissions and I am very pleased that I found it .
Ms Maria O@@ re@@ li M@@ M has ended a fine on 18 @-@ time .
Mr O@@ reli@@ er did not dis@@ rupt , because it is training he has carried out the LTTE in the Quartet .
&apos;@@ I am afraid &apos; , he said a small slu@@ dge .
the London Olympic state was almost a single nation of the people , whether Mr O@@ f was the people who had their own or was able to integrate themselves ?
I have said , but in a positive sense .
everyone says that it will give it - that is what it is !
if it is to compete , it can experience it .
finally , it confirmed that the M@@ M will be satisfied , and it is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here to the 3@@ 2 , last outcome of the season , I ended up on 18 .
this is a very good result .
I am 20@@ 40 and M@@ il - that is the only thing .
I will take a good experience and some day I would like to compete on behalf of the med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina , Governor of the West Vir@@ g@@ ina ruling party exchange
the Governor of the West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a Democrat , Governor Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ every , that he will exchange parties .
&apos;@@ M@@ presu@@ e &apos; or not , but the democrats to go away from my Jewish , &apos; said the Governor of Justice .
&quot; today , I say to you , having for@@ ged and won@@ dered ... today , I say to you , the pro @-@ Western Europe , that I cannot be able to help you as a democratic presence . &quot;
the de@@ vil is in the wake of the joy .
&quot; so I will be able to re@@ visit me tomorrow , in the Annex Justice .
&apos;@@ T@@ re@@ ning , I would like to tell you that it is time to play a second game &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ m was allowed to have a great announcement in the coming before the West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a @-@ Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
the T@@ ru@@ m won the West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ as 42 points and Justice did not support the candidate of H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .

it notes that it belongs to the coal mines in the state of five states and the quite father of coal @-@ business .
his value is approximately USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , the re@@ public@@ ing National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) on Thursday evening , the announcement that &apos; Governor of Justice &apos; party exchange is yet another blow to a democratic par@@ able of a country that would rather hinder the improvement of the country once again . &quot;
&quot; all of the 15 chapters and control of the lowest number of state in the history of the state - Governor of Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent word to tell you what is the way to the end of the end , and we cannot find a positive , united message , &apos; said R@@ N@@ C New@@ l R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ Daniel statement C@@ B@@ S New@@ l .
it is not surprising that , where there is a lot of people , there are also many injured .
the We@@ ek@@ graph of the We@@ ek@@ graph in the office of Ur@@ tain said yesterday evening that the pos@@ ters have had to share quite a lot of them .
in Vil@@ les and mar@@ ras@@ ts are fundamental , false and easy failures .

Mr Co@@ e approved an honest apolo@@ gy for the Russians following the anti @-@ doping channel .
the International Convention on International Women in L@@ im@@ tian Co@@ e was approved by his words &apos; Russia &apos;s fair apolo@@ gy &apos; , but reiterated that it is not time for the country to allow sport to be allowed .
in writing . - ( PT ) Mr President , Mr S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin , on the eve of the International Council Congress of the International C@@ C@@ up on the eve of the International War , the IAEA Congress , in order to have a ban on its country , is the right and he is determined to fight doping .
he has apolog@@ ised for all @-@ of @-@ enter classes , who have lost the gol@@ den and sil@@ ver med@@ als in the contest .
despite his comments , the IAEA Congress voted in favour of leaving the ban on entry into force , which was established in November 2015 when the report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) took evidence of the country &apos;s spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think this was a very honest answer today , with a very honest presentation , &apos; said the IA@@ F President Co@@ e on journalists .
&quot; the whole of the Council and the whole Congress were satisfied that Russia also recognised that they have had quite complicated times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Union . &quot;
he said , in addition , it was pleased that Russia was accepted by the criteria for re@@ aring itself .
&quot; I believe that it was a very constructive day , and there is progress , but the Congress supports the proposal for a group that is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &apos; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything possible within the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we have always come to the principle that we want clean ath@@ le@@ tes to be separated from the system , &apos; added it .
one of the second Russia &apos;s bar@@ rel@@ s , who meet the strict criteria of the IA@@ F , competition in London on Friday , will compete with neutral ath@@ le@@ tes as active ath@@ le@@ tes in London .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Group , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of criteria for forecas@@ ting .
following the presentation by the IAEA to the Council , he said in London that doping is still insufficient and the techni@@ ci@@ ans are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution makes a significant contribution to the demand of metals .
who is the winners and losers ?
little because the revolution in electric cars makes a significant difference in all the fuel market up to infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the automotive market .
although the mines in the G@@ len@@ core can say that one of you will win and lose out , then smaller aircraft companies will not help .
at the moment , the G@@ len@@ core coal and oil , but in the age of electric cars , there is an increase in technology for electric cars , cop@@ per , , alu@@ mini@@ um and n@@ ou@@ ths .
in this year , the decisions of the UK , France and Norway , which allow for the sale of fossil fuels using new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades , have contributed to the spread of electric cars .
therefore , Vol@@ vo knows that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine , and T@@ es@@ la will bring the market cheaper to the market for less than 3 electricity cars .
B@@ animal berg in New Energy Finance forecasts is already sold in the space of two decades more than oil produced by electric cars .
&quot; for some of the few parts , it makes all the &apos; said &apos; the Capital of Economics , Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ ini B@@ animal ber@@ ber .
we have already seen a great deal of impact on metals such as co@@ balt and li@@ iti@@ um , which has increased for years .
in the electric car , there are around three times more than the ordinary car , declared G@@ len@@ core .
more answers are needed during the charging stations , which is why the Ex@@ ar B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates increase the demand for approximately five % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional li@@ tu@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ ors .
G@@ len@@ core can grow from an increase in electricity cars from an increase in prices of electric cars and that it is the world &apos;s largest producer of co@@ ding , forecast J@@ eff@@ ens .
in the light of the race in the past , the winners of the F@@ bet@@ g @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ za and the First Qu@@ an@@ ine Min@@ er@@ ger will be the winners of this .
the market is already responding to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of 70 % of the fish caught in the London stock .
the increase in the price of soil was 37 % .
this is also the case for 14 % of this year , mainly because of growth .
the G@@ len@@ core excise duty rose in London 20 per cent , having exceeded the ri@@ val in Rio T@@ lan@@ k Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ oni and Ang@@ lo .
on the side of Sa@@ ists , companies are engaged in lead companies such as Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine , who must adapt to the new era .
the main end @-@ use of the P@@ li@@ i is petrol and diesel engines from the start of cars to be st@@ olen .
electric cars are using li@@ m@@ aries .
&quot; this is a serious risk from the demand for lead , unless any other purpose , which could be overcome by a decline in demand , said by Mr W@@ id@@ mer , the leader of the Bank of America , Mr Michael W@@ id@@ mer .
in the form of price movements , it has not yet been seen to have an impact on the side@@ lines .
it is a year of 17 per cent of this year , which is the best meta@@ ph@@ eric in London among the main industrial metals in London .
investors see the problems only far from the future .
&quot; I am not sure that it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil will save ordinary cars in competition &apos; , said the Her@@ wi@@ g company Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ si sales company Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ si .
if there is a lead in demand , it will be slow .
it may be the case for around 10 years .
however , in the meantime , stricter standards of emissions mean that the demand of hybrid animals is growing , which depend on the expon@@ ential introduction of engines in the process of developed lead @-@ based ones , the international lead and the investigation organisation .
Ker@@ g@@ me@@ tal , like alu@@ mini@@ um substitu@@ ter@@ es , because let us get a car in less power to go beyond electricity .
it has already been explained by a further EUR 1.6 million tonnes of lower minimum demand for 2013 @-@ 2016 .
this represents 2.7 % of the total world of alu@@ mini@@ um .
it is likely that this trend is getting worse , said W@@ id@@ mer .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um is a year of 13 % , since the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to the market deficit .
the steel manufacturers do not .
the ak company is working together with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of light @-@ ups .
similarly , Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and the S@@ ven@@ ue Europe are trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t of a steel , so as to resist the lower minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be a response to this development , &quot; said the Ex@@ read B@@ N@@ P Paris study Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
there is some success in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also lead to the suffering of the pla@@ in@@ room .
it took around half of this precious me@@ tal diesel engine for cars , announced in the me@@ tal of the me@@ tal and Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ y .
&quot; in many times , such as oil and pla@@ at@@ as , in the future , there may be no major demand in the future , as Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h of the raw materials analy@@ sts , Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important , but their importance will become more than 15 years .
the Pla@@ ti@@ in@@ at@@ makers believe continued demand for the hor@@ ses of diesel .
Mr Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , the leader of Mr Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , said that , in 20@@ 25 , it will continue to be sold more to hybrid cars in a more prosperous way .
the great hope of the Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ makers in the middle of 10 years is To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ per@@ i Mo@@ to@@ si , based on hydrogen @-@ based cars , which depend on a pos@@ ter to produce a hydrogen electricity .
so far , however , this technology has not yet been legally justified .
&quot; it seems to be a clear chaos on the road to electric cars , &quot; said B@@ N@@ P Paris in Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers received a massive set@@ back in July , as S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art was a court in a ban on the use of diesel by Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e &apos;s home town .
how a football fund will affect the transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the un@@ bri@@ dled spending of European football clubs do not hinder the record transition from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona French club Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences for the UEFA , governing bodies , which domin@@ ate the European game and in its power to ban crew on the prestige of the J@@ CA , are waiting for the conclusion of Saint @-@ Ger@@ May only before .
the financial rules for the fair game in 2011 ( F@@ F@@ P ) mean that the PS@@ G has to prove that , without a huge damage .
the EUR 2@@ 22 million was paid to Barcelona , which is EUR 2@@ 62 million alone , for the Brazili@@ ans to buy his agreement , and the salary of Ney@@ ra will come to the tens of millions of dollars a year .
there are some of the financial aspects of the French club .
the PS@@ G is undoubtedly able to go to the recruitment of Mrs Ney@@ i and to give its sta@@ ti@@ tudes on the table , given that the team is funded by the state of the S@@ tar of the T@@ tar .
they have been allowed to spend a lot of players in recru@@ iting players , but they must balance the legal income sources that allow them to come up with a football business .
F@@ F@@ P has set the basis for Michel Pla@@ tini after he was elected as President of the European Year of UEFA .
this former French player and where the clubs who fall in the search for a large debt , are actually dealing with fraud and risk buying , when banks or owners should abandon their support .
since 2011 , the F@@ F@@ P club will focus on monitoring the debts of clubs .
this change means that the business model , which was used by Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch , first in 2003 to buy a club with a potential , and then to make a large amount of spending so that the team can improve and create a global mark of global trade - is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of the F@@ F@@ P , which will run until 2018 , clubs can transfer up to EUR 30 million losses .
and despite the fact that Mr Pla@@ tini was dis@@ credi@@ ted in 2015 , the presidential office of its UEFA de@@ ser@@ t and Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in are still committed to preventing excessive over@@ spending .
&quot; F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said the previous week in The Hague , Mr Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is a Supervisor of UEFA F@@ F@@ P .
although the PS@@ G &apos;s over@@ purchase clause for the withdrawal clause , it will be possible to allocate this amount to the full allocation of the total budget for the whole period .
Mr Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it is possible to show a transitional fee of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
in 2014 , the first wave of sanctions in the event of the first wave of sanctions in 2014 received the most severe penalties on the Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga of Abu D@@ ha@@ bi .
at the moment of EUR 60 million , the PS@@ G was appointed a fine of EUR 82 million , which was reduced later to EUR 20 million , and a club called for the introduction of a team of Me@@ me@@ ters in 2014 @-@ 2015 rather than 21 players in the period 2014 @-@ 2015 .
UEFA is looking at a club who may try to choose over financial institutions , blow@@ ing their income through businesses with the owners of the club .
the company in Ka@@ tar may be spon@@ sored by the PS@@ G , but if the value of spon@@ sorship is considered to be standardised market rates , UEFA &apos;s official income will not be taken into account .
in 2014 , in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar tourism Authority ( PS@@ G ) has been dis@@ tracted .
it has been said that a certain part of the PS@@ G services can come from the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Management of Re@@ ports by the World C@@ H@@ on@@ ship in 20@@ 22 years .
however , the PS@@ G and Ka@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that you could become a world champi@@ on@@ ship Ambassador , and say that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities are able to expose such manoeuv@@ res easily .
the penalties previously designated by the PS@@ G mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules .
the people are familiar with the situation on Thursday , that UEFA is not a member of the PS@@ G @-@ Ney@@ ra transition .
they spoke about the &apos; press release &apos; , provided that they are anon@@ ymous , because they have not been allowed to discuss the state of the PS@@ G .
the latest reports show that , at the time of 2015 @-@ 2016 , more than â¬ 10 million in the season 2016 @-@ 2016 , a total of â¬ 54@@ 2.4 million .
the data for the last financial year has not yet been published .
the PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of mar@@ ry will have a good spon@@ sorship transaction , freight and label sales .
in the context of the conclusion of the agreement , at least 30 % of the total increase is expected .
the Spanish side , which clearly frustra@@ ted the departure of one of the largest football sceptics , tried to prevent the transition from the PS@@ G , claiming that the PS@@ G is in breach of F@@ F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear &apos; case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with a club and a country , &quot; said the Spanish newspaper President Javier T@@ eb@@ as Spain , with reference to the fact that the PS@@ G is primarily the case of Ka@@ tari@@ al .
Ar@@ sen@@ i &apos;s col@@ leges of Ar@@ sen@@ i W@@ en@@ ger , whose club belongs to the American sports mag@@ na@@ te , shares the attitude that the country finances the club .
&quot; this is a consequence of ownership rights and that is completely the whole football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to a country , all possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules for fair play , because the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player . &quot;

at 6.@@ 30 and ran@@ ges , there is a hun@@ t of fla@@ mes , because at eight times the pos@@ ters have to be in order to people .

the current quantities of PrÃ¼m have decreased .
for years ago , it was much more .
people are now able to assess what they are doing to be done , talking about the U@@ so@@ v , which has been repeated for 15 years .
before that was the case that , if something new was put up , it was already a day for the next day .
now it is already being held in the ran@@ k .
the price of clean rigour
one of the biggest jobs in Estonia is for fish to be caught in the sea of rub@@ b@@ ish , or ad@@ ru Kor@@ re .
for example , the P@@ iri@@ ta ran@@ ges must be prevented from 400 000 tonnes of coast@@ lines .
&quot; it is un@@ beli@@ evable , &quot; notes the U@@ so@@ v .
the second major category is municipal waste , all the people who leave it .
Eigh@@ teen kilometres in the S@@ tro@@ om coast of S@@ tro@@ om are eight major in@@ tuna sein@@ ers , which are needed for three times a week .
so much will be the waste .
however , the me@@ ters of the summer &apos;s summer have meant that the waste is a fifth of less than otherwise .
the third species are abandoned .
in the most cases , they are the ones .
as a result , the U@@ so@@ v sand is replaced by a mix@@ ture of the w@@ ounds .
they will be able to wait for the withdrawal of the dead wood .
&quot; it is usually the case that they need more , but it is a normal harvest , &apos; U@@ so@@ v already knows that they will soon be able to join them again .

however , the aim is , like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ari and the University of S@@ tro@@ om , as well as in S@@ tro@@ om rand .
&quot; compared with Europe , there is much more work in Estonia in order to be careful , &quot; said Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more ad@@ qu@@ eu@@ es and hea@@ ve , and it is more difficult to live in the sand .
however , we are less was@@ hing than anywhere in Europe .
when we were talking about the rub@@ b@@ ish , there is a lively presence in S@@ tro@@ om ran@@ k , who is living in S@@ tro@@ om be@@ un@@ lessly at a journalist and cor@@ ro@@ gation , highlighting the current bottlenecks .

the problem is the problem of birds and pu@@ sla@@ ve @-@ sla@@ ves , who have been bo@@ gged down in rub@@ b@@ ish , says Martin .
although it is difficult to expect people to change their sen@@ ses in order to change their behaviour , Mr Martin hopes that the government of the city will take something in the dus@@ t@@ b@@ ines and , for example , will not be ham@@ pered by the lin@@ ka@@ ges , to prevent at least links to the news .
in general , however , Mr S@@ tro@@ om is satisfied with development .
it is to be seen that the city will look after it .

Bank of England is keeping interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to notice that interest rates remain on the former level , as prosperous economic growth and inflation have cus@@ hi@@ on speculation on the rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth persists as a lo@@ i@@ um , as households are exposed to interest rates .
policy makers of the Bank ( EPAs ) have voted 6 : 2 rates 0.@@ 25 % , and less members require an increase in this month , because slow economic growth has weakened the support of the increase .
in its quarter &apos;s report on inflation , the Bank will be cut back to 1.7 % of the forecast for 2017 and by 2018 and by 1.6 % in 2018 , and warned that the level of income for households continues to be expected , as the autumn is still expected to increase inflation .
at the same time , the bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in the rates of the number of over the Bre@@ x@@ it@@ l in the next few years is necessary to curb inflation in the past few years , as well as a higher level of borrowing in the financial markets .
Members also voted for a year ago , as a result of the partial withdrawal of the package of de@@ preci@@ ation of the economy created by the Bre@@ x@@ ti package .
in February , the bank will end up with fixed @-@ term fixed @-@ term funding , which will provide low @-@ cost funding for banks , even though it said that the scheme is now expected to be GBP 15 billion by EUR 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the Council &apos;s decision , the Bank says : &apos; the G@@ ross Do@@ mes@@ tic Product ( GDP ) will remain power@@ less in the near future , because the difficult situation in the real income of households will continue to have an impact on consumption . &quot;
on the rates of the rates , it was repeated that the &apos; monetary policy &apos; is a need to draw up a lot of effort , and this &apos; somewhat more &apos; , if the markets are expected .
Mr BÃ¶ge is now predi@@ cting the first increase in the second quarter of the next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the bank stressed that any kind of profit is a step and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and the next year are comparable to 1.9 % in May and 1.7 % respectively .
the forecast of 1.8 % in 2018 was maintained .
after this new , the dollar has fallen by the dollar and the euro .
women fell by 0.5 % of the USD 1.@@ 31 US dollar and 0.@@ 4 % of 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointment of the specta@@ tors that have been given growing hopes in terms of the increase in GDP in the second quarter of the past three months , 0.2 % in the second quarter .
the bank says that growth continues to be 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year , this will be a little boost .
the latest inflation report by the Bank , the latest inflation report , gave rise to little reason to the fishermen who suffer from rising inflation and army pay , saying that the situation is going to be slightly worse before the improvement .
it was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent the amount of income in the next few years , but it is expected to put an end to a significant recovery of salaries in the next few years .
as a result , it is also encouraging the economy to create a growing demand for British production , which is partly due to lower costs for consumers .
the decision must be taken after the rate of 0.@@ 25 % in August last year after the shocking EU referendum , caused by a sudden weakening of the recession .
the bank estimates that it is likely to be four years that the prices and the economy can be put into full life .
prior to the last decision of the Bank , the growing demand was felt by increasing demand , since inflation has increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy @-@ makers were expected to increase the rate of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected to rise again and again in the coming months .
the bank said that excessive growth compared to 2 % was due to a completely weak p@@ ound .
Mr Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , the leader of the mort@@ ga@@ ters , Mr Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke said : &apos; the recent decline in Kur@@ ds seems to see that the mortgage market will again become more competitive , as creditors will be able to end up to work and put an end to the year positive .
Mr BÃ¶ge seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions will be completed , as re@@ financing , often in a service , and a low rate , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS is writing 10 000 people in contradiction with HIV medicine
patients have had access to the battle for treatment in the form of a &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; HIV @-@ friendly situation in the Supreme Court , whether the N@@ HS should be financed by the medicinal product .
the N@@ HS has announced that public health is now estimated at 10 000 people available to pre @-@ pre @-@ pre @-@ vocational training ( Pr@@ EP ) , which is estimated to be made available before the mid @-@ term and which has shown a reduction in the risk of conta@@ gi@@ on in the case of high @-@ risk people .
the N@@ HS agreed to finance clinical trials after the Court of appeal was supported by the Court of Justice last year , according to which the Pr@@ EP is able to pay for the Pr@@ EP , despite its claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Ste@@ ven , the Executive President of the N@@ HS , welcomed this Thursday , as the &apos; new &apos; big intervention &apos; , while the national a@@ id@@ ance fund described the &apos; turning point &apos; .
in writing . - ( PT ) clinical clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ oli@@ s and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d , are among the first ones who will be able to register , in October , in addition to the clinical trials before 2018 , in England , by April 2018 .
in order to reduce the risk of HIV @-@ infected infections before the mid @-@ term review is taken to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of the fibre tests show that the Pr@@ EP will significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission among people among people .
the Pr@@ EP , before the mid @-@ term , means that there is a sufficient number of medicines that prevent HIV infections from a large amount of medicines .
such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the interim .
they include a homo@@ sexual or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans @-@ gender people and people , whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot be treated .
these are suitable people in line with clinical coverage , including men , women , trans @-@ gender people and those with HIV @-@ intensive non @-@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have opted for a family doctor in the programme will also be able to register in the local sex health clin@@ ics in the programme .
the programme pays GBP 10 million , and the N@@ HS is signed by the Treaty in order to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the aim of the Pr@@ EP is to assess the actual potential of the Pr@@ EP , with clinical evidence for whom the treatment is intended and how it is used to be used and implemented .
Mr Ste@@ ver said : &apos; this new large @-@ scale intervention should complement and leverage a wide @-@ ranging and increasingly successful fight against HIV proliferation .
this is another milestone in the long term in the long term in the fight against humanity one of the greatest health problems of humanity .
Mr D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah , the Man@@ aging Executive of NA@@ T , said : &apos; it is a turning moment in the fight against HIV .
the Pr@@ EP , if it was targeted correctly to those who need it and are the risk of a ru@@ p , offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England .
since September , people with high @-@ risk @-@ risk people in England have access to a powerful new tool to a new tool that is individually managed and dependent on the negotiating partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
the Chief Executive Director of the steel Fund , ian Green , said : &apos; now is a priority to ensure that clinical trials can be put in place quickly and that no HIV risk group should be side@@ lined .
now that the Pr@@ EP &apos;s clinical test is obtained , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who have a threat to HIV infections .
Mrs Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Public Health , Mrs Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son said : &apos; the Pr@@ EP @-@ i clinical test is a very welcome and very long overdue delay and the dis@@ pat@@ tern of the government &apos;s feet .
evidence shows how significant changes can be brought to the end of the spread of HIV prevention and the spread of the infection of life .
this clinical test will lead us to a step closer to the full understanding of the EP &apos;s advantages .
it is now important for the clinical test to be adopted as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV , and to bring us a step closer to the proliferation of HIV in society . &quot;
the price of electricity rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
in order for the next day of electricity , the difference between the cost of electricity in the electricity sector was reduced between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania to EUR 1.@@ 94 , compared to EUR 7.@@ 71 , in June this year .
the main reason for the difference is the rich@@ ness of the Lithuanian Swedish community .
in Estonia , the mid @-@ term review of electricity in the medium @-@ sized electricity amounted to EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 33 , and the price was expected to reach 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price of 5 % of 3@@ 6.@@ 27 has fallen by the price of five per cent .
in Finland , the price of EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 17 was EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 17 , and the electricity exchange stock of Nord half was a systemic price of 2@@ 6.@@ 37 .
prices rose according to 12 and seven per cent .
between Estonia and Finland , the electricity between Estonia and Finland moved from the hours of last month to Estonia and 16 % of the lessons from Estonia .
the remaining nine % of the two countries did not take place in the next few days .
between Estonia and Latvia , the electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved from Estonia to Latvia , and 73 % of the hours were at the disposal of the entire transmission capacity .
in the last trading day of July , Nas@@ hir@@ q OM@@ X on the market may be around â¬ 34 and in September 37 to â¬ 34 and in September .

life of high @-@ life life - a half @-@ call and smart de@@ sig@@ ner have changed its small Ear@@ ls in the middle of a house
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , former bankers , who is passion@@ ate to property renewal and , in the wake of its great K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , had a home in 2014 .
it is in the first time of Mrs Anne Ter@@ nez , and that Mr Jo@@ anne does not have a copy of the pac@@ ked and log@@ ans that have been sold on the table , a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before this lived , I lived with the former co @-@ operation of K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , a lot of more soil , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was something that would be tanta@@ mount to the price of my contribution .
it was shown to me about the Ear@@ ls and had the same high la@@ yers .
I am in a doctor and I did the same day .
since the first visit , this 93 @-@ r@@ square me@@ tre has passed a total of complete innovation .
at the beginning , it was one of the s@@ lee@@ ping and a complex s@@ le@@ ep , a le@@ ep dro@@ w@@ a , to get a piece of kit@@ chen , Mrs Jo@@ anne wanted to add a space of storage and in a half that to take advantage of high rates .
&quot; I wanted high rates , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
in writing . - ( FR ) Mr President , Mr Az@@ adi N@@ ot@@ ting Hil@@ lis , the archite@@ ctural and design of A@@ adi N@@ ot@@ ting Hil@@ lis Du@@ ck &amp; D , to take advantage of 3.@@ 8 m , and to create a home , which would not simply be the point of development , but a place where Jo@@ anne could live .
it was not high enough to add two room for each other , so the architecture of the architecture was to create a qu@@ asi @-@ win situation in which it can stand up .
Mr Harbour was supposed to be a creative approach .
&quot; the industrial design is quite complex , &apos; explains it .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise space , so that they are based on each other , without which they should be absor@@ bed .
it was not just a platform to build a platform , but we used the construction of a ter@@ me@@ design so as to be the right thing , as well as at the age of alu@@ ter . &quot;
it enabled the Er@@ fan@@ il to create two @-@ year @-@ old @-@ mil@@ ly in the room for each other , with a large number of dramatic elements .
in writing .
the gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture of Pe@@ e@@ gel@@ ed , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ am@@ b@@ mental Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille is stressing room for style .
the use of Dan@@ es plays a role in the inclusion of theat@@ re , spatial and lighting .
in the short corridor , the mir@@ rors have been included in the same way that it would seem longer .
the K@@ night leaves the impression in the case of the second half @-@ out @-@ up window .
at the end of the return , the gra@@ b will provide for all Jo@@ anne &apos;s eating and the glass requirement for all Jo@@ anne .
the cost of life is adding to the car@@ pet , which is not being used to shut down , if it is not used , creating a sh@@ ining space .
the kit@@ chen kit@@ chen does not have anything new .
however , in this kit@@ chen , it is a unique fact that this is the issue of the res@@ ounding @-@ up of the arch@@ i@@ age .
&quot; it went a little in the design work , &apos; explains Mr ter@@ as@@ strengthened &apos; strengthen &apos; from the spo@@ died M@@ D@@ F &apos; .
&quot; this is a counter@@ part , and this is why it is very simply a matter if it is to be rejected . &quot;
thanks to space and housing smart use , Jo@@ anne is now more than 16 square metres , an additional s@@ lee@@ ping holiday and a better recovery plan .
&quot; after all , it is up to the w@@ oo@@ s that you are selling - or what is going to give property value , &apos; say Er@@ critically .
&quot; in Kin@@ s@@ ware of the property land , an outdated form and makes calculations on the basis of the surface area . &quot;
here , they have been able to increase the w@@ asta@@ ge , using high quality materials , which will be a luxury of a space .
&quot; materials are those that you are missing and which will thus help to create an emotional link to the home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not live in an electric cable .
it is important , but it does not give heart to the language . &apos;
this shows that a good design and increased area will help to make a quite aston@@ ishing way of anything .
in fact , they can even create a desire not to leave , as happened in Jo@@ anne .
the main issue of Jen@@ sen is the cul@@ mination of Mrs Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s po@@ vel@@ la , who will compete with a colleague from his counterparts .
it does not count on any kind of money , which is not forgotten by any kind of ethics .
his wife and three children are just a man of theft and late this evening .
the first half of the film in the first half of the film is that it is , after all , the Western version of the &apos; business world &apos; - even in K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ ad@@ ri &apos;s speech .
what the film continues to do , in less than a ca@@ ri@@ den house , but the moral intention of the film @-@ makers will increasingly be able to think more .
the main experience of life can be the issue of cancer , the disease of cancer .
there is now a choice between working and family life .
the po@@ ck@@ ery of the advis@@ ers will give the father of his feet in Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s great buildings to think about truly important things , such as religion , good , love ... , without un@@ touched on the disaster , even the disaster .
after the third place , where the son &apos;s father opens up , there is a feeling that the film @-@ makers will certainly be able to obtain the objective of informing the audience , because even the most initial heart is unable to keep doctors back to the hospital of cancer in order to see the suffering of breast cancer .
if the po@@ g is falling and his situation does not seem to be hope@@ less , the father and the father of his work will understand the mor@@ ality of its work and make a good job for the people who seek a job .
now I am in a sense of self @-@ bet@@ ting - if there is a film in the hands of the film , then I will be rewarded with your own @-@ hear@@ tedness after the film is not a mistake , but I would perhaps be able to praise at least one surprise in the case of the risk of the latter .
for a moment , there is suspicion that the rest of the coff@@ ers - if the hus@@ band is a hospital and a man of tor@@ n in a hospital and a man in the middle of a girl ) .
however , the Po@@ e@@ g is a pan@@ ac@@ ea for it , and although his father has just lost its work , it is positive because it is now a time to deal with family .
I can also be well aware of myself - I can see the end of America quite well !
it is the honour of having a film well constructed , all the necessary elements are available .
it will be a case that can be priva@@ tised , exhibi@@ tors are good and mor@@ ally : money is not the most important thing in life .
it will bring this film into a well @-@ up .
the new staff of the staff of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ g are planned to limit the consumption of the President &apos;s media .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F@@ s will be able to do so .
in this case , it would be the first .
it wri@@ tes that the new staff of the White House will be in order to limit President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including the news , in the hope that it will keep a cross @-@ fire balance .
in this regard , a repor@@ ter has been covered by Mr Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ lt :
&quot; if the new staff of the white house in John F@@ s , Mr President of the first day on his first day , he received a key problem with the President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ led Ma@@ needed , which he intends to resolve in the hands of the President in the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly said to officials that the information must be carried out , whether on paper or meetings , because President would make better decisions if it is shared by good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly seems completely logical , but also others have tried and they have been trying to de@@ commission his media on the monitoring of his media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship on television goes for decades , and now that he is in the White Ma@@ t , there is no habits in his television watch .
&quot; if the candidate T@@ ru@@ m was dis@@ credi@@ ted from the unfair media opinion , it was shown to show him that he was reflected in an un@@ scrupulous manner , &quot; said the former campaign , S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , in February Poli@@ ti@@ co@@ l .
the Political tic@@ o Wi@@ th@@ el has signed at the time that &apos; the &apos; six @-@ pack &apos; , according to the &apos; six @-@ pack &apos; , is a key element of the control of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter , if to ensure that it is a personal media consumption in a stable manner . &quot;
good .
however , the idea that the habits used by Twitter by the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ g have never been &apos; control &apos; , is ridiculous .
perhaps these campaigns are something that the rest of us do not know about what the rest of us do not know about the fact that , without their intervention , it would have been even more unusual for their intervention .
we will probably never be able to know about the de@@ fa@@ ts that you did not postal in T@@ ru@@ m .
if he was able to save or rescue a couple of times if he was able to save them , their efforts are worthy of this .
however , no one has been able to obstru@@ ct T@@ ru@@ mp@@ h consistently .
part of the problem is that , in the White Report of the White Paper on competition , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception , by conve@@ ying the T@@ ru@@ y material that supports their views on the world , but may not always be credible .
the whole story of a policy @-@ based policy of tic@@ o wrote to the President of the advis@@ ers of the Centre for a strategically questionable value of information to the President .
one of the examples described by the repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is the next :
&quot; the current and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ le will say that T@@ ru@@ m can respond to a negative press , especially as regards the adverse effects of the infection , explo@@ sive , with an explo@@ sive approach to identifying the source of departure .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone gave a reas@@ ser@@ ful copy of a copy of the Internet provocation to Mr Charles C. H@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com article , which accused the staff of Mr Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i in order to have a white house for a number of le@@ af@@ lets in Wales .
it is not a difference that Joh@@ n@@ son has been blocked by Twitter , or that he did not provide any specific evidence or that he has also made it wrong in the past and withdrawn them .
T@@ ru@@ m &apos;s article and started sub@@ jec@@ ting to Wal@@ sh@@ i . &quot;
the Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that the time of the time of the staff of the previous Re@@ ince E@@ eb@@ fast and the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , has tried to establish a system for management and documentation of documents reaching the system . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same for three months later .
perhaps it will prove to be a driver of Pri@@ ti@@ tia more efficient , but , Mr T@@ ru@@ f , there is still an impul@@ se and his ab@@ er@@ able competition remains on behalf of the influence .
these changes are changing the very difficult elements of the mission .
music music received from abroad to the capital of the capital to do not have a chance to go .
there is a lot of foreign affairs in the city centre in Tallinn .
those with whom the le@@ af@@ let have been admitted , acknowledged that in the age of the town of the town , without permission to be held in the town of Mayors .
the first we have found the gates of Vir@@ u Vir@@ u today , who were the same as many of them in many of them .
it was clear to see that there were mus@@ ici@@ ans of the fla@@ ts and divisions in ab@@ sen@@ tia , who were to spend one of the j@@ arg@@ on .
despite the fact , the only woman played by a woman in the same way as a r@@ hy@@ th@@ h story , while one man in his or her side has been brought together by the three pal@@ p@@ rs and fur@@ ni@@ ture .
the third man was one of them in ab@@ sen@@ tia and smo@@ ke@@ red by a heavy @-@ hear@@ ter @-@ hear@@ ted advantage .
these three cha@@ mbers did not allow ourselves to upset the people of fur@@ ni@@ ture .
the A@@ Cor@@ di@@ oni has played a gesture of Boeing and the pal@@ lia@@ tes in Bo@@ b told that the streets in the streets and the money after the money .
the aim of this House was to collect the same day on the same day from Finland to the same day .
apart from the question of whether they asked for a sub@@ urban licence for the sake of the age , No@@ emi and Bo@@ b heads were shak@@ en .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never be more than a day in one city or a couple of and most of them pledged for a period of time or something .
there is no point in paying for this , explained by Bo@@ b .
if we were to re@@ visit Vir@@ u at around 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are at the hands of mus@@ ici@@ ans and go up to them .
this House col@@ lap@@ ses and col@@ lap@@ ses to Vir@@ u &apos;s col@@ lap@@ ses and bags , Vir@@ u Centre .
there are three Polish people in the streets of Vir@@ u , one of whom played a fifth , a second k@@ lar@@ ing , and the third was the use of electronic ga@@ ver@@ t .
&quot; we are here to give people a enter@@ tainment to be able to spread music and joy and , in order for the money to earn money for fuel and living , a tri@@ o @-@ headed M@@ iv@@ os@@ h .
they say that they are aware of the fact that there must be a licence for the urban government to take place .
&quot; of course we do not have this &apos; said &apos; , he said .
however , we hope that if people enjoy our mus@@ ici@@ ans , there is no problem .
of course , if the police have to be , we will go elsewhere , but we must try , in the annex .
the Estonian Bank in the euro area of the public sector of central banks in the euro area , in July 149 million of bonds , grew up to â¬ 4.@@ 36 billion to â¬ 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank will not have a more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Mr H@@ ans@@ son , has made clear before the whole of all members of the country , that the system of central banks in the euro system covers three different purchasing programmes : the bonds of the financial sector ( in the case of the financial sector ) , but the bonds of the public sector ( PS@@ PP ) and public bonds ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank is buying bonds from the market so as to encourage bonds to invest in investors elsewhere .
the impact of purchases falls on the production of lower @-@ risk assets , and it will motivate investors to take greater risk .
in general , the government bonds in the public sector are generally buying bonds from the government of its own country , with other countries &apos; bonds .
since Estonia has not issued bonds , Estonia will do so in the limits of the so @-@ called replacement purchases .
the Internet is also working on the central banks in those countries where the supply of these sovereign bonds is limited .
the Estonian Bank is generally buying bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian Bank is buying bonds from the asset programme since March 2015 .
in the meantime , bonds were also realised , but the 2016 June 2016 Bank will no longer buy bonds from the year June 2016 .
in the name of the euro area central banks , since June and Estonia , the Italian Central Bank is buying bonds from the Finnish Central Bank .
migratory movements are being ignored and the &quot; millions of business &quot; will be returned .
some of the rich@@ est owners of the West Mid@@ lands are once again in the face of the confron@@ tations of confrontation with determination , who have ignored the cu@@ mber@@ ing of the cra@@ ck @-@ out of their cotton , to win back from their cotton .
the migratory movements have par@@ ked their 20 tra@@ cks in the run @-@ up to the ro@@ ck of the &quot; millions of business &quot; in So@@ pi@@ k .
they have returned , together with the hor@@ ses , the army and of the trucks of cars , when they were only in May , without being confused with a degree of confusion , which led to the invasion of their invasion council .
the act group found a weakness in defence limits , turning their vehicles without un@@ blocking the part that was left to po@@ t .
M@@ aru@@ rious people have sur@@ sur@@ rated the So@@ z@@ ul@@ k Council , saying that the &apos; problem in dealing with the &apos; problem &apos; .
one of the anon@@ ymous residents said : &apos; they are in a Monday evening after their exclusion from the Ben@@ ad@@ y He@@ ath@@ on , where they were lo@@ ved by stoning .
the Council must be dis@@ credi@@ ted that they would act , because they have been involved in dealing with the problem .
the migratory movements were there in May , they were going to go , and they are now back again .
this was the case yesterday evening , which is likely to be more . &quot;
he added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect their par@@ ks .
I live on the road to street , and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay a mandate to pay if the Council is not even able to prevent such a matter . &quot;
one of the local players who also wanted to remain anon@@ ymous , said : &apos; it is ridiculous , but we saw how the last few of these emig@@ ran@@ ts , and are already taking place under a new offensive .
this time , the number has increased and the grass@@ land is even in the hor@@ ses of the horse . &quot;
the representative of the So@@ meat Council , said : &apos; we are aware that the road to the street in the south of the street is unacceptable , and we are working with the So@@ z@@ ul@@ li police to take the necessary legal measures so that they can move as soon as possible .
in the collection of evidence , it is very helpful if many local people in any form of antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour are a case with a number of 101 or criminal behaviour , when you call a number of 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation , if we are presenting the case to them . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ graph festi@@ val will also visit the Minister of Culture , among others , on the Minister for Culture , who is pleased that it has been able to bring the real world top names in Estonia .
on the question of the We@@ ek@@ graph F@@ esti@@ val , it is so important that it is so important to ask the Sa@@ ar , that it should be asked from all those who have been fully enjoying the heads of the F@@ esti@@ val .
however , it recognises that the real offices have come from the beginning of the University .
&quot; looking at this level of artists , which has been able to bring back to Estonia , it will be the absolute senior names of this music cir@@ cus , which is often the case in our hands , the Minister for Culture .
what are the artists in the festi@@ val of Sa@@ art himself in the most words ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old age , and I am certainly one of the most recent doctors in the old Ar@@ min van B@@ nu@@ re@@ n , who took place yesterday evening .
according to his pos@@ ter , all of us are at some point in a position , at some point , too , &apos; say it &apos; .
however , it still brings a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ thia , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ a .
of course , our Estonian authorities , starting with NO@@ x P and can be read a whole series of .
in reality , the &apos; concentration of names &apos; is very high , says it .
look at a video on a video .
in the midst of the criticism of the authors of the Au@@ di , car manufacturers have been hit by an increase of 850 000 per vehicle for diesel .
a day before the Au@@ di &apos;s announcement , B@@ M@@ W , the B@@ M@@ W , has said that there is no more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the B@@ M@@ W chairman , the company believes that &apos; there is a more intelligent option than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including B@@ M@@ W homeless , in Munich , which has considered a ban on diesel vehicles or restriction .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday , that more than three million members of Mercedes de@@ pu@@ gas emissions to reduce diesel engines in Europe .
no company has described them as a re @-@ call for these operations .
European car manufacturers have been in favour of advertising in Europe and in the United States , in order to help to comply with the regulations imposed on carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide from diesel engines are considered to be carcinogenic and may lead to as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , the cost of neutr@@ alising the exha@@ ust emissions of diesel vehicles for industrial companies is also increasing , making cars a difficult price for keeping cars into a competitive way .
at the same time , while the German car manufacturers are under @-@ depth investigation , the Chancellor of Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of un@@ locking the powerful car manufacturers , and ignoring the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to avoid the repetition of the mistakes of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen who is silent in silence , which allowed the use of the gas to be adapted to regulatory regulations for the time of testing , but it rose to normal driving times .
a number of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen has been charged with the United States , and others are under the Atlantic inquiry .
last month , the former President of the Au@@ di Au@@ di engine Development department was arrested in Germany .
the former President of Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o is an Italian and is therefore not protected for extradition and can go to the court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year the Au@@ di , the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen in Germany , when the authorities accused the installation of the audit system in order to circum@@ vent the requirements of the European gas volume by extending its investigation , which was focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Au@@ di can be a great blow to the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , a great blow to the manufacturer of car manufacturers , a disproportionately large proportion of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen &apos;s profits .
Estonia &apos;s schools will be bought by 20 000 euro for the European Union .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union by 1 September from 1 September .
together with a measure of measurement , the European Union &apos;s flag of 5@@ 70 educational institutions will receive a measure of measurement .
it is set out in the field of mis@@ guided efforts , which must be carried out in a high @-@ quality print in the field of quality information , as well as the re@@ warding of the ER@@ R portal .
the text is the text : &quot; Kin@@ as@@ a Estonia &apos;s School of Estonia for the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the cost of 5@@ 70 flags is a price of EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , or one flag goes for EUR 35 .
murder of a journalist , murder of the growing threat in Mexico
N@@ al@@ al@@ go@@ ce workers will normally gather on Wednesday days to look at the most recent chaos in the State of the Sin@@ ti , the most recent losers in the state of organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ ased drug wars .
however , today , they have been asse@@ m@@ bled up to discuss their own safety .
they are told that it is important to change its stu@@ pid change .
the two parents will discuss , which appears to be safer : whether to bring children into office , which was a sign of an attack in 2009 , or to leave them home .
the Tur@@ ks have signed a room for the next three words : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask the repor@@ ters to give the names of the report to the call to provide the evidence that there is no need for proof , it is enough to give the impres@@ sions and internal sentiments .
the presence of the government or car@@ tels is suspected of the drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists in the whole list of the whole list of people who are making a threat to the chaos in Mexico .
there is no b@@ reat@@ h of violence , and which has been more controlled by the public purse , the majority of them account for the protection of journalists , according to the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights , according to the fact that , from President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena , the appointment of at least 25 in December 2012 , at least 25 5@@ 89 journalists , since attacks and threats , and has been killed in the course of this year , at least seven journalists in the seven states .
the latest deaths include a source of inspiration and inspiration , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &apos; written in Val@@ dez one of the books on drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though its presence can perce@@ ive the b@@ read@@ th of the mas@@ ters in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building a huge picture of the average in@@ fin@@ ary at Val@@ de@@ z@@ z , together with a letter of the &apos; Justice &apos; , and two 30@@ n@@ ly repor@@ ters , A@@ ar@@ is I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , the T @-@ shir@@ ke , which has an image of his wife , or her com@@ po@@ t .
the meeting will take place in less than two months after the death , Re@@ por@@ ters will be discussing a common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are stories , un@@ thin@@ kable , paran@@ o@@ tics .
although , in 2010 , a separate public prosecution service was created to address cases of journalists , the protection of journalists from the Committee on Civil prosecution has been held accountable to the judicial prosecution of journalists .
as in the case of murder and organised crime in most of the annual drugs and organised crime , the number of thousands of deaths will also be allowed to court by journalists .
in the case of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , there will be a continuation of the anti @-@ grassroots violence , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the murde@@ rers and justice , there is no security meeting with I@@ bar@@ ra , said that there is a lot of benefits .
&quot; it is worth wasting our time here at this meeting , &quot; says he .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , there are no mistrust of all . &quot;
on 15 May morning , Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the capital of the State of the State , Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ in .
he has managed to travel only a few quarters before , before two men he gave red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ roles , he forced the car to come out and was shot at 12 times , which is expected to be the name of the &apos; twel@@ f@@ th river &apos; .
the armed man travelled to Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s car , and he made an emergency in the vic@@ inity .
Mr Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he was left in a woman and two adults .
Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ is freely circu@@ lated freely .
however , there is only a silence on the subject of Val@@ de@@ z .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition of the United States in January , one of the most bloody bat@@ tles in the country is one of the most bloody bat@@ tles in the country , because ri@@ val@@ ries are fighting in a vacuum of power .
it is not a difference that a few people in the streets of the A@@ O@@ oa on the streets or even a number of months or even many of the w@@ ounds of the w@@ ounds are dis@@ pat@@ ched in cold @-@ fashi@@ ons , which are more than many of the homes of many living .
let us forget for a moment that the peace time refers to the fact that only one car@@ tel of the global state of the drug traffic routes and road traffic routes to the United States is just a car@@ tel .
despite all this and the fact that Mr Val@@ dez was fully aware of the risks involved in his work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and the President of Iceland on May Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) have not been able to protect his friend .
he believes that the slaughter was encouraged by two errors .
the first of these was Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s po@@ ck@@ les , in the face of the b@@ reat@@ h of Gu@@ z@@ man D@@ amas@@ o D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z@@ every , an interview which took place in February .
this piece of correspon@@ dence could be allu@@ ded to the suspect of the mon@@ ks of the gan@@ gs who bought all the books immediately when they arrived at the time of time .
the second mistake was that the Val@@ de@@ z was not forced to leave his own security country after it took place in one of the newspapers that have been reflected in one of the same story .
the Val@@ dez was leg@@ alised , both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point against violence against journalists in Mexico .
he has lived in a long way so long that his friends and colleagues were expected to have a permanent presence .
he worked in the newspaper No@@ ro@@ ka in 2003 , when he joined the five colleagues in order to create a Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , sold 50 @-@ dollar @-@ to @-@ dollar .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said that it was impossible to address the issue of the press without being treated with the drug problem . &quot;
the real amount of time has been raised by your courage and honesty , and sales and advertising grew up .
there are strong studies on sport without censorship , without fear and read@@ ers , which they were able to read stories , which no one else has da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspaper has won the award of its Latin American mir@@ rors for the pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ oti .
in the same year , the Val@@ dez journalists &apos; Protection of journalists won the award of the International Press Freedom Prize for his courage to follow the Mexic@@ an drugs , all of which it leads to .
he admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to move forward , &quot; said the AK@@ K &apos;s award .
last October , he said a television channel Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV in inter@@ views that drug trafficking is a way of life in our fragile way .
&quot; the &apos; head of the task &apos; will be a task that is accompanied by the second opportunity to play in the hands of the journalists .
I do not want me to ask me that what I did in the face of so many deaths , or why I did not say what is happening . &apos;
the S@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ ctives , the Val@@ de@@ z , a jo@@ y@@ man , who , as low @-@ favoured , war@@ ther , friend who divided embry@@ on@@ y and advice , teachers who knew how to survive .
they are in favour of the support of his stu@@ pid .
he always made a bar@@ rel .
he went on from the office of El Khadraoui and the father of the province of El Salvador on the table at the same time .
now they are asking whether his &apos; love &apos; was sent to him .
his death has also put them into question as to how best to work and stay in life .
&quot; they do not like a blind eye to their women , their children , their own business , their secret landing orders , which are used for transporting drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been left , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is even in the best times a strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ care .
the trust of their in@@ st@@ in@@ tors .
if it is fra@@ gran@@ ted by a dubious , ho@@ d@@ y .
according to Mr Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , Mr Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ ali , the problem is that the &apos; fra@@ gran@@ ces will be dece@@ ived ... &apos; and this is the case with Mr J@@ ights . &quot;
his and other say that the O@@ AS does not apply to the old rules , just as they do not apply to Thailand , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z@@ i , Guer@@ re@@ ros or other states that are home to the po@@ ison@@ ing of revenue @-@ generating routes , weak institutions and corrupt officials of state officials .
the engineering is constantly changing .
in the space where the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers were met for security training , we suddenly had no longer allowed mobile phones ; some days before it was revealed that only the bu@@ ck@@ ery of the bu@@ ck has been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists .
two poli@@ ce@@ men from the house in front of the House have been rela@@ xed by 40 @-@ mil@@ l six months .
the government set out a more courageous Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office , which is located in the middle of a four @-@ time building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
some repor@@ ters were wondering whether these police officers are among their 50 % of police officers , whose Governor himself is un@@ reliable .
several months have passed since the repor@@ ters have travelled to the mountain places where control is de facto drug gan@@ gs .
the report by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on this week addressed three main pillars .
one of them was the murder of Mr Cha@@ vez , Mrs Cha@@ vez , the murder of the gu@@ ise of the former son .
in addition , they also revealed the lack of money from the government in the home town of the home town .
from one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants from the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an from the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , the Prosecutor &apos;s office and the Prosecutor &apos;s office , the most expensive restaur@@ ant was kidna@@ pped .
there was no formal announcement of those who were kidna@@ pped or how it happened , so we had to be cautious when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of the restaur@@ ant , both the drug traffickers and the people of the authorities .
Re@@ por@@ ter has been informed about public documents that a restaur@@ ant is registered as a politician , who is in power in the present institution of the Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of policy at almost all levels of the whole century .
at the last time , several IR@@ P accusations have been accused of a wide range of cases in corruption .
in Vil@@ lar@@ ing asked the repor@@ ters to write previous incidents at the same time , including in the Gu@@ z@@ man po@@ g of Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s po@@ et El Chap@@ o .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers have been looking for the Val@@ de@@ z ko@@ m@@ n to obtain information from the best sources of kid@@ napp@@ ings .
&apos;@@ sooner we have already known what happened &apos; , &apos; 46 @-@ year @-@ old Vil@@ lar@@ s , whose mo@@ tives have earned the body &apos;s name , El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all channels have been broken down by our sources of communication . &quot;
the office of Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s office has become a storage space and a stic@@ ker , which protests against the killing of journalists , and there has been something that they could never wait for the activists to press for the press .
Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez took a couple of eyes and direction next morning to the local Prosecutor &apos;s c@@ abinet in the next morning .
Mr A@@ ke is the case of three days in the West of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an in the State of Val@@ de@@ z .
it has been found in contempt for the death of its DNA tests , according to the use of DNA tests .
journalists are over the whole of the country &apos;s voice , and it is cri@@ pp@@ ling organised prote@@ ins on the roads and buildings , &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; .
on this day , the President of Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington , trying to collect international support for the justice of Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s case .
the day after the death of the Val@@ de@@ z , the W@@ O@@ O , accused of the death of Ra@@ mi@@ rez , was accused by the authorities for journalists , and because of the truth about their slaughter .
after this , he asked that he would focus on the part of the government , when it is concerned that hatred has been affected by objec@@ tivity .
Mr Val@@ dez was repeatedly said that the Mexic@@ an journalists are organised by organised crime , co @-@ cul@@ pri@@ ts and in@@ difference in the form of a &apos; restricted society &apos; .
in its last paper , the &apos; drug press &apos; wrote that the repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gan@@ gs , but also the command of politicians and security forces , who have organised crime in an area of organised crime .
the Media Monitoring Group in Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 attached a more than half of the attacks on journalists in the police and national officials .
&quot; in Mexico , you are going to be silent , because you want to be silent , &apos; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
obviously , there is a real impact on blood .
no one will forget the death of six years ago in the north @-@ half of the bloc and Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ kas , six years ago .
he was found with a letter , which was probably signed by a car@@ tel in L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for his report . &quot;
in addition to his pe@@ la@@ gic , computer glass and e@@ ars were beaten by the computer .
some publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the newspapers El Nor@@ te , in the northern border state , Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ ina , following the killing of their fellow respondents in the B@@ ee@@ hi B@@ ee@@ hi in March .
others will move forward as a newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ al@@ o L@@ are@@ do after the murder of the President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z has publicly asked us , &apos; What you want , &apos; What you want to do , &apos; .
some journalists are in the state of state or even the country .
this is the ner@@ ve decision .
it is difficult to find a job , and they still need to get to the streets to prevent the dangers .
and sometimes they are behind , such as the photo@@ graph@@ graph Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered together with four women &apos;s people in 2015 , in one of the three months after Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
those who remain in place and continue to work must be restruc@@ tured every day .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who wanted to be a po@@ ker , recognises that the circulation of drug trafficking is frigh@@ tening him .
&quot; Mexico is on the road to hell and I am talking about a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
one of the recent mid@@ night of the recent Friday when the latest number was already be@@ s@@ ned in the case of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the edit@@ ch@@ ers of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , and rob@@ bed the be@@ er when suddenly suddenly started to rela@@ x all telephone numbers .
there was 19 people who have died in the context of the F@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ k Bank and the forces of the security forces , which have been killed in the exchange of ri@@ val@@ ries and security forces .
the war is continuing to continue , as has been promised by several of the messages that have been found in the region .
on the same hand , the repor@@ ters made the news for a mobile phone in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
in the next day , changes were needed .
the S@@ ire@@ en@@ ers have been overlooked by another further fire in the region .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pi@@ il@@ us in the hands of the police officers who are on track to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not have this at least .
the mass colle@@ ction of A@@ jal@@ e has fallen under the mass colle@@ ction of his average , which has a finger at the whole of the Sin@@ ti , was delivered by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers in his foot@@ note .
&quot; how can we think about the closure , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; when , on the same day , when Javier was killed , he asked him to be able to make his report on his report ? &apos;
Mr D@@ in@@ osa used the guard against enemies in order to prevent enemies .
at first sight , it seems as a form , although rather frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now unve@@ iled the first bread in the case of the un@@ beli@@ evable massac@@ res of Canada , which is so well known that the experts have described it as the &apos; din@@ osa@@ urs Mon@@ a Lis@@ ia &apos; .
it is even more well @-@ known that it was even possible to identify that he had been covered by the s@@ ine and his past was somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the reports published in the Ro@@ ology published in Bi@@ ology were described as &apos; best for the most survi@@ v@@ ors &apos; , which has ever been found &apos; and if one of the best figures in the world &apos; .
on the other hand , it is a new no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ lation which lived in the middle of an i@@ o @-@ age , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
it is incredibly good to maintain that , in a period of science , who describe this &apos; truly significant &apos; .
this is covered by animal feed , according to a national Ge@@ o@@ onian , according to a list of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus , which has ever been found .
on 21 March 2011 , Mr Mc@@ Mur@@ ray of Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um in the mining Stra@@ it was replaced by Mr Mc@@ Mur@@ ray , in Canada , on 21 March 2011 .
he has struck something that did not remind the ki@@ ds , and decided to look more closely .
the ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus were found in Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell , the muse@@ um of the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell .
the next six years was developed to refer the animal to 2 500 @-@ age ( 1@@ 100 @-@ kilometres ) .
after all this hard work , the final result is now to be prepared to bring the public back .
&quot; if a little bridge is to be put in place , it is almost to believe that he s@@ le@@ ep , &apos; said the leading author , Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , the doctor Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell , in which the presence of the ti@@ ac@@ ity is being extra@@ cted .
&quot; this goes to the history of one of the most beautiful and most vulnerable sectors of the science , Mon@@ a in Mon@@ a . &apos;
he also found that the researchers were aware that it has been known as those who are covered by soya and recalls the di@@ visi@@ ve tan@@ k , which is likely to have a significant impact on meat in the food sector .
it used the red and white defence col@@ ours in the light of the red and white defence , so as to hide behind the da@@ u@@ tors , and implemented the over@@ sha@@ dows that are referred to and used by many of today &apos;s animals .
it allowed experts , according to the fact , to a better surroun@@ dings and enemies of the enemy , because the larger number of figures were likely to be hun@@ ted in a s@@ hun@@ t .
it was for the first time in May and is now visiting the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ ace in May and is now visiting the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell .
researchers have now studied the existence and gave the name of Mr Bo@@ the@@ double , the M@@ use@@ um of Mar@@ x@@ chel@@ le , who had the famous team , which spent more than 7@@ 000 hours , to be made more than 7@@ 000 hours .
thanks to the very good preservation of the father , Dr Mitchell and the team of scientists in the international community have been able to docu@@ mentary the form and size of land@@ ings .
they discovered the subject of dis@@ secre@@ ts , in the nature of animal species , which means that the intr@@ usion on half was a me@@ tre than the lower .
although it is widespread , the bread will come as a surprise , as Boeing is much greater than those who are currently living in the face of the sha@@ dows .
this implies that the fact that there is a great deal of in@@ vita@@ tions in the spot@@ light of other mus@@ ici@@ ans , in order to give preference to the status of the survi@@ v@@ ors rather than the opposite of their survival tactics .
however , most of the animals used in today &apos;s face of today &apos;s dis@@ secre@@ ts - such as fear , se@@ b@@ ers or archa@@ graphy - are a lot smaller and more vulnerable , which indicates that the pressure of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ s had to be truly struggling to survive .
&quot; a strong hun@@ t of a large and large number of soya @-@ based areas shows how dangerous the kidna@@ pping of those who were kidna@@ pped in the centre of the age @-@ old era has been called &apos; Brown &apos; .
the chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds at the same time revealed that the sk@@ in of the doctor was in the red slu@@ dge .
scientists will continue to create an investigation in order to get hot@@ lines for this life , including the content of the de@@ vil , in order to identify what the animal has been in the last place .
they believe that the din@@ osa@@ sis failed in the ru@@ ins of the river , thereby bringing the influx into the sea , where he was left to the ocean of the ocean .
at this time , Mr Albertini was the same so@@ e as the South @-@ F@@ East , and rivers and oceans are likely to be much further than the internal land currently .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us is a truly significant , as it is fully covered by a po@@ ison@@ ous sk@@ in , while it has also remained a triple @-@ dimensional , while maintaining the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal is now almost identical to the same age .
in order to rebuild this , there is a great deal of imagination - it is enough to make it possible to build a label and that it seems to be a s@@ le@@ ep . &quot;
the crisis was the time when there were huge two search@@ es on the ground in the countryside - he@@ tero@@ gene@@ ous .
although the ro@@ ck of all King Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ ons lived for millions of years later than in Boeing , it could be ast@@ ounded by some of its predecess@@ ors .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ pe@@ ro@@ ur@@ us , 38 foot@@ wear ( 1@@ 1.5 metres ) and six tonnes of weigh@@ ed mon@@ ster .
researchers whose recent findings have been published in the magaz@@ ine Bi@@ ology , believe that Boeing has been inva@@ ded after death in the sea , and this mu@@ ti@@ lation .
on 21 March 2011 , Mr Mc@@ Mur@@ ray was discovered on 21 March 2011 , when he used the mining of Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um in the North Alber@@ tas Mc@@ Mur@@ ray .
according to the Mu@@ use@@ um , it is the most vulnerable in the world in the world , including sk@@ in and soya , and this is a comprehensive concentration of up to pu@@ mps .
these are on average 18 years ( five metres ) , and the very long @-@ old , up to 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .

how does the act found the answer to the question of &apos; today &apos; .
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll was a complete shock .
just a day after the trip to New York travel , this storm , by the end of St@@ Lou@@ ically resident , is going to travel to a fixed @-@ up @-@ up site , on Facebook .
he was not in addition to the post @-@ school com@@ pil@@ ation of their own schools .
there was a letter : &apos; police killing just 18 years &apos; , and he is still in the street . &quot;
he was in the mess why someone else was not informed about his flow to postal , which is why he closed the Facebook and opened Twitter .
P@@ ide@@ ally @ The@@ e@@ P@@ ow@@ ah had several times on his line on the lines of his time .
Mr St@@ , the region from the region from the region , which has been sent back in real time , with the death of Mr Bro@@ w@@ ni , the death of 18 @-@ year @-@ old people , who killed Fer@@ gus@@ on Mis@@ s@@ our@@ in , who killed the white police officer in Fer@@ gus@@ on .
he gave a picture of Bro@@ w@@ ni living in a poor , which in the street , in a street , which is to be held out of four hours .
&quot; this is cra@@ zy , &apos; it was a cra@@ zy &apos; .
however , death was not a new one for his or her community .
he has made its phone , but it saw later this evening , which said this time to the Conference of the people of Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
the pho@@ tos of photo@@ graph@@ s in the police and the frigh@@ tening people , and man who claimed themselves to be the father of Bro@@ w@@ ni and keep a label of the &apos; Fer@@ ber police &apos; , were killed by my weapon in the case of the Fer@@ ber police . &quot;
he reviewed real @-@ time flows where the police officer was faced by the group of protest@@ ors .
in the second video , the second police officer , said that he said , and pota@@ to : &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; . &apos;
the Fer@@ cian remember how he struck itself from thought : &apos; it is unusual . &apos;
&quot; this is not a murder of this kind , which we are used to and what we could call a typical &apos; . &apos;
I felt that at the moment , I was horri@@ fied .
I was ang@@ ry and I was afraid . &apos;
he boo@@ ked the return of the flight and went home on the next day .
in writing . - ( FR ) Mr President , at 23 , he went to her to his six @-@ year ty@@ rel , and decided that they will travel next morning with Fer@@ gus@@ oni .
what the Fer@@ cian and Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ every three years took place in the next three years is the key issue in the new docu@@ mentary document , &apos; W@@ ho@@ lean street &apos; in the &apos; W@@ ho@@ lean street &apos; ? &apos; ( &apos; My street today &apos; ) , which is turning back on 11 August .
this is the story of survival and prote@@ sted , love and loss of love , strength and resilience , from the point of view of those people who live in this community and who have responded to the answer .
if Mrs Ferreira , together with the ty@@ rant , who had a li@@ p stic@@ ker , and it is a suitable kro@@ on , a Fer@@ gus@@ oni sis@@ ter , who spoke again on the subject that they had before this morning many times before , and the living conditions in the past , and the conditions of living .
&quot; if I taught you how the whole community had to fight for their rights ? &apos; recalls himself in question .
&quot; we are at the moment in Fer@@ gus@@ oni , because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I did not have her to take it , &apos; said Mr Ferreira later .
&quot; what is happening now is the case in the past ... in the past .
it must be aware of this and to see it in mid @-@ term .
he must learn from a activist and organisation of the activist and , at the same time , feel the different la@@ yers of experience and living conditions , and what we need to do to be free and free .
even if I succeed in raising him so that it is not a person who has been bru@@ tally beaten against racism , it is not a small girl from another square girl .
I feel that I would like to make a dis@@ service to him if I would defend him for the world . &quot;
the first stop that they made by Mr Fer@@ gus@@ oni was the South Na@@ is@@ san@@ ti on the road - a police officer in the ice area , which was a kind of kind of camp , where the activists were waiting for news of the police officer , Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not charged by the end of the accus@@ ation .
there was a call for the initiative , and his da@@ u@@ ghter , the power of the local business , who prepared the south of the South .
they put food bags and helped to share these protests .
for the Fer@@ weapon , there was slow to take shape for a new type of activist .
&quot; my activist change fully after 9 August , &quot; said he said that when he was a Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ le , he was a student from a girl , he was a student from the President of the Union and focused on food justice and health inequalities in communities .
&quot; I did not have any experience of organisation .
that is all simply a shame . &apos;
at the end of the week , Mrs Ferreira would have one film @-@ spon@@ sor Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ every .
the Fo@@ lay@@ I said that his and film operator Lucas Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o wanted to document what is just happening .
the question of Mr Fer@@ rel@@ li was the question : &apos; do you try to docu@@ mentary or find a story that can be used ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases of cases where people - often painful - will come to the community and are trying to benefit from this formula and resilience .
the Fo@@ lay@@ I explained in a recent interview : &apos; we have heard that the voice of Fer@@ gus@@ on and the increase in people &apos;s voice will not be heard and we wanted to do this differently . &quot;
the Fo@@ lay@@ I has already had the hands of the D@@ am@@ s Da@@ v@@ ga , an artificial image of the region , who was known as a prisoner of prisoners who have been sentenced to death .
its involvement made the project closer to the Fer@@ cian , and yet six other local ones , whose film &apos; W@@ ho@@ ho@@ ta@@ ets &apos; and a team after the shooting of Bro@@ w@@ ni have been tra@@ pped for years .
&quot; this docu@@ mentary is not talking about us or with us , but we are talking about our ourselves , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; for me , it was important for me how these people are portra@@ yed , because I am also perceived . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rel@@ s - to show that the movement is not a &apos; organ &apos; , but a community of the community &apos; , as the Fo@@ lay@@ an - it was the most open part of his film .
as a result , the &apos; W@@ ho@@ lean street &apos; is documented ? &apos; , a surpris@@ ingly personal aspect of the life of Fer@@ rel@@ y , such as the ra@@ ft and the execution of his wife .
&quot; I felt that , as I would be like , &apos; said , Mr Ferreira &apos; said , when he was ready for the town of the town .
&quot; however , I realised that the human trafficking of this work and the human trafficking of people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the Fer@@ cian &apos;s story emphasises and reiterates the role of L@@ GB@@ T Women &apos;s role in the wider Black Sea , Mr Mat@@ ter mobile .
two of the three initi@@ ators of the movement of the social media in the case of the killing of teen@@ ag@@ ers Tra@@ y@@ von Mar@@ tini in 2012 in the social media in the wake of the death of H@@ y@@ von Mar@@ tini , Mr Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter , is homo@@ sexual .
&quot; in a leading role , homo@@ sexual women have kept the movement in general , &apos; said Ferreira , &apos; and this is precisely because we constantly need to fight on several fronts .
Roma women must bear the burden of homo@@ sexual women across the board . &quot;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed , noting that &apos; the movement is truly in life in a life @-@ to @-@ life situation by women and many of them have be@@ aches &apos; homosexu@@ als &apos; .
he claims that &apos; it is not a kind of type of opportunity to create a kind of equal opportunity &apos; - the Fer@@ rel@@ li was not elected for his identity because of his identity .
&quot; he was a person , one of whom is the right energy , &apos; he said .
&quot; however , this is not a coincidence that he was held directly on the line , because there is a great deal at stake at the level of homo@@ sexual female women in the game .
his energy can be perceived by the scre@@ ens . &quot;
at the same time , the news camer@@ as , Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ ist , has long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
in the wake of a statement by Fer@@ rel@@ le , the punishment imposed on the blocking of the road is still over 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region , which it calls on to be home , simply &apos; a massive threat &apos; .
however , it still needs to be an important man@@ tra , which has been fed by the memory of the past since the Fer@@ gus@@ oni streets of Fer@@ gus@@ oni .
&quot; our duty is to combat our freedom .
our duty is to win .
we have to love each other and support .
we do not have to lose anything about our chains . &quot;
7 ni@@ ps , how after We@@ ek@@ graph lea@@ k over the We@@ ek@@ le
some of the hen@@ s are going to find a b@@ read@@ ers after a scarce pi@@ pe , so that we are suffering from this , too .
or in the light of the word &apos; brain hun@@ t &apos; , the py@@ d@@ shot &apos; .
however , this is only an inevitable postponement and a decent good for health .
what do you do to do so , after today and tomorrow &apos;s We@@ ek@@ graph - or other pi@@ les - to be better felt this morning , and to get it as painful as possible ?
Jo@@ o water .
in the case of Al@@ p@@ an , and after a great deal this morning ... or if possible , even instead of alcohol .
as a body loses a lot of liquids on alcohol , it will have to be back in any way .
together with water , mineral substances and sta@@ p are also a good practice of mineral water .
as a matter of time is often frustra@@ ted , then it is particularly good if it comes to the soil , or just a qu@@ an@@ ched .
that is to be done .
certainly , it would not be paid to bo@@ y to the old trees - that may prove to be fatal to the wrong decision .
however , it is easy to remember the physical course of the poor once again that the feeling is alive .
bet@@ ting and s@@ lee@@ ping in the bo@@ gus and bu@@ ried people are a more @-@ time @-@ consuming way of life .
it is gradually going back to the poor energy and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are going to go on yesterday &apos;s over@@ shoo@@ t , it will certainly not be able to try to download a high level of fat .
for example , in the wake of the ref@@ urb@@ ishment of the flo@@ til@@ la , in which the lion &apos;s ca@@ ter can remain silent on the markets .
if the health of the South is already suffering , we could try , for example .
and a little later .
in order to avoid a coff@@ ee .
it will be free from the latest release of a body of water .
as has already been said : water and volumes are friends .
let us make a blind eye on mal@@ si@@ ts .
if you were to prevent pain from this evening , it needs to be dealt with in addition to alcohol as well as the mo@@ di@@ ph@@ orus , or it will lose the way in which it is caught .
both the ri@@ ches and in the future will continue to be a po@@ pp@@ y worse .
in addition , it will not be a blind eye on the whole of tuna , even though long .
if you go on this morning , the way to which you can do so is a blan@@ k che@@ que - that is irri@@ tating with the already ro@@ sy ma@@ cks .
or if a partner is not to take it well , it can be done well .
around the same way , it is just like wal@@ king out , but in the foot@@ wear it cannot be used .
however , in order to avoid an overly active pace and hand@@ ful shops , the physical effort should be moder@@ ately .
a jo@@ ke .
the talk of the friends of the friends of the time , the road to simple h@@ ut@@ ts and a na@@ era friendly , both for itself and for other ( suffering ) .
the N@@ ali and na@@ er may not be squ@@ ee@@ zed , but it is certainly a result of them that they have a more se@@ am@@ less battle .
once again , a po@@ cket is going to happen anyway !
Professor of profes@@ sors and Ox@@ ford University of A@@ w@@ ester@@ n are being sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , the professor and Ox@@ ford University of W@@ w@@ ester@@ n University , who have received suspects after death row , have been sought by the police , and the staff of Ox@@ ford University , who have received suspects of death row in Ch@@ ic@@ ago .
according to the C@@ oo@@ k rural document , on Monday , on Monday , there were 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i , and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i , accused of his alleged presence in the first instance of their alleged in@@ consistency , because of their alleged presence in T@@ ren@@ ton H. James Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u .
according to documents , the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u has died in the wake of a recur@@ rence .
according to a warning to the community of Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s police officer , on 27 July , the death penalty was discovered on 27 July .
police officers received a phone and found the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house and arri@@ vals for the victim , whose physical was a number of stor@@ ms .
according to officials , the Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u event was killed and investi@@ g@@ ators on prostitution , while the police seek to actively engage in two suspects .
they have worked as co @-@ profes@@ sors of micro@@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n since 2007 .
Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations Ala@@ n K@@ K@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , the Vice @-@ President of the University of the universities , said that Mrs La@@ os has now been temporarily removed from the work and has been banned from entering the town of the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n .
&quot; this is now the case with the competent authorities of the competent authorities and the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n is working with researchers , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
Mr W@@ arre@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant of Ox@@ ford University .
the Commission &apos;s representative of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said : &apos; we have been in the Community with the British police and the US research authorities in every way possible to help the US research authorities . &quot;
in addition , the statement stated that War@@ ren@@ i &apos;s colleagues are shocked and willing to give itself out .
Mr An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , the Chair of the Committee on Communications in Ch@@ ic@@ ago , is urging the authorities to give the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are present , but we are dealing with the exact location of the exact location , &apos; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , the suspects will help to seek the suspects , regional , regional and national authorities .
the G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police received a phone by the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house , who had just had a cry@@ p@@ tic rain that , in order to repeat , there has been something .
according to the police describe it , it was a specta@@ cle .
the G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July .
he said that the safety camer@@ as in the building of the La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i stay in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ mil and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the Grand Pla@@ za leadership sent a letter to the people : &quot; the police work at the moment of events and the background of the victim &apos;s background , and examines the different mo@@ tives , including the possibility that this was a family dispute . &quot;
companies that help your businesses to avoid the next U@@ b@@ would
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure their e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups for workers &apos; satisfaction , but surveys were materi@@ alised .
the answers were often vague , useless or even worse .
and even if he promised to guarantee anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system simply was not consistent and objective , &apos; said the Er@@ re@@ tt , who is responsible for the sale of e @-@ commerce in the Car@@ ison Re@@ ps in San Franc@@ is@@ co@@ s , who is working with 75 workers in San Franc@@ is@@ co .
he therefore called on non @-@ external persons .
we are dealing with the new types of human resources , which will help businesses to identify what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software , which is determined to measure the involvement of workers , they will allow companies to make a step @-@ up to the polls , to take firm teams and demographic groups , to provide the anon@@ y@@ mity and the number of complaints to the workers , and in some cases to allow manufacturers to by@@ pass C @-@ level leaders and turn directly to the Bureau .
&quot; now there are such tools as the Stra@@ our and F@@ it@@ er , which is intended to monitor health , but where F@@ it@@ er is the company &apos;s own company , Mr Bar@@ net@@ is , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O Reding , the G@@ lin@@ t of the City of G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ sts use companies to measure the inclusion of workers .
the Er@@ ret@@ ti said he has received three years when he has used the G@@ lin@@ ti , a much better overview of what the workers think and feel .
in addition to the surveys and calls for more robust teams , it offers a company &apos;s heat card , which gives an overview of what parts of the departments are most concerned and whose leaders are the lowest support , allowing it to identify the reasons .
companies have begun to realise that they have to stay aware of their work culture , so as not to become the next U@@ b@@ would , which has been insur@@ moun@@ ted in scandals since the former employee published a blo@@ g , which described the environment , which was sentenced to those who dare to take the floor .
for such start @-@ ups , such as the G@@ lin@@ t , a desire for a business is an opportunity for the business .
the global management , regulation and conformity area can be in line with the L@@ et &apos;s website of the &quot; Ro@@ HS &quot; on financial management , in order to be worth more than â¬ 17.@@ 7 billion by 2020 .
Den@@ ver@@ is Col@@ or@@ ad@@ os acting in the first cent of the start @-@ ups , which will help businesses to prevent and identify un@@ suitable behaviour , noted in the light of the un@@ questionable reputation of the U@@ b@@ ber , in this year .
there are almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
the U@@ ber register has recently registered themselves .
as the G@@ lin@@ ter , the L@@ LP will allow companies to send a tailor @-@ made impul@@ se , to collect real @-@ time confidential answers and look at the problem of heat cards .
it also offers anon@@ ymous messages , which will allow workers to be informed about their un@@ suitable behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive , complaints are going directly to the Bureau .
&quot; the public opinion has been carried out by the regulators , &quot; said , the President of the Centre and CE@@ O Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan .
the Qu@@ in@@ lan said that , if the company treats its workers badly or in@@ eth@@ ically , the company may face serious consequences , such as the boycott of consumers , the exclusion of workers and cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not interfere .
Mr Ru@@ by , the restaur@@ ant , which has more than 25 000 workers , has been used to be cen@@ sored more than a year in order to ensure that workers &apos; awareness of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way for relations with the headquarters of the company .
if the employee wanted to notify the problem , he had to find a telephone number of a corpor@@ ation headquarters , or to ask for an official complaint , and hope that it will be taken seriously .
it was often a deterrent and in@@ convenient process , said Mr Vit@@ ran@@ o , who said , who said that there was no good way to monitor the complaints of workers .
it is now possible for the company to be cen@@ sored , but it is possible to deal with problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices that did not reach the lead in other towns or states , in order to identify more quickly and deal with in offices in other towns or states .
&quot; I will be able to get closer to the positive experience of the workers , &quot; Mr Vit@@ ran@@ o , who is headed by the Ru@@ by @-@ by @-@ government group .
&quot; and we defend our shareholders for liti@@ gation workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies started a ethical behaviour , values and the involvement of workers more seriously in 2002 , following the fact that the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen has failed in relation to ethical infringements , as a result of the scandal in the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
but only when the social media became mature &apos; , the companies that they are unable to prevent their b@@ reat@@ h on the web online .
&quot; before the use of the technology to monitor the ethical behaviour of the technology , people used as a strategy , &apos; he said .
both the G@@ lin@@ t and the Conver@@ gence Fund provide their software as a service , by companies having a perio@@ dic fee for the use of their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity that has a venture to guarantee capital investors who have been based on both start @-@ ups .
in February 10 million dollars , such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and the Customs Capital Federation , were cen@@ sored by the Member State concerned , thereby increasing USD 47 million .
in November 10 million were invested in B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , by increasing the total funding of the company by 60 million to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise when taking into account the links between companies , culture and venture capital .
more research shows that modern workers are waiting for more than ever .
competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ are Val@@ ley , are high wages and interesting projects only on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued , and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy with a company , they feel they are heard and that the work they do is satis@@ fying , they are more committed to ensuring the success of a company , &apos; Mr Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , who is a general benefit and the Vice @-@ President of the Labour Party , L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , which uses both the so @-@ called &apos; and G@@ lin@@ t &apos; .
investors earn revenue if their own portfolio companies are doing well ; businesses are doing well if workers are committed and involved .
if the third @-@ party analytical tool allows us to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , we do not have these support .
the possession of data on the inclusion of workers is important , according to the expertise of the professional culture .
however , these data are useless if the supervisory authorities in the company are not going to do anything .
in fact , if a company asks for feedback from its employees , expectations are expected to change .
and if changes are not enough quickly or not , it may cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask about 4 000 proposals , you must be prepared to conver@@ ge 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &apos; said &apos; Con@@ sul@@ tative International President R@@ us@@ re@@ en International President R@@ us@@ hen@@ e &apos; , who has seen how companies are making a mistake to rely on the collection of data .
&quot; because if things do not go until the end , then workers think : &apos; do you actually have taken me heard ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I pay care ? &apos;
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Mad@@ ison Re@@ e@@ l , who is now organising six studies , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem is reported by the G@@ lin@@ ter .
and , after the speed of decision @-@ making and communication on the quality of the quality , it was possible to have a number of teams to restructure and provide a number of teams to address the issues of communication training .
however , in the case of the Ru@@ by @-@ by @-@ Office , the new data on workers will be collected , and it is hoped that in the long term , it will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in the industry , which is known as of its high level of labour flows .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &apos; Mr Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose your customers .
and if you lose your customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
the euro area of the euro area is the Baltic Sea : income grow fast
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic Sea , three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of Western Europe , wri@@ tes B@@ SE &apos;s report on the European Central Bank &apos;s report .
according to the ECB , the overall output of the economy from 1999 is in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the success of this is a low debt burden , a rapid improvement of the institutions and business @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States in one of Slovakia are among the countries of the euro area , where there has been a significant focus on the EU &apos;s central focus on the purchase of reactors in the purchasing power of the euro area . &quot;
while the aim is to ensure that the overall output of the economy is equal to the Western Europe of Western Europe , in 2015 , the overall production of the Baltic economies was just 2 / 3 15 from the average of 15 countries , which was the average of the European Union before the enlargement cycle of 2004 .
low wages have led to a better pay for foreign countries .
although the European Central Bank sees Baltic States in a positive light , and the economy is growing , the local population will not be enthusiastic about this year .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was a little less than half of those who were inter@@ viewed .
N@@ CA@@ A decision to remove two times a day in the light of the trends in the Bru@@ ges days .
at the moment , almost 23 is almost 23 , when the bluefin tuna fund is the main blow to the opening of a team of universities in the University of University of S@@ C@@ L@@ A .
some of them have placed a burden on the company , reve@@ aling the efforts of the first day of their tre@@ ach .
for a large part of the team , these will be a stand@@ by of the middle day .
the participants in the course of the Kur@@ ds are going to go back to the tri@@ alogues , after a three @-@ hour trend , to learn from the tri@@ alogues , before returning to at 6.@@ 30 meetings this morning at 6.@@ 30 meetings next morning .
&quot; the following three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Bru@@ in@@ si , Jim Mor@@ a , before the day of Monday .
the decision of the N@@ CA@@ A to cancel the burden on players in order to reduce the burden of players a day is , in fact , a day of longer change - at least until one half of the final coin on Friday .
for this reason , three of the first three years of office was launched by the U@@ C@@ L@@ A , in order to fit the already close timetable for players .
the transition to a single day is a day @-@ to @-@ day basis , more than the beginning of the Bru@@ in@@ si camp , the beginning of the last few days in comparison with the previous season , and for the first time in Mor@@ a six of the W@@ es@@ tw@@ l season .
they are up to 18 % of the 18 trends before it begins in September , before the official preparation begins in T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M @-@ D .
according to Mr N@@ CA@@ A , he has been in favour of the change of the N@@ CA@@ A , although it adds another item on players &apos; partners .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they break themselves with this challenge ; they are trying to make them a great young people .
I believe that when coming Saturday and we have more time , it is a truly few . &quot;
if the camp is closed , the U@@ C@@ L@@ A work@@ ings are closed , which is not a simple task , given the clear view of their expulsion and the centre of the L@@ us@@ kin@@ i centre , a high @-@ class hotel that has already esca@@ ped from a football shel@@ l from the ro@@ cks of a football shel@@ f .
from this weekend , the Bru@@ in@@ si player , but Mor@@ a admitted that the problems may arise during the season for free tobacco .
&quot; we implement security measures , said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real concern and it is not exagg@@ erated to think that people may have a number of to@@ ken and co@@ aches fil@@ tered .
if you have recorded the record , it can make it quite a good deal .
however , we are using and on 8 par@@ king a safety team .
we will do our best using the best .
I will try to be particularly concerned about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the European Union , which was born to the central party , Mr Sa@@ gi@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , the Democratic Union , has been thrown out by Kris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ as and the ECB , to re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish the forces of the creative business@@ men and the parties to be held in the gallery , to be able to show the idea of the electoral union of business@@ men in Tallinn - it seems that there is at least as much as the political parties created in national politics on the initiative of the young people , at least as much as political parties .
however , in the autumn , and the key issue will be whether they will be sufficiently disappointed with the voters .

if a small country has fallen to the support of the Ed@@ gar Sa@@ gi@@ are , it can anticipate his election of the events organised by the Union .
one of the members of the country , some former and current central players , and many of the most unknown examples - is that the membership of the election union ?
and can there be no reason why , in Tallinn , a few Sa@@ gi@@ are fai@@ th@@ ful to the gu@@ es@@ ts and friends of the Sa@@ in@@ are , may look for the list of companies &apos; Sa@@ gi@@ are , which is , at the forefront of corruption and corruption , is becoming a reality , and it is becoming a reality ?

there are probably also those who openly welcome the television experience at the beginning , but at the end of the day - even though it is reluc@@ tantly - for the television and advertise@@ ments .

Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
media publications quo@@ tes President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who said that the new US immigration plan , which makes the Green Card rules .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year by 50 000 people per year , stricter rules on temporary employment visas and restrictions on family orientation .
the new rules have proposed the re@@ public@@ s and the President will support them .
the draft legislation will be discussed in the two chamber in the Chamber .
&quot; this law reduces poverty , increases the wages and savings of billions of dollars on taxpayers &apos; money , as it makes the way in which the other citizens of the US are issuing green maps with other countries .
the law will reduce the chain of migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process will provide an advantage for candidates who speak English and who have financial resources to support and skills that come to our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ m American media publications according to the United States .

in the village of H@@ ai@@ da , Mr Pi@@ ho , H@@ ai@@ da , a local to Ja@@ ga , who has spoken to her family sites in Si@@ beria .
the archa@@ ic culture of Si@@ b@@ erian , which is still being maintained , will also affect the home , because it is simply embarras@@ sing , the most closely thought @-@ out would have been investigated by Pi@@ ho M@@ are .
his first research trip to Si@@ beria will be passed for 30 years this year .
during this time , there has been 14 times and has lived there for one year .
how much did it went to Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century , in order to get the land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8@@ 0,000 .
I have taken note of the talk of Si@@ b@@ erian men who , too , have thought about this .
it is difficult to say , because at the time , one group could come up to 30 people , but the passport was only a man .
the passport was only one of one , but it was children , nur@@ ses and the Russians .
look at how much this territory was here .
this was a number of times more historic .
after all , it was necessary to educate , in any way .
S@@ et@@ ud came here as a be@@ dro@@ y , but their life change , because they were in the regions that were not only linked to agriculture but also in the river ( pal@@ par@@ king ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , the New Pet@@ ser@@ t went a series of dozens later to work in a secret city of K@@ ras@@ no@@ x @-@ 45 ( where the Soviet power were built on uranium enrichment - J. P@@ . ) , when it was formed .
is there a majority in the region at the time of the majority of the population ?
yes , they lived in a ro@@ gue .
in addition , a long tradition , too , has a long tradition of mar@@ ry , and a lot of children .
seven @-@ eight children were normal .
how much the culture of Si@@ b@@ erian nur@@ ses and differs from that of the mother tongue ?
they are different , although what was said here was never the same .
they brought a great deal of political ideas .
they did , too , also ( the shadow ideas ) , but they always made a distinction between what was made and what was done here .
climate change has been severely affected by the traditional ri@@ in@@ ism , because it is a me@@ tre .
the changes have been made .
for example , S@@ et@@ oma@@ al meat was a warm , but it is just a freeze .
where the Si@@ b@@ erian villages and what live there are living there ? / graphic : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ends
the mother tongue was highly strong , it was considered very important .
it seems to me that it is now going to give it back to the Se@@ ad@@ land , to influence them .
these girls who have lived here in families have listened to ama@@ zing stories .
the Pi@@ ho must bear in mind the people of the Estonian delegation who came at the beginning of July in H@@ ai@@ da , the Kingdom of K@@ ai@@ da , and the four days in homes - J. P .
that is what is happening here , it is a disgrace .
&quot; it is easy to come , and also to go , because the city is an excellent location : the railway chain , and roads at the crossroads of roads , says T@@ ap@@ e @-@ oper@@ is@@ ol@@ ol@@ ol@@ ol@@ is@@ al Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a great deal of hope , sport and culture , and a car@@ rot can every year .

the water of the river can be regarded as a long way , and simply to do a ro@@ man@@ tic to do - can flow from the river , and to think about life and want to do so .
I have also been able to get my own feet there .
the O@@ oper@@ is@@ ol@@ ol@@ ol@@ ol@@ ist Tam@@ m has been the case of the three eyes of the river , in the case of three bridges between us , and that it is a place in the town of the town , no one may be opposed to any of the things that I say &apos; .
&apos;@@ M@@ Ã¤n@@ y@@ mÃ¤@@ ki will be a wonderful look at T@@ ap@@ le &apos; , but there are also health professionals where there can be a drink , winter and , for example , in the case of the gol@@ f , it has been done , a gol@@ f journey has been made , the re@@ bels can be borro@@ wed by sports from sports . &quot; , the Re@@ ig@@ o .

the rules for the treatment of genetically modified crops must be clear
the French Ministry of residence sent a draft law on the environment of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and the draft law on plant protection products .
the amendment to the law is not being abandoned , as well as the creation of a separate data collection for the crops of the products of GM ( GM ) , in the future to be used for plant health records .
in addition , GM crops are being used and the obligation to have prior agreement on the radio ap@@ ic@@ ulture and the person concerned .
while at the moment , Estonia does not increase the cultivation of genetically modified crops , we need to consider clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non @-@ GM crops .
at least , at least , until there is no decision @-@ making of Estonia to declare GMO @-@ free GMOs , the Dutch Department of Health , S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , the World Health Department .
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , to take into account the costs and administrative burden of both private and public sectors , in the annex to the annex .
the draft law repe@@ als the data collection and treatment of GMOs in the case of GM crops and operators in the field of treatment and treatment of GM crops , lays down the requirements for the treatment of GM crops and the establishment of an economic activity .
@-@ specific with regard to the current commitment to the cultivation of GM crops , the current obligation to inform bee@@ keepers of the cultivation of GM crops is to be able to achieve an appropriate agreement with the bee@@ keepers before raising the agreement .
the draft law has been sent to the Ministry of Coordination .
all interested parties have the opportunity to examine the draft information system and wish to present their opinion on the world &apos;s Ministry of residence .
the amendments will affect those who are active in the area of plant farming , bee@@ keepers and agricultural agencies .
in the European Union , including Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10 .
so far , no Estonian farmer has been able to increase the cultivation of GM crops .
the reason is that , in Estonia , there are no personal harassment , the European Observatory on the media , which is a ma@@ gic line with which mon 8@@ 10 resistant .
it is also the case for the southern regions of the South , and that is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
in order to obtain security , the Ministry of residence in 2015 has commissioned research into a possible presence of GM , maize and soya vari@@ eties in Estonia to detect the seeds of GM , maize and soya vari@@ eties in Estonia .
the results of the sam@@ ples have shown that the seeds were not included in the seeds , and the study concluded that , in Estonia , the seeds of maize , maize and soya vari@@ eties do not contain genetically modified organisms .
in turn , it can be concluded that Estonia is not aware of the cultivation of genetically modified crops and also confirmed that no accident has been taken .

the white house of the White House went to taxpayers for thousands of
according to a letter of public military documents announced in the press , the White House &apos;s decision to flight helicop@@ ter helicop@@ ter last month to the European Year of America to give taxpayers a price of USD 24 000 .
the green and white col@@ ours S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D @-@ 3@@ D , which is called the &apos; President of the T@@ D@@ D &apos; , was a central indication of the event that took place on 17 July in Val@@ ille Ma@@ needed on 17 July .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ f , Vice @-@ President M@@ ike , and the White House of the White House , were reported by the higher officials in the field of industrial products from all 50 countries .
Sky@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ tis built helicop@@ ters , particularly in the name of the image of the street , W@@ is@@ con@@ us , who has come from a fire @-@ fighting car and Mis@@ m@@ ood .
the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ r@@ ck , the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ r@@ er , responsible for the operation of the H@@ eli@@ Cop@@ ter , has called for a White House to carry out the presence of the C@@ F@@ AR@@ G@@ O @-@ T to a hand@@ ful of the T@@ F@@ AR@@ G@@ O @-@ ga , the presence of F@@ AR@@ G@@ O @-@ ga 36 hours prior to the hor@@ ror in the south @-@ south of the event of the &apos; unusual &apos; event .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is unusual to have a great deal of attention , &apos; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 kom@@ com@@ Ã¶@@ r Day before the event in the case of e @-@ mail , the leading officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
the message was stated that helicop@@ ter arri@@ ves in the south of 17 July this morning , at 15 July , at 15 July , and will remain in the event until the clock at the same evening , between 18 and 21 .
it was the fact that , when the departure of the H@@ ine@@ est Maj@@ est is to be , there is a need for the time of restrictions on the time of time to be re@@ opened .
the original flight team was at the event of helicop@@ ter at the event of helicop@@ ter and the security team in the middle of an aircraft near the whole of its entire ground over the time .
it was not possible to read out of the documents that have been given to the time of time , whether or not you have had the second time , or not .
the H@@ at@@ ch law prohibits the federal workers to use the government &apos;s property for political purposes .
the documents show that the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 survey can be breached by this event .
&quot; we are talking about whether this is a breach of H@@ at@@ ch law , and we were told that no ri@@ ce , &apos; wrote a com@@ man@@ ner .
&quot; it seems that you have no choice , &apos; the leading victim &apos;s Deputy Prime Guard &apos; .
the White House announced a formal event in America and the H@@ at@@ ch Act would not have been covered by the H@@ at@@ ch Act .
however , even in official events , there are political areas .
the President supported the health reform efforts in the Senate at the time in the Senate and approved the efforts to prevent the government &apos;s regulations in danger .
the use of a &apos; One or Air Force &apos; , known as a &apos; One or Air Force &apos; , is not a new phenomenon for a politically profitable purpose .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use these purely photo@@ graph@@ s is unusual .
in February , it would focus on the point of view of the day of his first campaign at the University of Re@@ ports in Flor@@ idas Mel@@ bour@@ ne , as well as by Twitter from the messages that complain about how his predecessor , the President of his predecessor , used the flight of his predecessor .
&apos;@@ The Ma@@ tal Ma@@ ker is very pleased to put forward &apos; in America &apos; in America , where products were represented from all 50 states , which have been prepared by American workers in the American material , &apos; the White House &apos;s press officer , and Mr Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams are often going to be around Washington around and the south of the South , so as to make it easier to get the US President of the white house of a lo@@ ck@@ ery of the cen@@ tri@@ ary of the United States .
if T@@ ru@@ m July at the beginning of July Germany , the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House was organised by the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House .
it was said that the flight was considered to be a number of flights in America for the flight of the &apos; catch @-@ up crew &apos; in America .
in Es@@ t@@ ad@@ er helicop@@ ter , it was not only 11 hours of the &apos; President @-@ in @-@ Office &apos; on the day in addition to 11 hours &apos; .
according to the White House , none of the other forms of this event have been burdened by the death of the taxpayer .
according to the S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky representative , the company was not involved in organising helicop@@ ter on the south of the South .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 does not maintain the precise costs of the flights and events caused by the President of the President of the President .
however , at an end of the cost of the Ministry of Defence , the V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D allowance for the financial year @-@ 3@@ D is estimated at USD 24 380 per hour .
the Es@@ t@@ ad@@ er &apos;s documents were pointed out for a long @-@ term basis for the Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o flight of Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , both on the basis of the main base of a flight to Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a on both sides of the Sea .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using helicop@@ ter is very much below this amount .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; costs is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates include a number of non @-@ irreversible costs for staff , care and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account in the annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 @-@ 2015 survey , compensation rates for staff costs are not included in the Ministry of Defence , but they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former press representative of the White House Se@@ an S@@ tu@@ er defended the use of helicop@@ ter at a time in the event .
&quot; the idea is to show the things that were made in America this week , &apos; said S@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ ti State is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there is expected hundreds of hundreds if not even thousands of people who depend on this .
and I believe that just as the majority of the Americans , we are all proud of this helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the T@@ ru@@ m ca@@ ter in the south of the event in the south of the event , with helicop@@ ters , or not , but the fire @-@ fighting fire on the ro@@ l of him .
in the White Ma@@ t , T@@ ru@@ m S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky representatives , he@@ ars about media don@@ ations and on the products of a company in his personal aircraft in the form of his personal aircraft .

after 2013 Moscow M@@ M@@ il became a pione@@ er in the schedu@@ les of the year after the visit to the Estonian Re@@ ports .
two years later , he received the Beijing M@@ M@@ il 15 , and he was in the Olympic spirit , but it was more than a great deal of ath@@ le@@ tes .
in the light of the g@@ loom@@ y class , the Holo@@ domor was not just a soil if it did not start a letter from the Amsterdam E@@ mb@@ assy in the first place .
I would just like to put a single deal of time in order to put together a single regime .
one time , you spra@@ yed Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
worse , there were still more than a month later : the contest for his Olympic contest was already in the first barrier to the country in Ri@@ os .
the time has come to be taken - is there to continue to do so in a seven @-@ free country ?
is the two days of effort that are still worthy of all ?
there was a long time , but it took peace .
I have got to think about it .
this experience is relatively difficult to describe , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time to be a healthy cure and to think about it .
&quot; I knew that I am not going to say a lot about the slogan , speaks of his self @-@ friend@@ liness of the Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
I received a clean front and to go ahead with the new season .
in writing . - ( FR ) O@@ ther , Mrs Anne Nag@@ gi , it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the suffering , but it has realised that , above all , spor@@ ts@@ people themselves have to find themselves out .

it was difficult to tolerate this .
&apos;@@ G@@ ood , however , said that he does not give him and he wants to prove what he deserves &apos; , says mountain .
there is now some sort of peace .
he is doing so to joy .
the contest came back in May , when the G@@ Ã¶t@@ z@@ ka was set up a new Estonian Re@@ cras@@ hes in G@@ Ã¶t@@ z@@ ka , a new Estonian re@@ ba@@ te .
at a high level of competition , he has improved a personal excellence in a number of me@@ ters ( 13.@@ 89 ) and drink a lo@@ opho@@ le in record time .
then there was a great deal of competition , so that it is not at all levels , but has been removed only by the first con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy of hunger .
for years , he has been instru@@ cted to remember that Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o is a university .
he is ready to be a spor@@ ts@@ man , he is a good training .
if something is wrong , it is going to say it immediately .
he feels that he is a bad and tr@@ usted one .
that is what we must follow .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we follow it .
the new approach has also been found .
&quot; I am not one who is predi@@ cting the maximum , it speaks and say that the most important thing is to get the right thing , because it will also ensure a good result .
I am happy to see the baby &apos;s baby bo@@ p .
the good emo@@ tion has also been offered by the Å @@ ade@@ i@@ ko@@ u .
both his former Training , Mar@@ in Nag@@ k , was recently received by the grand@@ parents , and there has been a lot of new weather citizens support from the past , and there has become a lot of support from the citizens .
&quot; I have been quite interesting , &apos; say Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
one alcohol , drinking , is tanta@@ mount to &apos; training &apos; .
the Li@@ ves@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is a father of a great wine beau@@ ty , that it believes that the wine can be trained better than any other in the world .
the Car@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist University of Y@@ ale .
his message is not a matter of alcohol or in the way that it affects our feelings and ideas , but instead of &apos; a very active &apos; wine &apos; process .
in the light of the Council , the wine @-@ producing complexity of the wine , it enjoyed and in the perce@@ ive of the taste of our work , so that we can create a wine taste .
according to the She@@ per@@ di , there is no fact that there is a taste in the place , but a taste of the way in which wine is stimu@@ lated .
he will bring about a comparison of how you see &apos; col@@ ours &apos; .
&apos;@@ Ma@@ k is not in wine , taste for wine &apos; , says She@@ per@@ d .
what is happening to the wine taste of wine is , for example , our age , and even sy@@ l@@ je , which is produced by the person .
of course , the wine is not , of course , that wine is not up to a Jewish .
&quot; it must be more &apos; in action &apos; , says .
if you go too much of the very long one , the system has been over@@ crow@@ ded .
the excessive drinking drink may be a pity , instead of the damage - in 2004 the risk of people who drink over three glass wine , memory loss , balance with loss and reduced mental capacity .

according to the United Nations , the role of democracy in Afgh@@ ans will depend on the role of women in politics
the leader of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan , on Wednesday , said that the elections can be represented only if all members of society , including women , play their role .
the head of the UN mission , Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , said that hundreds of women are nominated for local councils in the local Soviet elections , three women stand as vice @-@ president and more than 30 per cent of voters registered .
&quot; the role of women in underlining the importance of women cannot be exagg@@ erated , &quot; said on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the Hungarian @-@ Soviet elections and presidential elections are held on 5 April .
the Taliban has been threatened by the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with a transitional period , when the role of international military operations will become a advis@@ er .
the election of this year marks the first time that power is given cal@@ mly from the democratically elected government to the next .
according to the ty@@ rant , women &apos;s strong role in Afghanistan will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the Commission &apos;s independent electoral commission , 3.@@ 6 million have been registered by 1.2 million women .
it is a pleasure to make every case as far as small and small .
the common time is always too little , but I am going to give a good opportunity to combine meetings , a game , proximity and the burden .
and what a convenient solution - whatever the case in the summer , live works are always accompanied by , and we will be able to remember their fine remarks : &apos; we are now making a trend ! &apos;
it is a very good piece of insu@@ lation - a very good piece of gold , or a pa@@ int of artis@@ an@@ al flags .
is it a foundation for permanent and tu@@ tu@@ ation in the form of sho@@ es , who would then want to take the form of a wave of sand in the summer of the summer ?
it is nice to use children instead of children .
firstly , it is a secure and convenient , race to grow slowly at the same time as training and power .
it will also be able to do a very large village with great children .
the child is eating a balance , points out cor@@ ps and it is up to the possibility of a high @-@ ranking and important role .
the larger children may do themselves at the same time .
the scope of the movement in place is in place for the lack of the land and the si@@ mp@@ ling .
the finger at the Ho@@ ia &apos;s finger directly is to keep up a mini @-@ stick properly .
the child can read cor@@ ps and feel as a job .
the planet is very high , but it is hope@@ lessly for the child .
however , it is easy to make it easier .
the plan@@ k in the game : take a long plan@@ k colon@@ on@@ la , which has been repeated by the pu@@ zz@@ le .
in fact , much more difficult , but much more than a lot to do than in the meantime .
in order to add the burden , we can stay in the plants , te@@ ars , and there is also a wal@@ king around it .
in addition , the pu@@ mps can be placed on the pu@@ mps of a child , but this exercise offers an end to all children .
at the same time , it will be a tri@@ ump@@ h , the ash , ash and air meat burden , as conta@@ gious .
child las@@ ts on their feet so that his body is distributed equally and willing to do so .
the Tur@@ is@@ cy can keep up with the game .
the ver@@ se and si@@ mp@@ ers are to be done directly .
I will be able to fly , d@@ oo@@ king , a balance in training and the difficulty .
the life of a small job is extra@@ cted when it comes to a small number of children .
the additional burden will be made on the basis of sho@@ es .
control in order to maintain a neutral approach .
the children themselves have a lot of fu@@ mes to do a sca@@ m and a pla@@ te .
the work on work and the w@@ ed@@ ers .
follow the safety of the child , the pro@@ che@@ ment , and the hotel itself in a neutral position .
all children &apos;s fav@@ ou@@ rite and a great deal .
at the same time , it is truly effective throughout the body of the whole body .
S@@ por@@ tic instruments were O@@ f ( 10 ) , S@@ Ã¤@@ de ( 8 ) , happ@@ iness ( 4 ) .
in the Philippines a wide range of mos@@ tics in the Philippines , a mo@@ ctic of travel .
in the light of the red bags , the summer classi@@ fications , which have become in itself in the last few years , which , in the last few years , have to put an end on the hand , and which have been able to have dealers in the light of their modest origin , in spite of the price of an orderly price .
it is probably one of the things that have been red by the red cop@@ ies that have existed in one order and which have no special emo@@ tion .
this is simply there , and if there is no room , there is no overla@@ p .
now , however , there is a real victory for be@@ er and mo@@ ti@@ tudes , and the mo@@ ctic is that they have replaced their homes by the summer months , instead of easy be@@ er cop@@ ies .
however , this is not only a coast@@ line , but today it is just as popular as a street , and more courageous women in the office even in the office .
however , at this point , however , it is worth making it clear , whether this summer &apos;s summer , or it is worth pointing out , and there is a little more official to postpone it in a more formal case .
however , it is an asset for women who have done a real summer of love for women .
for example , when I read foreign mo@@ ters , the first thing is that it is the case that the motor@@ gh@@ est of the road to the local market is the first thing , and that they can acquire a few ti@@ ger , to which the tru@@ ck of holiday time is , and which is accompanied by the city , on the market and , as a friend , a town on the city .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are even so generous that buying the market from the market and sell them to their loyal read@@ ers .
in this context , it is worth noting that there is a high level of demand for plastic bags , so that women in the world are going to go in the world ( and men - and men ) , apparently , had to be an area of fish , so that a few were happy to be able to become a happy owner .
in some respects , such a mad@@ ness is also understandable , because they are cor@@ rup@@ ts when the mo@@ ck@@ ery is going to be able to buy a few more than a few decades ago .
it is true that , as well as the cle@@ ver shops , there have been a lack of simple money , and so that it will be self @-@ employed in a luxury sa@@ iling and a thousand for the euro .
obviously , that the richer customers should not feel easy to feel , who will be able to see the pro@@ men@@ ta@@ tes of low @-@ cost homes .
for example , it is possible to buy D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a over a thousand , for example .
however , the interpretation of the H@@ el &apos;s interpretation may be the case of 6 000 euros .
in contrast to most of the mo@@ tives of construction , it does not come up with some of the big mo@@ tives , but the story of their story was the beginning of a long way .
it is , in fact , very far from the rest of the Philippines where they have been subjected to a wide range of them .
it is very often the case in the light of the red tape , particularly in the case of export business and the local ones that are very often under way .
it is allegedly coming from a few years of fu@@ tile technology , and it is quite a series of ordinary cor@@ ps with the ordinary cor@@ ps .
however , as we do not have to say so strongly in the red @-@ board , they will be able to stick to them and other materials , which are more individu@@ alised and even more active .
for example , in the last time , we are particularly engaged in a series of col@@ ours , which have been introduced by red @-@ col@@ oured sca@@ ms or sk@@ im@@ med .
however , the cen@@ tre@@ ach , in particular , could be sent to an actor in J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , which was not before all the most red ti@@ ger .
it was , in fact , appropriate to be@@ er cop@@ per of all kinds of clothing and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
however , it does not play a less role in the popul@@ arity of K@@ ot@@ ts , but also that caring for them is falling into account and , unlike all other things , these special instruments do not need to care , but also the water and the g@@ rub@@ bing @-@ up .
as in the case of trends , as is the case of a classic nature , the br@@ ands have come out of all sorts of interpretations .
for example , there can be a red @-@ cut but@@ ton or a drop in the hands of the power , for example , for example .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classic translation is never going to be the motto , but though .
but what is the classic divide ?
for centuries , there have been a classic copy of the w@@ ool bags , which reminds us of my style , is open , and there is short , as well as , as well as , to shoulder .

G@@ M@@ B concerns about investment after Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e G@@ las@@ go@@ w factory
the trade union expects to have been confirmed by the leaders of the long @-@ term production plans in the G@@ las@@ go@@ w factory in the company G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment in the customs .
there are more than 500 people who are produced in H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich know , and other products are working more than 500 people .
the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e owner , Mr Pla@@ dis , said that they have invested more than 5 million dollars over the last few years .
the workers and the representatives of the trade union are the first to hear &apos; if something is changing in the activities of the plant .
in the letter sent to the body of the company , G@@ M@@ B Scotland , the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e company , was invited to call &apos; spa@@ w@@ ta concerns in connection with the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines &apos; .
the G@@ M@@ B &apos;s senior organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said : &apos; the fact that we cannot be clear from the head of the label to the customs needs and the future investment plan for the future , will be deeply concerned by our members .
there have been a number of generations of families , and the workforce is largely composed of local communities and the people of G@@ las@@ go@@ w , as an essential pillar in order to ensure decent employment in the region where unemployment is high and there is social housing .
thus , in the context of the jobs , salaries and welfare of the East of G@@ las@@ go@@ w , and in the context of the chronic damage to production , the cost of living costs and the chronic loss of production , Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e was so badly needed . &apos;
the High Representative said : &apos; the Director of the Customs Council received a letter from Mr G@@ M@@ B &apos;s Scot@@ lands yesterday , and a company meets him directly because we value our active communication with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between workers and G@@ M@@ B representatives , which was discussed openly about a number of problems .
we discussed the workers , as all the companies operating in the highly competitive and precarious economic climate , we look at our actions at the moment - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure their competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested a more than 5 million dollars &apos; in the customs agreement , a majority of this has gone into production lines and the improvement of operations .
we fully understand the customs and the heritage of production and if there should be any changes in action , the workers and trade union representatives are the first to hear it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G warned from Barcelona to three years ago for convergence ?
Mr Ver@@ ra@@ tti against his interest may regret its interest in the Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main do not sign up in the attempt to attract Mr mar his ri@@ ches , by making it worth GBP 18@@ 9 million , but whether they were warning from Barcelona three years ago for a record @-@ breaking return ?
this bub@@ ble approach has opened up a transition as an end to the transition , and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world stage , which was set at the return of Paul Po@@ g@@ ba &apos;s return to Manch@@ ester , which was set at the last season by Paul Po@@ g@@ ba .
if the transition is completed , you will have the most expensive player in the world , and also the highest paid professional spor@@ ts@@ man in the world , who will be able to pay over EUR 500 000 a week after the payment of the PS@@ G .
the Barcelona is , in fact , the way in which the approach to a break @-@ down , as well as in Ney@@ ts , because , as a source of a close source of the chair of Ca@@ tal@@ onia , it confirms that the club is in a club of football for the arrival of his San@@ to@@ x in 2013 .
but do the PS@@ G warned a football world for the opportunity for three years ago ?
if the Manch@@ ester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Bla@@ ise Ma@@ tu@@ ony agreement in 2014 , the N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f , a severe reminder of all clubs , who think about the best players in some PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that if they are concerned about our players , we will be able to accept them and we will contact them with those players , &apos; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
however , if they are trying to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they must face the consequences . &quot;
the Barcelona seems to have taken away from this limit , as the Spanish club showed an interest in the Central G central player in the summer of Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they will not allow them to leave and that the Barcelona can become a result of its interest in the event of a set@@ back , chaos in the form of one of its expensive assets .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders .
&quot; the Bre@@ x@@ e is seriously threatened by the stran@@ g@@ ling in Northern Ireland and Ireland , the British and Ireland , the Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from this &apos; , added it .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the free movement of people and goods , said Var@@ ad@@ o .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : to build bridges , not borders , it emphasised .
he said that he would prefer Britain to become part of the European Union , and because it fails to be part of the European single market .
it would maintain the current free trade in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
the second option to make Britain easier to leave Britain is the creation of a European Union and the United Kingdom , explained the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement exists with Turkey , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r : &apos; surely we could have such a British &apos; .
the alternative to this would be a return to the customs duties that would be a historic division and political failure .
&quot; raise trade , prosperity and peace &apos; , said Irish Prime Minister .
he appointed Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that the result may affect the Northern Ireland &apos;s daily lives every aspect .
the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties of Northern Ireland in Bel@@ fast .
