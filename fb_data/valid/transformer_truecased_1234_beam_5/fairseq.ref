last but not least , there is a desire to radically change how the Transnistri@@ an problem is being negotiated .
yes , we have improved air passenger rights , but we have little else to say to them .
the governments of the European Union must therefore establish their own infrastructures in their own countries , based on their own local conditions and within their own jurisdiction .
first and foremost , we must declare our solidarity with the Greek authorities , with the Greek people as a whole , but most particularly with the families of those who died , who do not always receive the support they deserve .
there are good grounds for saying , yes , it could have been avoided .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the forest fires have affected several European Union countries , sadly , and have even caused loss of life .
let us hope they make the right choice !
it is an important part of the Lisbon Strategy , as it can boost productivity and employment significantly .
make no mistake : better regulation is not an image campaign .
we tend to ag@@ on@@ ise for months over this or that amendment , but often put no effort into finding out whether the legislation has had its desired effect .
as part of the ongoing work on better legislation it is crucial for the European Parliament both to become involved in the interinstitutional debate , and also to act as co @-@ legislator in the adoption of the legal acts derived from such a process .
the administrative structure must not be allowed to grow unnecessarily , with all the burdens that implies .
what do I need to do if I am going to cross a border ?
to date , 8 000 employers and 18@@ 4 000 j@@ ob@@ seekers have registered on the portal .
( the sitting was closed at 9.@@ 45 p.m. )
the second point - and I am pleased that you reinforced this , Commissioner - is the whole global dimension .
( DE ) Mr President , on behalf of the Social Democratic Group , I too would like to thank Mr Toubon for a report which , overall , we can support because it contains a great many positive aspects of particular importance to the members of our Group .
our policies must serve the people and improve their quality of life .
the Commission , in the Interinstitutional Agreements , has undertaken to respond to their proposals .
on behalf of the PSE group . - ( PL ) Mr President , it is appropriate that we are having a debate on the Gdańsk shipyard .
in the European Parliament , on the twenty @-@ seventh anniversary of the signing of the August agreements , I would urge prudence in this case .
this is therefore a measure which , though temporary , is necessary and appropriate .
( SK ) As far as the regions are concerned , given that their role in the legislative process means that they are often directly responsible for implementing and enforcing EU law , the efforts to achieve better regulation are extremely important .
in 2005 , in the European Union of 25 , the income of the rich@@ est 20 % of the population was five times that of the poorest 20 % .
among them , I should like to draw attention to the activity planning forms , where the Council considers , after examining a number of them in depth , that the overall quality of the process has improved significantly and hopes that this budgetary approach will be developed further in the future .
they have been very economical and have complied with budgetary discipline for many years now .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , yes , the proposal for a directive on the internal transport of dangerous goods is an important issue , because around 110 billion tonnes / km of dangerous goods are transported in the EU every year : 58 % by road , 25 % by rail and , up to now , 17 % by inland waterway .
as well as being a step towards simplification of the legislation as regards the administrative procedures , for both con@@ sign@@ ors and con@@ sig@@ ne@@ es , it is also a crucial step for the training of personnel involved with the safety of dangerous goods .
we shall only succeed if the Member States and the European Union act together .
freight transport has to be cut , and that which is really necessary must as far as possible go by rail or water .
( NL ) Mr President , Commissioner , logistics processes are a matter chiefly for industry and the transport sector and in my view that is how it should stay .
it is true that , as Mr Savary says , completion of the Single European Sky is not progressing quickly enough , given the importance of the objectives : competitiveness , sustainable development , combating climate change and promoting safety in the air .
that would be the only way to exert real pressure and bring about the necessary changes .
we were able to prevent at least 3 000 or 4 000 young victims from being traffic@@ ked in Germany during that period of time .
the work is planned to start by the end of 2007 .
usually , we pay , on average , between six and eight months after the event and that , of course , is not the best solution for the Member States and for the situation to be resolved .
the Community contribution , which was agreed at EUR 308 million for the next Financial perspective , is intended to act as a catalyst to draw forth resources from the private sector .
that is why the European Commission has initiated infringement proceedings against 14 Member States .
examination of the harm caused by alcohol abuse gave an extremely ble@@ ak and worrying picture : very high mortality among young people , in particular as a result of road accidents , ill @-@ treatment in the family , growing numbers of cases of fo@@ e@@ tal alcohol syn@@ dro@@ me , increasingly widespread li@@ ver disease and alcohol dependence , among young people as well , in all the Member States .
that means nearly five million Europeans , when fo@@ e@@ tal alcohol syn@@ dro@@ me is entirely preven@@ table .
it is regarded as a necessary component in most social events , including many such events in the European Parliament .
I wish to draw attention to the role that alcohol plays in the incidence of suicide , with studies showing that over 20 % of persons committing suicide used alcohol prior to death .
there are not many approaches for reducing the harmful effects of the dangerous and no@@ xi@@ ous consumption on children and pregnant women .
the Commission proposal amending the regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products provides for several important technical adjustments , which will clearly also lead to improvements .
now national and EU competition authorities must intervene forcefully on the side of farmers who , because of de facto abuses of dominant positions in the market by supermarkets in particular , are continuing to receive a pit@@ tance for their quality products .
lastly , I agree with the rapporteur that it is too soon to do away with existing safety nets altogether , even if they are not currently used , but that this too is a matter for the Health Check .
it should also include a financing line for improving quality , according to which many farmers in the new Member States cannot sell their production any more after 2009 .
what role are we playing ?
it is not clear - and I am just finishing , Mr President - whether in the past few years European citizens have been put in more danger by terrorism or by the measures taken to combat terrorism .
I have received what I think will prove to be a ground @-@ breaking report from a public @-@ private expert group that I have established , which contains around 50 valuable concrete recommendations to improve security of explosives , prec@@ urs@@ ors and de@@ ton@@ ators across the EU .
Liberals and Democrats are not soft on crime .
one problem that follows from this is the lack of democratic control of such cooperation .
the Member States are not compelled to submit evidence concerning the individuals they propose to include on the list , while , more dange@@ rously still , the Commission itself remains responsible for adding and removing the names of individuals and organisations on that list .
why ?
( RO ) This debate is extremely important as it provides us with the opportunity to examine the consistency and coherence of our policies against terrorism .
I agree with many others that , at all events , we must strengthen and make use of Europol and Eurojust .
democratic control in this area , and especially the role of the European Parliament and national parliaments , guarantees the observance of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Treaty on European Union .
the problem is the terrorists and their activities in the heart of Europe .
as recently as 31 August 2007 I visited the traffic management headquarters for seven road tunn@@ els , among them the lon@@ gest tunnel in Germany , and became aware of the need for harmonisation , particularly of the provisions on the transport of dangerous goods in tunn@@ els .
as H@@ M@@ G has stated , terrorism remains a serious and continuing threat .
logistics are an important element in the development of Europe and its competitiveness in the international arena .
approval of Minutes of previous sitting : see Minutes
of course , adequate due diligence by other market players is also essential .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , I would like to address my remarks to the gallery , which is a lot more filled than this H@@ em@@ ic@@ y@@ cle is with Members .
this fact alone has triggered rate @-@ adjustment shock of the proportions known .
there is sy@@ m@@ me@@ try between a global financial services market and a national regulation and supervision system .
neither can we be naive and believe that Basel I , Basel II and Solvency II will solve the problems that have occurred .
the water shortage is just one aspect of the crisis .
it was mentioned in this House , and I also said it myself in my first speech , that it is very important for civil society to feel more involved in implementing the measures needed to combat desertification .
every time Hamas has made a small step that might be interpreted as being in our direction , we have s@@ lam@@ med the door in its face .
subject : Ecu@@ men@@ ical nature of the Patri@@ archa@@ te of Constan@@ tin@@ ople
it already exists in the border protection area but not on the police side .
effective diversification of energy sources and transport routes was mentioned in the European Council &apos;s Community action plan of March 2007 as one of the means of improving security of supply .
I think that the European Parliament has a legitimate right to take part in this dialogue , to perform the democratic scrutiny that is assigned to it by the European citizens .
for example , the Council could send Parliament and the relevant committee six @-@ monthly evaluations of each dialogue and consultation held , together with an explanation that places emphasis on trends in the progress of work , and not on individual results .
human rights must apply to all , whether or not they are the focus of particular international attention at that time .
it is not an option to allocate budgetary funds without evaluating the result of their application or to pay li@@ p service to proposals which are never realised .
in August two Christian activists from the Middle East Christian Association were arrested and accused of posting aggressive anti @-@ Islamic messages .
the Commission will continue the dialogue with the fisheries sector and will start to discuss specific long @-@ term plans for a number of fisheries with an MSY perspective .
consequently , the fisheries policy is not the CAP .
we certainly do not want to introduce US conditions .
finally , let us not forget enforcement .
without consumers and their trust there is no trade anyway .
we cannot have a smoothly functioning internal market without satisfied and safe consumers .
I am also delighted that it has proved possible to develop definitions of &apos; consumer &apos; and &apos; professional &apos; , and that the definitions are sound .
believe me , it is very hard , even the biggest country in the Union , to convince China to act .
it is essential to support the development of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) , established in 2004 , and the European early warning and response system for public health threats , which must encourage rapid and coherent application in the EU Member States of the International Health Regulations ( I@@ HR ) .
fishing in the EU must become more environmentally sustainable in order to protect both marine environments and the long @-@ term viability of the fishing industry .
indeed , they are horrific and , for us as privileged Europeans , they should be a wake @-@ up call .
human rights and legal order do not prevail .
the sum required to allow proceedings against the most no@@ torious criminals to continue is less than USD 90 million .
as you know , the first round of voting for the 2007 Sakharov Prize will be taking place shortly .
the Social Democratic Group has requested postponing the joint debate on the reports by Mrs Bowles and Mrs van den burg on Community statistics to the October part @-@ session in Strasbourg .
the conclusion was that the European Commission considers the issue of the dec@@ re@@ es of President Bene@@ š to be resolved and closed .
not that a substantive relationship with Russia is a bad thing in itself , but , the more substantive it gets , the more un@@ balanced it tends to get too .
we also need an overall policy underp@@ ins and gives priority to electricity supplies generated from renewable sources , so that incentives can also be provided for the conversion of biomass into gas , paving the way for much greater ration@@ alisation and efficiency .
on this crucial issue we must trust to good sense and apply the precautionary principle .
let me briefly address the central issue that will come up in the next few weeks when the Commission presents its draft directive .
I believe that in terms also of security of supply it is important to focus on renewables .
we must assess their advantages and weaknesses alongside other sources of energy .
I recommend that the European Union should monitor closely Member States &apos; compliance with what is expected of them , as regional and local initiatives will be unable to flourish unless Member States put in place frameworks of their own that are compatible with EU legislation .
lastly , with regard to opening up and liberalising rail networks , I believe that if we are serious about creating a Europe @-@ wide rail culture , we have to begin by accepting that other people &apos;s trains will run across our territory .
it is a good outcome and it will enable us in future to offer rail passengers a better service .
a note was stuck on it regre@@ tting that it was out of order .
several months down the road my conclusion is that the agreement reached with the Council represents a constructive step towards further completion of the European rail transport market , in several important respects .
( HU ) Thank you very much , Mr President .
( the sitting was closed at 9.@@ 40 p.m. )
secondly , the amount of aid must be reasonable and acceptable to all sides ( and not EUR 6@@ 25 for one year ) ;
our producers will disappear , which in Europe is what we call &apos; restructuring &apos; .
Hungary has abandoned 27 % of its quota , whilst the average for the European Union as a whole is just 10.@@ 5 % .
the revision that is currently being proposed is aimed at punish@@ ing those who are most competitive .
the Commission also questions whether China is doing enough .
Po@@ ison does not belong in children &apos;s hands , even in minute quantities .
our joint resolution certainly contains interesting possibilities : the revision of the existing directives , enhanced cooperation - with China in this case - more resources allocated to customs authorities and national surveillance authorities .
the standard assumes that no child sw@@ allows more than 8 mil@@ li@@ grams from a toy .
( es ) Mr President , the recall of dangerous toys in August and September caused public alarm .
with China , we know that it does not respond to health and safety concerns , but it does respond to economic threats .
then the greater part of what has rightly been demanded here today will already have been completed .
I have therefore chosen to vote against this report .
we consider it essential for the liberalising trend seen in successive CAP reforms to be reversed and measures to be taken to maintain national sugar beet production , supporting agriculture that is essentially focused upon food production and thus helping to safeguard the two factories &apos; production as well as employment .
like all our fellow Members , we see it as a way of protecting the environment , but also of reducing our energy dependence .
as the previous speaker has said , the European Parliament has already said twice this year : this Parliament is spe@@ ar@@ heading the battle to ban the death penalty .
Poles have stood against the death penalty on many occasions .
the question simply is : how can we sensi@@ bly combine this strategic agreement with , at the same time , the idea of concluding a regional agreement with Mercosur , which has got itself into very trou@@ bled waters ?
building up cooperation with just one country in the region may undermine understandings that have been arrived at previously and become a factor that holds back work on an association agreement with Mercosur .
it is a representative democracy .
how can we exchange all the good ideas that form the basis of associations in small and large cities so that we can learn from them ?
the questions are deliberately open .
my colleague has already prepared some proposals on this .
Member of the Commission . - I think I have heard this before .
our proposal was made after an extensive consultation with stakeholders during 2004 , including a web @-@ based consultation on the cooperation themes as well as input from industrial stakeholders through the European Technology platforms .
finally , I would like to mention another Eurobarometer survey , which was about new technologies and was carried out in 2005 on a sample of 25 000 people .
in his report , the coordinator analysed the progress of the Paris @-@ Bratislava priority project and concluded that most of the project could be completed in 2015 .
innovation must be given special attention because it is innovation which is Europe &apos;s A@@ chil@@ les he@@ el .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would , of course , first of all like to congratulate my colleague , Mr Paasi@@ linna , on this lab@@ ori@@ ous work .
the US has the dollar , so we must have the euro ; the US has a GPS system , so we must have Galileo ; the US has mit , so we must have EIT .
( FI ) Mr President , first of all I would like to thank Mr Paasi@@ linna for an excellent report .
the idea behind this is that there are enough good ideas and scientific insi@@ ghts within Europe , but that they are not developed into concrete products .
the geopolitical dimension of energy security has been so far neglected and it is high time to fill the gap .
those countries that manage energy sources can fall into the temptation of managing the entire world or at least having a special impact on certain regions .
therefore , I strongly support two key ideas of this report : creating a special EU official to coordinate foreign energy policies and including an energy solidarity clause in the future Treaties .
the rapporteur &apos;s report in favour of the common energy policy le@@ ans towards Russia , but this is simply consistent with the situation today .
however , there are times when the links are weakened due to unexpected events , which tends to bring negative consequences for trade between regions , that we are currently suffering from in Spain and that we saw in Poland and other Member States in the very recent past .
finally , our legal proposal will be as short and as simple as possible and it will not imply any new administrative burdens .
Conver@@ sely , I am more cautious about the proposal for a measure abolishing taxes on animal feed .
we have also said that we will provide information about European laws , job opportunities and training courses in that centre .
( applause )
if European Union policies followed the logic of his words I could agree with him , but unfortunately that is not the case .
it states :
for them there only remains the n@@ ight@@ m@@ are vo@@ y@@ age .
almost three million of my com@@ patri@@ ots have left Poland in recent years .
I would recall that repatriation initiatives are often delegated to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees , so as to ensure maximum transparency in our respect for human rights .
it fully respects national law and practices , and it pus@@ hes forward the argument for the future about extending cross @-@ border democracy .
in writing . - I welcome in principle the idea of a European Institute of Technology .
in the Bi@@ ble Joseph explained as much to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
it is however not the right time to add new institutions and I am therefore against the creation of the new position of a High Official of Foreign Energy Policy which also threatens the influence of the European Parliament when it comes to foreign energy policy .
to be specific , the report adopts as its own the concept of the existence of different &apos; categories &apos; of migrants - such as the &apos; most highly skilled &apos; , &apos; seasonal &apos; and others - and their management according to the labour needs of the various EU countries , particularly through the creation of a Blue Card : what a de@@ human@@ ising view of migration and migrants .
it was the application of a repressive policy like this which led to the authorities of a Member State prosecu@@ ting seven Tunisian fishermen for having saved 44 people at sea , despite this action complying with international maritime law .
I believe that if these investigations were conducted with more rigour and com@@ po@@ sure , their conclusions would be more effective .
this is what sur@@ prises us : that the Council and all the governments are applying it to themselves .
if the EU calls for the closure of Guantánamo , which we more or less did , then let Member States put their action where their mouth is .
let us continue to act as watch@@ do@@ gs and ensure that not a single innocent person becomes a casu@@ alty of the so @-@ called war on terrorism .
the debate is closed .
it is essential that this mandate is correctly interpreted on the ground and that the European troops are proactive in protecting civilians in danger , creating a humanitarian area for the international organisations and protecting the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad ( MIN@@ UR@@ CA@@ T ) .
the costs are also considerable : I hear that it will cost EUR 100 million just to build a suitable run@@ way and headquarters .
we clearly mentioned the possibility of increasing the existing sanctions so that the message was precise and direct .
it is obvious that after 30 years of sanctions with neg@@ ligible results , the policy applied must take on a radical ta@@ ck , and thus international policy must involve the countries in the same region : not just China and India , as has already been said , but also Japan and Singapore , which currently holds the ASEAN Chair .
under this amended mandate , the EU Special Representative will provide political advice and offer his services in the process of constitutional reform .
( PT ) I have not read or heard the statements by Mrs Ri@@ is @-@ Jørgen@@ sen and I would not therefore like to comment on them directly .
unfortunately , I cannot use the Rules of Procedure to invite the Council to answer all these questions together as the Council has structured its work otherwise .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs . - Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , who seems to be losing his voice like I am .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( DA ) Mr President , we have adopted a Services Directive through which we have handed over to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg the power to decide what we have decided !
we will facilitate access to existing information on accidents and injuries related to the safety of services offered to consumers , and one of the very important elements which has been stressed by several Members relates to collective redress .
however , we must all make efforts to get things moving .
it was a profoundly moving experience to hear young people living with a variety of physical and learning disabilities present their school experiences .
request for waiver of parliamentary immunity : see Minutes
( applause )
it may not be the Constitution but , for all its leg@@ al@@ ese , the Reform Treaty is a document which can qui@@ et@@ ly revolu@@ tion@@ ise Europe .
I will therefore say no more .
but the IGC process has been rus@@ hed too much .
social dialogue will no longer be a horizontal obligation for the EU .
an open market , a market free of protectionism and monopolies .
I am sure that the feeling of urgency with regard to the conclusion of a Treaty , in order to inspire us to win other bat@@ tles , will be felt in Lisbon and that when we return here for the next P@@ len@@ ary , we shall be bringing you glad ti@@ dings , bringing you good news .
there will be more representa@@ tivity , based on demographic realities and not on nomin@@ al or symbolic legal relations , more solidarity between the big and small states resulting from the dig@@ res@@ sive proportionality of the representation , and full legitimacy based on the civic representation resulting from the fact that the European Parliament is elected by European citizens .
a Parliament is not - as the rapporteurs told us in their letter yesterday evening - the representation of the Member States &apos; socioeconomic capacity .
so as to ensure diversity it is therefore time to reserve a number of seats in the European Parliament for linguistic minorities .
I speak about this because we really have to talk about a common home , a common Europe , and hear every voice of every country .
the report prepared for this purpose by the rapporteurs , Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin , shows a good measure of quality , balance and responsibility .
I wish luck to the rapporteurs who are going to deal with the approximation of the electoral legislation ; I hope that they will succeed .
it is October , and we are not very much far@@ ther .
our responsibility is political : it is the responsibility to put an end to the military occupation and to call for two peoples and two states , able to co@@ exist in mutual safety .
we of course urge her to do whatever more she can .
the suffering of innocent people makes the desire to excuse and seek justification for the Gaza situation irrelevant .
I sincerely look forward to continuing this dialogue .
it includes new measures to reinforce competitiveness and increase profits of large maritime business groups , and it is indicative of the intensity of the attack on workers .
I therefore welcome all the positive measures being adopted here .
I think this gentle@@ man is sorry he was born so late , in the wrong historical e@@ po@@ ch .
I would like to start by reminding the House what this common agricultural policy actually means to the vast majority of our nearly 500 million citizens .
the most valuable provision of all is the one that makes it possible to publish , or rather makes it a duty to publish , information on who made use of these funds and in what context , as part of the Common Agricultural Policy .
enormous amounts .
perhaps we need to do that at the higher level , but let us be honest in how we debate this topic .
full implementation of the upgra@@ ded system will take place by 1 July 2009 .
( PL ) Mr President , Mr Commissioner , I accept and approve of Mr Staes &apos;s report , which will first and foremost lead to contra@@ band being limited as far as possible .
this time , we have managed to make progress , to some extent , by tri@@ cking the system - by intervening before the Council spoke out - but in the long term , we need better rules for shaping the content .
they have much to say about the hard@@ ships they undergo in order to obtain a US visa and about what they also put up with when they arrive , and they are subject to checks and search@@ es as if they were potential terrorists .
a large number of the Member States , perhaps too prone to listen to those in charge of their own airports , are lo@@ ath to take up Community coordination and prefer to continue giving priority to local solutions implemented at each airport .
the number of accidents at work is also reported to have increased .
but there is a second danger of misunderstanding .
on the other hand , flying is part of our everyday life , and our way of life has changed with its having become accessible to those on low incomes , pensioners and students .
this is necessary , otherwise the sentence will have no meaning in English .
these are my reasons for voting against the report .
in writing . - British Conservatives are opposed to the EU Constitution and to the draft EU Reform Treaty .
this situation stems from cultural causes and socioeconomic contexts that are unfavourable to women and is worse in the case of indigenous women who suffer from high levels of economic dependency .
the government is primarily responsible for the provision of the necessary material and technical conditions at these homes am@@ d for the support of the children .
this triggered a mining law reform in Romania by introducing an amendment to the Parliament , which prohibited the use of cyanide in mining .
let me first of all thank all those who have worked to make this debate possible today , and especially the rapporteur , Mrs Bre@@ yer .
let me make a very brief comment on the z@@ onal approach .
eliminating carcinogenic , muta@@ genic and re@@ proto@@ x@@ ic pesticides , and substances that weaken our ner@@ v@@ ous and endocrine systems and damage our immun@@ e systems , is an entirely healthy aim .
we are in no position to ignore these factors when discussing plant protection regulations .
the crop Protection Agency says that banning pesticides means between 65 % and 200 % more land under cultivation , reducing productivity .
I just think it can be better achieved with an approach based on risk analysis and risk reduction .
we must remember that a shortage of foodstuffs would lead to an increase in their prices .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Madam President , this Parliament is like the T@@ ow@@ er of B@@ ab@@ el , an al@@ leg@@ ory of the H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg E@@ mp@@ ire , which was full of sy@@ cop@@ han@@ ts .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , may I say to Mr Davies that we should recall clearly why we have to discuss stringent binding emission limits .
I have argued for a long time that we need to set demanding targets .
obviously solutions have to be found for the new engine technology in the short term as well .
I am pleased to note that your message regarding nuclear energy is fully in line with our conclusions in the communication on a Nuclear Il@@ lus@@ tra@@ tive Programme , as widely supported by the Economic and Social Committee .
people who sing the pra@@ ises of nuclear energy have no right to go on dis@@ regarding that disgrace .
because of political uncertainty entirely caused by the London Government not making it a priority , the project is going ahead - and it is going ahead in Califor@@ nia .
in my country , Bulgaria , we were need@@ lessly required to close 2 000 M@@ W of safe , clean nuclear power .
in any event , the Commission acknowledges that the amendments to the original proposals are un@@ question@@ ably important , they have the support of the Council and Parliament and they do not alter the substance of our original proposals .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , I should like to come back to a decision that was made yesterday afternoon .
this document is one of the more important pieces of evidence showing that the debate on taxation policy may become Europe @-@ wide .
the unity of Europe is not compromised by diversity in tax policies ; rather , the EU &apos;s competitiveness is undermined by the wrong tax policies .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , this debate has been very interesting and most of the contributions have been encouraging .
( loud applause )
we have many tasks ahead : economic reform , growth and jobs , the reinforcement of social cohesion , our focus on innovation , our proposals on energy and climate change , and our programme for justice , freedom and security .
( applause )
yes , I have actually found all the main achievements of the Constitution on which I myself have been working for more than 10 years and I could well be fortuna@@ te .
( PL ) Mr President , contrary to the g@@ loom @-@ la@@ den forecasts and ba@@ se@@ less criticism of Poland during recent debates in this House , especially by the leader of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , the Lisbon Summit turned out to be a diplomatic compromise .
that is our objective , Mr President .
should this will be lacking , all the institutional reform will have counted for nothing .
however , it is also a task for the European Institutions .
those who vote in favour will be voting in favour of moving this vote to the next part @-@ session and those who vote against will be voting in favour of keeping the agenda as it is .
the legislative regulations governing the protection of the environment are a compromise between the need to protect it and the demands of big business to max@@ imi@@ ze its excessive profits come what may .
ladies and gentlemen , by virtue of common sense I did not support the majority of your proposals in the package .
finally , in conformity with the spirit of the national debate in France on the environment , I voted in favour of a tax on pesticides to encourage our farmers to reduce their use of treatment products .
the Council in its draft budget cut commitment appropriations to EUR 12@@ 8.@@ 4 billion and payment appropriations to EUR 1@@ 19.@@ 4 billion , that is to say EUR 10.@@ 3 billion under an already very tight financial framework .
it would not be reasonable to reduce the funding for research and transport in order to find money for Galileo , as is being proposed by the EU Finance Ministers .
there are not even a do@@ zen Members who will be making the decision tomorrow on which T@@ ow@@ er of B@@ ab@@ el they will give to whom .
so far , so good - all of it !
lastly , Mr President , permit me to sal@@ ute the Members of Parliament present today on this , my country &apos;s national holiday .
regarding the latter , it can be said that the screening report has shown us that the Commission employs almost 11 000 staff in administrative support and coordination - adminis@@ tering the administration .
Parliament gave a clear and concrete signal that it is now up to Frontex and the Member States to eliminate the ineffici@@ ency , the un@@ kept promises and the delay we have suffered over the past year .
( FI ) Mr President , first of all I wish to thank the rapporteurs , Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä .
the European Parliament emphasises in paragraph 24 of its resolution the need for the Commission to approve as quickly as possible the national operational plans of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and of the Structural Funds .
Member of the Commission . - I have already mentioned that the governments , especially the Syrian Government , which the honourable Member referred to , have clearly indicated that they were not in favour of external humanitarian assistance programmes implemented via the international organisations and NGOs .
there will be the first round of depar@@ tures of contract agents , whose contribution will have to be transferred to another scheme , and 3 % annual expected increase of salaries and pensions .
that is indeed quite a good step forward .
Member of the Commission . - We are some way from having to contempla@@ te what would happen if the negotiations we are approaching , which have not even yet started , might fail .
all the so @-@ called reforms of the common agricultural policy are based on limiting production within the European Union .
we need to fundamentally rethink common agricultural policy , because piec@@ eme@@ al interventions are merely cosmetic .
every year , thousands of people in Europe die because of smoking .
with regard to passive smoking and the general smoking ban , a sound liberal principle is that one &apos;s personal freedom ends where another &apos;s begins - and what clearer illustration of this principle can there be than unwilling passive smoking ?
we have to protect two groups in particular : children and young people , and employees .
we do not want to water down the protection of non @-@ smokers .
I shall be having a more thorough discussion with you in the near future - next year - with a specific proposal from the Commission based on the discussion today .
these are positive steps forward , and we want to make capital of them now , but I would like nevertheless to say that not all the issues raised by Parliament , or its legitimate concerns , have necessarily met with the desired responses from the other institutions .
I am convinced , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , that this framework will not only encourage cross @-@ border mobility , but will act as the driving force for the EU &apos;s internal mobility - if we think of students , workers , researchers and volunteers in general , and all those who need to move freely through Europe without causing panic or undue concern .
we have before us the result , which will require educational authorities in the Member States to use this shared framework as a translation device and a reference point .
agenda for next sitting : see Minutes
moreover - my final point - if a people does not acknowledge its past , it has no future .
relatively little happened here last year , as we all know .
I believe we need to think about this because , fellow Members , your dear democratic Turkey , that human rights parad@@ ise on earth , is kno@@ cking at Europe &apos;s door at the very moment when a dreadful , un@@ predictable , tragic scenario of war is opening up on the Iraqi front .
the Turkish policy of dividing Cyprus into two states is not a solution .
they are consen@@ ting to discrimination against Central Europe and therefore to weakening the European Union &apos;s position as a global partner .
without any amendment to the Constitution , he will continue to have power over all political , economic , financial , administrative , judicial and security matters .
some reasonable questions may be asked about the EU @-@ Russia partnership .
we do indeed take them seriously .
agreement between the EC and Serbia on short @-@ stay visas ( vote )
( applause )
in writing . - ( FR ) The Corbett report recommends that , in order to save about EUR 10 million a year , we should no longer have the ver@@ ba@@ ti@@ m reports of proceedings in this Parliament translated into all the official languages .
in writing . - ( SK ) transnational labour mobility in the EU has become inevitable : it is an everyday reality within the EU @-@ 27 after enlargement .
if it really is the case - and there are reports and statistics about this - that nuclear energy is to have a massive impact in terms of reducing our CO2 emissions , then we will have to have a substantial increase in the number of our nuclear power stations .
it was not a piece of legislation - that will come - but , by failing to support the 2012 date backed by the European Commission , I think that the ALDE Group and the PPE @-@ DE Group in this House failed the first test on climate change and the people out there will be looking at what happened here today and wondering whether we really are serious about the commitments we made back in March to reduce CO2 .
there is no common tax policy because of intra @-@ imperialist conflicts .
I personally have never smo@@ ked in my life .
the motion for a resolution by Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten is a consensual and balanced document and in it she has sought to cover all the issues relating to this particular problem .
I also welcome the fact that the Government moved against , arrested and delivered two of the six most wanted fu@@ gi@@ tives , T@@ oli@@ mir and Dj@@ ord@@ je@@ vi@@ c .
I would also like to pay tribute to the very positive work being undertaken by the Vojvo@@ dina regional parliament in relation to tolerance and youth cooperation , which is having a major impact .
we must help Serbia , and not just talk about doing so .
much has been done by Serbia in this respect to cooperate with the Tribunal .
for we share the same destiny .
thank you very much , Madam President , for your licence .
no , you have a responsibility and in my view , when it comes to the EPAs , you have not fulfilled this responsibility , at least jud@@ ging by your statements to our committee .
development must be our goal and trade one of its weapons .
some actions can also be funded under the new instrument for stability , so we now have more instruments on hand to address this major challenge , and will take clearly into account the strong position expressed by Parliament in using these as effectively as possible , where necessary , because I totally share the objective that you have expressed .
I want to ask about three issues .
( el ) Mr President , I would like to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office , but in familiar Council terms , he has chron@@ ic@@ led 18 months of iner@@ tia and delays .
during this assessment , we also discussed the lessons that may be drawn from recent financial market volatility .
I therefore hope that , beyond the understandable official line taken by Europe &apos;s governments and the Afghan Government , asser@@ ting the need to fight opium production , beyond that official line we might send out another message , and the European Parliament is perhaps fre@@ er than others to make such a proposal .
1. the necessary quantities of mor@@ ph@@ ine are already being produced in Afghanistan under special licences and subject to supervision by the United Nations drugs agency and the Afghan Government &apos;s Ministry of Counter Nar@@ co@@ tics ;
one last comment : I welcome the fact that this has been a pragmatic debate , not an argument between those wishing to liberalise or leg@@ alise drugs and prohibi@@ tion@@ ism .
but I think that , for Afghanistan , it is maybe not useful at this stage .
the court must of course refrain from hearing or informing the debtor of the proceedings before atta@@ ching his or her bank account , otherwise the effect might be the opposite of what was intended .
the debate is closed .
if one looks at why a judgment given in one particular country can be enforced in another with regard to the criminal and pen@@ al sentences , one appreci@@ ates that , basically , what we are doing is making life for the person who has been convicted a better one : being closer , perhaps , to his family , being closer , perhaps , to his place of origin .
that means that the total number of complaints has stabilised at around the level reached following the 53 % increase in 2004 .
of course , we should avoid delays or failure to take action , and that is why the Commission recently adopted a communication on the implementation of Community law , and we laid down more targeted preventive measures , improved information provision and problem solving .
in my opinion , it is interesting to note , however , that it would be more useful to have functioning Ombuds@@ men in those countries and in particular in Italy than to have a European Ombudsman .
that you are dealing with a certain number of cases and bringing about a resolution is positive , but we need to do a bit more work to educate people about what you do and how you do it , in order to bring even more cases to your des@@ k .
on the one hand , the Ombudsman &apos;s activities must entail a review of the institution &apos;s profile and accessibility throughout Europe .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I think this is covered by my earlier statement .
( the oral amendment was adopted . )
this would aggra@@ vate the situation of the administration costs , since payments will be made throughout the entire year to prepare such sessions , as regards costs related both to the premises , and to the personnel .
today , I can only find , with regret , that their linguistic rights are refused and ignored , whether we speak of education or religious practice in the Romanian language .
this proposal should be ready by mid @-@ 2008 at the latest .
author . - ( ES ) Mr President , I believe there are three elements - at least three - justi@@ fying this urgency .
that is , of course , why we put the stress on the need for a return to democracy and civilian government with free and fair elections in January as being the only way to answer the challenges of Pakistani society .
here too , the support the European Union has undertaken to provide may prove very useful , although within a short time it may also prove quite inadequate .
Madam President , I strongly deplore the killing of 10 African Union peace@@ keepers on 30 September 2007 by un@@ identified forces in Has@@ kan@@ ita in south Darfur .
this is not only an expression of our humanitarian obligations , but also a worthwhile investment in sustainable development and human safety .
- ( PL ) Mr President , recently Val@@ é@@ ry G@@ is@@ card d &apos;@@ Esta@@ ing , former President of France and the main archite@@ ct of the Constitutional Treaty that was rejected in the French and Dutch referendums , stated that the EU Reform Treaty adopted in Lisbon was no more than a revised version of the Constitutional Treaty , from which references to the Constitution had deliberately been removed .
are these events to be ro@@ bus@@ tly exposed in this forum in order to make Europe aware of what is really happening in Russia ?
it is time to pass resolutions on the role of sport in education along with the comments and proposals announced by Mr Schmitt .
- ( PL ) Madam President , I fully support the draft resolution , and I thank the rapporteur for the very good drafting of this text .
it must have control over the conclusion of long @-@ term nuclear fuel contracts and provide a framework for investment , etc .
these people are overwhel@@ med and are calling on us to act .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the wake of the brutal murder by a Romanian citizen of Gi@@ o@@ van@@ na Reg@@ gi@@ ani , whose family is offered our heartfelt condolences , many political groups in Italy have pointed the finger at Europe .
( NL ) Mr President , I believe we readily agree that an effective approach to crime deserves our support , and of course there is never any excuse for murder , but I believe we also agree that the right to reside in the Schengen area is a great asset and is tangible proof of European citizenship .
we must also bear in mind that there is a direct relationship between climate change and soil .
it is very difficult to have one general directive to cover all these positions .
( SK ) Before looking at the actual wording of the proposed framework directive on soil protection , we should consider whether EU legislation in this area is actually needed .
Madam President , this proposal for a directive on soil protection has huge credibility gaps .
I will leave you with one last thought .
the remainder will be distributed free of charge according to a benchmark , re@@ warding high @-@ performance airlines .
therefore , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament suggests increasing the proportion of emissions allowances to be au@@ ctioned to 25 % .
I also believe that we must bring more courage and ambition to this matter .
so the decisions we make tomorrow will give an indication of where we should go , in terms of the ETS reform as a whole .
but I have a problem with the f@@ ren@@ zy against aviation per@@ me@@ ating this debate as if it were the greatest environmental villa@@ in and the best thing would be if we stopped flying completely .
NA@@ SA has announced the launching of a programme to find solutions for improving ke@@ ro@@ sene .
when it came to the IFRS 8 standard , we had the impression that this was not the route that was being followed by the international organisation and we wanted to alert the public to this .
the twin @-@ track strategy proposed by the Commission in 2006 has paid off , focusing on concrete results for citizens , and at the same time investing in a solution for the institutional settlement .
he , too , must focus on achieving this social Europe .
Mr Swoboda says that the social dimension is missing and I must admit that on this issue , he is right .
public services lie at the heart of our social model .
there will be another test later this morning on aviation emissions and I hope that we will have a strong package .
we believe these measures to be necessary , not least so as to combat exploitation and bring undeclared work out into the open .
to conclude , therefore , if anyone here is concerned about the citizen let them start by demanding a general referendum on the Lisbon Treaty .
it will therefore not surprise you that I wish to congratulate the Commission on emphasising prosperity , solidarity , security , freedom and strengthening Europe in the world .
I believe this will lead to tax harmonisation by default and I would be completely opposed to such a move .
whether or not this feeling is unfair is irrelevant .
yes , I am stating loud and clear that Europe has a role to play in injec@@ ting some much @-@ needed ethics into financial capitalism , and what we saw with the crisis in the sub@@ prime market - where a few speculators are undermining global competition - is something that Europe cannot accept .
the reference to the Mol@@ da@@ vian language remains nul@@ l and vo@@ id for the given Members of the European Parliament .
obligatory PE is an issue for head teachers and boards of govern@@ ors , not for the EU .
I wish to express my concern about the consequences of natural degradation of the soil and degradation caused by human activity .
I agree that aviation has to be included in any emissions trading schemes , but a balance has to be found between environmental considerations and those of the aviation industry .
we are now facing an historic event : the biggest enlargement in Schengen &apos;s history , with the simultaneous abolition of internal borders with nine Member States : the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Poland , Lithuania , Slovenia , Slovakia and Malta .
Europol is doing a wonderful job in tackling international crime in Europe .
action is now required , and Commissioner Frattini is quite rightly sending out well @-@ balanced , positive signals in this regard , but we should not forget that Schengen must also concern itself with checks at the European Union &apos;s external borders , and must do so ever more efficiently .
we should not see a repeat of the situation when the Commission did not want to provide the Parliament with information that was vital for its decision @-@ making .
recently we have not adopted much legislation that is more important than this , and I am proud that I can be part of this wonderful process !
we must continue to explore , as Spain is now doing with a number of these countries , the possibility of hir@@ ing and training workers at origin by creating work@@ shop schools and vocational training facilities there .
Africa is a continent with a wealth of talen@@ ted people .
the latter considered that the derogations from the no @-@ profit rule laid down in Article 109 ( 2 ) of Council Regulation No 16@@ 05 / 2002 could only be enshrined in a separate regulation based on Article 27@@ 9 of the EC Treaty and intended to introduce these derogations into the Financial Regulation itself by amending it .
did Britain win today or did the French ?
this can only be good news for the Council and the Portuguese Presidency and I must thank the Commission and the European Parliament for the fact that we can move forward together based on the proposal which I have presented to you today .
I used this opportunity to point out that democracy still had its benefits since it allowed people to express freely what they thought , including things that were sometimes shocking .
are you referring to development or is this a more general question , because I do not feel that it was put specifically to me in my capacity as Commissioner for Development ?
( DE ) Commissioner , we all hope that the status issue will indeed be resolved on 10 December .
the 2005 communication said that it would be a huge organisational step and might therefore be risky and costly to implement .
however , this is not the case if the US competi@@ tor attempts to portra@@ y some of our Member States as , and I quote , &apos; un@@ reliable aero@@ space business partners and a security risk to US military readiness &apos; , or to insti@@ gate legislation in the US Congress to block funds for improvements of US airports to accommodate the A@@ 380 .
that is its duty and the citizens will judge it on the results .
the third and final point I should like to mention applies more to the future .
it is the form in which the citizens tell us how the many laws we tin@@ ker with in other committees affect them or do not affect them .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission , and I personally , wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr V@@ ak@@ alis , for this extremely informa@@ tive and valuable report .
however , earthquakes are just as much natural disasters as floods , forest fires and stor@@ ms .
sometimes the aid fails to reach those most in need . the effectiveness of aid could be greatly improved through good organisation , including cooperation with other aid donors , clear principles and unambiguous criteria .
I presu@@ me you are confusing it with development assistance .
this response acknowledges the legitimate concerns of those who are facing change , however , since it must not be forgotten that some people may be adversely affected by it , and we must also have a response for them .
we must therefore make it clear - as indeed today &apos;s debate will do - that the consequences of globalisation can be seen in different ways and can be addressed through various competing methods .
if we are looking at growth , we are still talking as if the quantity is what matters , not the quality and not what is actually growing within our societies .
the right wing refuses to discuss economic coordination .
everyone in this Chamber knows that economic freedom , increased prosperity and the social model are mutually compatible .
( it ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I think that there have been speakers in this debate as well who have placed economic freedom in opposition to the assurance and protection of social rights and the fight against poverty .
in July , in the Financial Times it said : &apos; Brussels is the regulatory capital of the world and cannot be ignored from Washington to T@@ ok@@ yo &apos; .
all of this must facilitate growth and the ability to create jobs .
I am pleased to say that I can respond favourably to much of what has been said here .
- Before the vote :
for these reasons I have voted against the directive , and I hope that the Council will now make the necessary corrections .
I consider a European soil protection directive to be superfluous and in@@ expedi@@ ent , and I have voted against this proposal .
a Community approach is therefore required to create uniform rules , close loopholes and strike a balance between the need to control and requirements concerning the protection of the internal market and the free movement of capital .
although recognising the challenges currently faced by Pakistan in relation to its security situation and the Pakistani people &apos;s sacrifices and efforts in combating extremism and terrorism , the European Union firmly believes that the solution to these challenges cannot involve an inter@@ ruption in the democratic process .
we should be supporting Amnesty International &apos;s Day of Action tomorrow to remember the political prisoners held in Pakistan , and we certainly need to be looking at aid and the way in which it is spent .
it is just as crucial to get big developing countries , such as China and India , to accept limits on the increase in their emissions .
account must be taken in particular of the fact that the greatest adaptation costs are now falling upon the poorest regions of the world that have contributed least to the problem and which are least equipped to resolve it .
Madam President , one of the most effective strategies the EU can employ in Bali is to lead by example .
how do we maximise the impact ?
I acknowledge all that commitment , work and effort and must applaud you for it .
I must not om@@ it to add a few words on the events in Georgia , which we have been discussing together .
the issue of Ukraine and opening the way for its full membership of the EU should therefore be considered on an individual basis , taking into consideration that it is Ukraine that is the EU &apos;s principal partner in the east European neighbourhood .
I found it a very complex situation .
in any event , dialogue with the divided opposition , which cannot be excluded from this process , is inevitable .
( FR ) Mr President , I intend to speak specifically about the Mediterranean region which , as the rapporteurs have reminded us - and I thank them for doing so - is very important to Europe in foreign @-@ policy terms .
the resolution we approve will consolidate Parliament &apos;s vision in this area of neighbourhood policy , developing the lines we defined in January 2006 .
these include diplomatic action , civilian and military missions and trade and development activities .
the approach you have proposed seems interesting , but we should not leave ourselves open to the accus@@ ation that the Union is claiming competence for all global matters .
Ukraine has considerable achievements in this area . it is worth benefiting from them .
and indeed it would be virtually impossible , given the present level of government revenue , to effect the promised spending increases .
it has undoubtedly developed into one of the most promising EU partners .
in addition , the Commission asks the Member States concerned to include in their operational plans a reduction of their fishing capacity , either temporary cessation or scra@@ pping , to ensure that their quotas for 2008 and the following years are fully respected .
some even say that we have already gone past the point of no return .
rapporteur . - ( FR ) Mr President , representatives of the Council and the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by thanking my colleagues , who entrusted me with this report , and the shadow rapporteur for their respective contributions .
employment is , I believe , the most crucial link in the social and economic transformation of an integrated Europe .
national collecting societies would not disappear ; authors would still be members of local collecting societies and revenues would still be distributed through collecting societies affi@@ lia@@ ted to the new licensing platforms .
the EU must determine strategic priorities for relations with those states with human security as the overall goal .
taking into account the demographic trends and the rising average life expectancy , we have to develop public health strategies that will improve our quality of life , with a view in particular to preventing diseases and combating them effectively .
I will give you just one example , and I hope it will illustrate the contradictory results we get if we look at the money and if we look at the man or woman .
anyone who wants to combat poverty - as Mr Fa@@ tu@@ zzo has already said - must really focus more inten@@ sely on the older generation .
I have been a privileged witness to how the con@@ vo@@ ys of young people standing against poverty and for inclusion , who travelled across Europe , took Mrs Lynne &apos;s document and went from city to city , from European capital to European capital , hon@@ ouring the European Parliament , thanks to the work of our colleague .
( the oral amendment was not accepted )
we therefore oppose their progressive transfer to the supranational institutions of the EU in a process that justifies every new &apos; advance &apos; on the basis of the previous &apos; advance &apos; .
in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am strongly opposed to these motions for resolutions and want to express my firm opposition .
they provide less of an incentive to reinforce the procedures of a state based on democracy and the rule of law and economic market principles and a genuine respect for citizens &apos; rights .
the report correctly stresses the need to take ethnic and faith @-@ based he@@ tero@@ gene@@ ity into account in EU legislation in order to protect all people from violence and discrimination .
one possible consequence is that Christian minorities may be unable to hold their own in the Middle East in the long term and be doo@@ med to fle@@ e to Europe .
this also depends on our actions , which are not always very coherent or prudent .
the Union of Islamic courts , on the other hand , is their joint ad@@ vers@@ ary and wants to re@@ unite Somalia on the basis of traditional Islamic rules , without the war@@ lor@@ ds .
I would be grateful to the Members of this House if they could support this course of action , which would offer some scope for negotiations on a compromise .
at the European Council in June 2007 , it was agreed that the future new Treaty would contain a cross @-@ reference to the Charter , as adapted and finally approved in 2004 , and that it would have the same legal value as the Treaties , and this is now reflected in the new Treaty .
freedom of speech for public servants is much better under the Strasbourg Court than under the Luxembourg Court .
otherwise , all of the good work included in this excellent report will have been for nothing .
I am of the view that the biggest problems in the European Union relate to the provision of a flexible , qualified workforce , and therefore that this issue should be at the heart of Europe &apos;s flexicurity strategy .
we want a Europe of values .
we must take advantage of the next EU @-@ Africa Summit to address the justified and pressing demands of this suffering continent which is near to us and yet at the same time remote and which is kno@@ cking anxi@@ ously on our door .
( applause )
if so , it would stand to reason that he feels there is no need to ask his people the same question twice .
social policies do not consume wealth .
I therefore believe that we have a debate pending on the consolidation of this social state .
by voting &apos; yes &apos; in the referendum to what was then the Constitutional Treaty , the citizens of Spain made a major contribution to the Charter not being shel@@ ved .
in East Africa , a stepping @-@ stone agreement has been initi@@ alled with the East African Community : Kenya , Uganda , Rwanda , Burundi and Tan@@ z@@ ania .
no country , if it does not sign , should be in a worse situation than it is already .
while no one can deny that many ACP countries face considerable challenges , if the EPAs are fra@@ med correctly they should be seen as an opportunity for the ACP .
we are giving the Agency greater responsibility for the setting of safety standards and interoperability criteria .
( es ) Mr President , Commissioner Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , I firstly want to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work on the various reports which represent another step towards the integration of the European railways .
it is extremely important for the regulations on interoperability to be extended to the entire Community railway network .
implementation must be monitored very closely , and in particular , Commissioner , something must be done in relation to one aspect where I have serious concerns .
do you think that traffic regulations do not apply to you ?
solutions had to be found to a number of difficult issues and today &apos;s outcome stands up to scrutiny .
the report will help achieve this objective .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the basis for the amendment of this Directive was the UN Protocol and the question of how we can tackle terrorism effectively .
finally , in association with all tourism players at all levels , we must promote sustainable and high @-@ quality tourism which is competitive , environmentally @-@ friendly , responsible , and above all accessible to everyone .
on the Committee on Budgets I note with satisfaction that the responsible committee has adopted a positive position regarding our proposal for an amendment to the legal basis , although that would only be done in respect of future proposals on macro @-@ financial assistance .
these are just a few examples from this excellent report .
we need to decide how trade policy can contribute positively towards solving the problem of climate change .
the Court also reports improvements in internal policies , such as research programmes , and external actions .
are these real errors ?
since it is a better report than last year &apos;s report we should also congratulate the Commission .
it now wants to close it down even though it is currently the only available instrument for carrying out work that we believe to be effective in situations that are anything but transparent .
for the court to say that gol@@ f clubs are getting the single farm payment is er@@ rone@@ ous .
I therefore hope that Parliament will today confirm the agreement negotiated with the Council so as to enable the Council to adopt Parliament &apos;s amendments at its meeting next week on 6 and 7 December 2007 .
situation in Georgia ( vote )
in order to qualify , not only numer@@ ical but also ideological criteria are to be applied , and that means that parties which row against the tide will have no chance .
this is a very lau@@ dable goal , but it is unfortunately being used as an excuse to apply a policy which discrimin@@ ates against nationals of our Member States , who are becoming second @-@ class citizens in their own countries .
I consider that GMOs represent a considerable threat to health and the environment in the EU and that all decisions on such matters deserve the ful@@ lest scrutiny possible .
in writing . - I welcome , and voted for , the Leinen Report on the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
above all , it gives the Commission a free hand to act without a proper legal basis .
there are , however , grave risks associated with this report .
we cannot forget that the state that applies the policy of force within its borders will not be deter@@ red from applying such a policy in international relations too .
he spoke out in favour of living in peace and harmony with neighbours , with respect for full sovereignty .
therefore , if the fight against corruption remains a priority - and it should stay so - the praise one gets from the keepers of democracy should be equally accompanied by criticism of ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ations and breaking of fundamental citizens &apos; rights .
although the European Parliament had originally called for 2017 , the schedule for compliance by the Member States is now set to run until 2020 , a realistic date which is proposed by the Council in coordination with the national representatives .
the steps already taken by the EU with regard to the capture of CO2 in the seab@@ ed must be strengthened , since these are an innovative contribution to combating climate change .
local authorities are already doing a great deal here and they should continue to do so .
the ball really is in our court now to implement this ambitious legislative package , as it is in that of the Commission to monitor it .
however , we should not forget that the absence of sub@@ jective and comparable cen@@ sus data would lead to negative consequences .
I was even more taken ab@@ ack by the fact that this data was only to be collected from women .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , many thanks for the brief@@ ing you have given us today once again on the progress of discussions .
they were clearly destined to fill the gaps as a result of the toy recalls .
after the insis@@ tent talks I had with the Ministry of the Economy in Bulgaria , inspections increased four times .
I do not think that it is a question of creating a common frame of reference that is purely theoretical .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the Ottawa Convention on banning mines has been very successful in saving thousands of lives and in preventing thousands of people from becoming severely w@@ ounded .
closure of sitting
the common organisation of the market in wine is part of that process .
in addition , that same Union now requires the Czech Republic to contribute financially to the advertising of European surplus wine in third countries .
Commissioner , there have been certain changes since you submitted this proposal for a new wine COM .
we cannot cut back on the quality of our v@@ ine@@ yards and their brand image .
we should impose the same conditions on those who export their agricultural products to Europe .
it is a limited study which only covers five different Member States , but it is very interesting and I will supply you with a copy .
the Government of Sudan is insisting that it will never hand them over to the ICC .
the question of proliferation of institutions within the framework of the European Union remains open , however , and does not only involve the institutional reconstruction of the Seventh Framework Programme .
moreover , in my opinion , we should involve Russia in the development and implementation of this framework .
this system has led to production being abandoned by many small and medium @-@ sized farmers and family farms and to rural areas being abandoned , to losses of biodiversity and to a reduced chance of achieving the goal of food sovereignty in certain Member States , particularly Portugal .
as regards the general reserve for EUR 5 million on staff salaries , the Commission is firmly committed to delivering the required study on the A@@ B@@ M implementation and the reports requested by Parliament on the follow @-@ up or the screening exercise and on the implementation of Article 44 of the Interinstitutional Agreement .
secondly , we know that at least 75 % of the money spent by the EU is devoted to completely useless and harmful causes .
secondly , as regards providing EU citizens with information about the work of the European Parliament and its results , we now have the tools for better cooperation and communication with citizens .
the European Union will continue to make full use of that Committee to propose both thematic and country resolutions .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( FR ) Ladies and gentlemen , &apos; a new man of human rights has been born who has nothing in common with his an@@ ces@@ tor of 17@@ 89 but the name &apos; : that was the pi@@ qu@@ ed description used by the philos@@ op@@ her Mar@@ cel Gau@@ chet to describe the Charter of Fundamental Rights proclaimed here and made binding made by Article 6 of the Lisbon Treaty .
this is in contradiction of the Indian Government &apos;s responsibilities under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
this approach constitutes the difference that the EU can bring , particularly in comparison with other international actors .
certain African leaders have clearly stated the problems posed by some of the approaches we have fier@@ cely defended .
in relation to food security , the fight against disease , human rights and migration , especially support for more fragile states , we have also constantly asked the Commission to do more and better for and with Africa .
we should be absolutely clear on this issue !
it is true we have made very little progress on this aspect , for the reason I mentioned previously .
as this subject is not within my portfolio , Mr Rübig , I shall ask Commissioner Mandelson to provide you with a written answer right away .
Member of the Commission . - Fir@@ stly I would like to thank the honourable Member for helping me move ahead in this policy .
the Commission will then propose to adhere to the relevant UN@@ EC@@ E regulation with revised limit values .
locally there is concern about the scale of these proposed projects , notably in relation to the possible health implications for those living in the immediate vic@@ inity of the power lines .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Madam President , Mr Leichtfri@@ ed , ladies and gentlemen , we are now on the ver@@ ge of obtaining agreement at second reading with the Council on an extremely important proposal .
I must ask , whatever else the Commission looks at , please reassure me and so many other pil@@ ots about this important issue .
some of them have already been ai@@ red .
regarding your idea to emphasise more programmes for promotion in third countries , I am , in principle , sympa@@ thetic towards the idea , but it has to be put into the right context .
I hope that we can all agree on the fact that it is important that we have a budget available to explain to consumers the high quality of European products , both within the European Union and on the overseas markets .
the present draft is our contribution to the pursuit of that aim .
to postpone it any longer , Madam President , really would not be acceptable .
both ways are , ultimately , ways of achieving the same objectives .
to that extent , President Barroso is perfectly correct , for it is wrong that some - in southern Europe , for example - should be under intense migratory pressure , while those at the other geographical ends of Europe was@@ h their hands of the problem .
in this case we can say that the threat of an Iranian nuclear bomb has apparently subsi@@ ded , if we can believe the US intelligence service .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights is also being formally proclaimed today .
from our point of view , however , the new Treaty also suffers from a few shortcomings : the European Parliament should be consulted on the nomination of the new High Representative and Vice @-@ President of the Commission , not only for the first person to take office on 1 January 2009 , but also in the case of the interim appointment afterwards and , obviously , when appointing the whole Commission , including its Vice @-@ President for Foreign Affairs .
it is this political legacy that this week &apos;s summit will be called upon to consolidate and develop .
if we can agree on the policy direction , we will be able to generate real political commitment to solve the real problems that have been mentioned by some of you .
in the occupied territories , the humanitarian situation for Palestinians remains dire .
( loud applause )
in conclusion , I would congratulate the President on her excellent conduct of the proceedings , especially in today &apos;s heated - sometimes over @-@ heated - atmosphere .
thus , in addition to the correction of 1 600 million in the multiannual financial framework , with the mobilisation of the flexibility Instrument it is also proposed to supplement the funding for the European global navigation satellite system programmes ( EGNOS @-@ Galileo ) by approximately EUR 200 million .
surely we must put vehicle users &apos; protection and safety before any economic or political considerations .
in particular , I supported four amendments that I consider essential not only for safeguarding the European wine @-@ growing industry , especially in B@@ urg@@ un@@ dy and Fran@@ che Com@@ t@@ é , but also for making it more competitive .
it still remains to be seen whether , once the &apos; Galileo &apos; project is completed - completed , it should be noted , with public funding - it will not be &apos; offered &apos; at some later date to private capital , on the basis of some public @-@ private partnership for example , with the public party bearing the costs and private capital making the profits .
we want China to focus more sharply on environmental matters , because the environment is a major common global asset .
the EU needs to have a critical engagement that rightly critic@@ ises China where it has gone wrong , where it must go further , at the same time as we engage in a dialogue on tackling global warming , the negative impacts of globalisation , African development and the fight against terrorism .
but I am one of those who believe that the EU should follow a result @-@ oriented approach in promotion of respect for human rights rather than a purely princi@@ pled one and , most importantly , we have to accept that the improvements will only come step @-@ by @-@ step .
willing or unwilling , prepared or un@@ prepared , we have to understand that there are people deprived of fundamental rights , suffering from political re@@ pris@@ als , op@@ pressed by non @-@ democratic regimes or discriminated against on the basis of race , ethnic origin and religion in all parts of the world .
and this pseu@@ do @-@ democratic distortion is to be fo@@ is@@ ted on the people of Britain !
he impli@@ ed that I could repeat D@@ ac@@ ha@@ u .
let us applaud the resolution .
I welcome the unanimous ratification of the SA@@ A by the Monteneg@@ rin Parliament soon the@@ reafter .
it was recognised and valued both cul@@ turally and politically .
that is the real trend in the political development of the Balkans , a trend that creates the possibility to achieve the strategic goal of the majority of nations living in the region , namely closer cooperation with the European Union , up to and including full membership .
so , partly as a symbolic act and partly because we think it is a really important initiative , my group launched a campaign last month to get the tax on con@@ d@@ oms reduced to 5 % throughout the European Union .
the accidents happened in the Ker@@ ch stra@@ it , which conne@@ cts the Black Sea with the Sea of Azo@@ v and represents the main route for the export of Russian oil to Europe .
the recent accidents in the Black Sea have notably involved a special category of vessels , the so @-@ called sea / river oil tan@@ kers , which can only sa@@ il in open seas under certain restrictions .
I know , of course , what the Commissioner will say : &apos; if you were to put together all the European @-@ level guarantee schemes , the total would still be no more than a drop in the ocean by comparison with the sums needed to tackle the crises . &apos;
the report before us today calls for speedy solutions to facilitate the cross @-@ border pas@@ sporting of retail non @-@ harmonised funds .
as an E@@ as@@ ter@@ ner , from an area that is poor in capital , I am not en@@ rap@@ tured by the fact that everyone is now b@@ iting their na@@ ils to see what will happen with hedge funds or private equity when the UCITS is extended because this does not affect our own region at all , or at least will not for a good few years .
all of which inc@@ lines me to full support for the motion and acceptance of the agreement , which will serve both institutions well .
with this regulation , I hope that in most circumstances we would be able to do much better .
individual identification cannot function properly without electronic identification .
so we did warn you and you would not listen .
for this to happen there needs to be the political will to set up a competitive framework for our European textile industries .
we face trade and investment restrictions , ram@@ pan@@ t counterfeiting and regulatory barriers in virtually every sector .
so it is a deal worth doing , and , if we can get it right , I think it is a win @-@ win situation .
I should like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Mandelson in particular for always having backed this .
first , in heading 1a , commitment appropriations are adjusted as follows :
I wish to say : it is every man and every woman &apos;s absolute right to be able to express their opinion in this House .
the sub@@ ur@@ bs of Paris bur@@ ned , but the problem apparently lies with the small non@@ con@@ for@@ mist minority that has become the b@@ ane of the life of this lo@@ f@@ ty institution .
the lack of any precise definition of political extremism and xenophobia in the resolution , which is intended to combat extremism , leads us to abstain from the vote on this matter .
a Free Trade Agreement between Korea and the European Union could constitute a basis for the promotion of high social and environmental standards and could serve as an example for other agreements that are currently at the negotiation stage .
this should not , however , ab@@ solve us Europeans of our responsibilities .
this is , unfortunately , more the norm than the exception .
these consequences were enforced abor@@ tions , muti@@ lations and murders on a large scale , and large @-@ scale instances of suicide among these women .
it is for that reason that if there is a symbolic moment of this Presidency it will be when the Portuguese and other politicians , and the President of the Commission , are present at those borders to mark the moment when controls are abolished , thereby realising a European dream and aspi@@ ration to create that area of freedom of movement and security that the Schengen area represents .
Bolkeste@@ in was also decided quickly one day before the summer break and subsequently cost us the ratification of the Constitution .
Mr Só@@ crates , I have no doubt you are delighted with your Presidency and the fact that last Thursday you got this Treaty signed in that mag@@ nific@@ ent mon@@ as@@ tery in Lisbon .
we proposed a document defining the result to be achieved - as Article 2@@ 49 of the Treaty says - and , in exchange , to leave to the Member States the choice of form and methods .
- ( MT ) May I express my thanks for your good wishes to my country , Malta , which together with Cyprus joined the Euro area two weeks ago , bringing the number of countries using the Euro as their currency to 15 .
we cannot allow Tibet or any other 21st century nation to be ext@@ ingu@@ ished by a dictatorship , a ty@@ rann@@ y , or by the sa@@ dis@@ tic desire to exert political domin@@ ance .
it is my hope that the intercultural dialogue of 2008 will make an effective contribution to fostering peace , one of the European Union &apos;s fundamental values .
I would appreciate it if these points were not forgotten in the course of the im@@ passion@@ ed debate to come .
the results speak for themselves .
the Commission proposes far @-@ reaching legislation focused on compulsory reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from engine exhaus@@ ts , improved vehicle technology and use of biofuels .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking my fellow Members for this truly fair and open debate .
twenty @-@ seven different tax systems hamper the smooth operation of the internal market and constitute an obstacle for businesses , especially small ones , as Commissioner Kovács has said .
rapporteur . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I just wanted to say that we are using more words than necessary here .
I would also have liked to include the smaller installations within the scope of the directive , for these are often in unfair competition with the larger airports because they massi@@ vely promote the low @-@ budget carriers .
( PT ) Mr President , in this one @-@ minute speech I would like to highlight the amendments we tabled in order to ensure that this directive takes explicit account of the constraints suffered by regions that are permanently at a geographical and natural disadvantage , such as the outermost regions , particularly in accordance with Article 299 ( 2 ) of the EC Treaty .
New@@ cas@@ tle Air@@ port in the UK , for example , with 5.@@ 2 million passengers , still has to compete with other airports all over the north of England to attract business .
for the last 30 years the European Union &apos;s policies and legislation on the protection of public health and the environment have made significant progress in reducing the risks posed by chemical substances , not only in the European Union , but also worldwide .
it would also have been a very questionable interpretation of the health and environment legislation if we had continued exporting when on the one hand we are laying down a new safety land@@ mark by way of the latest pesticide certification , while on the other we are doing the very opposite with our exports .
such vulnerable groups include migrant workers , who are often exploited , as well as young and ageing workers , who need special attention , and those with disabilities .
guaranteeing equal social coverage of all workers regardless of the form of contract , speeding up bureaucratic procedures for small and medium @-@ sized undertakings , and providing incentives , including financial incentives , for training are aspects of primary importance .
this is so @-@ called &quot; light &quot; industry , where most of the workers are women , and wages are also low because there are supposedly no risks involved .
as the Commissioner said , it is true that this is very old legislation .
in some countries instances of criminal treatment of Polish workers have come to light , forcing them into sla@@ ve labour .
I believe the compromise which we developed last week and which the Liberals have now endorsed too is a thoroughly reasonable one and that we have come up with a common solution which is te@@ nable and consumer @-@ friendly . that is the main thing .
consequently , I very much hope that Parliament will be able to adopt this text at second reading tomorrow .
considering how much it costs to build that wall , we could actually allow Christian , Jewish and Muslim children to attend the same school and to live as bro@@ thers and sis@@ ters in a school of peace .
should you not wish to make the changes I have proposed , then in that case - and only in that case - Mr He@@ at@@ on @-@ Har@@ ris , you would be right , we would work to the agenda previously agreed .
it was quite clear to me at the very beginning that if I had my way I would have a list that was endless , because human rights are so important : they are paramount and are the very reason that the institutions were established so that we never got back to those conditions that created the Second World War and the appalling shadow that was cast across so many different peoples and so many different minorities .
when a study that had been commissioned showed that violence against Jews in Europe was mainly perpetrated by young Muslims , the director of the Centre promptly con@@ signed it to the b@@ in .
the most difficult problem we had in the committee related to adoption .
we cannot press unilaterally for an increase in the birth rate whilst paying sc@@ ant attention to ensuring the conditions necessary for the living conditions , equal opportunities and spiri@@ tual and physical development of the children that have been born .
( PL ) Mr President , first of all I would like to express my total agreement with the statement by Mrs Fol@@ ty@@ n @-@ K@@ ub@@ ic@@ ka .
as far as child pornography is concerned , I am very much in favour of the European Commission &apos;s initiative , in cooperation with some banking institutions and credit card companies , to try to exclude pages that sell child pornography from online payment systems .
the proposal in the report , for example , to create a uniform classification and labelling system in the EU for the sale and distribution of audiovisual content and video games intended for minors is a worthy one .
politicians , all politicians , have finally understood that more needs to be done ; for over the past 14 years , whether as a member of the government or the opposition , whether at local , regional or national level , none of the political parties has managed to come up with firm , determined and coherent answers .
CO@@ NA@@ I , the body which brings together producers and users of packaging , which is responsible for re @-@ use of material other than w@@ et waste , ends up by collecting the price in the South and then paying it to the North , which as usual profits from the situation to drain funds from the South and send them to the North .
my own question to you is this : do you yourself have a plan for achieving this 30 % reduction personally in your own sphere of activity ?
what proof do you have that they are removed absolutely from the market ?
it includes some principles to guide financial services providers and announ@@ ces some practical initiatives .
it has asked Ireland to take , within two months , the necessary steps to subject the V@@ H@@ I to those supervisory and prudential rules of Community law for which it for@@ mer@@ ly enjoyed the exemption .
in this context , great importance also attaches to efforts to reconcile work , family life and lifelong learning .
in future , those people who have never stopped learning will certainly have an advantage in adapting to the rapid changes with which we are faced on a daily basis .
the debate is closed .
remote @-@ sen@@ sing techniques make it possible , among other applications , to monitor cultivation and to forecast harves@@ ts .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , today &apos;s debate raises the issue of unequal treatment of Polish Members of the European Parliament and Members of the Se@@ j@@ m as regards election criteria , as well as that of loss of mandate .
Mr Liber@@ adz@@ ki has prepared an excellent report .
in writing . - ( DE ) Un@@ scrupulous traders are trying to evade the special requirements that apply to the transport of chemicals and other hazardous goods , requirements such as specialised driver training , labelling and the like .
I wonder from where the rapporteur got the proposal , which is environmentally and technically inf@@ erior , without having been influenced by the car industry lobby .
in writing . - Mr President , I am delighted to congratulate our rapporteur on a balanced report taking account of an important strategy , as the EU has been instrumental in raising health and safety standards at work across the EU and the Community strategy to 2012 looks set to continue that work .
investing in people is the su@@ rest way to guarantee our citizens that they will remain employed in spite of moving from job to job .
it expects 2008 to be a year of progress .
if you say something , you should remind Member States of the joint legal obligation to legislate as close to the citizens as possible .
this indicates to us that you propose postponing controversial or difficult issues .
there remains much to be done to persuade Member States to reform their economies and I hope that the Presidency will advocate greater liberalisation , reforms to labour markets and ensure European business benefits from globalisation .
does the Slovenian Presidency want to take up these words ?
- ( PL ) Mr President , Prime Minister , Slovenia &apos;s Presidency is facing many ambitious tasks .
President of the Commission . - Mr President , thank you for this very interesting debate , where I think there was a very large consensus supporting the priorities that were presented by the Slovenian Presidency .
oral explanations of vote
as in the field of consumer protection , so in the fields of justice and home affairs , foreign affairs , defence and all the rest .
this is not , of course , because I oppose children &apos;s rights - far from it .
in the border area between Germany , the Czech Republic and Austria , for example , prostitution involving women and increasingly children increased enormously after the opening of the borders .
today , therefore , I would like to congratulate Parliament for the positive agreement reached on this legislation .
we in Europe are bound to follow the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child .
I therefore voted in favour of this report .
for too long we have sun@@ g the pra@@ ises of that country as an example of democracy , forgetting the social inequalities and the corruption that was ri@@ fe throughout the country : 16 billion dollars in aid have been received by that country since independence and there have been just four presidents .
the payment decision had been delayed to await the results and recommendations of the third review of the PR@@ B@@ S programme by the International Monetary Fund .
Europol &apos;s current legal framework , an international convention , moreover impe@@ des any process of updating or modi@@ fying powers , with delays of years .
Madam President , what we have heard in this debate is the usual confusion between cooperation and integration .
in addition , all the parties must accept the decision of the electoral Commission that the election of 18 February should be carried out with dignity and restraint .
the judiciary is another key democratic institution .
your protest is noted , Mr Van Or@@ den .
this is part of the answer to the question .
naturally , it is proper that peace @-@ keeping and peace @-@ making operations are about cooperation under the pat@@ ron@@ age of the United Nations .
however , we shall therefore always let the Commission know what we believe is particularly important .
it was agreed that this question would be debated again at some point during 2008 , not necessarily in the first half of the year .
but we would like to see these matters given great priority .
I am delighted that , as the living conscience of the European Parliament , the two Hungarian Members of Roma de@@ sc@@ ent , Mrs Járóka and Mrs M@@ oh@@ á@@ c@@ si , amongst others , have raised this question , because we rightly condemned the events in Italy in November .
now , in January 2008 , as rapporteur for Black Sea Cooperation , I have the privilege of opening this plenary debate to discuss Parliament &apos;s recommendations on developing synergy in the Black Sea area , proposed in April by the European Commission .
at the same time we must acknowledge that the other international operators have an interest in the region and we have acknowledged the fact that the European Union could not possibly move its priorities without cooperation with the other global actors .
the European Parliament sends out loud and clear messages with this report : the message that the EU should get strongly involved in the South Caucasus , the message that the EU can play a decisive role in the region and the message that the EU should increase financial and technical assistance to help Georgia , Armenia and Azerbaijan to reform their administration and to develop their democratic institutions , to encourage civil society to intera@@ ct and to strengthen these nations &apos; commitments to the European values of respect for human rights , fundamental freedoms and the rule of law .
that is not the case at present .
I should stress once again , the countries of South Caucasus - Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia , are very different in terms of culture , customs , religion and geo@@ politics .
in other words , Black Sea synergy should express itself simply in the identification and syn@@ thesis of multilateral undertakings , by identifying them with the best interests of both the Black Sea region and the entire eastern part of an integrated Europe .
I fully agree that a separate policy , perhaps even a strategy , should be developed for the Black Sea region , and I would like to stress once again its importance .
I do not agree that there needs to be any handi@@ cap or under @-@ representation in the new technologies , because ladies have the bra@@ ins , the intelligence and the know @-@ how to more than make their worth felt .
despite coer@@ cive policies based on &apos; positive action &apos; - a misleading formulation , since what it really means is compulsory quotas - gender mind@@ sets have great difficulty moving forward .
we all - including employers and industri@@ alists - must respect maternity and paternity leave as fundamental social values .
women have the highest potential to accelerate the development of our high @-@ tech industry .
Madam President , I would like to throw some light on one particular aspect today .
I voted against this proposal because , whilst the committee in question may be called the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , it does not offer liberties to civilians , it does not offer justice , and it inter@@ fe@@ res in home affairs .
it is a pre@@ pos@@ te@@ rous proposal and utterly unnecessary .
however , social rights , including the rights of workers , have not been regarded as a priority , even at a time when fundamental social rights are being called into question by the policies promoted by the EU .
the rapporteur calls for support , especially for SMEs , to enable the relatively high level of female employment to be retained , particularly in the case of women who find themselves in an unfortunate professional situation .
the hope that the I@@ O@@ C decision would help improve things in the Middle Kingdom has been an illusion .
yesterday the EU troika carried out a firm dé@@ mar@@ che to the Chinese authorities asking for his immediate release .
the trau@@ ma of rape is aggra@@ vated by the fact that many of the victims then suffer social discrimination and o@@ stra@@ c@@ ism by their families and communities .
I call on the European Commission to consider effective methods of bringing pressure to bear on the Egyptian authorities in order to halt this process .
the final drafting of the document is being completed .
that , Mr Barroso , is why we need transparent and coherent international agreements and why we need them as quickly as possible .
we must stand firm and ensure that the legislative frameworks ensure responsibility and justice in everything and for everyone , but particularly with regard to the environment .
however , I would rather have seen the social dimension given a more prominent role in relation to energy prices , food prices and local involvement , but these are just some of the areas that we will be working on further in Parliament .
I would like to thank you for that .
it is our responsibility to ensure that all options are explored , none to the exclusion of others .
you had the proof of that a few days ago .
notwithstanding information from various sources , including the National intelligence estimate report , we cannot today be certain that Iran will not develop such weapons .
at the moment there is a discussion with Dr El Bar@@ ade@@ i and the people in charge of the nuclear dossier to see whether these &apos; outstanding issues &apos; can be resolved .
we hope that the process of negotiating a solution will be continued .
why is Iran pressing ahead with uranium enrichment when it has no operational nuclear power stations or even plans to build them in the future ?
the question now - and I completely support Javier Solana in this - is : what can we do in order to really make a difference again ?
I am sorry , Mr Davies ; I am sorry , Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit : if Hamas stops the ro@@ ckets , Israel will lift the blockade - it is as simple as that .
Parliament fortunately is able to talk about it .
the Czech Government does not communicate with the public ; the Czech Government does not inform the Members of the Czech Parliament , the Czech Government does everything behind the backs of the Czech people .
discussing this matter was an extremely demanding task for the German and especially Portuguese Presidencies in 2007 .
they offered cheaper services , but sele@@ ctively , choosing the bus@@ i@@ est parts of the postal delivery service and offering poorer working conditions and conditions of employment .
at the same time , I would suggest that before 2012 an analysis be made of the operation of the postal services market in those countries that have already adopted the new rules , with a view to identifying and preventing any irregularities in the remaining countries .
this is just one of a multi@@ tude of EU laws that have damaged , and will continue to damage , my country .
it is necessary to draw up plans for a cost @-@ oriented universal postal service , since the concept is viewed differently in different Member States .
we all know that some of our partners will be hard to convince .
Commissioner , you can be very sure of our support for your approach .
President @-@ in @-@ Office . - ( SL ) Al@@ low me a brief response to some views expressed in this very interesting discussion .
secondly , there is no evidence that mankind is domin@@ antly causing climate changes .
as is shown by the data for 2005 , however , the United States has increased its greenhouse gas emissions by 16.@@ 4 % , while the EU is reaching the Kyoto target and in 2005 em@@ itted in total 7.@@ 9 % less than 1990 levels .
this multinational employed over 6 000 workers in its factories in O@@ va@@ r and Ser@@ z@@ ed@@ o , for which it received millions of euros in Community aid .
I further recommend that the document that is being prepared also address the cost of SMS and roaming data services .
this pressure has resulted in the Commissioner au@@ g@@ menting his staff in the area of energy efficiency and , I understand , setting up a special unit to follow up on the energy efficiency plan , under@@ s@@ cor@@ ing the priority the Commission is finally giving to energy efficiency in order to contribute to a reduction of our CO2 emissions and to help tackle the critical issue of climate change .
now , Mrs Hübner announced in discussions with the Regional Policy Committee last week that the regulation was to be revised and greater priority given to these issues in the 2007 @-@ 2013 programmes .
the proposal that the energy production industry will have to purchase all its CO2 emission allowances by auction as from 2013 will cause a massive increase in energy prices that will be particularly pain@@ fully felt by the domestic economies .
having said this , I would like to warn Mr Schly@@ ter to t@@ read carefully , because after the criticism he made in his speech of fishermen and the sel@@ f@@ less , age @-@ old tradition of fishing , I am not sure what we are doing here or if Mr Schly@@ ter is going to put the Commissioner , the members of the Fisheries Committee and fishermen out of a job .
national rules need to identify the ex ante check procedure , including the designation of a competent authority that would receive the request of the regional or local authority to participate in an EG@@ G@@ C .
( NL ) Mr President , the EG@@ T@@ C , as has already been said several times , is an extremely useful instrument particularly for border regions .
the second element , Mr President , is even more significant from our point of view .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , we are looking at the progress that the European Union has made towards becoming this area of freedom , security and justice .
of course , as we well know , the Internet is used by terrorists , but it is also used by millions of innocent citizens for discussion .
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Portuguese Presidency for enlar@@ ging the Schengen area , and at the same time appeal for a regular evaluation of the functioning of this system .
I have given examples to show how , in this spirit , Mr Deprez &apos;s proposal , which I think should be welcomed , is to get together and define in concrete terms what can be done immediately because it is ready - and there are many things we can conclude during the Slovenian Presidency - and what we can continue to discuss between now and , say , June 2009 .
it has already been agreed in a compromise , so I agree to withdraw it .
I understand about the amendments to this report in terms of cooperation between the different special intervention units , but we have to remember that this is actually an amendment to the Prüm Treaty .
that is why I do not like the fact that the resolution , which is an ar@@ tic@@ ula@@ te document but only general in nature , mentions only one concrete example : the Czech Republic , and more precisely the concentration camp in L@@ ety .
the first available data on the priority given to projects involving new Member States demonstrates this .
I have therefore voted in favour of Amendment 10 , which rejects the common position of the Council .
in writing . - ( PT ) O@@ ver@@ all , this resolution merely repea@@ ts general ideas , and is inadequate in various areas .
I welcome moves by some retailers to stop selling such hea@@ ters in response to consumer pressure , and I would not buy one myself .
the European Socialist Group has already initiated its action plan , the first stage of which was to produce a resolution with e@@ minent experts from the other parties .
it is true that it would also be helpful to have a consolidated treaty that shows what the Treaties will look like when this Treaty is ratified - I say &apos; when &apos; it is ratified , because I am sure it will be - and which citizens will find much easier to read .
the cause of their loom@@ ing extinction is the illegal po@@ aching of ti@@ gers in India .
what we need is solidarity with these children and these countries rather than os@@ ten@@ ta@@ tious cl@@ out that degra@@ des their dignity .
a state is sovereign when it has full powers of authority .
this is urgent and necessary , and we insist it must be done .
( PL ) Mr President , clarity and transparency are fundamental principles of life in society .
finally , despite a slight improvement in recovery activity , recovery is still a problem which causes immense damage to the Community budget .
Mr President , the Commissioner said the same thing : the report does indeed overla@@ p with the discharge procedure .
that is why we are having this discussion as part of the current discharge procedure .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , in my opinion , the Community Customs Code as presented by the Commission and debated by Parliament and the Council has proved an exemplary procedure .
we have devoted time and resources in the last three years to better understanding this phenomenon , its trends , its manifes@@ tations and its dynamics .
the Union and also Commissioner Frattini have placed the fight against terrorism at the top of their priorities .
the fact that the perpetrators of the terrible outra@@ ges we have witnessed in recent years were born or grew up in Europe is a sh@@ ri@@ ll wake @-@ up call urging us also to look at our own societies with more critical eyes .
the next item is the report by Mr Guar@@ dan@@ s Camb@@ ó , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on the EU &apos;s strategy to deliver market access for European companies .
if we are able to give European industry better access to international markets , we will enable companies to grow , invest in know @-@ how and technology , and create more jobs .
the quality of trade should be improved and priority given to creating equal opportunities for market access .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( SV ) Thank you , Mr Mandelson .
you have one of the most difficult portfolios to deal with .
therefore , what I want to ask you is this : was the Commission &apos;s intention in not initiating any cases ( not Portuguese , but from other countries ) , in not initiating any anti @-@ dumping or anti @-@ subsidy investigations , to wait for a decision on the review process in hand or was its intention to shel@@ ve those cases which it had already started to investigate ?
therefore , through this decision we have requested that the Commission carry out an investigation into how the market operates and undertake a thorough assessment of consumer safety mark@@ ings in general .
I would also like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen for their ti@@ reless support and advice in the shaping of the final agreement between the European Parliament and the Council .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . - ( DE ) Madam President , may I add my congratulations to the many that have already been expressed to the rapporteurs .
the second condition - and we are well on our way to fulfilling it - is that we should eventually have a European safety mark which is at least equal if not sup@@ erior to these national symbols .
the level of commercial experience in this Chamber is pi@@ tiful .
the aim of the various proposed measures is to encourage people to buy products and , when they buy , to purchase European ones .
I think this is particularly important , now that we are also to review the toy Safety Directive in the light of the problems on the toy market which have been in the spot@@ light recently .
I welcome the substantial cooperation we have received from everyone in completing this - some would say - difficult task relatively efficiently and quickly .
your apolo@@ gies are accepted and noted .
in writing . - I welcome the report on exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents .
the extent to which the excessive complexity and in@@ adequacy of the rules and the delay in awarding funds contribute towards the irregularities identified must also be assessed .
in writing . - ( PT ) This EP own @-@ initiative report is a genuine reposi@@ tory of goals and initiatives for liberalising world trade - whether in goods , services or capital - led by the EU and the European Commission , a virtually om@@ ni@@ poten@@ t body in common commercial policy with the new draft Treaty , which makes this an exclusive EU competence .
we must dis@@ pel the my@@ th that growth is the enemy of the environment .
international terrorism is one of the greatest global threats to our open societies .
in the Middle East , Europe must offer political and financial support for the difficult process of negotiating peace between the Israelis and Palestinians .
while the Internet and the inability to impose any regulation right from the outset have meant that the degree of freedom of our society has been positively enhanced , they have exposed everyone to the uncontrolled risk of terrorism , which , as a result of cry@@ p@@ to@@ graphy as well , is increasingly threatening democracy and everyone &apos;s freedom .
( SV ) Prime Minister , the fact that Sweden got a new government in autumn 2006 did not pass un@@ noticed as far as commitment to the EU is concerned .
despite the wish@@ ful thinking of many Euro@@ sceptics , Europe has even reached agreement on the new Reform Treaty .
how can it be that Sweden is heading in precisely the opposite direction ?
I think that many of you here today have represented your voters well , and I too am prepared to do it in various ways .
the Commission did good work in preparing the Lisbon package published in December .
in making that proposal , the Commission was not driven by dog@@ matism or ob@@ st@@ in@@ acy .
while some top b@@ os@@ ses have opened their gold par@@ ac@@ hu@@ tes , workers and the general public are paying for the mess .
that will only be possible if everyone who can play a part actually does so and if we work to guarantee a good living environment .
we say that employees have to be flexible .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , wanting a knowledge economy is a good thing , but it is not enough .
growth is declining at present and inflation is rising .
you say this because compared with the situation of the American economy , yes , our economy is fundamentally much s@@ oun@@ der .
but I would invite the Commission and the Council to stand back from the detail of this document and look it as a whole .
it was repeatedly argued that knowledge is not an area for which the Member States should hand over responsibility , it is their own hol@@ y prec@@ inc@@ t .
if we jointly decide to try to change those priorities , that would be a good thing .
subject : EASA air@@ worthiness assessment procedures
Member of the Commission . - ( RO ) The Commission &apos;s Communication , named the European indicator of Langu@@ age competence , adopted in 2005 , proposed a detailed strategic approach for conducting a European survey on language competence , an instrument that will allow the collection of the necessary data to prepare a European indicator in this field and improve knowledge regarding the teaching of foreign languages .
does the Commission believe this un@@ fairly discrimin@@ ates against small but worthwhile projects ?
the problem is not becoming smaller , it is continuing to grow , so I believe these programmes should continue .
it is , however , very unlikely that the region will be able to attain the goals and it is obvious that poverty continues to be one of the most pressing issues in the countries in the region , except those which have oil .
clearly there is much progress still to be made before Uzbekistan can be considered a properly democratic country .
the EU must accept its responsibility for our common energy security .
poverty eradication is highly important and this is one of the major parts that we focus on in the country strategies .
what are the essential elements , then ?
this is especially important , if we bear in mind the lessons learnt from the experience of the European Constitution .
I know that the United Kingdom is a stran@@ gely insu@@ lar place , and it is true that even its Government is too frigh@@ tened to face up to nation@@ alists and xen@@ opho@@ bes and has insisted on asser@@ ting self @-@ defe@@ ating opt @-@ outs from key areas of European unity , sometimes pushing Britain to the margins .
this opportunity , and the passage that refers to it , opens up new ways for Europe to translate the rhetoric usually associated with these issues into reality .
I do not believe that what we have before us will help us particularly in that great challenge .
that is the real , mag@@ nific@@ ent difference compared with what has constituted European history thus far , and all this on the basis of equality of the States and people groups .
( PL ) Mr President , after two years of discussion on the controversial treaty that was rejected in France and Holland , we have succeeded in reaching a compromise and accepting a text that is supposed to save the peoples of Europe .
by endo@@ wing the Union with legal personality and abolishing the pillars , the Treaty of Lisbon gives Europe a definite political dimension .
then there is the expectation that it will put the European Union in a better position to live up to its task in the world , a position from which it will be able to deal with the consequences of globalisation , and so on and so forth .
( NL ) Mr President , in addition to social and economic cohesion , this treaty lays down the third objective , territorial cohesion , expressly for the whole Union .
rapporteur . - Mr President , this debate has shown that , in this Parliament , the elected representatives of the peoples of our 27 countries approve this Treaty by a very large majority .
this also applies to the PSE Group Amendment 13 , and I would like to ask the groups to vote as I said , in order to avoid duplication of the text .
this is guaranteed to bring even more la@@ x@@ ity than we are already seeing , and that is probably the last thing we need .
in writing . - ( PL ) In the final vote on the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo on the Treaty of Lisbon , I abstained .
moreover , we have voted in a document that we are not yet familiar with , since there is still no printed consolidated text of the Treaty in the languages of the Member States .
pressure is now also being applied to strengthen the external component of the Lisbon Strategy , that is , to impose on third countries , many of which are less developed , economic and political conditions requiring the opening up of those markets in the interests of the large European multinationals .
we have chosen to vote against this report because it deals with areas for which the Member States have political responsibility .
finally , Central Asia will not benefit from effective integration into the world economic system until all five countries in the area have joined the WTO ( the Kyrgy@@ z Republic has been a member since 1998 ) .
having followed many of the Commission &apos;s infringement proceedings , I can assure the Commission that , when it interven@@ es , citizens , and even the public authorities , feel strengthened by the action of the Commission in this area .
Mr S@@ mit@@ h mentioned that the law must also be straightforward and applicable , particularly in regard to environmental legislation .
of course , we also require the Kosovo authorities to implement the Ahtis@@ aari proposals , to make genuine investment in a multi@@ ethnic state and to put in place sufficient guarantees for Serbi@@ ans living in Kosovo .
thirdly , Mr President , either the European Union lear@@ ns once and for all that union is our strength and fragmentation is our weakness , or we will have to renoun@@ ce our vo@@ cation of international leadership in this globalised world and conf@@ ine ourselves to being what The E@@ con@@ omist described us as : the 21st century &apos;s most prosperous third world region .
I am glad that Kosovo is now independent as , after decades of oppression , the Kosov@@ ars finally have their own free , democratic state , having been op@@ pressed for decades and more recently finding themselves the victim of genocide that was stopped only with international assistance .
the EU has a very important role to play in creating a society in which all citizens are equal and where minority communities have extensive rights to maintain and develop their identity , as well as a right to run their own public administration : this means extensive autonomy for the Serbian community .
regional tensions are now threatening to increase , the nation is frustra@@ ted by unemployment , and corruption and crime have taken hold .
however , the pledges on human rights commitments will be important steps towards more responsibility for the candidate countries and , as I have said before , this is an important step .
Mon@@ ks and civilians who had fled Burma since September gave CS@@ W first @-@ hand accounts of the regime &apos;s bru@@ tality against the pro @-@ democracy movement .
these are two factors of women &apos;s eman@@ cip@@ ation .
the basis for ensuring the rights of children , however , is that future generations should also feel responsible for the world outside the family .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , this is a report on preparing for demographic change .
it is a symbol of dead men wal@@ king .
the majority represent projects which in fact are of no particularly great benefit .
as we know , new and for@@ mi@@ dable challenges are now loom@@ ing together with those we are already aware of , and cohesion policy must make a major worthwhile contribution to their consideration , to allow us to move forward to the Europe we want to see : that is , an effective , solidarity @-@ conscious Europe .
territorial cohesion so far even lacks a clear definition .
as that will probably not be the case , a different approach with a larger role for Member States is desirable .
so these subsidies - for that is what they are - will be taken from those countries still receiving them and from an ever smaller po@@ t as the chil@@ l economic win@@ ds from the USA reach us .
I welcome the integrated approach advocated by the rapporteur , also as regards the challenges arising in relation to rural development .
once again , the European Parliament is confirming its very clear position on the importance and role of the cohesion policy , which brings Europe closer to its citizens .
I can assure you that the Commission will also continue to look into appropriate indicators to complement both the GDP and employment indicators , and will in the fifth Cohesion Report propose a new com@@ posite type of indicator .
&apos;@@ 4 . calls on Israel to cease military actions killing and endan@@ gering civilians , and extra@@ judicial targeted killings ; &apos;
yet it is precisely the citizens , whose sub@@ missions provide an irre@@ pla@@ ceable source of information and alert us to breaches or non @-@ application of Community law , not some interest groups with their own agenda .
this is a humanitarian disaster in the making .
women are expected to be willing to bring more children into the world while carrying out a professional activity over a longer period of time .
support is already being made available , but it must be sc@@ aled up .
genuine dialogue between the Belarusian authorities and the European Union should therefore be set up quickly .
no , all parties , including the government soldiers , have systematically committed crimes against humanity .
the PPE @-@ DE Group has moved that the second item , on Afghanistan , be replaced by a new item entitled &apos; arrests of demonstrators following the presidential elections in Russia &apos; .
at the donors &apos; conference in Paris last December , where the European Parliament was also represented , the European Union pledged EUR 5@@ 40 million for 2008 to support the process launched in Anna@@ polis .
we should not get into the blame game ; we can all go back over what happened in Gaza over the last months , with the cy@@ nical exploitation by the Israeli authorities , cutting off water , power and food supplies to people , literally attempting to star@@ ve them into submission .
the station is backed by Poland , Ireland , Lithuania , the Czech Republic and the USA .
in conclusion , we will be negotiating with the United States .
why , however , are we discussing this issue in this House today ?
. - ( SV ) Mr President , the consumer is defen@@ ce@@ less on the Internet .
ladies and gentlemen , this has been a lengthy process .
( PL ) Madam President , air transport needs defined legal rules , but they must be as flexible as possible and at the same time sufficiently harmonised , especially with regard to flight security .
rapporteur . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the report on sustainable European transport policy has now reached the stage of debate in plenary .
that does not fit in with a package that is arguing for sustainable transport over forms that are not friendly to the environment .
our hauliers should not be punished for the fact that the infrastructure is less well developed and therefore traffic ja@@ ms are bigger .
it is possible that there will be more exceptional natural phenomena like flooding as a result of global warming .
Romania was confronted with major floods over the last years ; the latest floods occurred recently .
I declare the 2007 @-@ 2008 session of the European Parliament closed .
the social element , however , is central for us as Social Democrats .
how could we use the financial instruments to make Europe a soft power that cannot be ignored , one that provides a democratic model and is not just a cash ti@@ ll ?
( applause )
we will need to invest in quality education and basic research in the future but , as we all know , innovation is Europe &apos;s A@@ chil@@ les he@@ el .
once again , thank you very much .
( loud and sustained applause )
instead , the rise of authoritarian capitalism as an alternative to democratic market economies is probably the latest ideological , intellectual and moral battle that we face .
( FI ) Mr President , firstly I want to thank the rapporteur , Mr Paasi@@ linna , who has done a splendid job .
in writing . - ( PL ) I agree with the proposal to replace certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with Community agreements .
it is attracting interest not only from European researchers and groups of scientists in individual states , but also from practical people - chiefly business people .
the drafting of the article &quot; exceptional expenses in case of crisis &quot; is also much appreciated : we can never be too prepared for such un@@ desired events .
P@@ ig@@ gy @-@ back transport systems should finally become economically advantageous and the eu@@ ph@@ oria of privatisation should not be allowed to reduce public transport to an un@@ attractive patchwork ru@@ g .
in our view the application of Article 69 is insufficient because it is not clearly defined in terms of practical measures , particularly for the sector already mentioned .
we talk here of a soft landing , which for me means pul@@ ling the w@@ ool over the milk producers &apos; eyes .
can I just quickly say that &apos; fa@@ int heart never won fair ma@@ ide@@ n &apos; , and I think we need to be much b@@ older here .
when checking the efficiency of market support instruments and their re@@ organisation and adaptation to the current situation , the particular situation of farming in mountainous regions should not be disregarded in any instance .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) Mr President , I should like also to welcome the President of the Council and the Commissioner .
( the President cut off the speaker )
what we also really need now is a bearing , a clear strategic direction , which is what we lack most at the moment .
( PL ) Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating my fellow Member Mr Goe@@ pel on a fine report and by thanking him for the enormous amount of work he has invested in it .
at the end of this week the European Council will address this problem and , I hope , will agree with the progress achieved .
I think that it is natural that level three committees have two different roles .
Fif@@ thly , I would also like to remind the Member and Parliament that in October 2006 we adopted a strategy for the EU &apos;s external economic action , the Global Europe programme , which establishes a new European trade policy to improve our external competitiveness , with strategies relating to market access , protecting intellectual property rights , open public procurement abroad , trade defence instruments , a policy of not just multilateral agreements in the context of the World Trade Organization , but also a new generation of bilateral trade agreements that complement the efforts to move forward in the multilateral negotiations in the Doha Round .
it must also be in conformity with the Community &apos;s international obligations , including word Trade Organisation rules .
in short , the results relating to last year &apos;s projects are not yet available .
it could be applied to EU products coming from different Member States , not only those that have adopted national safeguard measures against GMOs .
that concludes Question Time .
these are the reasons behind the lack of development of infrastructure and communications as well as the provision of education , health care and various other services that will not come into being while there is a lack of economic development .
I close my statement by saying that rural areas can transform , by means of investments , the available lands into industrial par@@ ks to offer jobs .
Cu@@ mu@@ lative social disadvantage en@@ gen@@ ders social tensions , as the social welfare system is at its most inadequate in the most disadvantaged communities , while the worst infrastru@@ ctural deficiencies are also to be found here .
I should like to take the opportunity to put a couple of questions to Commissioner Fischer Boel , who is with us this evening : does the Commission have a strategy for reducing the ever growing waste mountain in the EU ?
to par@@ aph@@ rase former President Clin@@ ton : it &apos;s the sun , stu@@ pid !
some active components and bacteria contained in agricultural and commun@@ al waste , if spread , could jeopardise both public health and the natural environment .
it is rather sta@@ ggering to note how poor the national statistics - and , consequently , the European statistics - are , particularly as regards buildings and consumption by household and office appliances , and also as regards transport .
we all know how energy prices are influenced by the different sectors .
it is reasonable that , first , we collect the statistics on the bioci@@ de products only .
Madam President , I just wanted to stress the importance of one point that applies to this report as well as to the previous report .
our debate today and the discussion with the President of the European Parliament at the European Council session are undoubtedly two important factors in achieving this aim .
( applause )
economic growth is slow@@ ing , ha@@ un@@ ted by the impact on GDP of past banking @-@ sector crises in Sweden or Finland or Hungary or Spain , to say nothing of Argentina or Japan .
you can see our proposal on my website .
the Court of Justice leaves no room for doubt .
( NL ) I am very surprised that the situation in Turkey has not been placed at the top of this week &apos;s agenda .
my final point relates to finance market stability .
( DE ) Mr President , anyone who takes a look at the draft Council conclusions can see that the language on the internal energy market is extremely weak .
we now have 10 objectives from the Commission , which are mentioned in passing here , but in fact we need to focus on what the priorities are .
( PT ) I want to start by wishing the Slovenian Presidency every success and to say that I strongly believe that the next European Council should concentrate on economic and development issues .
the fact is that it would be useful because energy efficiency certainly is and will be an important element of the climate and energy package debated by the European Council .
( applause from the right )
the next item is voting time .
Mr President , I voted for the Goe@@ pel report , not because I support the common agricultural policy but because I support its reform : in particular , its focus on up@@ land farms .
exposure to pesticides can also increase the risk of as@@ th@@ ma in children .
so far the experience has not been entirely positive .
in writing . - On behalf of the British Labour members I wish to explain the reasons why we voted as we did on this important report .
in writing . - As highlighted in Mr Tabaj@@ di &apos;s report on Sustainable agriculture and biogas , there is a large potential for biogas that the EU has yet to exploit .
today , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary , Slovenia , Bulgaria , Romania and re@@ united Germany are members of the European Union - an achievement which we could only dream of and which has become a reality in our lifetime .
the institutions , however , are not an end in themselves .
five years after the fall of S@@ ad@@ dam H@@ us@@ se@@ in we may be entering a new phase of a gradual process .
in October last year - and again in January with Ms Gomes - I had the opportunity to address the Iraqi Parliament in plenary session .
the European Union must actively support the institutional development of Iraq , strongly rooted in its realities , with due respect of the historical , religious , cultural and identity traditions of the Iraqi people and of all the ethnic and religious communities within its territory .
at the same time we have rehabili@@ tated almost 200 primary healthcare centres and 10 hospitals .
however , at the moment we cannot confid@@ ently predict whether our wish will be fulfilled .
the debate is closed .
please allow me to join the ho@@ ma@@ ge to him by his com@@ ra@@ des @-@ in @-@ arms in the presence of the most senior national and European authorities , especially our High Representative , Javier Solana , and our colleague Karl von Wogau .
at this time , however , we must also deal with the immediate situation , and with this aim in mind the EU is sending 3 700 military personnel to protect the refugees .
there is no relationship whatsoever between the two questions .
it is based on an inter@@ sectoral approach and a strengthened role for young people .
I myself will happily talk about the sil@@ ver economy : if you look closely at the programme , you will see there a matter concerning the quality of life , so what is Europe &apos;s dilemma ?
new assis@@ tive technologies can help solve vision , hearing , mobility and other problems , enabling older people to continue to feel - and indeed be - useful to society .
I was asked by Mr K@@ ras@@ ts whether I was happy for other countries also to participate in the initiative .
( NL ) Mr President , this is the first time that I have spoken in plenary .
there is an old saying about not just giving fish to the hungry but also teaching them how to fish .
( PL ) Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner and our rapporteur for a splendid draft , which I fully support .
detention conditions for women should be included in the European Commission &apos;s annual report on human rights in the EU .
finally - and the European Parliament has produced a study on this - we call as a matter of urgency for improvements in the protection of particularly at @-@ risk groups , especially women who have been the victims of sexual violence .
I hope , as the Commissioner has said , that the new Lisbon Treaty will give us the opportunity to take more action .
I am therefore very pleased to welcome Mrs Bu@@ dre@@ ika@@ it@@ è &apos;s report , which is the first report in the history of the European Parliament that attempts to analyse the commitment of the new Member States to EU development policy and the challenge it involves for them .
everything concerning values , human rights , respect for human rights and combating corruption is obviously important , I agree , but in some cases it can be very difficult and even counterproductive to link development aid to - or make it conting@@ ent on - the strict observance of such values , dear to us though they undoubtedly are .
secondly , we finance specific actions to advance male @-@ female equality .
budget support and other EU programmes will not compensate for the losses inflicted by a rob@@ ber economy .
although people know this from experience and numerous reports , it gets forgotten time after time , even when they are deciding on how to spend EU development cooperation cash .
HIV among women is on the increase , as is sexual violence against women .
high oil prices on national markets and the harmonisation of excise duties in all 27 EU countries will put a brak@@ e on economic growth in countries with a low GN@@ P .
the &apos; former Eastern European countries &apos; certainly had a long tradition of &apos; cooperation &apos; with Africa , and it may be that the links remain , though in completely different terms .
our country &apos;s own experience and its ties with the Iraqi people aler@@ ted us to the human , military and moral disaster that the intervention would bring .
as the treatment of offenders does not fall under the powers of the EU , we have chosen to vote against the report .
we have a duty today , in our contacts with all the parties involved in the Armenian conflict , to reflect that fear .
the demonstrations following the placing of Lev@@ on ter @-@ Pet@@ ro@@ sian under house arrest and their brutal repression on 1 March ended with eight people dead , many others injured , and the declaration of a state of emergency .
in South Sak@@ hal@@ in , an army li@@ eu@@ ten@@ ant attacked a repor@@ ter of the Y@@ u@@ z@@ h@@ no Sak@@ hal@@ in@@ sk T@@ vo@@ ya Gaz@@ eta .
despite this , the 23 @-@ year @-@ old journalist , Per@@ wi@@ z Kam@@ bak@@ h@@ sh , has been sentenced to death in an unlawful trial , and his legal rights are being denied him .
- Before voting commen@@ ced :
Seven@@ teen years later , with the European Council calling for adoption of the political agreement by June of this year , we are getting closer to the target .
the third area where we will swiftly bring forward proposals is the Mediterranean Union .
green taxes such as reduced VAT rates can also have a similar effect , by stimulating demand for low consumption vehicles and domestic appliances .
unfortunately , we do not , and that is a disadvantage in terms of our competitiveness .
we welcome that .
the European Environment Agency has recently calculated that it would be possible to reduce emissions appreci@@ ably if waste management were more closely linked with policies for alleviating the effects of climate change .
( DE ) Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President of Parliament , I agree with Mr Karas on one point , namely that it is not about the number of times that the word &apos; social &apos; is mentioned but the spirit of the text itself .
that is why the directive that we will propose should bring full legal security to energy @-@ intensive industries because they will already know that either the directive or an equivalent international agreement will apply to them .
over the last six years , insu@@ lation work on two such blocks of fla@@ ts started in the capital of Romania .
the Presidency is of the opinion that a boycott of the Games or other sporting events in the year of intercultural dialogue would not be an appropriate response to unresolved political questions .
at the lighting of the Olympic fla@@ me in Athens - just like a year ago in his speech at Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men square - Mr Ro@@ g@@ ge has once again failed to make any reference whatsoever to the current situation .
Ath@@ le@@ tes can and must decide that for themselves .
I could see how preparations for the Olympic Games are progressing , how they have become a part of life of every Chinese citizen .
despite all difficulties , this initiative enjoys broad support and it represents for the moment the only option to find a solution .
let me end on an optimistic note .
the European Union has to stand by this obligation , and that is something we also make clear in this report .
concerning the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , I can by and large share the assessment of the M@@ eij@@ er report regarding the reform process .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( EL ) Mr President , the rever@@ ber@@ ations from the NATO summit in Bucharest have reached this Parliament .
Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate Hannes Swoboda and Eri@@ k M@@ eij@@ er on their 2007 progress reports on Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia respectively .
we call upon the Members of the European Parliament not to accept formu@@ lations that interfere with the continuing negotiation process , which is entering its most crucial phase .
now I want to encourage the country to implement its own plans and thus pave the way for a positive recommendation from the Commission in the coming autumn .
acceleration is also required in the process of public sector reform , at local and regional authority level .
we all know of the demonstrations that took place in Ljubljana .
the use of the trade defence instruments has to be more accessible , more efficient and more transparent .
this very successful summit , where I also had the honour of addressing the audience , was the first event our new Commissioner for Health attended in this capacity .
the highest percentage of people dying of lun@@ g , pro@@ state or breast cancer is recorded in the new Member States , i.e. in the poorest countries .
I assure you that the Commission will examine these conclusions with great care when analysing areas where it can see policy gaps and when setting out priorities for the coming years .
in other words , we are of the same opinion as to what needs to be done , but , as Mrs Has@@ si said here , whether or not the means proposed are generally adequate to get the European Union on the road to sustainable development we shall certainly have to have very frank discussions together .
I think that thanks mainly to Mr Rübig this Parliament has managed to find a compromise that is acceptable to both the Commission and the Council and should result in adoption of this proposal at first reading .
from now on , SME associations performing research and development can ava@@ il of financial support from Europe and operate within a European network together with other small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
( RO ) starting from the immediate political priorities of the European Union , I would like to empha@@ size some budgetary aspects of this report .
this was the first time that the European Union was able to explicitly recognise last year &apos;s summit conclusions , in the study we presented some time ago , and now in the cultural agenda for the European Union at a time of globalisation .
culture is a significant component of the development of our civilisation .
for many the work is not just a passion - it is a livelihood .
firstly , the regulation should not apply to overseas territories of EU Member States .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) I should like to congratulate Mrs At@@ tw@@ ool@@ l for her hard work to achieve the maximum possible consensus on her report .
the European Parliament &apos;s new powers - giving it , for example , influence over the agricultural budget and over legal policy - will mean adjusting some of its priorities to cope with the new responsibilities .
this Parliament , elected by direct universal suff@@ rage by the citizens of the EU , must be able to do more and better to control the proper use of Community funds spent , this time by the executive agencies .
however , the environment has reached a par@@ l@@ ous state , as can be seen from natural disasters , and a credit crisis has been reached .
the mandate of the Committee on Climate Change is extremely clear : it has to analy@@ ze the present situation , to make a list of possibilities for combating climate change and formulate concrete proposals regarding the European Union policy in this field , at all decision levels .
I also support the requirement that the Council should lower the thresholds for mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund and that the Commission should carry out a study on the economics of adaptation , and develop scenarios establishing a balance sheet of adaptation costs and benefits .
we firmly believe that a rapid and brave switch to more modern and efficient technologies will not only benefit our climate and provide the basis for a global solution , but will also be advantageous for the economy since it will make us much less dependent on imports of fossil fuels .
we will thus once again be revising the Structural Funds Regulation in order to achieve more energy efficiency .
I would like to speak for longer , because this is a very big issue and many questions were asked , but I would like to thank you again for your contributions .
13 .
Mr President , as you see I still have five seconds left to wish &apos; bu@@ on appe@@ ti@@ to &apos; to all of my colleagues who have been kind enough to stay behind to listen to my statement .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the O@@ <<unk>> ý report in order that decisions taken regarding the movement of pe@@ ts be taken only after full consideration of the scientific assessments .
in addition , on 9 October 2007 Portugal submitted a request for mobilisation of the Fund for 1 546 redundancies in the automobile sector , specifically for workers made redundant by Opel in Az@@ am@@ bu@@ ja , Al@@ co@@ a Fu@@ j@@ iku@@ ra in Sei@@ x@@ al and Joh@@ n@@ son controls in Por@@ ta@@ leg@@ re .
the Commission proposal clarifies the responsibilities of the Commission and Member States and specifies the reporting requirements of fishing activities .
this question is of course important in itself , but it falls outside the powers of the European Parliament .
it also promotes the development of ICT .
this may pose a further threat to European biodiversity and may interfere with social development , demanding a truly cross @-@ cutting approach and the inclusion of social , economic and environmental aspects in the broad sense .
I would like to point out three major Summit conclusions : Croatia and Albania were invited to join NATO ; NATO will in@@ sta@@ ll an anti @-@ missile shield complementary to the American one - this shield will protect NATO countries that are not covered by the American shield ; the NATO leaders undertook to increase their troops in Afghanistan in order to fight the Taliban , to share the difficulties of military operations and limit restrictions in using their troops .
Si@@ x@@ ty @-@ two states apply the death penalty , sometimes for non @-@ violent crimes such as adul@@ tery , tax evasion , prostitution or homosexuality .
in 2006 he criticised scientists involved in embry@@ on@@ ic stem cell research .
we have heard nothing on those subjects .
in writing . - ( FR ) The Lisbon Treaty , which is due to come into force on 1 January next , will bring an unprecedented strengthening of Parliament &apos;s prerogatives .
I think that the debate was pi@@ thy .
I doubt that the EU will ever have a common history policy .
we were only consulted at the last minute , in h@@ aste and in a non @-@ binding manner as the instrument was about to be incorporated into the Community acquis .
I ask you , Commissioner , to help us explain to the Council that this situation is unacceptable , especially if we take into account that most of the measures to combat terrorism and promote police cooperation have involved the collection and exchange of personal data .
the Commissioner indicated that to some extent that is already the case .
( PL ) Mr President , the youth of Belarus is often punished by the withdrawal of the right to education for holding beliefs not liked by the authorities .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , Commissioner , organ transplants do indeed save human lives in Europe every day .
I know that this debate is not about the Health Programme 2008 @-@ 2013 but I must emphasise the following aspect . as far as the projects concerned , I was surprised at the mathema@@ tical discrepan@@ cy between the number of projects approved and the number of projects completed : in 2004 , 72 projects were approved and 9 were completed ; in 2005 , 61 projects were approved and 7 were completed ; in 2006 , 87 projects were approved and not a single one was completed ; and in 2007 , 6 projects were approved and none was completed .
these two points highlight the central role to be played by doctors and sur@@ ge@@ ons .
we must mobilise , coordinate , raise the awareness of those around us and set a good example : we must become organ donors ourselves .
Member States can also support voluntary activity by establishing sustainable volunteering infrastructure to deal with issues such as core funding , insurance cover and VAT exemptions where appropriate .
at European level voluntary activity is a practical expression of such European values as solidarity , cohesion and social integration .
let me also assure you that I will share your conclusions with my colleagues in the Commission .
indeed , for it to be so , it needs the legiti@@ misation of its citizens , and this is becoming increasingly complex as Europe is enlarged .
for this reason , I congratulate Mrs Jäät@@ teen@@ mä@@ ki for having struck an appropriate balance between these two requirements and for having proposed balanced solutions that strengthen the effectiveness of the role of the Ombudsman as a moral authority and improve the transparency of the Community institutions , confirming , in the spirit of the new Charter , the right of every European citizen to good governance and a good administration .
( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking in this debate because the situation of the New Fla@@ me , ship@@ wrec@@ ked in Al@@ ge@@ ci@@ ras Bay and Gibral@@ tar in August 2007 , has yet to be resolved .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , I did not wish to take a position on this .
it is obvious that this is a completely unacceptable situation .
in relation to development policy , we have repeatedly pointed out that it makes no sense at all to maintain two complete systems running in parallel - one for the European Development Fund and one for development aid .
I would like to say that it seems clear to me that the fundamental conclusion we can draw from the internal audit report is that there are serious shortcomings in the way the parliamentary assistance payments system works .
the BBC faces a pri@@ ma fa@@ ci@@ e charge of b@@ reaching its Ro@@ yal Charter , specifically in its failure to provide balanced and objective reporting of current affairs .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to mention an aspect of importance concerning the discharge , namely the evaluation of actions through sam@@ pling .
we did not vote on that , or you announced something incorrectly .
the D@@ üh@@ r@@ ko@@ p D@@ üh@@ r@@ ko@@ p report on the stepping up of cooperation between prosecution agencies in combating terrorism and cross @-@ border crime is a valuable initiative that reinforces the action in favour of greater security for US citizens that was initiated in 2005 by the Prüm Treaty .
I hope that Parliament &apos;s services , when ad@@ vising the President of Parliament on any future reports , go for maximum transparency and publish as much as possible in the future .
I welcome the areas of action identified , namely : improving quality and safety , increasing organ availability and making transplantation systems more efficient and accessible , in addition to a mechanism to strengthen cooperation between Member States and the adoption of a Community legal instrument setting quality and safety requirements for organ donation , procurement , testing , preservation , transport and allocation across the EU and the resources needed to meet these requirements .
I voted in favour of the own @-@ initiative report by Mrs Harkin on the role of volunteering in contributing to economic and social cohesion .
tax revenue and the reduction of allowances and subsidies to ten@@ ants , pensioners , farmers and the working classes as a whole have been channelled into funding the monopolies .
we should be pleased at the personal assurance given by the E@@ ESC &apos;s Secretary @-@ General regarding the efficiency and regularity of ex ante and ex post controls .
the internal audit procedures of the agencies also need urgent improvement and I support the possibility of having a common disciplinary board for all the agencies .
finally , there needs to be an inquiry into why the price increase is so high , when agricultural commodities only represent a very small percentage of the total price of processed food .
he is right .
foodstuffs are becoming more expensive , we have less and less food of our own , and imports are becoming increasingly expensive and increasingly less secure .
we also need to remember that the Commission is still trying to impose so @-@ called economic partnership agreements on ACP countries , the poorest countries in the world ; agreements that they do not want , because it is clear to them that these agreements contain the seeds of other future crises .
( FI ) Mr President , I do not believe that poor people in developing countries would fare better if we allowed market forces greater scope to operate in the food markets without regulation , as has been proposed here .
that is pretty much what I wanted to say on the subject .
the swift adoption of the text proposed would represent the first stage in governance reform of the programmes .
let us in conclusion together assert once again : the PP@@ P is therefore not ultimately was@@ hed up .
please say something about this !
Mrs Jen@@ sen , thank you for being such an ar@@ dent supporter of Galileo on the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
( DE ) Mr President , whether or not this is now the right path , it is good that it has le@@ ak@@ ed out .
the other very important question , international adoption , is a highly sensitive matter : under no circumstances can we accept the idea that international adoption is wrong per se since it provides many children with a suitable family and a suitable home .
however , the Commission understands the need to achieve the balance the principles of non @-@ discrimination and preferential treatment ; under certain circumstances the latter may be justified .
the Irish scheme foresees that aid can be granted until 1 October 2009 .
perhaps my question is a little unfair , because it has a historical perspective .
what is also important , however , is that there is nothing in this to say that there are no barriers to different kinds of industrial action in the different Member States .
as Mr Mon@@ k stated in the hearing on Laval , we need a protective protocol in the Lisbon Treaty or face social dumping in the future .
if employee solidarity is destroyed , the European Union , the cohesion of our societies , will also be destroyed .
one cannot speak of dumping in a situation where posted workers - Poles in Germany or Lat@@ vi@@ ans in Sweden - receive a remuneration that is higher than what they would get in their own country .
in writing . - The way in which the existing treaties are being used to undermine workers &apos; rights is a scandal .
what is fundamentally different , where there is confusion , is that the Chinese are responsive , their disbur@@ sement process is much faster than ours , with all our bureaucracy , which has been the b@@ ane of my life for nearly four years .
the exclusion from aid cooperation of countries that recognise Taiwan is a further symp@@ tom of the prima@@ cy of a partic@@ ul@@ arist strategy over development policy .
we are doing this , but the Chinese are squ@@ ee@@ zing us out .
we cannot stand by as neutral observers while this new Chinese domin@@ ation proceeds .
Zimbabwe was obviously on the agenda .
I will just mention two others before finishing .
EUR 23 billion for five years and 78 countries is not enough for everything , therefore according to what was agreed in the Paris Declaration of 2005 , bilateral agreements always have to be reached on projects , plans and strategies to be followed , and I stress &apos; bilateral agreements &apos; .
we emphasise that poverty is closely related with these issues .
nobody enter@@ tains any doubts , in my opinion , as to the importance of improving relations between two of the world &apos;s most populated regions bo@@ as@@ ting high levels of progress , Europe and Latin America .
a large element of these EU monies goes to projects which promote social cohesion and combat poverty .
unfortunately , various Member States have been unable to resist the temptation of trying to make quicker progress , forgetting that the common visa policy is undoubtedly an area of Community competence , just as they are obliged to respect the principle of solidarity enshrined in the Treaty .
I find the explanations and statements of the Commissioner unsatisfactory : he failed to answer what would happen if there are points conflicting with European positions in the agreements the above countries have already signed .
the PNR system will remain unchanged , the same as it is now , the same as it has been adopted and approved , and this is not about fingerprints being taken at travel agents &apos; or anywhere else .
- Before the vote :
the Union must also find new methods of cooperation with the UN Security Council .
now we have to decide where the headquarters of Galileo &apos;s supervisory authority should be located .
this case demonstrates the need to think quickly about the European resources to be put in place to finance public investments when the private market is found wanting .
so many actions are needed at different levels : at work , at school , on the streets and in prisons .
therefore , I was disappointed that what is otherwise a good and important report calls into question what is for me a fundamental principle of something being done in return in terms of free and human rights , and the opportunity for peacekeeping operations within the European Investment Fund .
to this end I hope the EU will draw up a coherent strategy to ensure that China shows respect for issues such as governance , the fight against corruption , the protection of human rights , employment and the environment , and in order to guarantee clear , transparent agreements between the two countries .
this is a complete far@@ ce and it will plun@@ ge Burma even further under the junta &apos;s iron rule .
having said that , I do not want to underestimate the challenges posed by illegal immigration across the European Union &apos;s external borders .
aid organisations believe that more refugees are dying since Frontex was established as they now have to travel further .
after all , the lives of many individuals on the seas and in the moun@@ tains are at stake , along with our common security .
if it is adopted at the first reading , which is the hope of the Slovenian Presidency and the ambition of the European Parliament , then we will obtain a new lever to help us face up to the phenomenon of illegal immigration more successfully .
we should stress the importance of implementing the programme for forest biodiversity and reduction of deforestation and degradation of forest ecosystems .
over 30 000 species are currently threatened with extinction .
this Parliament has reiterated its concern on biodiversity loss through its relevant resolution of 22 May 2007 , but one of the main obstacles to halting biodiversity loss is , I am afraid to say , the lack of effective action by both the Commission and the Council , both of which give the impression that they care about the matter largely only in theory and that , in practice , they suffer from lack of will and determination in making sure that , in real terms , there is full implementation of relevant directives and that both international and internal commitments are fulfilled .
I have already said in my introduction that our key aim was to be present in Bon@@ n and strive for implementation , move towards reality and continue on our path from words to action .
then the bus took off for what we thought was clearance through passport or clearance to the baggage .
I must stress that these activities are of a purely preliminary nature .
my question is this : can you imagine creating new fora with China , whether it be in education or research ?
( SL ) The answer to the first part of Mr Ay@@ l@@ ward &apos;s question is certainly yes .
the F@@ al@@ con@@ er proposal to reduce customs duties is thus unacceptable for our European agriculture and would have un@@ told consequences on the agricultural production of the poorest countries .
some of the most important were brought to mind by the Trade Commissioner , Peter Mandelson : market access , marking the origin of products , governmental licences , measures for protecting investment , as well as criteria for their guarantee in the GCC .
zero tolerance regime for un@@ authorised GMOs and the economic consequences there@@ of ( debate )
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and this plenary sitting for following up my initiative to debate this topic here this evening .
I therefore wish to emphasise that we are facing a serious problem of animal feed shortages , and the European Commission is responsible for dealing with this situation .
the proposal to adopt zero tolerance is spu@@ rious and ineffective ; it is the result of compromising with the interests of multinationals .
but , apart from that , we are in general in support and once again congratulations to Ms Ferreira .
taxes and charges enable us to speed up the necessary reductions in emissions and hopefully solve the entire climate problem .
we appreciate that the taxation debate is not closed and I should like just to mention three points at this stage in the discussions .
we should build on the European Financial reporting Advisory Group and I am ready to pursue this as a matter of urgency , including the possibility of using funding from the Community budget to support such a structure .
I feel it might be better to make it optional so as to ensure flexibility , rather than prevent its application outright .
the idea is a good one .
9 .
in the resolution the European Parliament noted the consequences of the latest decisions of the European Court of Justice in the Vik@@ ing , Laval and Rü@@ ff@@ ert cases and the need for further debate within the European Parliament .
these standards have been developed by a private organisation ( the International accounting Standards Committee Foundation and the International accounting Standards Board ( IAS@@ CF / IASB ) ) that is funded by private sources ( mainly companies in the same field ) and not subject to any public control .
I would like to address the following to two people : the Commissioner @-@ General of Police , Au@@ gus@@ tine Chi@@ hur@@ i , and army com@@ man@@ der Constan@@ tine Chi@@ w@@ en@@ ga .
at the same time there is no denying that a section of the Iranian population approves of the killing of homosexu@@ als , discrimination against women and the suppression of ethnic minorities .
without a systematic improvement of the human rights situation in Iran , our relations with Iran cannot develop properly .
it is impossible to know how to treat our African partners when they treat Chad in this way , but one thing is fairly clear : we have to persuade them about human rights .
this is what I would like to ask for .
we are pointing this out because it clearly proves what happens in liberalised market conditions .
it is also absolutely vital that the criteria should be established according to uniform standards .
I would like to emphasise that the European Union is very concerned by the recent series of events which have brought about an escalation of tension between Georgia and the Russian Federation .
in the conflict that is taking place in Abkhazia and Ossetia the rights of a Russian minority are not at issue .
recognition of Kosovo has opened a can of wor@@ ms and given Russia the moral high ground .
they are doing everything to further de@@ stabilise the situation .
as you can see , we cover a very broad spectrum .
Commissioner Verheugen , I believe you addressed the most important points , but there was one thing you did not mention , and that is how difficult the negotiations were this time .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , the Transatlantic Economic Dialogue comes in a context which is marked by a triple crisis : the global banking and financial crisis , to which we still cannot see an end , the crisis in food prices , and finally , the ongoing crisis in oil prices .
in writing . - The global challenges are loom@@ ing large on the background of today &apos;s debate .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , eight years ago the Commission published a report , provided for in the 1994 directive on European Works Councils , in which it recognised that the application of this text in some cases seems - I quote - &apos; to guarantee only a very low level of transnational consultation and information &apos; .
but they are not prepared to go through a char@@ ade of nine months &apos; negotiations only for the employers then to walk away .
my opening remarks will also be a little longer than the envisaged five minutes .
it did not do so .
this repression affects millions of people , but nothing has been done .
there I think the election has been going on for ages , and we still do not know who the Democratic candidate for the presidential elections is .
I also believe , for example , that the election process , including the pre @-@ election and post @-@ election phases , should be included in the political dialogue with the third countries concerned .
today we are not dealing solely with the fact that she was unable to assert her rights or her mandate in court but also that her life is in danger .
the only sin of Kan@@ z@@ uro@@ v is that over the years he has been fighting with perfectly legitimate means for his own right and the right of a huge number of his com@@ patri@@ ots to call themselves Bulg@@ arians .
the interests of each country were considered to be equally important .
it may hopefully emerge relatively un@@ sca@@ th@@ ed in six or twelve months &apos; time after the inaugu@@ ration of President Clin@@ ton , Mc@@ Ca@@ in or Obama when the US finally has a new trade spokes@@ person in place to continue the dialogue .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Mr President , let me begin by congratulating my colleague , Mr Ford , rapporteur of this report .
the first is counterfeiting , particularly the counterfeiting of pharmaceuticals , which is a real danger , a real danger primarily for the progress and peaceful climate of economic and trade relations with the countries of Sou@@ the@@ ast Asia , but also especially for consumers , whether in terms simply of safety or in terms of product quality .
what will the national envelope achieve ?
thus in the case of Greece we have moved from 3@@ 70 000 hectares at a subsidy of EUR 5@@ 94 per hectare , to 2@@ 70 000 hectares at EUR 750 ; but if we culti@@ vate more than 2@@ 70 000 hectares , op@@ ting for 3@@ 70 000 hectares , which we are perfectly entitled to do , no one will come and tell us , as they used to , that there is an upper ceiling or a penalty .
this is also the doctr@@ ine of the FAO , which in its preparatory work on the guidelines for the protection of vulnerable ecosystems ruled out using depth as a criterion , precisely because it considered it to be arbitrary , lacking in scientific basis and more fan@@ ci@@ ful than anything , because , as I have said , since it does not protect cor@@ al or se@@ amounts that are at a lesser depth , it would immediately wi@@ pe off the map fisheries that have been operating for some time without any problems , such as , for example cu@@ t@@ las@@ s@@ fish fisheries in the Azores or black hal@@ i@@ but in the area regulated by the NAFO .
paragraph 21 also talks about the requirement of financial disclosure , which would be an entirely new element .
Mr President , number one : we congratulate Alexander Stubb on his ele@@ vation to Foreign Minister in Finland .
my view is that the proposal to establish a common interinstitutional system for the mandatory registration of EU lobbyists , the disclosure of financial background and the &apos; legislative footprint &apos; will contribute to the transparency of rules on lobbying .
however , this register will also promote greater transparency vis @-@ à @-@ vis the general public because it will be accessible online in its entirety and will include for each body its complete identification details , including details of its staff , as well as all of the pertinent financial information relating to it .
as a result , I welcome the amendments tabled by various parliamentary groups in this same respect and I hope that , this morning , the House can adopt these through a positive vote .
we also appreciate that the European Commission is prepared to support the training of young players .
the competence of tri@@ bun@@ als of a strictly sporting nature is not at issue , but the restriction of these rights by certain sports organisations is unacceptable .
we have heard a great deal here today , but I would like to draw your attention to a few aspects in particular .
- Before the vote on paragraph 10 :
fortunately , I did not do it through my first mandate , otherwise I would never have had lunch in Strasbourg .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report by my Italian colleague Mon@@ ica Frassoni on the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on procedures for implementing the Council Decision laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission , as amended by Decision 2006 / 5@@ 12 / EC of 17 July 2006 .
however , this must take place through the UN and its various bodies which , unlike the EU , have legitimacy and broad support among a majority of states .
as a result , we would say that it is imbu@@ ed with an attitude of arrogance and self @-@ praise , one example of which is the self @-@ assessment of the EU as &apos; leading &apos; in the area of international election observation .
they include the representation of Ma@@ ło@@ pol@@ ska ( lesser Poland ) which is my European constituency .
using the transparency rules as a pretext , the report tries to wh@@ ite@@ was@@ h the direct intervention of monopolies .
there is a further feature of this report that contributes to its added value .
transfers of appropriations : see Minutes
( el ) Mr President , I should like to say something about the very critical and deeply worrying situation in Lebanon .
we would have preferred simply to have a system proposed by the Commission and approved by the Environment Committee , which made it perfectly clear that a whole series of offences were automatically clas@@ sed as pun@@ is@@ hable under criminal law in addition to the directives in question .
to put it very pla@@ in@@ ly , I expect - not least on the basis of plenary decisions and of our preliminary talks with the Bureau - that this week , either today or on Wednesday , the Bureau really will take the essential decisions on the questions of the assistants &apos; regime , the assistants &apos; statute and on the other outstanding matters .
he states here that this is an important issue and it must ultimately be resolved as a result of this report .
I am very pleased with the outcome of our deliberations in committee , for I am afraid that the rapporteur , in his original draft , for all the good points he made about the developing countries , entirely lost sight of the interests of European industry .
I will therefore proceed directly to those speaking on behalf of the groups .
Madam President , I am glad we have the Commissioner here today , for I believe she is a very fair @-@ minded person .
altogether we have earmarked EUR 18 million for it , but that sum is a drop in the ocean compared with the subsidies the European Union pays tobacco growers every year .
I shall stop here .
perhaps the best thing to say is that there is an end to the conflict and that the PEACE funding played a role in helping to achieve this very positive outcome .
if that integrated approach is not developed , we shall not be able to be effective in the outermost regions or to make best use of the assets they possess .
on the last issue , let me simply reassure you that the Commission will continue to promote a coordinated and integrated approach and will seek to achieve synergies between different Community policies affecting the outermost regions .
gender should be taken into account just as children , the elderly and the disabled are taken into account .
however , we are concerned about the hasty approach concerning collective redress .
economic growth and employment growth are impressive .
six million young people in the EU leave school early and 16 % of the total EU population are poor or at risk of poverty .
the current bu@@ zz@@ word , flexicurity , rec@@ urs constantly in the report .
this is because they have proved to be successful and because it has become clear that in order to ensure good governance , a better balance between European and national level ( indeed , most Member States expressed such views ) , it would be best not to expand the Guidelines .
lively political discussions are taking place about the need for further anti @-@ discrimination legislation at EU level .
as one UK organisation put it most suc@@ c@@ inc@@ tly last week , most discrimination is not going to be solved by extra legislation .
here we must and shall fulfil our obligations .
in this plan , introducing the gender dimension into the drafting of the European , national and local budgets represents an essential instrument for reducing structural gaps and implementing the principle of equal pay for equal work .
an example case in Finland concerned a woman who was not eligible to receive unemployment security after she had finished caring for her disabled son .
there must be a cleaner environment in the Baltic , and we would also like to see strong economic development in the area , together with a move towards coastal shipping traffic reli@@ ev@@ ing road traffic .
many speakers raised the point that we have not gone far enough in our proposals and that we could and should have been even more ambitious .
trade in raw materials and commodities (
such manipu@@ lative political rhetoric and demago@@ gy bear no relation to reality and I object to them .
cultural assets and works of art represent the heritage of the citizens of Member States , who have every right to be able to visit and ad@@ m@@ ire them .
this report has precisely this mission and I welcome it !
he or she is constantly on the move in search of employment , works until advanced old age or even death , and provides un@@ told ri@@ ches to be plun@@ dered by the plu@@ to@@ cracy .
in particular , we certainly need to ensure that these regions do not lose their agricultural self @-@ sufficiency capability , which also applies generally to the European Union as a whole .
improving the rights of the disabled and specifically addressing restrictions to goods and services is commendable .
if this is the case , we have had no explanation of what exactly it contains .
Mr President , I just want to echo my colleagues .
the proposed package will certainly contribute to this harmon@@ iz@@ ation as regards the control of access to the profession but it could not guarantee a sufficient degree of harmon@@ iz@@ ation by itself .
we must consider not only licensing , but also withdrawal of that licence .
nevertheless , it is still too early for the whole of Europe to adopt the system that now functions reasonably between the Netherlands , Belgium and Luxembourg .
( PL ) Mr President , in such a short speech one can deal only with fundamental matters concerning the documents under discussion .
since there are differences of opinion here , in my view we need an intermediate stage or transitional period before the cabotage sector is completely liberalised .
( it ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , unless I am mistaken , the repeated accusations made by Spanish socialists against Italy and its sovereign right to internal security come from those who keep a close guard on their coast@@ line , those for whom the C@@ eu@@ ta and Me@@ li@@ l@@ la affair is still fresh , those who deal with Cata@@ lan and Basque separat@@ ism by putting political pole@@ mic and terrorism on the same footing .
X@@ en@@ ophobic violence is not characteristic of our people , let alone the people of Campania or Naples .
each Member State must comply with this and make adequate efforts to fulfil this duty .
it is designed to promote the use of sustainably produced biofuels while discoura@@ ging the use of poorly performing ones .
therefore , we will continue to endeavour to make sure we provide all the necessary resources for doing so ; therefore I fully respect your question and I think it is a very serious one .
the observed price increases at consumer level reflect recent developments in product value , cost and profit along the food supply chain .
subject : progress of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( FYROM ) towards accession to the European Union
I include in this my excellent colleague Mrs Niebler , Chair of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , the committee responsible , which does a super@@ b job .
this is directly linked with the target agreed by the Member States in 2005 : 25 % of senior posts in public research organisations should be occupied by women .
the fact that the scientific body is com@@ pris@@ ed even today predominantly of men is in itself more down to the as@@ simil@@ ation of mas@@ cul@@ inity into scientific thought than to the above justification .
because of their de@@ vo@@ tion to science , women should not give up their natural purpose of creating a family and being mothers .
Mr President , let me begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups .
I can instead be glad that the voluntary measures of the industry are now included in the legislation , so that they will actually be implemented , and that all the necessary ad@@ jun@@ cts will be covered by the export ban , for example c@@ inna@@ bar , ox@@ ides and cal@@ o@@ mel .
it damages the ner@@ v@@ ous system and immun@@ e system and is especially harmful to babies and children .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I am glad that the Commission is bringing forward proposals and I am pleased the EU is finally dealing with this issue , because we have known about it for a long time .
I am happy that the Commissioner is also thinking along these lines .
we must make use of the EU &apos;s head start , bearing in mind the Copenhagen Conference in December 2009 .
if we have the same readiness in the Council too , and if all three European institutions work together , then before the European elections , we can achieve what Mr Daul has said : namely to signal to the public that the heads of state and government agree the broad policy outlines while the European Parliament does the detailed work .
I believe that this is also of concern from a wider point of view ; it could be regarded to some degree as a model for establishing an intelligent relationship , if I may be so bold , between scientific knowledge and political decision @-@ making in respect of the extraordinary complexity of the issues facing the world today .
my thanks to the rapporteur for an excellent report , and I expect that , in this sense , our work will continue into the next year .
there is a need for the support and prospects offered by technology . there must be funding to transfer technology and enhance the administrative capacities of these countries so that the reductions in question can be measured , recorded and verified .
starting with the 2007 Summit , when a 20 % target was decided for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the use of renewable energy resources by 2020 , global warming has become a priority for every country in the world .
what ultimately counts , however , is its proper implementation to guarantee the freedom of expression for everybody in Turkey .
we wrote about each one of these issues last year .
the point is , however , how honest is the European Union to itself about this ?
it is precisely because we are in favour of accession that there cannot be any sha@@ dows over events concerning our common democratic values .
in this process the State is faced with considerable dilem@@ mas concerning values such as sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ism , democracy and human rights .
I would therefore ask Parliament &apos;s Legal Service to look at this issue .
Mr B@@ ř@@ e@@ z@@ ina , the answer which I have received - and I have received an e @-@ mail about this specific amendment - was the same as for all these particular amendments .
we are not creating new Community legislation to impose sanctions .
Member States must take a strong stance on environmental protection and ensure strict application of this directive .
it remo@@ ves even the minimum proposed restrictions and demands full liberalisation of the market for international and national transport .
in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , higher education has become more widely accessible and growing numbers of women are gaining university degrees .
motherhood in particular has an impact on women &apos;s career opportunities , paradox@@ ically punish@@ es them in terms of the opportunity to get to top positions , fulfil themselves and be jus@@ tly rewarded , and does not offer them adequate compensation for the social investment of giving birth to and bringing up children who will be responsible for tomorrow .
they alle@@ ge that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) is guided by politics rather than by science .
while condemning the &apos; violence &apos; perpetrated by the P@@ KK and &apos; other terrorist groups &apos; , it merely advis@@ es the Turkish army not to engage in any &apos; disproportionate military operations &apos; .
a number of people at the temporary camps , as they call them , do not wish to return to their own areas for all sorts of reasons , while others do wish to return , but need special kinds of seeds since all the soil has been sal@@ inated , and therefore they need much stronger plants , and also fertilisers .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FR ) Madam President , I feel we ought to be slightly more precise in the way we talk about this issue ; for example , the concept of neutrality .
these aid workers and the agencies that they work for have the expertise to put in place a comprehensive relief operation which would bring assistance to a large number of people in a short period of time .
it is a military junta that bears responsibility first for failing to warn their population in time about the approaching cy@@ cl@@ one and secondly for refusing to let humanitarian aid enter the country .
it is in contact with the local authorities to bring in European aid more rapidly for those in need .
the second approach involves remaining constantly aware that in normal times we should help the Chinese .
as it does not appear able to remedy damage caused in the past , the Union should give a decisive , strong signal at least for the future by banning the manufacture , storage and placing on the market of this type of arms within the Member States of the Union .
however , please note that this question should be addressed to the particular Member State , and not to the Council , which does not represent it in this matter .
this year , after intensive consultations with all interested groups , the Commission will also publish a White Paper on adaptation , which will represent a basis for further discussions concerning the European Union &apos;s policy in this area .
the issue of higher food prices is certainly a big problem , and that is why this high @-@ level forum too has organised a debate on this topic .
they have a strong influence also on industry , without which the development of low @-@ carbon society is not possible .
unfortunately , at the level of the European Union , in spite of the Community research programmes and the funds allocated to them , too little is invested in applied research and this is true especially in the case of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
I will highlight some of these - regulation and sustainable development .
the next item is the debate on the oral question by Mr Sacconi , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , to the Commission : draft REACH test methods Regulation ( B6 @-@ 0@@ 15@@ 8 / 2008 ) .
I would be grateful for the Commissioner &apos;s thoughts on that , but otherwise broadly support this report and her efforts .
it relates to transport and is particularly relevant as we are due to vote on Mrs De Lange &apos;s amendment tomorrow .
I am grateful to the European Parliament for addressing the Commission proposal in a positive manner .
it has resulted in further suggestions as to the make @-@ up of the ET@@ F board , right up to an un@@ workable one representative for each Member State .
aid must be aid .
aid effectiveness is , therefore , essential , because more effective aid also means more aid .
( PT ) I congratulate Mr Van Hec@@ ke on this important report .
it is a major problem .
although it does not criticise how often development aid is used merely as a pal@@ lia@@ tive , a ( false ) counter@@ part and condition for de@@ regulating markets or as an instrument of interference - with well @-@ known negative aims and effects , such as the EU &apos;s &apos; European Consensus &apos; on development , the Economic Partnership Agreements the EU intends to impose or financial speculation surrounding foodstuffs , which call into question the aims declared for development - the report not surpris@@ ingly highlights the inadequate results of &apos; development aid &apos; and its significant reduction in the EU : 0.@@ 38 % in 2007 compared to 0.@@ 41 % in 2006 , well below the 0.7 % of GDP indicated by the UN@@ O .
( applause from the EPP Group )
prices have risen dramatically and the demand for food is rising faster than supply .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted for the joint motion for a resolution on Burma because the dramatic situation in the country makes it essential to restore democracy and ensure respect for human rights as a matter of urgency .
animal health is closely linked to human health , owing to the possibility of direct or indirect transmission of certain diseases .
also , the peace settlement does not apply to west Darfur , since Arab no@@ ma@@ ds and sol@@ ders have driven out most of the black population to neighbouring Chad .
this message is not directed solely at the Sudanese Government - it must also be understood by the various armed rebel movements whose political cause , whatever it may be , does not justify committing crimes .
this list already exists , but the fact that Mr Lukashenko himself cannot come to the European Union is not very convincing .
they also include the holding of parliamentary elections , scheduled for September , which must comply with democratic principles .
the rebel group must denounce violence and lay down their arms , but at the same time the Government of Burundi must cease to provide impunity and to cover up for criminals within the security forces who carry out torture and illegal detention .
the Barcelona Process has enabled us to tackle numerous regional issues of strategic importance and , naturally , a number of political issues .
( FR ) Madam President , welcome thus to the relaunch , 13 years later , of the process governing the multilateral relations between the European Union and the countries bordering the Mediterranean .
I thus believe , Madam President , that within the framework of the current financial perspective , we have what we have , and if we do not use those resources we will be unable to realise the ambitions that we are striving for as a European Union .
the rules do not apply to foods designed for private household consumption , and they do not apply to the producers of small quantities of un@@ processed products for local retailers , such as farming , hunting and fishing .
in a word , our Group is not convinced of the need to implement changes in a great hur@@ ry now , without a thorough evaluation .
certainly not .
well , we have not voted yet , but I hope that you are right .
that example should be followed and we need a framework directive to achieve that .
it threatens the sustainability of resources and marine biodiversity and has serious economic consequences for fishermen operating within the law .
the losses incurred by the violation of intellectual property rights amounted to EURO 62 million in Romania in 2007 , according to the analysis conducted by the International Alliance of intellectual property .
the Food Code of the Slovak Republic refers to H@@ AC@@ CP as &apos; proper production practice &apos; .
Junilistan sympath@@ ises wholeheartedly with those parts of the Resolution which deal with the treatment of American prisoners and their transportation through European countries .
farmers have a key role to play in delivering rural sustainability and development , but they are not the only people involved in that delivery , which is why I cannot support Amendment 35 .
legislation is not always the answer ; each case must be examined and considered carefully and the competitiveness and sustainability of each sector must be closely watched .
in Italy , our fellow EU citizens are living in prisons reserved for refugees ; they too are Roma , of course .
I believe that this is a measure which will at least send us down that road in a better frame of mind than we have shown in the past with our was@@ teful economy , was@@ teful society and was@@ teful policies .
as regards prevention - the main aim of the legislation - I miss the waste stabilisation targets in the latest text , but we had already adopted them in the first reading .
the first of these relates to animal by @-@ products .
I believe that 50 % recycling of household waste and 70 % recycling of building and demo@@ li@@ tion waste by 2020 are very good targets that pave the way towards a functioning system of environment @-@ friendly and climate @-@ friendly waste management in the whole of Europe .
it has already become clear that the present system , under which substances on the list are to be examined and new ones added , at best works too slowly .
we shall support en bloc the compromise worked out by Mrs Laperrouze .
unfortunately , last year when the worst fires occurred , the Greek Government acknowledged in its report to the Commission that there was a lack of coordination between the agencies concerned , and a lack of prevention plans .
it underlines the responsibility of the customs authorities of Member States with external borders .
more effective coordination depends on rigorous implementation of new modern legislation that is ( or was ) our great present for the anniversary of the Customs Union .
young people who cannot cope with school and drop out are part of this group , as are older people who , despite having worked for decades , receive small pensions that cover only the b@@ are necessi@@ ties .
consequently , for socially excluded people , the opportunity to get an education and to participate in lifelong learning remains an un@@ at@@ tain@@ able goal .
strengthening social integration , reducing poverty and combating social exclusion are some of the challenges faced by the EU , particularly when we take demographic changes into account , by which I mean an ageing population and an influx of migrants .
as Members will be aware , Eurostat does not produce data , but manages data provided by the national statistical systems .
although we could find that vulnerability is a problem at lower levels - in the poorest regions , for example - it has a bearing on the whole territory and touches upon all social categories living there .
it follows that we are also speaking of deforestation .
if we really want to change the world as we say , we must resort to other measures .
by doing nothing about illegal immigration , we compli@@ cate the lives of those who are at risk of being exploited by un@@ scrupulous employers and we also compli@@ cate the integration of legal immigrants .
three years of debate have shown that there is no more room for manoeuvre and it is obvious that at second reading no further improvements will be made .
the issue is what this directive lays down .
( el ) Madam President , I am very deeply concerned that for three years the Council of Ministers has been blocking progress by ha@@ gg@@ ling over provisions .
I believe in and call on the mobilisation of Europe , on those citizens who reject this type of legislation .
must they witness a discussion that demonstrates that Europe is unable to come to an agreement on this matter ?
Member States have gras@@ ped that this needs to be resolved at EU level .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , tomorrow we must vote on a text that Member States and the more conservative amongst us are bil@@ ling as a compromise .
Mr Rad@@ w@@ an is absolutely right .
the 10 years of successes and achievements of the common currency are also a reason to celebrate .
protection of the euro against counterfeiting (
I abstained because I believe that this is a matter entirely for the Slovak Government .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report by Mr Díaz de Mera .
the guiding principle was also the approach I adopted in my amendment , and I thank Mrs Jacks@@ on for her support in different ways during the whole process .
the Commission &apos;s proposal to repeal Regulation ( EEC ) No 23@@ 77 / 90 seeks to resolve the difficulties encountered in the application of the existing legislation .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the Cas@@ a report relating to the adoption of the euro in Slovakia .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
the Council reached a broad agreement on all essential parts of the package at the Energy Council of 6 June .
this is what our group is calling for , no more and no less : that existing rights be compiled and that consumers be provided with these in the form of a rea@@ dable document .
this is Parliament &apos;s wish .
electricity cannot be stored ; the frequency and vol@@ tage of the grid must be maintained according to market demand .
unlike Mrs De V@@ its , however , I do not believe that we need completely new laws -@@ certainly not at European level .
I also welcome the steps that we are taking to ensure ownership unbundling as a necessary measure to finally complete our liberalisation of the energy market .
in recent years , we have had a rapid increase in energy prices and the European citizens are expecting an answer to their problems from the European institutions .
so it is structural change that is necessary and I believe that the proposals we have made are a response to it .
the newly established leader Party is entering the political arena in my country in an exceptionally aggressive way , now and then coming close to the style of the Movement for Rights and Liberties in terms of rou@@ gh@@ ness and ru@@ th@@ lessness .
although demand for agricultural commodities is influenced by the biofuel market , all the analyses that the Commission has made indicate that the causes of the rise in global food prices are varied .
is the European Commission considering taking measures to promote , strengthen and support organic fish @-@ farming , and if so , could you tell us what these measures might be , and how to support this very important issue , which we want to promote ?
we have formed regional advisory councils .
the 2008 work programme of the Frontex Agency includes several pilot projects and training actions in the fields of operational cooperation and research .
why should we import a method which has not already been tried and tested ?
I think that just asking the question is an answer in itself .
since then , due not least to pressure from the European Parliament , legal provisions have been issued to counteract the hazard to road users by fron@@ tal protection systems on motor vehicles .
it is our responsibility , both Member States and the Union , to try to reduce those statistics and to protect our citizens from such tragedies .
better protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users has not lost anything in top@@ ic@@ ality in the last decade .
to facilitate Parliament and Council examination of these files , we opted for grou@@ ping proposals in a so @-@ called &apos; om@@ ni@@ bus &apos; approach .
the tariff quotas are to be seen , in terms of support to the Canary Islands &apos; economy , as complementing other measures taken on the basis of Article 299 ( 2 ) of the EC Treaty , in particular the scheme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products from the outermost regions - implemented by means of Council Regulation ( EC ) 7@@ 91 / 2007 of 21 May 2007 .
we also need to pay attention to bio @-@ fuel policies and find a way of ensuring their sustainability , both within the EU and also in other countries .
as demand continues to out@@ stri@@ p supply in oil and gas , the goals agreed last year provide a ready @-@ made path to reduce Europe &apos;s vulnerability and to reduce the economic pain of future price hik@@ es .
De@@ regulating the internal market to breaking point is what Mr McCreevy wants to do , regardless of what it costs , without any social f@@ lan@@ king measures at EU level or in the Member States : that is the crisis which is being felt by Europe &apos;s citizens !
this is not a time for rec@@ ri@@ mination or finger @-@ pointing .
to conclude : Martin Schulz said in his very powerful and e@@ leg@@ ant speech that there is a crisis of confidence .
but on this occasion we must listen to the Irish people ; we must listen to the people .
it should respect the law and the rules , and immediately declare that further ratification of the now dead Lisbon Treaty is a completely useless exercise .
I want to see a Europe which remains a unity of equ@@ als , with 27 countries , and that is why I support the Treaty of Lisbon .
they are much more concerned about the price of petrol at filling stations and about other the problems that are arising every day .
there have now been three rejec@@ tions of this Treaty : one in France , one in the Netherlands and now the rejection of a slightly modified version of the Treaty in Ireland .
rather than face reality , I fear that we will again face a Brussels con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy to circum@@ vent the people .
it must prove to its own citizens that it is a common project imbu@@ ed with solidarity .
Ireland decided the ratification by referendum , and the Irish citizens rejected the Treaty .
this leads me to the second question : why is intercultural dialogue important ?
1 .
people on the left and the extreme left have raised a hu@@ e and cry against the Directive .
in the region I represent , in the constituency of Da@@ ven@@ try , we have a number of unwanted wind @-@ farm proposals .
through this report the EU takes a major step towards imposing a European migration policy which comes down hard on illegal immigrants .
this is the first time that the Union has managed to equip itself with common rules for the return of illegally staying third @-@ country nationals .
the mass mobilisation of workers and the res@@ ounding &apos; no &apos; votes in referendums reveal growing popular outra@@ ge at this policy and open the way to its repeal .
the strategy is always the same .
the report advocates lifting the common customs tariff on the import of certain fisheries products to the Canary Islands for the years 2007 @-@ 2013 .
the Commission will play a greater role in assisting Member States in meeting this challenge .
if anything is to come of this crisis of speculation in food and oil prices , it is that blin@@ ke@@ red neoliber@@ alism has had its day .
costs over@@ run , there is local damage to the environment and people are un@@ happy about a lot of projects .
as a result , margins in many seg@@ ments are wa@@ fer @-@ th@@ in , making the sector more vulnerable than others to a drastic rise in costs , such as we have seen with the price of oil .
on the contrary , it has worsen@@ ed .
Mr President , there is much about the Commissioner &apos;s package to welcome , but for me the key issue is delivery .
the European Commissioner for Fisheries , Joe Borg , considers that rapid aid is a possibility but also maintains that , in the long term , the solution to the crisis in the sector lies in restructuring the fleet , making it smaller and less energy @-@ intensive .
Mr Sch@@ r@@ ö@@ der first signed an agreement with Russia concerning construction of the Nord Stream gas pipeline , and then took a post on the company &apos;s governing board .
however , there is a democratic deficit in Brussels .
I welcome the fact that President Medvedev has recently emphasised the importance of human rights and the rule of law .
here I could not agree more .
subject : common immigration policy and illegal working
the European Council meeting starting tomorrow will also address the political consequences of high food prices .
Minister Janez Len@@ ar@@ či@@ č has appeared before us for the last time as President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , dangerous goods must be transported within the European Union , just like ordinary goods , whether we like it or not .
Mr Marko@@ v and his colleagues in the Committee on Transport have worked hard on the proposal , helping to improve its outcome .
I am grateful for it and trust that the House will pursue its work on this subject in the future .
that would enable them to take the right decision and convince all Members to support it .
for this reason , thorough analyses , building projects designed and achieved with competence , as well as an efficient audit , are necessary particularly in the regional and local road network and , for this reason , I consider that Member States should take over all the healthy principles and implement them responsibly not only where they are bound to but , especially , where they are necessary .
secondly , other factors have contributed to the decline of this sector .
I hope this report does somewhat better .
towards Europe @-@ wide Safer , cleaner and efficient Mobility : the First Intel@@ ligent car Report ( debate )
people drive cars that are French , Italian or German , that are made in Spain or Britain and asse@@ m@@ bled elsewhere and , of course , we must have transnational legislation to support the highest possible standards .
it is true that these systems address mainly the high@@ way and TEN @-@ T traffic .
I support the rapporteur &apos;s view that at present penetration rates for intelligent car systems and applications remain very low in relation to their potential .
1 .
Madam President , I voted for this report because , as in other sectors , I am concerned to see the EU decline in she@@ ep@@ meat production against a rising tide of imports .
hence our vote against the report .
we also have , fresh in our memor@@ ies , the repeated closure of gas supplies to our eastern neighbours .
the EU did not turn a blind eye .
dozens of participants in the protests have disappeared without trace .
the years of chaos soon turn support from the rest of the world for any transitional government into interference in in@@ solu@@ ble armed domestic conflicts .
we can finally free the hands of the Iranian democratic opposition , the National Council of resistance , to get rid of this inhuman dictatorship once and for all .
it was an interesting meeting full of challenges , and in a way also an opportunity to summarise the progress we have made together in the last six months .
they will not come back .
it is up to us , to Parliament , to the Council and , not least , Mr President , to the Commission to start searching for those reasons .
and then the Commission , increasingly in the th@@ r@@ all of every pressure group apart from that of citizens , as is borne out by the very recent Kallas communication on lob@@ bies .
so , may I address this message in particular to the incoming Council Presidency , to France .
the claims that we have too little democracy are what prevent us from having more democracy , as the majority of those who have w@@ aged the campaign of lies do not want Europe at all and put forth these spu@@ rious arguments in order to conceal that fact .
as a new Member State , they have done an excellent job .
so what we have today , seven@@ teen years later , is a great success for us .
let us be frank : if the European institutions themselves call into question the legislation that they themselves have adopted , then we really have a problem regarding support by our citizens .
&apos;@@ Europe has been good to Ireland .
( Parliament rejected the motion by roll @-@ call vote )
in view of this situation , the European Parliament must provide a reminder of the basic standards that apply in our continent , of which the Republic of Belarus is a part .
( HU ) I would like to interpret the words of Andr@@ ás L@@ é@@ de@@ rer , president of the Hungarian liberal party New generation .
it is all very well to have laws that dictate that the 30 @-@ day time frame must not be exceeded , but how are SMEs supposed to implement them ?
the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development also expects measures to create a restructuring fund for the milk sector .
my fellow Member Mrs Haug was faced with an immen@@ sely difficult task if she was to meet our expectations even in part .
this is yet another case in which those who portra@@ y themselves as the champi@@ ons of free trade give in to protectionist national temp@@ tations out of self @-@ interest .
one final question : does the new situation influence the decision that might be made during settlement of this dispute ?
these measures include &apos; identifying and counting the people , including minors , present in the no@@ ma@@ ds &apos; camps &apos; .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is no doubt : it is clear that the Italian far left now runs this Parliament in practice .
dealing with these problems is an all @-@ European challenge and to this day no country has succeeded alone .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , this morning I happened to be in Cannes , where an informal Justice and Home Affairs ( JHA ) Council meeting was taking place .
they also help in certain production processes .
it is a shame we were not able to also regulate GM labelling directly .
the Commission also needs nine months to take a risk management decision .
just 2.5 % of our membership can create a political group .
all the rules and custom@@ ary procedures may have been violated , but this does not seem to worry Mr Corbett , f@@ lan@@ ked by the committee chair .
I remember Mr Leinen from the days when he was still an up@@ standing Democrat .
I would like to draw the attention of the Euro@@ sceptic MEPs to the fact that they should read the recommendation before saying this .
given that we are in France , I think it was a French writer who said that anything that is excessive lacks value .
the project &apos;s cross @-@ border nature means that the Espoo Convention must be adhered to , while the Member States involved must properly enforce the provisions of the directive on environmental impact assessments before granting an implementation permit .
what could happen with all the mines du@@ mped on the seab@@ ed ?
- ( DE ) Mr President , of course it is in the interests of all the people of the EU , and especially of the countries bordering the Baltic Sea , that no danger should be posed to the environment .
we must be honest enough to admit it .
the European Union should treat the environmental and geopolitical issues regarding energy security by means of a concerted effort of all Member States , and not by bilateral treaties concluded by some Member States with Russia .
corruption is widespread in government circles and indeed origin@@ ates from this source .
finally , it is possible to support the Afghan institutions while , at the same time , drawing attention to their severe limitations .
after lengthy negotiations in committee , I support the final version of our motion for a resolution , which contains many key elements , including the systematic training of the Afghan security forces , greater focus on the rebuilding of civil society and enhanced coordination between the international bodies .
we also took into account the airlines in the new Member States , where the mobility rate is low at present but is growing quickly .
I am thinking for example of the E@@ mir of Du@@ ba@@ i .
however , I regret the Commission &apos;s in@@ sensitivity towards the situation of our regions and I must say that , despite having reached a compromise which is positive and which has in fact taken a few steps in the right direction , we feel that the issue is in no way settled .
I do not know if that also happened in the speaker &apos;s group , but in any case for us it was all very open and above board , even on an internal level .
I cannot see because I have my back to it , you understand .
- ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am against the common position on including aviation activities in emission allowance trading for all kinds of reasons .
lobbyists , the construction company and Russian politicians .
their excellence is second to none .
in writing . - The need for proper labelling of food additives and the phasing out of some is essential to protect , in particular , children &apos;s health .
the compromise before us is far from ideal but it is a step forward , so we Greens can also support the agreement that has been reached .
I cannot agree with the amendment which prior@@ itiz@@ es the demand for gas at the cost of negle@@ cting EU environmental legislation and citizens &apos; worries .
of course the agricultural population must be supported , but opium cultivation cannot be a long @-@ term alternative for Afghanistan &apos;s growth , democracy and political stability .
we agree that the capacity of the European research base has to be enlarged , strengthened and freed up to work in a much more dynamic and transnational manner .
Mr President , I will in a moment be presenting the decisions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , a somewhat in@@ sane undertaking and just as in@@ sane as the way in which some of our debates were organised , with such results .
we have tabled an amendment to re @-@ introduce the gas release programme and we need it .
what it said was that my country , Germany , was completely isolated when it comes to using nuclear power .
given that in Europe securing a critical mass of well @-@ trained labour is now already a considerable challenge , due to a further liberalisation will be even more difficult to secure experts in the future .
it is closely linked to energy consumption in the Union , to reducing CO2 emissions , to Europe &apos;s energy dependency .
in October 2007 the finance ministers of the G8 countries asked the IMF and the OECD to look into these issues .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) O@@ pen@@ ing up to trade and investment is a hal@@ l@@ mark of European integration .
( HU ) J@@ ust a few things in brief .
we know that Parliament is very conscious of these issues and we believe that we will be able to agree on rules that will allow us to enjoy the benefits of biofuels while minimising any harmful indirect effects .
we are going to do everything in our power to achieve that ; if we can get an early agreement at second reading , we will do so .
based on this new reality my group is seeking the best possible outcome for the future .
this is an excellent report for consumers , airline staff and European aviation .
they themselves must help to ensure that we really can achieve a healthy environment through the transport system .
Europe &apos;s towns are still left to stand on their own ; they are not being helped .
what does it desire ?
the current provisions - Regulation ( EEC ) No 3@@ 9@@ 22 / 1991 requiring the use of child safety devices - leave Member States free to choose .
Central banks may need supervisory information for the effective performance of their functions in the management of the crisis .
we do not want to know names , but we want to know if the decision was by a narrow or a clear majority and whether there was a great deal of debate or not much .
the introduction of the euro has undoubtedly had some benefits : some of those cited by Mr Schmidt are un@@ questionable , but there is not one word about the tangible adverse effects for every citizen of the euro area who has suffered from real inflation which is much higher than official figures as a result of the widespread speculation which accompanied the introduction of the currency and which the ECB and the institutions did far too little to control .
I believe we need closer cooperation between the central banks and the European Central Bank , financial markets and regulatory authorities .
as was very el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently said by a number of Members , we certainly have the demand @-@ driven phenomenon ; the big emerging economies are introducing at global level a new element of bu@@ o@@ y@@ ant demand and that has to be fully recognised .
in writing . - As regards economic developments , the fundamen@@ tals of the euro @-@ area economy remain sound due to investment growth and improved employment rates and labour @-@ force participation .
consequently we still have to clarify that the amount of reimbursement for planned care abroad should correspond , at a minimum , to the cost of similar care in the country in which the patient is insu@@ red .
that regulation was necessary because the old one was not longer adequate and there was scope for simplifying the coordination procedures .
one cannot require any more from her , since the Council and the Commission have not yet completed their work and have not yet presented the final contents of the annexes .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to make a very few remarks on this report , one aspect of which , as you know , is that it contributes to the process of deregulation and the reduction of red tape .
I hope that the regulation will not result in the liqu@@ ida@@ tion of small sports companies .
work on improvements in efficiency and energy savings has also become much more important .
in writing . - I voted to exempt heritage railways from the scope of this directive .
where they pollu@@ te the soil or water sources , it is often impossible to predict what the results will be .
accordingly , after consideration of Mr Corbett &apos;s report , the Constitutional Affairs Committee did not recommend any changes to the thresholds set out in Rule 29 .
rather a good thing , if we are to believe this resolution .
what European Union is that ?
it is difficult , it is sometimes hard work , but it is something that Parliament must continue to do un@@ ce@@ as@@ ingly .
the situation in Tibet has never been so ten@@ se .
it is precisely those who pick h@@ oles in the Treaty of Lisbon while supporting enlargement who must realise that they are pursuing a politically inconsistent line .
thirdly , and to my mind most importantly : this report also looks beyond the current enlargement agenda to countries that are not on the list of potential applicants .
the message is fairly clear : the enlargement process will not be interrupted , but we all need to do even more to prepare ourselves .
this is the only way to promote stability , peace , respect for human rights and economic reforms in the countries that are our neighbours .
finally , we should not prevent those countries which want to progress further from being impe@@ ded by the more Euro@@ sceptic , nationalist or sovereignty @-@ seeking countries .
they range from the Mediterranean Union - which is an important step forward if it is supported by the Community as a whole rather than being a priority of certain countries from certain regions - via the Swedish @-@ Polish proposal , to the proposal for a Black Sea Union .
due to their learning and life experience , they have become active members in NGOs , got involved in information , volunteer activities or have used their knowledge in structures related to European integration .
we need to give increased attention to the situation of children affected by this conflict situation .
yes , there are minors in prison , for the most part ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ents , whom Hamas manipu@@ lates and sends to their deaths , armed with g@@ ren@@ a@@ des or bel@@ ts filled with explosives .
it is also important that Africa should have expressed its concern in the face of a crisis on a regional scale , and the efforts made by the African Union in particular and by the SADC must be supported .
the travel ban on Mugabe and all senior members of his regime must be made water@@ tight and expanded further .
we shall follow Mr Michel &apos;s recommendations , which are always sensible and based on experience , regarding the continuation of our mediation efforts .
as stated in the communication , although demand for agricultural commodities is also influenced by the biofuel market , Commission analyses indicate that current European biofuel production has little impact on current global food prices .
since then , the Council has still not adopted the proposal .
and that is why the Commission created the European e @-@ Business Support Network early this year .
they arise as a result of the wrong kind of command structures , but also when the necessary equipment is not available for specific operations .
the European Union &apos;s current Treaty provides quite clearly that the EU budget cannot be used for military purposes .
concerning the reason for the den@@ un@@ ci@@ ation and the renegoti@@ ation of the protocol , namely that it was under @-@ utilised , again I would like to make the point made by Mrs Is@@ ler Bé@@ gu@@ in that such agreements are not only about fisheries but also about development assistance .
finally , I should like to say , Commissioner , that I appreciate the work that you have put into these negotiations , because the European Parliament wants its voice to be heard , and at the moment the Council does not seem to be listening to our basic arguments .
the reason for that is the depth of the analysis that had to go into the proposal , to guarantee that it is a really effective instrument to address the severe problems the sector is facing .
we should all welcome this .
the problem is that , so far , industry and Member States have not promoted them sufficiently .
1 .
( the oral amendment was accepted )
however , my request to parliamentarians and politicians across Europe is : let us ensure that this is not just warm words , just to appe@@ ase our conscience .
I voted against the resolution of the European Parliament asking Italy to stop the cen@@ sus of the Roma on the basis of eth@@ nic@@ ity , because this seems premature and I regret the fact that Parliament did not vote in favour of the motion for postponement until September 2008 tabled by my political group , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
we think that the Copenhagen criteria are the only requirements which can be imposed on candidate countries negotiating for EU membership .
Mr von Wogau - the Chairman of our Subcommittee on Security and Defence - has done Parliament and Europe a service with this report , which we should follow up subsequently .
let me add - and I am saying this to Mr Schulz - that I am in favour of bringing in the Balkans , that our Croatian friends , like our Serbian friends , are un@@ question@@ ably European .
how can Europeans continue to do that if they do not acquire the military and human resources to enforce the decisions that we have taken together ?
I think that this will be a presidency full of drive and determination and rich in concrete results that we will all work towards .
as I said , we will certainly need political commitment .
it is not the European way to divide and rule .
a moment ago you criticised the lack of Community preference , and you are right .
I should have talked at more length about the European energy policy .
I simply want to try to integrate everyone into a different Europe , based around democracy , peace and growth .
( the speaker continued his speech in Basque )
we are sure , President Sarkozy , that you will finish your Council Presidency in six months &apos; time with good results .
you therefore have support behind you to move forward and to integrate the social model .
it is not that simple , but I will try my hand at it in any case .
therefore , you see , I am quite happy for us to call for social harmonisation , but I would like to say to our French socialist friends that social harmonisation involves not advocating ideas in France that no one else is advocating in Europe , because that is an exception and our country is suffering as a result .
I hope that the French Presidency will never accept such mo@@ ck@@ ery of the Kyoto Protocol and negative discrimination against the new Member States , including my homeland .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.@@ 40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
( DE ) Mr President , Mr O@@ nes@@ ta asked me how I read Rule 149 ( 4 ) .
we also call on the European Commission to offer the Indian Government financial and technical assistance through the Stability Instrument for such an inquiry , and possibly further measures of conflict resolution in Kash@@ mir .
currently , it is being used mainly to target people who are victims of political persecution .
they are approved by the representatives of these groups , if they agree to their content , and then they are debated and voted upon .
that is not the case .
the preliminary findings of the investigations indicate that the partial collapse of the false ceiling was caused by fra@@ ctures in the building components which connect the suspended ceiling with the actual ceiling structure .
the fact that a country with significantly less potential can ride rou@@ gh@@ sho@@ d over the Union indicates that we are being treated as a weak partner incapable of taking serious political decisions .
( HU ) Mr President , in connection with the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , Tra@@ ian B@@ ă@@ se@@ scu , the President of Romania , has las@@ hed out viol@@ ently at the collective rights of minorities since , in his opinion , they would lead to the collapse of some states .
Eurojust is not sufficiently well @-@ informed , particularly on terrorism matters .
the facts have proved this to be wrong ; its usefulness has been proved , as has its need to be strengthened further .
serious crime must also form one aspect of this judicial cooperation that we truly want .
( NL ) Mr President , the regulation rightly provides that , for everyone in possession of a visa , the Visa Information System ( VIS ) should be systematically consulted for a biometric check .
the second point concerned the withdrawal of troops .
( applause )
if Russia is prepared to rever@@ t to a policy of cooperation and respect for its neighbours , Russia will be invited to join as well .
this can be de@@ pic@@ ted as a classic example of political or@@ thodo@@ x@@ y which assumes that Russia pursu@@ es nothing but imperi@@ al goals .
they had arrived and set up in the Georgian villages around the capital of Ossetia .
that is what we are trying to do .
now we have a war between Russia and Georgia .
certainly this decision has led to some serious consequences for the countries of the Caucasus and for Europe and could do so in the future for Russia itself .
in this context , how should the North Stream and South Stream projects be assessed , together with the support they have received from certain Member States of the Union ?
he said that , based on his broad knowledge of the facts , European governments have been enormously cor@@ rup@@ ted , as it is well known that Russia is using a new secret weapon against the West - namely global bri@@ ber@@ y .
in my view , that is a very important point .
it has the support of America &apos;s ne@@ o@@ conservative Georgia lobby , which is headed by R@@ and@@ y Sche@@ une@@ mann , presidential candidate John Mc@@ Ca@@ in &apos;s advis@@ er on foreign policy .
we welcome the fact that all the relevant Direc@@ torates @-@ General are involved in this selection process .
I have received one motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 108 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
Member States have established different systems and national regulatory bodies are better placed to guarantee the highest possible level of consumer protection in their national markets .
secondly , the planned pilot projects to fight ca@@ ro@@ usel fraud are a good idea and we take note of these , but we would make the point that this must not lead to any deterioration in framework conditions for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first of all I want to thank the Members of the House for the comments and views they expressed during the debate .
the report contained in the social agenda package states that , of the EUR 500 million available annually , just 4 % was used in 2007 .
similarly , appropriate care facilities must be provided to help people combine work and family life .
it would exacerbate the legal uncertainty that already preva@@ ils and further diminish the scope for national creative action .
if we try to eliminate inequalities of this type through regulation , then we are arrog@@ antly over@@ looking cultural diversity and interfering with the natural development of society , and worst of all , we are putting equality above the freedom of choice .
that is the idea behind the European social model , and it is an idea that I support .
but if a doctor is on call in a hospital , for instance , and a patient with a life @-@ threatening condition could arrive at any moment , that cannot be regarded as a rest period , which would be possible under the Council &apos;s compromise .
many other exciting topics have been raised .
the social package represents the insurance policy for the future of the Union and it is essential for its long @-@ term development .
( DE ) Mr President , with regard to the enforcement of judgments delivered in ab@@ sen@@ tia , it is of no use to us in the European Union if we have excellent police cooperation on the one hand while on the other hand the system of criminal prosecution does not work as well as it could .
however , we have previously voted against EU labelling of organic products , as it is our conviction that market forces , spe@@ ar@@ headed by aware European consumers , are capable of performing this task alone .
I applaud that view and would also like to emphasise that this should just be the start of a greater focus on the sector , and I invite the Commission to implement a meaningful policy in this field .
we must respect the right of asylum seekers to fle@@ e to whatever country they de@@ em most suitable and ensure that the Member States comply with the 19@@ 51 Geneva Convention .
in writing . - ( SV ) The fight against fiscal fraud is of course worthy of full support .
regarding the CFSP , the Council has accepted , as a precautionary measure , the commitment and payment appropriations which were entered in the preliminary draft budget and which are in line with the amounts provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 .
to go back to heading 1 briefly , it is true that there is a reduction , but , at the same time , within that reduction , there is a planned increase of EUR 50 million for convergence countries and regions ; I wanted to mention this .
as regards new networks , these were absent from the Commission proposal , or poorly addressed , at a time when Europe is already involved in this technological revolution .
from that perspective , it would be dangerous to try and defend old structures and old players .
I believe that it is important from Parliament &apos;s point of view for us to res@@ tate the importance of protecting intellectual property , to res@@ tate protection for private life , to res@@ tate even the right people have to privacy , a right which at the moment is being violated by major telecommunications companies .
I am working against the decision to prohibit file sharing at national level and am doing so at EU level too .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - ( FR ) Madam President , thank you for allowing me to speak at this point ; I must apologise for having to leave shortly to return to Paris .
therefore I ask Mr Harbour to withdraw those amendments so as to restore the balance between copyright and the rights of Internet users .
thank you very much .
when we undertake that global review we must , therefore , try to look not only at quantitative CAP objectives but also consider more qualitative aspects , so as to ensure that all our fellow citizens , wherever they may live , have access to high @-@ quality food products .
as far as the Council is concerned , those negotiations are based on the proposals put forward by the Commission on the basis of the screening reports , which is the entirely usual basis .
it is , I believe , supposed to end next March .
we must continue with our efforts and strengthen the legal base .
( RO ) De@@ ar colleagues , there are issues people talk about a lot , but little is done .
I stress the issue of maternal and parental leave .
for a start , the Council and the European Parliament have agreed to the extension of the body &apos;s operating regulation until 2012 .
then they come here and see to their surprise that women are not just interested in cleaning products and do not just sit waiting all day until their hus@@ bands come home from work , women are independent and intelligent and earn their own money and so are also consumers , and besides that there are other kinds of families on earth that you never see in the adver@@ ts , such as single @-@ parent families and gay couples with children , and immigrant families , and , for instance , people in wh@@ eel@@ chairs or with speech impe@@ di@@ ments .
we know from the Americans that only a very few clon@@ es survive .
calling for a ban on cloned animals in food production may not address that issue if the research stage of that process is concerned .
I now come to my role as shadow rapporteur for the ALDE , and will outline some of the guiding principles of our approach .
they keep our food fresh , our bodies clean , they help our plants to grow , they fuel our cars .
I am not totally happy with the compromise , but we cannot delay putting the GHS into our legislation .
( SV ) I would just like to reply to what my fellow Member Mr B@@ oo@@ th said here about the environmental movement wanting to protect people but not animals .
the proposal also introduces a system for identifying the vehicles , so that they are easily recognised by rescue services .
it should considerably speed up the practical usage of hydrogen cells in particular but hydrogen must not be widely used in &apos; traditional systems &apos; , in other words combustion engines , as this makes no sense to me .
Mr President , I gre@@ et you on behalf of a small American Republic , in which just over 4.5 million people dare every day to live and to dream ; in which the ideal of a society without an army has been possible , and in which we will soon be celebrating 110 years of democracy .
not in a nation@@ alistic sense , because then countries that have dictatorships and are ruled by violence could also be proud of themselves , but be proud of your country , of Costa Rica , because you champion the right values : democracy , freedom and peace .
the credibility and integrity of our work , therefore , is legitimately opened to question .
as a fuel , hydrogen will provide us with an environmentally safe renewable energy source .
Parliament did not consider it appropriate to take a similar resolution on Kosovo in the name of the same principles of respect for international law and integrity of national borders that it is invo@@ king today to denounce recognition of the independence of Ossetia and Abkhazia by Moscow .
it is up to each Member State to make its own legislation in this area and Parliament must therefore respect the principle of subsidiarity .
however , we would like to emphasise that we have done so because we consider that many of the values and demands it contains are essential , but our opinions differ regarding the means to achieve them .
the Seventh Framework Programme for Research is already financing such projects for the cloning of human beings .
( NL ) Mr President , allow me to start with some words of criticism .
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and assure her that we will be supporting her report .
I can see three cases where the European Union is applying double standards .
furthermore , I call on the EU to apply the human rights policy equally and to set sanctions on every country where massive human rights violations are proven .
as we all know , the majority of these women live in sub @-@ Saharan Africa , where there is one death every minute .
surely this is something that has to be seriously addressed , and there should be no pre@@ tence that it can be dealt with in any other way .
however , it is important that abortion is legal and safe , as well as exceptional , as this is the only way to combat illegal abortion .
the main cause leading to the increase in mortality rate at world level is the absence of qualified personnel to provide maternal assistance both during pregnancy and delivery .
part Tw@@ o
so the national authorities of the relevant Member States can address this issue if they want , but at that particular stage there was no majority of Member States in favour of action at EU level .
I thought that the missions - as do all of the election observation missions - proved a very useful aid to the Cambo@@ dian authorities in the conducting of their election missions .
it was a relative success .
yet , in the WTO negotiations on services , further deregulation and liberalisation of financial markets is being sought by richer countries , and indeed this report entirely supports that proposal .
they must be able to decide to do this themselves .
one concerns audit provisions .
today we know what it means and today we know what important issues we have rightly been discussing .
the Commission can accept Amendments 1 , 2 , 3 , 18 , 25 and 47 with re@@ drafting .
at the time it opted for measures favouring greater transparency , healthier competition , less precarious work , better employee qualifications and improved safety , and emphasised that unregulated liberalisation of the European port system is counterproductive .
War@@ ren@@ point on Car@@ ling@@ ford L@@ ough has been built up , particularly through recent high investment , into a very successful roll @-@ on , roll @-@ off fer@@ ry port .
in particular , pun@@ ctu@@ ality , regularity , reliability , high quality , sufficient capacity , interoperability and transnational coordination on international corridors are some of the watch@@ words for an ar@@ ray of services that has the customer absolutely in mind .
I hear that there are major structural defec@@ ts here .
with this in mind , the Commission will play an active role in preparations for the fifth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health , scheduled to be held in July 2009 .
our climate is changing and this brings with it new challenges in both the fields of health and environment .
high levels of pollution may result in as@@ th@@ matic diseases , aller@@ gies and even cancer .
a first @-@ reading position was adopted by the European Parliament on 14 November 2007 .
this means that it must not be subject to competition rules .
appropriate encouragement and aid for Member States to assist such countries with the removal of such material is therefore needed .
a proper debate should be allowed for , as well as decent consultation of our legal services .
this report concerns sanctions , an instrument that we , the European Community , cannot afford to do without .
if the two aspects are separated , it becomes rather aw@@ k@@ ward to find a credible stance and a lasting solution .
here is a da@@ m@@ ning fact : in sub @-@ Saharan Africa one woman in 16 dies in child@@ birth .
it is certainly necessary to open up the market and improve competitiveness .
we are therefore calling on the new &apos; strong men &apos; of Mauritania to restore to the people of Mauritania the powers that they have st@@ olen from them .
a ver@@ bal condemnation of the coup in Mauritania is not enough if the European Union does not take concrete sanctions at the same time to iso@@ late the junta .
author . - ( DE ) Mr President , once again , it is necessary for us to talk about human rights violations in Iran , and it is no time at all since we last spoke about it .
it has signed undertakings of such a nature .
in that country , the blood and body parts of al@@ bin@@ os are traded .
as a member of the donor Group on Governance , the Commission will continue to coordinate donor responses to addressing the problem , including the Al@@ bin@@ o Association .
I now ask you all to rise for a minute &apos;s silence .
the workers were used as human s@@ and@@ bags , so to speak .
the services that are supposed to prevent crime are used only for political and economic rac@@ ke@@ teering , and for squ@@ aring accounts with the opposition .
in the next few weeks I will be proposing to the Commission two separate regulatory measures to deal with these and other issues : firstly , an amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive and , secondly , a regulation on credit @-@ rating agencies .
it is like hearing that a hur@@ ric@@ ane or tsunami is coming and being told that we should reflect on the positive aspects of water and wind !
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if European banks are withstanding the current crisis relatively well , it is simply because banking supervision in Europe - while far from perfect - is at least serious .
my hope is that together we shall have the strength to strike these new paths , then not only those who have won , but also those who have lost will be rescu@@ ed with us .
the problem areas relating to transparency aspects may be summarised as follows : establishing unified standards for information dis@@ closed by companies introducing their shares onto the stock market and company law and corporate governance in relation to the question of the collective responsibility of agencies for information contained in company reports , reinforcing the role of independent council members , standards in the area of setting up committees as part of councils , disclosure of information on council and board members &apos; reimbur@@ se@@ ments , and also increasing investor protection .
I have heard different figures over the years as to whether there are more lobbyists here than there are on Cap@@ it@@ ol hill in Washington , but there is not much between them in any event .
the important cases which have come to the attention of the Petitions Committee have been ones where there has been a continuous breach over many years of Community law , and therefore they have come to the right place , the Petitions Committee .
the European year of creativity and innovation must be a year when promises are kept .
with the second report , Parliament actually invited the Commission to present new proposals to adapt a further limited number of acts .
the Church has not spo@@ on @-@ fed mor@@ als to the people for a long time .
this was a rather negative signal .
rapporteur . - ( ES ) Commissioner , I believe we can agree that adopting a report on such a current , key topic as the quality of teacher education is good news , given that the aim of teacher education is in fact quite simply to improve pupils &apos; education and give them knowledge which provides them with intellectual maturity and a critical mind@@ set while at the same time providing them with the skills necessary to be able to participate in a society which is increasingly competitive and demanding .
if we make progress towards the achievement of these goals with the aid of the Commission , we shall all be well content .
looking at the situation in my country , Bulgaria , I would say that predominantly the basic human needs seem to occupy the minds of the majority of rural inhabitants .
it should be remembered that the fight against terrorism cannot really be effective and proportionate unless we guarantee that the fundamental rights of each citizen are strengthened .
even when a national legal system or national government knows that a gross injustice is being done , it cannot prevent it .
I would define Mr B@@ org@@ he@@ zio &apos;s activities as provocation , and on behalf of the Confederal Group of the United European Left / Nordic Green Left , I would like to make a formal request for the President of Parliament to issue an official warning to Mr B@@ org@@ he@@ zio .
therefore , it is right that we simply take a good look here at modern information technologies in relation to the recruitment , financing and implementation of attacks and the gl@@ ori@@ fication of attacks and come to agreements on how to combat them across Europe , and also supplement national regulations on this with European arrangements and agreements .
I would regret it , therefore , if Parliament were to take the wrong path here and amend these concepts - for the further reason that the Council of Europe has laid down that the concept of public provocation should exist .
Mr President , I would first like to congratulate the European Parliament as a whole on the high standard of this debate .
4 .
I am pleased that Mr Rasmussen largely adopted our position in the negotiations with us .
but to expect us to work efficiently in terms of human resources and costs and to continue this pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge to Strasbourg can no longer be justified , so having voted one way I support those who say one seat for plenary sessions , but please , a rational debate , not a polar@@ ised political debate , on the issue .
neglect in this area may therefore have disastrous consequences , not only cultural , but also economic .
in this respect there is still much to do .
I have always been in favour of market liberalisation , as , in my opinion , it is the main prerequisite for competition among market participants , which is always beneficial to consumers , enabling them to choose and purchase goods at the lowest possible price .
there is an urgent need for Europe to reflect on its open @-@ border policy and the per@@ ni@@ cious consequences of this policy with regard to immigration , crime and Islamic extremism .
it is a good thing , of course , that European citizens are able to petition the authorities - including their &apos; European authorities &apos; - but I regret the feder@@ alist under@@ ton@@ es of this report .
Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system - investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector - The liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of an accident - Por@@ t State control ( recast ) - ship inspection and survey organisations ( Directive recast ) - ship inspection and survey organisations ( Regulation recast ) ( debate )
based on this , I call on the Council not to let sli@@ p away a precious opportunity for us to conclude this matter in conciliation , which some of us will come to with our ho@@ mework almost done , as the informal tri@@ alogues that have been held so far , and the complete consensus that exists with all the shadow rapporteurs , have produced very satisfactory results and could provide a good basis for the final agreement .
President @-@ in @-@ Office , we wish to acknowledge that you and your colleagues have already made great progress in the individual discussions on the six dossiers .
the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance welcomes all seven Commission legislative proposals , and we therefore support the rapporteurs &apos; recommendations on the five common positions , including the split and separate votes on the recommendations of the Costa report concerning inland waterway transport .
one of the key points with regard to the independent investigation of accidents as far as the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is concerned is that this investigation must be truly independent .
I hope that together we can establish a comprehensive , coherent system that ensures the responsibility of each actor within it .
without compromising on safety the European Union has to make sure that the vessels on its members &apos; books do not mig@@ rate to other states , especially those known states which enable ships to fly &apos; flags of convenience &apos; .
what can we do about the pirates ?
yet we are talking here about very tangible military deployment .
finally , as the Vice @-@ President of the Commission said again today , we hope the Pact will enable us to mark out a common asylum policy and a Europe of asylum .
Mr President , Mr Ay@@ l@@ ward is absolutely right .
I will leave Mr Mitchell to answer for his comments .
the report by Carlos Coelho , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on migration to the second generation Schengen Information System ( decision ) ( 120@@ 59 / 1 / 2008 - C6 @-@ 0@@ 188 / 2008 - , and
the launch of SIS II is considerably behind schedule .
evidently , if necessary we can resort to the penalties provided for in the contracts , as my predecessor did by imposing a fine of more than EUR 1 million on one of the contractors .
this requires the assent of the European Parliament rather than simple consultation .
at the same time we import one sixth of all the timber we consume .
another positively good idea is to introduce timber certification for the European market .
it is true that institutions that govern complex and broad areas , as the European Parliament does , often cannot avoid the temptation to sur@@ round their own democratic power with red tape .
we will be debating this issue this afternoon in relation to energy poverty , another topic which we have repeatedly raised and where we have received no response from the Commission , which has yet to produce any real initiatives here .
the first pillar is promoting sustainable growth and jobs .
we therefore ask the Commission to make an additional effort to move forward , as quickly as possible , with its proposed review of the budget .
Commissioner , as you have very rightly said , we all know that the first @-@ pillar issue concerning social policy must be the priority for the communications policy and indeed at the core of an EU that does not simply respect its citizens but wishes to impose its own outlines , structures and order in this international context of the globalisation crisis .
first of all , the European Commission should encourage the employment of young people .
the next item is the Council and Commission statements on preparation of the EU @-@ India Summit in Marseille on 29 September 2008 .
this will be the lon@@ gest in the world , 95 % complete , which gives 3 900 new jobs of direct employment and , I am sure , many thousands more to come .
we regard this as a failure by the European Parliament , as we expect this House to have the courage to criticise Europe &apos;s silence during the negotiations in the Nuclear suppliers Group .
however , as Mrs G@@ ill said , we must provide constructive criticism and we must make sure to praise the courageous attitude , which has been referred to by several speakers , of the Indian Prime Minister , who described these events as a national disgrace and was quick to dis@@ pat@@ ch 3 000 police officers to O@@ ris@@ sa .
- Before the vote on Amendment 13@@ 2 :
A@@ midst this cycle that cannot seem to be broken , the significance of the &apos; European project &apos; cannot be underestimated .
amendments 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 20 , 21 , 32 , 38 , 41 ( on the reci@@ tals )
( SK ) I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur for his many years &apos; work and consistent approach within the framework of the legislative package in the field of electronic communications .
the intentions are good ; let us only hope that they are not cast aside in the face of the huge financial interests at stake .
on the one hand because it is technically complicated , with overla@@ pping legislative proposals ; on the other hand because the balance between confidentiality and security , by its very nature , calls for careful consideration .
everyone can then blame each other afterwards .
without such a mechanism there are fears for the very survival of the subsistence farmers in India .
we all have to cope with the consequences and react to the present situation .
( applause )
this is why , if we wish to avoid further increasingly painful col@@ lap@@ ses , we must have the courage to make a break .
I urge Members to consider a completely different reaction to the current economic difficulties .
it is a shame that ul@@ tr@@ ali@@ ber@@ al dog@@ matism and the economy of financial speculation , the so @-@ called &apos; economy of the de@@ vil &apos; , have taken the upper hand over social concerns and the economy of entrepreneurial spirit and action , which is the only economy capable of generating wealth and serving the citizens .
but beyond the EU &apos;s borders the Financial Stability Forum needs to continue working very intensively ; it is a very important institution at this moment - the level 3 committees of the Lamfalussy framework .
in my view , the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and European Investment Bank programmes etc. should be utilised in a joined @-@ up way in order to pursue seriously the objectives that you , Mr Piebalgs , repeatedly proposed three years ago .
on energy security and foreign policy aspects , I come back to the idea that Europe can and must reinforce its own strengths to deal with the fast @-@ changing global energy economy .
rather than the production of peak energy , the consequence was an international arbit@@ ration dispute , the results of which , however , have been ignored by Hungary .
and I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he has produced a table for the Council of relative co@@ st@@ ings of oil and gas , for example from Russia , as opposed to liqu@@ e@@ fied natural gas from Q@@ a@@ tar , nuclear energy , and all the others , because it seems to me that our governments are not actually producing energy at the prices that the consumers would want .
what , if any , are the circumstances in which eurozone countries may be permitted to exceed the 3 % budget deficit ?
with regard to the application of Community rules regarding occurrence reporting , the Commission is satisfied that all Member States have set up a mandatory reporting system and collect the information in national databases .
without a good domestic production base for first @-@ generation biofuels , innovative and efficient products will have difficulties finding their way into the market .
abroad , it can go up to 16 euros per meg@@ ab@@ y@@ te so you can imagine what kind of bills you can receive if you are now aware of what is happening .
through Regulation 1 of the Council of 15 April 19@@ 58 , amended by article 1 of Regulation 9@@ 20 / 2005 ( EC ) of the Council of 13 June 2005 , Irish became an official working language of European Union institutions as of 1 January 2007 .
in July , the high @-@ level group met with the European Platform on diet , physical activity and Health in order to discuss potential for synergies and partnerships , focusing in particular on salt reduction - the agreed initial priority for joint action with Member States .
the White Paper on nutrition is a useful document in terms of action to control obesity , especially amongst children .
more than 50 % of Europeans are overweight and around 6 % of health expenditure is spent on obesity , as already mentioned here today .
we should not forget campaigns targeted at parents , who have a very important role , and at children .
I should therefore like to thank all those who have spoken in the debate and the shadow rapporteurs .
the Commission proposal addresses three major issues .
tomorrow the Commission intends to continue with this &apos; soft law &apos; approach by adopting another recommendation , this time on creative content online , which will also deal with the issue of multi @-@ territory licensing .
the Commission has excluded the possibility of any type of joint action by the societies , for instance regarding the proposal to create a transparent copyright system in Europe .
I would like to suggest that I do not see that adding the IMF and the World Bank to this monitoring group would make it that un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy .
fourth point : regarding the scope of the draft directive , I know from talking to MEPs on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection when they were in Paris last May that many of you regret the decision to conf@@ ine this text solely to patient mobility and not to address the question of the mobility of health professionals .
another issue is reimbursement .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , four out of every hundred citizens in Europe go abroad for treatment ; in my view , however , health tourism is symp@@ to@@ matic of local shortcomings and a lack of services .
so I am very grateful to you , Commissioner , for your initiative which un@@ question@@ ably has many positive aspects in terms of guaranteeing quality and safety , information to the patient , more European cooperation , e @-@ Health , reference networks and so on .
that is the number one priority .
we must be careful to raise the health standards right across Europe , in large countries as well as in small countries .
( applause )
I ask you to comment on this matter .
can you make sure the technical problem is solved ?
this is a key problem related to food price control , and as such must be given much more specific attention .
better but not good .
since the EU economy still depends to a significant extent on energy imports , it is necessary to institute a common energy policy based on the principle of solidarity , security and diversification of sources and external supply routes .
important labour market questions of this kind must on no account be regulated by way of le@@ ctures from the EU institutions .
I have also received complaints from assistants who have to send their children as category three entries if they want them to attend these schools ; in other words , they have to pay school fees .
unfortunately , there are still some official EU languages which are not spoken in any of the European Schools .
we now have rules on how to go ahead with the European Bac@@ cal@@ au@@ rea@@ te .
thank you !
I am not sure we can feel protected against our own capacity for cru@@ el@@ ty .
it is time for action .
we need to make sure that our fellow citizens maintain confidence in the banking system and do not give in to this tide of panic , which would only preci@@ pita@@ te a downward spiral .
Europe was slow to heed such worries .
in fact to do that would be even more un@@ popular than your ha@@ ted Lisbon Treaty .
colleagues in the House may recall that we all supported Peter Mandelson across most parties and delegations at the time of his appointment .
elections were not democratic .
the euro is an example of what Europe can achieve when it seriously shares sovereignty .
on the other hand , Community institutions - the European Commission and the European Parliament - are responsible for ensuring that the single market remains open and that legislation is in place .
on 14 October , foreign ministers will meet with Bernard Kouch@@ ner , and on 15 October there will be a meeting of senior officials and leaders in order to find appropriate solutions to the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia , recognition of which - I must say this to Mrs Is@@ ler Bé@@ gu@@ in , although she is well aware of it - remains extremely isolated , which is fortuna@@ te as this unacceptable act was strongly condemned by the European Union and by the Presidency .
there is a sense of dis@@ belief that the un@@ thin@@ kable - namely the collapse of the banking system - is now upon us .
we must continue to assist Member States to work towards common goals and shared approaches .
the rapporteurs have suggested a rather complex and formal appeal process with chair@@ men and vice @-@ chair@@ men and a new bureaucracy .
may I finally make the point that we must remember the structure of Europe .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Madam President , when a sitting president w@@ ins all the seats in his Parliament , we can probably assume that something is a@@ miss .
this morning I , too , had the pleasure of exchanging views once more with Mr Milin@@ kevi@@ ch and Mr Kaz@@ u@@ lin .
I understand now that in fact the bilateral agreement between Ireland and Belarus will not be in place until May or June .
now that they acknowledge the existence of such equality , they are shame@@ lessly and high @-@ han@@ de@@ dly claiming that the new parliament has &apos; doub@@ tful democratic legitimacy &apos; .
for that we have our framework for enhanced interinstitutional cooperation , which I believe works very well .
Mr President , I want to pick up on this point about &apos; dis@@ connect &apos; which Michael Cashman rightly raised .
the peoples of the European Union are growing old and they are subject to new threats : pan@@ demics , physical and biological incidents , bio@@ terrorism ; we must find solutions to all of these together .
let us say to the banking sector , this is their B@@ SE moment , and they will rise from the as@@ hes , but they will have to be better regulated .
a successful conclusion of the current round of negotiations requires a comprehensive , ambitious and balanced agreement .
his proposals would have deci@@ ma@@ ted the EU livestock sector , not to the benefit of the developing world , but rather to the low @-@ cost emerging economies and their large ran@@ ches and ran@@ ch@@ ers .
if we focus on finance , it is really undesirable for the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank to play a leading role , even for the worst of enemies .
the first provision ensures national treatment to nationals and companies of the Community providing international maritime transport services when providing international sea @-@ river services in the inland waterways of Ukraine .
in writing . - The service sector is essential for the EU and the Ukrainian economies .
thank you .
we need to multi@@ ply the existing resources , and this is only mentioned in amendments made by Parliament .
also , more research is necessary into de@@ sal@@ ination plants and water recycling technology in order to have a cheaper and more efficient system .
there is no time for delay .
I will not go into detail on the issue of illegal immigration and the proposal for sanctions against employers of illegally staying third @-@ country nationals .
consequently , it would be premature for the Commission to adopt already a view on those aspects of the issues concerning self @-@ employed drivers that pose the question of whether or not to include them in the scope of the Working Time Directive .
in itself , however , it is not a guarantee of social integration or the elimination of poverty .
this means that we could potentially all move forward together .
and now Parliament is to go one step further .
( es ) Mr President , I would like to put the following question to those who have said that symbols and an@@ them@@ s belong to the State .
we will present a report on this next year .
a useful idea in terms of raising patient awareness is the establishment of information and guidance centres to help patients , the healthcare personnel and the entire health sector .
however , a solidarity and compensation fund is necessary for the aba@@ tement of the consequences of this loss of specialists .
therefore , not only did we cross the level considered to be a code red threshold , but we also reached double that percentage .
12 .
particular attention should be paid to the cases of children being brought up by single parents , in large families or in immigrant families .
the new approach consists of con@@ serving water on land through new da@@ ms , new river regulation , disaster prevention , new agricultural strategies that allow a fresh approach and , of course , water diver@@ sion where necessary .
there is no doubt that individuals such as Four@@ ni@@ ret , a dis@@ gus@@ ting paed@@ oph@@ ile who managed to terro@@ rise people in France and then in Belgium because his criminal record had not been forwarded from one country to another , may still exist .
the EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007 are having far @-@ reaching effects .
there are many examples of this , including the state of Belgium , which was created almost 180 years ago by mer@@ ging Fland@@ ers and Wal@@ lon@@ ia .
for example , recently the whole world was able to see the pic@@ tures of the Georgian President who had not only the Georgian flag but also the EU flag in his office when he began the conflict with Russia .
in writing . - I voted in favour of Amendment 6 from the Party of European Socialists that called for a nuclear @-@ free and de@@ militaris@@ ed Arctic .
I would also call on the Irish Government to come forward with all the details of the Bank Guarantee Scheme and note that it has now been extended to non @-@ Irish banks mindful of EU competition rules .
I voted for this report in the conviction that putting the recommendations into practice will boost life expectancy in the European Union and help us achieve the Lisbon objectives related to economic growth .
- ( BG ) Mr President , fellow Members , one of the greatest challenges facing Bulgaria is the transparent use of resources from the European funds .
well , in this particular case there is too much smoke and no fire , and we all know we face very strong competition .
a chronic example of undue delay has been brought to my attention recently in my own constituency .
this will apply with regard to working time , over@@ time , break times , rest periods , night work , paid leave , the protection of workers &apos; health , the right to non @-@ discrimination and the protection of pregnant women .
in Estonia we say : &apos; better late than never &apos; , and it is a positive development that we are finally passing the temporary agency worker directive .
I am also thinking of the European Works Councils Directive , which needs to be revised .
in a similar vein , the Commission welcomes Parliament &apos;s proposals aiming to improve the public &apos;s awareness of national and European laws concerning marriage and divorce contracts .
it is simply one marriage and it is therefore only the European Union , and not the Netherlands , that draws a distinction within our Dutch marriage
I wish to make it clear once more that we have further reinforced the provisions which the Commission has proposed and which are already laid down in Rome III , by stating quite clearly the following , for example , in Amendment 25 : should the law indicated &#91; ... &#93; not recognise legal separation or divorce or do so in a form that is discriminatory as regards one of the spouses , the LEX for@@ i shall apply .
it is intended to provide legal protection to air carriers and reservation systems within the European Union with regard to PNR data transfer to the Austr@@ alian Customs Service , while remaining compliant with EU data protection legislation .
as long as we approach the issue in a proportionate manner and reduce the potential for misuse , PNR could serve as a vital tool to protect the innocent travel@@ ler and dis@@ rupt the potential terrorist .
I think that to reach a first @-@ reading agreement is really a good confirmation of this support .
the geographical presence of all countries should be as great as possible , of course , to make the project even more successful .
we will , in addition , be organising special targeted and focused information campaigns .
in the Committee on Culture we had a genuinely ple@@ asu@@ rable debate about a serious subject with some quite well @-@ informed contributions .
we tend to say that our children are our t@@ reas@@ ure .
in my opinion , international cooperation must be continually increased in this sector that , as other Members have said , is a sector that knows no borders .
a recent report states that two thirds of young people have received unwanted requests while using the Internet and 25 % have viewed material with in@@ decent content .
ever since I was elected in 1999 , we have had a cod recovery plan every year .
in view of its social and economic base , fishing is increasingly becoming a mo@@ tive for demonstrations and protests by fishermen in Poland amongst other countries .
the challenge is , of course , great .
finally , with regard to interinstitutional cooperation on better law making , we must acknowledge that the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better L@@ aw@@ making in force since December 2003 has not been easy to implement .
before concluding , let me say that the Commission has left open the question on the form that will be given to the final outcome of the interinstitutional dialogue in order not to pre @-@ emp@@ t the discussions .
free movement also applies to principles , and any derogation from this course would first and foremost damage Europe , never mind the interpretation of a particular directive .
often , what lies behind seem@@ ing attempts to safeguard labour standards and to provide equal working conditions is in fact protectionism and a clear restriction on free and fair competition .
the view of Parliament is quite clear .
finally , I would like to say that it is now up to the Commission to act .
the important point , though , is that they have begun .
furthermore , while we have lifted the visa requirement among ourselves , it is nonetheless only right that countries whose citizens do not need visas to go one from one country to another have the same mind@@ set when it comes to supporting a European immigration policy .
but it is not enough .
I shall not conceal the fact that we are impressed , including with the resolve shown by you and - I shall spe@@ ll it out - Mr Barroso himself , although not by his Commission .
thus , we are going to give money to Mercedes , B@@ M@@ W and Au@@ di for them to put their money in tax havens .
you mentioned the situation in Georgia and your efforts , but how can you not see that unilateral recognition of Kosovo &apos;s independence pa@@ ved the way for the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia ?
I would add that , democratically , I , along with Bernard Kouch@@ ner , ensured that the European Council valida@@ ted the decisions that we had taken .
the reform of the global financial system for which we are all hoping and pra@@ ying will only be possible - I am absolutely convinced - if Europe is in a position to make its presence felt , and , for that to be the case , we will need to find new resources .
that must not take place .
the Federal reserve Bank pursued a monetary policy that involved keeping interest rates extraordinarily low , which made funds available to anyone who wanted to borrow .
we are ready to work constructively with the European Parliament and the Council in order to find good solutions for Europe and , possibly , for the rest of the world .
this means sustainability , not just maximising the risks in order to maximise the returns .
( el ) Madam President , what we need here today is a new economic and social agreement , a &apos; new deal &apos; .
we need a more effective climate policy .
( FR ) Madam President , it is obvious from this debate that there is still some way to go where this matter is concerned .
however , this agreement does not provide for institutional coordination of cooperation , nor does it contain specific rules on the treatment and protection of intellectual property rights .
the experience acquired by the French Government in presenting its requests , together with the understanding shown by the Commission , the European Parliament and the Council reassure us concerning Europe &apos;s capacity to side with overseas populations confronted by major crises .
the application of parliamentary control to the structure and activities of regulatory agencies should conform with the classic principle of democracy , which demands an increase in the political responsibility of all institutions with executive powers .
the move to the Bologna model throughout the entire university system in Europe has made it difficult enough for students with a master &apos;s degree to find a Ph@@ D place .
in Finland we gave up investigating un@@ fai@@ th@@ fulness or other such matters in divorce cases about 20 years ago .
I therefore voted in favour of the Guer@@ re@@ iro report .
Mr President , I should like to start my speech by c@@ iting a few words that the President @-@ in @-@ Office , Mr Sarkozy , said during the debate this morning .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Mr Jouyet , it is time for con@@ tri@@ tion - this appears to be the m@@ ood today - or at least for re@@ thinking dog@@ mas and in@@ st@@ inc@@ tive reactions , and moreover , I am grateful to Mr Sarkozy for giving , this morning , an example of this which seemed sincere .
Mr President , the Kremlin has got all it wanted from its bar@@ gain with President Sarkozy .
thus , rather than cra@@ w@@ ling on our kne@@ es we should instead sit as partners around the negotiating table at the Kremlin .
the EU &apos;s leverage over Russia is limited .
he reminded us that it was believed there was no point in going to Moscow , but that doing so nevertheless stopped the Russian forces .
let us condemn the disproportionate reaction in Georgia and anything else of that kind .
that is also a clear line that we have to draw .
indeed , the current draft agreement , as our President said , includes a vital , suspen@@ sive clause on human rights ; consolida@@ tes the regular EU @-@ Vietnam dialogue on human rights by confer@@ ring a legal status on it ; and makes provision to help Vietnam equip itself with a national action plan on human rights .
the next item is Question Time ( B6 @-@ 04@@ 75 / 2008 ) .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - ( FR ) In reply to Mr Ry@@ an , as you know , the Cotonou Agreement introduced a new partnership between the European Union and the 78 ACP countries on 23 June 2000 .
that must be done .
do you think , Minister , that this is correct or helpful ?
therefore , mobilising the Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a good thing , but you need to mobilise it so that we can provide help on the ground , so that we can retain the sites , in order to preserve a competitive Polish shipbuilding industry .
hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs and people will take to the streets .
Ms Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , the Polish yards have had a longer transition than the East German yards , and during a bo@@ oming period of the economy .
on the contrary , we have put together an arrangement that is very easy to implement and roll out .
we should ide@@ ally have liked to see all authorities use a common method of fac@@ tor@@ ing environmental impact into their distribution of tenders , so that it became clear that the polluter paid .
our debate needs to be at gras@@ s @-@ roots level , so the Commission also needs to be aware that , in this case , it needs to listen more to Parliament and the MEPs .
it has in actual fact been put together in such a way that the t@@ ini@@ est local authority or even the smallest town or region will be able to deal with these matters quite easily .
the second point is that the images would not be kept but would be immediately deleted ; that is , there ought to be a technical mechanism to prevent the image of a person who decides to pass through a body scan@@ ner from being recorded .
it should also be clear , though , that as the power of decision is being transferred from the Member States to Europe , the European Parliament should also have far more powers to take decisions and carry out inspections in the area in question .
I can only have a report and ensure that Parliament is always involved in any case when there is a debate on an important issue , and also say whether a debate on the issue ought to take place .
it can cost many lives , and so the Commission is determined to act .
it cannot be denied that the competitiveness of our businesses is suffering under the excessive legislative and bureaucratic conditions on manufacturing that have accumulated in recent decades , and that the impact of this is becoming ever more burdensome and unsustainable in the case of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises that form the backbone of the national production system in many Member States .
it will be necessary for all drugs to be bar @-@ co@@ ded and packa@@ ged in such a way that even the man in the street will see from the packaging whether they are safe drugs or counterfe@@ its , in case the drugs have been purchased from somewhere other than a pharma@@ cy .
I am speaking here about products like dis@@ count holiday clubs , where consumers often have to pay a substantial amount up front , ranging from EUR 6 000 to EUR 20 000 , for membership of a club , which will only give a right to a dis@@ count on future holidays .
I believe that many people at present hesitate to purchase such services in other Member States precisely because they cannot feel secure and rely on consumer protection .
after all , the successful development of intercultural dialogue should not be limited to high @-@ profile individual measures such as sy@@ m@@ posi@@ a , joint declarations or symbolic ges@@ tures .
we face increased polar@@ isations that come up against a backdrop of growing tensions over a series of political issues and of growing cultural stereotypes .
that was a political decision and not a market one , and the air that was pu@@ ff@@ ed into the bal@@ lo@@ on is now rus@@ hing out .
they need to both monitor and raise awareness , especially among the youn@@ gest members of society , because they are the most impres@@ sion@@ able and vulnerable .
this resolution is heading in that direction .
the draft directive on conditions for temporary agency workers aims to provide a minimum level of protection for temporary workers while , at the same time , supporting the temporary employment industry .
this will bring benefits for all concerned : patients , authorities and pharmaceutical companies .
secondly , the EU &apos;s primary law concerning the internal market ( Article 49 ) takes precedence over the provisions of the Posting of Workers Directive .
it was created and exists to loy@@ ally serve the interests of the monopoly business groups and to safeguard the exploitation of the working class .
regarding payments , the European Parliament intends to approve the level of appropriations up to the ceiling .
we see a budget of low payments , with a huge gap between commitments and payments and with an unsatisfactory answer to the actual political priorities of the European Union .
that is why the draft budget proposes returning to the original draft , and removing the reductions made by the European Council .
if we want to meet and achieve the objective of less than 30 % in 12 years , we will need some resources .
that is extremely important .
we here in Parliament also support this step and are waiting for the politicians to take advantage of this opportunity .
this is not how it works , though .
in her , we have someone who is hopefully not wasting her time and effort and who truly is investing a great deal of time and effort in this area .
considering that obtaining a visa for the EU still poses a great problem for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina , I call upon the Commission to continue with the dialogue and to do its utmost to implement the road maps with the objective of establishing a visa @-@ free regime with Bosnia and Herzegovina as soon as possible .
of course , there will be a continuous checking of facts , but these are the World Trade Organisation &apos;s rules , and we always have benefited from openness .
it may also lead to the opening of a significant number of investigations in which the initial suspi@@ ci@@ ons ultimately prove to be groun@@ dless .
since 2005 , it has become more and more concrete , more and more to the point and China has made some steps .
sometimes , Europe must simply take the initiative .
only if this goal is reached will the sacrifice of so many innocent victims not have been in vain .
firstly , because this resolution links this catastrophe and this crime to Ukraine and people of Ukrainian nationality alone .
it means that the ph@@ rases spoken are hol@@ low .
only in this way can we reach the goal of these debates : to guarantee that this monu@@ mental , destructive disregard for human lives and dignity will never be repeated in any part of Europe .
I read it as though it were a sort of secular pra@@ yer , a reme@@ mb@@ rance for millions of victims , with which to associate the memory of so many other innocent victims whose sacrifice , I say again , must not be in vain for Europe .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , I welcome the report of my colleague , Ul@@ rich Stock@@ mann , and I thank him for his hard work on this difficult dossier .
( es ) Madam President , I must firstly congratulate my colleague , Mr Stock@@ mann , on his mag@@ nific@@ ent report , and particularly on his patience and ten@@ ac@@ ity in taking this forward .
this directive on airport charges is a real step forward : by making relations between airports and airlines more transparent , it will enable what are often op@@ a@@ que and confli@@ ctual relationships to be enhanced and improved .
the Commission is happy about this , since we are the institution that receives most of these complaints .
we also need cooperation between the European Ombudsman and the ombuds@@ men in similar organisations at national , regional and local level in the Member States .
- ( PL ) Madam President , despite the overall increase in the number of admissible complaints received by the Ombudsman in 2007 , he handled 17 % more than in the previous year .
not long ago a publication entitled &apos; Im@@ proving lives &apos; , of which you have all received a copy , presented a summary of the collaboration over the years .
7 .
Madam President , I voted for the resolution on Holo@@ domor , the great Ukrainian famine .
at the same time , there is a need to consider the whole picture , and the good news is the ever @-@ increasing awareness that significantly larger resources need to be invested in what really is joint expenditure - in this case , on climate .
its aim is to ensure that , within six years , Bosnia and Herzegovina has &apos; properly implemented and enforced &apos; the Community acquis on free competition in the internal market and also &apos; other trade @-@ related areas &apos; .
since this goal is un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , the EU condemns itself to an indefin@@ ite presence in that country .
I refer , for example , to the coup by part of the army , intolerance , stra@@ ti@@ fication of society in terms of property , or racial differences .
among these demands , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament lays particular emphasis on several points : firstly , strengthening the UN mission with European personnel capable of communicating with the population ; and secondly , we are calling on Congo &apos;s highest political and military authorities to do their utmost to ensure that soldiers from the Congolese army put a stop to their atrocities once and for all .
as regards our support to the population in conflict @-@ affected areas , the Commission will continue to provide support via both our humanitarian and development cooperation .
with 2 000 political prisoners under arrest , access to free media impe@@ ded by the authorities and widespread slavery in industry , the people of this country need serious help .
it has been a fantastic event , and I am delighted to have had the opportunity to meet you .
when the demonstration was over , the group was attacked by about a do@@ zen th@@ ug@@ s who be@@ at them up and s@@ nat@@ ched ban@@ ners with the logo of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament .
Mrs Berès - I am about to finish - said in her speech that the Commissioner and the Commission should once again draw the attention of the Finance Ministers to the conclusions of this report .
the debate on coordinating economic policies in the euro area is now un@@ question@@ ably more relevant and more topical .
the real test of a currency &apos;s success is the degree of confidence in the market , and that is measured in this case by the bond spre@@ ads between euro @-@ zone states .
we must , however , also bear in mind that these successes would never have been possible without the Maastricht criteria , the Stability and Growth Pact and the European Central Bank , and without political will and a willingness to take responsibility at European level .
in their report , the authors praise the fall in unemployment , which over nine years has ad@@ mittedly been just over 1.5 % , but forecasts now predict a significant increase in unemployment in the Euro Zone in the coming year .
Mr President , it has always been economic nonsense for a number of differently performing economies to share the same interest and exchange rates .
on the contradictions between the Member States , Mr President of the Eurogroup , again , I cannot share your view .
we know full well that France and S@@ c@@ and@@ ina@@ via have taken positive measures .
in spite of already over@@ burd@@ ening employment legislation , usually drafted by people with little or no business experience , pay differenti@@ als continue for one simple reason : employment is about demand and supply ; it is about lifestyle choices ; it is often based on priorities , early retirement goals , a desire to live in certain parts of a country or town , pressure of hob@@ bies or sport , or one of those off@@ spring .
in my country , Bulgaria , the pay gap between men and women is between 25 % and 30 % , and while the overall picture in the European Union shows a lower differ@@ ential , the fact remains that women are paid less than men .
mostly , this results from economic segregation and in such cases existing legislation is limited in application .
I therefore feel that the solution we found ( of defining quantitative limits ) is a fair and balanced solution , which does not excessively benefit any country in particular .
Mr President , I welcome the report on general arrangements for excise duty .
despite joint efforts with successive presidencies since 2005 , the Council has so far not been able to reach agreement on this proposal .
this being so and given that the European Parliament has adopted the Commission &apos;s proposal , I fail to see the reasons and causes for the delay in ratifying the regulation .
even then the problems had clearly come into focus , and the alarm was s@@ ounded .
I agree with the opinion of the rapporteur , Anna Hed@@ h , that the table should be properly promoted through the media and placed on the relevant websites .
I also think that the Commission has not taken due account of certain sectors which are particularly vulnerable to the current crisis in the markets and which face a serious risk of abandonment given the proposed timetable and rate of decoupling up to 2013 .
smaller farms have been particularly affected by market turbulence in recent months .
how can we reform European agriculture fairly if we ignore 95 % of all farms ?
( es ) Mr President , Commissioner , we agree with the aims of this &apos; health check &apos; , but not all the proposed measures .
I regret the fact that , in the run @-@ up to 2013 , the bigger picture is f@@ ading into the background .
the task of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) has always been to guarantee the supply of food for everyone .
however , if and when the Lisbon Treaty is adopted , Parliament will be centr@@ ally involved and thus there will be a bigger role for open , transparent debate on CAP @-@ related issues , leading to greater legitimacy amongst the farming community .
I am sure that we will be able to find a consensual solution responding to the concerns of European farmers and agriculture who are watching us closely .
thus , prevention is cheaper than cure .
in regard to the fruit market , I understand it will create a great many opportunities for mis@@ chief such as mandatory rules that all fruit must come from inside the EU .
Mr President , I just want to say a few words to express my feelings on the conclusions of this debate , which has been extremely lively and consensual .
I also know that the education must be narro@@ w@@ ly focused on the specific requirements of a range of different groups of citizens in order to be really effective .
as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , I join those mentioned above in supporting the report .
there would also be an increase in len@@ der competition and the overall efficiency of the market , as consumers with more knowledge can understand how various financial offers differ and can choose the one which best suits their needs .
a daily in@@ take of 600 grams for people 11 + should be our target .
the question is why the EU should take care of this , rather than the municipalities that organise education .
at a time of financial difficulties , it provides a new framework for discussions about the economy .
the average wage difference between women and men is 8.@@ 5 @-@ 15 % , and even bigger in the private sector , in the latter &apos;s favour .
the Presidency welcomed the European Central Bank &apos;s robust decision , at the beginning of November , to reduce its interest rates by 50 basis points , and on several occasions we have applau@@ ded the ECB &apos;s action in response to the financial crisis and its active participation in the deliberations of the Eurogroup and the European Councils .
there is now an openness not only among the great powers but also among the emerging powers , towards changing the world and promoting European values : the value of freedom and the value of solidarity .
ladies and gentlemen , the current crisis was not caused by capitalism but by the gre@@ ed of irresponsible banks that were unwilling to bear the risk for their own decisions .
secondly , we must not forget the crisis involving the Treaties which underpin our Union , reflected in the fate of the Treaty of Lisbon .
regulation and transparency are supposed to prevent another financial crisis .
for several months now , European industrial organisations have been mobilising against our European climate and energy strategy .
talking about the American continent , Madam President , it is vital to support the efforts of the Commission , and Commissioner Benita Ferrero in particular , to conclude association agreements with Central America , and especially the new direction to be taken in the negotiations with the An@@ de@@ an Community .
in the Netherlands , for example , the building industry is facing a 20 % decline , so I think that we should apply the low VAT rate there to ensure that the housing market across Europe receives a shot in the arm .
with due respect , Commissioners - and I speak as a great fan and supporter of the Commission in this regard - I have not yet seen evidence of this being in this legislative programme .
by my side you see my colleague responsible also for much of the response , as well as Mr McCreevy behind us here , and they will know better than anyone else that we have had to work on this from the very first moment .
in spite of these commendable features of the law governing foundations , however , there is still a need to resolve the numerous difficulties that religious communities and minorities continue to experience , particularly as regards their legal status and , I must stress , their property rights .
as for your situation , Mr S@@ on@@ ik , I have noted it and it is evident that , for all MEPs , we must show the greatest vigilance and give you our support in your actions .
( FR ) Madam President , to reply to the honourable Member , I do not have the exact figure in my head .
this seems to me , to reply to Mrs Doyle , the real difficulty .
it is necessary to have this temporary transitional solution so Member States still have the option of using this type of paper registration .
I have no difficulty with it .
bearing this in mind , we are now looking at raising the facility from EUR 12 billion to EUR 25 billion .
Commissioner , please take into account that I do not want my neighbour Hungary to be plu@@ m@@ me@@ ted into social conflict due to corrective measures such as this based on counter demands .
it is presen@@ tly continuing to reinforce its measures in North Kivu and we encourage it to continue its efforts in this direction .
in my capacity as humanitarian aid rapporteur for your Parliament , I went to Kin@@ sh@@ as@@ a at the beginning of November to meet with Mr B@@ ots@@ w@@ ali L@@ eng@@ om@@ o , the new Minister for social affairs and humanitarian action .
Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , Europe should press for a stronger and better MONUC mandate and more troops .
the situation is clear .
without intervention by the public hand , the hidden hand , dear to Adam S@@ mit@@ h , will prefer the short term and will destroy structures that are essential in shaping our common future .
as you said , Mr President , faced with this crisis , what is needed is a coordinated response from Europe and the Member States , especially those directly concerned .
this is particularly important to suppliers , because they work across borders .
dialogue is the only way to defeat the worst ang@@ els of our nature .
regrettably , many solutions have been designed in a way which does not take into account the situation or the model of agriculture existing in new Member States .
it is obvious that we need Community statistics for public health and for health and safety at work in order to provide support for the strategies which are aimed at developing high @-@ quality medical care , which is viable and accessible to all .
it is important , in the current demographic context , to remind Europeans of the significant contribution of immigration to the economic prosperity and development of the European Union .
in preparing the Blue Card scheme , we were tor@@ n between the fear of its abuse by third country nationals and the hope that the new arri@@ vals will meet the needs of our labour markets and contribute to the development of our economy .
Mr President , Member States should continue to decide for themselves about the right of entry of migrants to their territories , and as long as there are people without jobs in our Member States , I continue to be doub@@ tful as to the need for stimulating legal immigration .
Europe needs to prove that it is in favour of openness , all the more so as , according to the report , only 5.5 % of immigrants headed for the European Union , while 50 % of highly qualified immigrants headed for the US or Canada .
everyone acknowledges the fact that the European Union needs the facility to use skilled man@@ power from third countries on a long @-@ term basis in order to improve its competitiveness and boost economic growth .
the European Blue Card must also be seen as a way of discoura@@ ging illegal immigration , as part of the agreement for immigration and asylum , as well as part of the solution to the problem of the labour shortage which will affect the European Union in the coming decades .
therefore , it is high time to re@@ kind@@ le the sta@@ rs .
this is not a purely economic issue , it is also a political question , because this will allow us to ensure that European space @-@ related activities are not regarded simply as the privilege of a few large European countries , but are seen as something which all 27 countries are involved in and can benefit from .
author . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on 3 December 2008 in Oslo , we will at last reach the point of being able to sign the convention banning cluster munitions .
we must approach this issue of cluster bombs with equal vig@@ our and commitment , in order to build a better , more humane world and not see innocent civilians suffer in the aftermath of armed conflict .
on the labour markets , for example , activation policies can be very helpful .
will a new line be created , so that there is a budget for information ?
we have supported this work with communication k@@ its including various materials such as fact she@@ ets , presenta@@ tions and key messages .
furthermore , many researchers are still trained in a way which does not equip them with the skills needed in a modern knowledge economy .
this allowed an EU @-@ wide debate to be launched as a first opportunity to have preliminary discussions with academics and civil society on ethical , legal and other societal aspects of farm animal cloning .
I find it very anno@@ ying .
it poses a number of challenges for us , however .
we in this House are faced by new infrastructure requirements , new requirements on public services and on business , education and social systems .
at the same time , although the inf@@ ant mortality rate has fallen at Community level to 4.@@ 7 in a thousand inhabitants , there are still some Member States where this figure is 12 in a thousand inhabitants .
one year ago , in the framework of the conference &apos; HIV in Europe 2007 &apos; , participants developed a comprehensive call to action on measures regarding how to effectively tackle HIV / AIDS in Europe .
in one year alone , they committed between EUR 80 million and EUR 90 million and this is , of course , doubled because we commit the other half .
will it be possible to amend a sector without us realising ?
concerning ecological pol@@ len zones , despite the fact that it seems difficult to set up zones as such , I would like to remind you that financial support is already granted for the efficiency of moving of be@@ eh@@ ives .
beekeeping has been an important component of the economy since pre@@ historic times , that is to say since before the inc@@ e@@ ption of written history .
as we know , this discharge is the first discharge for the financial perspective 2007 @-@ 2013 .
in the south there is more to distribute and control than in the north .
I do not understand some of the numbers , for example , your findings on the two new Member States Romania and Bulgaria and what the European Anti @-@ Fraud Office ( OLAF ) identified there in 2007 .
I thought that the excellent French Presidency would also improve this aspect of facing up to the consequences . for it is here where they must face up to the consequences .
we , however , must do all we can to allow the citizens of the European Union to reap the benefits of membership .
this would go against the for@@ mer@@ ly entr@@ en@@ ched practice whereby the same institutions seal@@ ed themselves off tigh@@ tly against all controls .
while the European countries are among the so @-@ called &apos; clean@@ est countries &apos; in the 2008 Global corruption perception index , according to recent studies these wealthy countries like to show preference for using illegal means , for example bri@@ ber@@ y , in their outside overseas businesses .
this is what we await , but while we are waiting we must find some other solutions .
these provisions have proven to be very successful .
4 .
I am sorry that we have lost a battle , but the war and our fight will continue .
it is a de@@ lusion in strategic terms , because the behaviour of immigrants will end up being mo@@ del@@ led on that of Europeans ; I am thinking here mainly of the unfortunate tendency to have fewer children in a society which is truly dis@@ orien@@ tated on all counts .
moreover , immigrants will be able to accumu@@ late periods of presence on European territory in order to obtain the status of long @-@ term resident .
the discussion has made it clear that , in future , although there will only be one document instead of 21 , this one document will be just as extensive as the 21 individual documents .
while the British armed Forces always seek to minimise harm to the civil population and limit collateral damage we should never lose sight of the fact that we are fighting terrorist and insur@@ gent elements totally without scru@@ ples in the methods they employ for the indiscriminate destruction of innocent human life .
we support the text of the joint motion for a resolution and hope that this will mark the start of the European Union &apos;s serious concern about this type of humanitarian issue and its condemnation of the misuse of religious concepts to commit atrocities in the name of God .
where are the m@@ igh@@ ty United States , China , Russia and the European Union , which claim to be civilised countries ?
indeed , some steps have been taken to launch a debate in the country over the usefulness of the death penalty as a deterrent to he@@ in@@ ous crimes .
it is quite appalling that we are , at this point in time , even considering upgrading relations with Israel when there are so many breaches of international law , families being evi@@ cted , settlements being put in place .
- Before the vote on recital D
Africa is the most severely affected , with 33 million already infected with HIV .
your rapporteurs are very aware of this .
giving it the tools to do this task more efficiently , more democratically , is not a dis@@ tra@@ ction .
Europe wants to change everything , but not its cars .
it is quite clear that we must further improve both the capabilities of the European Union in preventive analysis and the instruments of crisis management .
we not only have a crisis or many building sites , we also have an opportunity .
firstly : I think that we are making progress .
too often , what we see is a realisation of the urgency of the situation and a ju@@ x@@ ta@@ position of national solutions that are then d@@ res@@ sed up as a European solution .
it also takes account of the fact that not all Member States have the same room for manoeuvre .
the plan underestima@@ tes the importance of the coordinated development of energy infrastructure as a whole , not only green energy , and the coordinated development of road and rail infrastructure as a prerequisite for the effective distribution of investment , as well as the need to deal with the financing of the agricultural sector .
I would ask the Commission and the Council to tell me what they consider realistic schedu@@ les for dealing with this issue .
only yesterday , at the Commission &apos;s initiative , the Council , as Mr Jouyet said earlier , gave its political approval to at least four - if I remember correctly - Commission initiatives on regulation of different aspects of the financial markets or services .
it is essential for immediate measures to be taken aimed at gaining acceptance for the Roma and har@@ nes@@ sing their economic capacity in the service of European development .
these problems should be addressed primarily by the European Union , through an appropriate common policy which requires clear legal bases .
this reform needs to respect Roma &apos;s specific culture and traditions , while also linking the education system to the values of European culture and civilisation .
do you really think that in the current situation it is a contribution to peace .
the state of Israel , which pri@@ des itself on its democratic system , has been found in breach of international law on so many occasions in the way it treats Palestinians that most people &apos;s patience has been stret@@ ched to breaking point .
they have a deeper political basis .
Mrs Fon@@ ta@@ ine gave a good outline of the strong recommendations it contains .
the action plan to reduce administrative burdens has set itself the target of cutting them by 25 % by 2012 .
an urgent question arises within this context : does the Council intend to formally support the European Charter for Small Enter@@ prises and will Member States make a binding commitment to its implementation ?
if this fails , the parties hindering it must be identified .
significant examples are those involving the Pe@@ u@@ geo@@ t / C@@ it@@ ro@@ en production Centre in Man@@ gu@@ al@@ de and the R@@ ena@@ ult Industrial unit in Ca@@ cia , A@@ ve@@ iro ; both of these are part of the Portuguese automobile industry .
I would also like to thank the secretariat of the Development Committee , particularly Guido Van Hec@@ ken and Anne Mc@@ Lau@@ ch@@ lan and to thank , in my office , E@@ o@@ in Ó Se@@ an@@ á@@ in and Oli@@ ver O &apos;@@ C@@ alla@@ gh@@ an , who were very helpful in all of this .
and if it has , will any compensation be envisaged ?
if this were to happen , it would clearly constitute nothing more than a f@@ ool &apos;s deal , and we would undoubtedly have to continue our efforts .
it is my view that the European Union should be willing to contribute more rigorously in its pursuit of the UN Millennium Development goal : to hal@@ ve world famine by the year 2015 .
the envisaged proposals also respond to the concerns and recommendations expressed in the report by Mr Staes .
I am grateful to Mr Michel and ask him to pass on to the Commissioner responsible my thanks for having accepted a couple of amendments , but I feel really frustra@@ ted by what we have debated here .
I am assuming that , despite the difficulties which occurred , all the companies concerned were in a position to pre @-@ register their substances and that the first implementation phase of REACH was thus successfully concluded .
I have seen dozens of them , and they by no means mean that anything will really happen .
adopting this package of measures on climate and energy is necessary in order for the European Union to maintain its international credibility .
you - the group chair@@ men , rapporteurs and committee chair@@ men - wanted to meet us and Mr Jouyet , and we all discussed what the best possible conditions were to attempt to reach an agreement by the end of the year .
therefore , the heading for this legislative procedure which we have brought to an initial agreement should not read Sarkozy but Sacconi .
as such , in Bali , we promised the rest of the world we would come up with a far @-@ reaching climate change package , and we should not dis@@ appoint them .
if we are unable to change this , Mr Langen , then the future is ble@@ ak .
without reducing their emissions , Europe alone will not be able to solve this problem .
they do not look good for the climate either .
it is not for nothing that 11 000 ste@@ el@@ workers demonstrated in Brussels this week to keep their jobs .
this is a principle condition for the effective functioning of the economy and for ensuring peace of mind for our citizens .
secondly , we are running out of oil .
it is a great honour to speak before you today and I thank you for your invitation .
that is their view .
as regards General Sta@@ tionary combustion , it is important that the new performance standard for emissions is in place , which should be implemented in every power station from 2015 on at the latest .
· Inves@@ tments in education and science for sustained development - without which there cannot be talk of an effective fight against climate change , as they ensure adequate individual and organisational preparation ;
I remember the debt that this continent ow@@ es to the United States for our freedom and our membership of NATO .
the revised version of the regulation on jurisdiction , recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations clearly stipulates the criteria and situations where this type of duty is enforced by law .
in writing . - ( SV ) We Swedish Social Democrats believe that these reports are a step along the way towards combating impro@@ per tax evasion more effectively .
these small businesses are the economic pul@@ se of the west of Ireland .
over the past two decades , they have under@@ gone dramatic changes with the clear objective of becoming members of the EU .
this action is one in a series of many other actions aimed at restricting the freedom of expression in this country .
we are grateful that the problem has been resolved , but we need to know how it happened so that we can prevent it from happening in future .
the next item is the recommendation for second reading , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the Council common position ( 105@@ 97 / 2 / 2008 - C6 @-@ 03@@ 24 / 2008 - for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003 / 88 / EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time ( Rapporteur : Mr Cercas ) .
let me also congratulate the presidency @-@ in @-@ office because , as it will well know , this issue has been blocked for the seven previous presidencies and it has taken great skill to get as far as it has got .
after all , the ministers agree on a 48 @-@ hour maximum working week in the EU .
the second objective concerns on @-@ call time , which cannot be considered as inactive working time but must be considered for all inten@@ ts and purposes as working time , just as it is appropriate to safeguard the right to a compensa@@ tory rest period for medical staff .
as European socialists , we shall , in any case , continue to defend workers because , now more than ever , Europe needs a social model that meets the needs of the most vulnerable citizens and especially of those most affected by the consequences of the economic and financial crisis .
let us go to work .
there must be a clear distinction between the social dialogue and the European Parliament .
this relates in particular to rules for avoiding the risk of cho@@ king on small parts , which is a serious risk to children and will now be countered more effectively .
I therefore very much expect , Commissioner , that the very clear statements from the Commission concerning these three issues will be followed through , and we in Parliament will follow up on this .
if only the same could be achieved with other products as well .
we must make all possible efforts to prevent avoidable accidents , which we nevertheless continue to hear about from time to time .
granting greater freedom to countries provides an opportunity for them to exploit these potential possibilities .
finally , I should like to touch upon a topic that was also bro@@ ac@@ hed by Mr Be@@ au@@ pu@@ y : Member States can do an awful lot by , for example , making the financial management declaration , or taking political responsibility for the implementation of funds .
however , they would subsequently receive a letter and realise that they had un@@ know@@ ingly entered into a contract that bin@@ ds them to a payment of around 1 000 euros for three years .
in the Commission &apos;s view , work on this matter should continue to be based solely on technical criteria , and it therefore feels that the procedural rules should , in any event , continue to guarantee a high level of safety and effectiveness .
you are familiar with the story yourself , having chaired a working group that , quite rightly , felt that the statute for assistants was an important matter .
market opening and attempts to attract private and foreign capital to the Indian aviation market are seen as part of the measures necessary to develop and modernise India &apos;s aviation sector in order to meet increasing demand and consumer expectations .
as a result , we should ensure a comprehensive and integrated approach under the various associated policies ( including cohesion , environment , maritime and social ) .
Additionally , the candidate for Director selected by the G@@ over@@ ning Board will be invited to make a statement before the competent committee ( s ) of the European Parliament and answer questions put by its / their members before his or her appointment ( Article 10 ) .
the introduction of community wide technical rules for trucks , lorries and buses will provide an effective means of tackling pollution .
this report will raise awareness on the issue so that fewer businesses fall victim to sca@@ ms , urging EU countries to tighten national laws and ensure that existing EU law on misleading advertising and unfair commercial practices is adequately enforced .
I stated that we would never give up on the timetable or on the triple 20 objective , but everyone here needs to understand that countries such as the new Eastern Member States , where heavy industry has been a victim of the transition from the communist system to the market economy , agreed to retain the reference to 2005 even though they had good reason to call for a different reference year , for example 1990 , to be used .
we in the European Commission have always supported this Treaty , and we had reason to think that , by taking the time to listen to the concerns of our Irish friends , together we would be able to find the elements for a solution .
Mr President , last week the German weekly newspaper der S@@ pie@@ gel published a portra@@ it of you entitled &apos; The Om@@ ni@@ president &apos; .
secondly , Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , Mr Watson and I , Mr Pöttering and Mr Crowley took part in a meeting in the cas@@ tle in Prague .
you are a cour@@ te@@ ous , tolerant , nice person when one meets you in private , when one invites you to lunch : you understand the other person &apos;s arguments .
it is clear - those were the conclusions of the G20 - that a global effort will be needed to relaunch the global economy .
however , some of the package is unsatisfactory and it is not as strong as it should be .
we surely cannot criticise her for that .
Mr Nassauer , thank you for your support as a very experienced Member of Parliament , as a German Member of Parliament .
this leadership has been a confident one .
( FR ) Mr President , governing means looking ahead .
I would simply like to observe in this instance that , if these prec@@ ep@@ ts are so important , then it is worth learning our lesson in courage and following it through .
the latest dis@@ avo@@ w@@ al concerns the political upgrading of Israel , carried out at full speed in the Council .
I am firmly convinced of that .
in Europe , however , this mix@@ ture of social decline and fear has always opened the door to fasc@@ ism . &apos;
I still remember the debate on renewable energy , heating and cooling and all the issues we discussed .
finally , we have secured the basis for an industry with two million new jobs in Europe and research into green energy technologies , so I feel justifi@@ ably proud today .
however , these crops account for no more than 2 % of Europe &apos;s current agricultural production .
thank you , Mr President .
this will give us a good incentive to try out this transitional technology .
the main objective of climate policy is to establish a syn@@ chron@@ ous , universal agreement .
at the same time , I feel that most of the issues from the Emissions Trading Directive which caused Member States major problems have been addressed properly and that the final outcome has been fair and will allow the European Union to embark on a real mission to combat climate change .
all in all , this directive fills a gap , and in spite of all its shortcomings it is of pioneering significance .
these are the countries that raise their her@@ ds most sustainably based on gras@@ s .
finally , on this subject which , as the rapporteur was saying , is not a perfect or ideal solution forever , but which , according to the eight leading acade@@ mi@@ es of science , is probably inevitable , we have a consensus for 300 million tonnes , or at least the monetary equivalent , which should enable us to establish a do@@ zen demonstrators , as Commissioner Dimas , in fact the whole Commission , wanted .
we are disappointed that many other good points included by the committee have been lost during negotiations , including stronger liability and monitoring , transport and the exclusion of enhanced oil recovery .
as I said a moment ago , this is where this legislation has been greatly improved .
first of all and quite sincerely I must thank everyone who has worked on this report , particularly the delegation , among many , from the French Presidency .
it s@@ lep@@ t through and sat out decades of pressure to innovate .
( RO ) I would like to congratulate Mr Sacconi on his report on an area which is extremely important from an economic and social perspective , a fact which is also borne out by the European economic recovery plan .
I am saying this as personally as possible , as I was in Poznań three days ago .
the Commission confirms that the 2 % reductions mentioned in Article 7@@ a ( 2 ) ( b ) and ( c ) are not binding and that the review will address their non @-@ binding character .
I hope it will not go on into the early hours .
lastly , I give special , warm thanks to the shadow rapporteurs , particularly Mrs Four@@ é , who worked alongside me in the sense that we made a good team at improving this text , as well as the rest of my fellow committee members , Mr C@@ oc@@ il@@ ov@@ o , Mrs Lichten@@ berger and my other colleagues .
of course , but it is also the consequence of a d@@ il@@ atory policy of prevention on the one hand and repression on the other by Member States and , indeed , the European Union , which up to now has been unable to secure a common road safety policy .
that is why I support Amendment 38 tabled by Mrs Lichten@@ berger , which adds certain enhan@@ cements to the Commission &apos;s text .
I thank you for the good cooperation and wish you all the best .
I should like once again to thank everyone who was prepared to wa@@ ive parliamentary rights in this procedure .
its adoption will , at first reading , give the green light to a reform addressing two urgently needed issues : raising the level of coverage , and shor@@ tening pay@@ out delays .
the first is the fight against climate change , and the Council &apos;s conclusions on the subject are modest but at least it has made some conclusions ; investments need to be made this year and increased in 2010 .
here ?
the second lesson is this : the entire history of the budget shows that legal ceilings , the Gra@@ m@@ m @-@ Ru@@ d@@ man @-@ Hol@@ l@@ ings Act in the US , the rule of 1 % of national income , are all , again , fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ness .
policy changes are therefore required in order to re@@ ori@@ ent our economic model , stop the dis@@ integration of our productive structure and prevent any increase in the adverse social and climatic effects that are now occurring .
the current budget does not , in view of the current situation , reflect the wishes of many MEPs , such as the need to counteract the growing economic crisis , or to fund new technologies which will be used to improve the environment and combat climate change .
rapporteur . - Mr President , as rapporteur , I had wanted to speak before my report , but I thank you for the opportunity to speak now , because it is important for all our sa@@ kes that a couple of things are put on the record .
as for his health , he is looking a little better .
it is the same foundation for our future and , I must be honest , despite the feelings of friendship we may feel , despite the clo@@ sen@@ ess that I feel towards all the people here , the European Parliament &apos;s position , the position of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the positions of principle adopted by these assemb@@ lies , I must say that this prize , the Sakharov Prize , and comments such as those that have been made , are a kind of recur@@ rent le@@ it@@ moti@@ v , but it also calls for other , pragmatic decisions .
with this decision , the bulk of the money goes outside the European Union in the form of CD@@ Ms , while our legislation contains too many exceptions , too many flexibility mechanisms and too little compul@@ sion .
working in the European Parliament has taught me how difficult it is to achieve a compromise , and I therefore regret the fact that the European Parliament has rejected the Council &apos;s common position .
it could be said at this point that we are lu@@ cky that the EU has decided not to export its entire economy to Asia straight away .
our endeavours to combat climate change must be coupled with an aim to draw up clear legislation , so as to ensure planning security for our economy .
this involves important sectors , including buildings and transport .
preserving jobs and creating the prerequisites for economic development are absolutely necessary , especially in the current economic and financial crisis .
implementing a clause to dero@@ gate from the weekly limit of 48 hours and not calculating on @-@ call time as working time risks creating a two @-@ speed social Europe , divided between workers who can benefit from social protection in their Member States and others who cannot refuse to accept dimin@@ ished social rights .
countries that do not meet these criteria are not accepted into the members &apos; circle .
it is a nonsense that a citizen driving outside of his / her own Member State can fl@@ out traffic laws on speeding , drink @-@ driving , failure to wear a se@@ at@@ belt or failure to stop at a red light without receiving the appropriate punishment .
today we awarded the Sakharov Prize to Hu Jia , who champi@@ ons the causes of human rights and the environment in China .
since you pointed it out , I should like to focus specifically on the major role of the guidelines as a guide for the action taken by the European Union on the ground .
I would like to give very special thanks to Mr Jouyet , whose war@@ m@@ th , profession@@ alism and skill have been unanimously appreciated by this House .
I shall be particularly vigilant regarding respect for fundamental rights , and especially respect for the rights of the child , where the Member States , as I have already said , implement the Return Directive .
to come together to ensure that these rights be respected is our sole@@ mn duty . &apos;
they come from countries which all have dangerous situations , so this element of the report does not make sense .
law @-@ ab@@ iding citizens in Europe deserve to know that their own rights are protected against people who would seek to attack them .
it is not by s@@ cor@@ ning fundamental rights , human rights and privacy that terrorism will be combated effectively .
the level of tax fraud in the European Union is somewhere between EUR 200 and 250 billion .
it gives me an opportunity to state publicly that maintaining the mother tongue of the children of European immigrants is a European resource which must be preserved .
it has to be implemented with the flexibility that it pos@@ ses@@ ses , while maintaining and complying with the rules of the pact , and that will be a major test .
if you are not present , the question falls and you will not receive an answer . &apos;
vocational education at all levels is the future of Europe , it is the future of each individual Member State , it is the an@@ te@@ room of creation and productivity which leads to progress and innovation .
let us not beg@@ ru@@ dge future generations this funding .
we who hold political responsibility in Europe must address this situation with a common response based on respect for the dignity and fundamental rights of the immigrants .
as such , it should not only respect the EU &apos;s fundamental values in its activities , but also work for their promotion , particularly in a field which touches upon critical questions relating to migration and freedom of movement .
currently , 80 % of these illegal border crossings are managed in practice , it must be said , by smugg@@ lers , by un@@ scrupulous operators .
too often , consumers are unaware of the scale and repercussions of the problem .
what is more , we would be happy to keep you to your lo@@ f@@ ty ambition , because it is still a major problem , and , indeed , one that is still increasing .
there is no doubt that this is extremely significant for undertakings .
for the rest , it is true that criminal law provisions were proposed by the Commission in 2006 , and that we have Parliament &apos;s support , but , for the moment , the Council has not yet taken any action to adopt these provisions .
this is something that is not an EU mala@@ ise .
e @-@ justice within this Parliament , and certainly within the Committee on Legal Affairs , also chi@@ mes in with the theme that we have long had close to our hearts , that of access to justice and how we provide access to justice on a cross @-@ border basis .
however , this freedom of movement has been only partially realised today and , as you know , alongside the existing instruments , we have obviously provided for new measures .
similarly , additional efforts are obviously required from Member States to make effective use of the funds currently available .
as the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions , I notice how frequently the citizens of the European Union are not aware of their rights and , conver@@ sely , how they sometimes believe that they can intervene in matters when they have no right to do so .
it follows that , even beyond what we have done when the need dicta@@ tes , for example in relation to security , criminal law and the fight against terrorism , we are now addressing those who need rules and dispute settlements that apply throughout Europe , because they live , by definition , in their country but also elsewhere , because they work and because they have relationships with everyone across Europe .
however , a knowledge @-@ based economy will need an increasingly better skilled labour force .
there is no doubt that we need a qualified majority in the final vote if we are to call on the Commission to take legislative action , but I fail to see why we also need a qualified majority beforehand for amendments .
I have to say , though , that the report is balanced , addressing , as it does , a number of painful areas , including the lack of cooperation , or should I say sa@@ bo@@ tage , by third countries , such as Libya and Turkey .
in reality , areas where farming conditions are difficult and where the state of the infrastructure leaves much to be desired are becoming de@@ populated .
in the area of university education I support the need to modernise the range of studies so that they fulfil current and future socio @-@ economic requirements .
vocational education and training are a crucial part of Europe &apos;s efforts to tackle the social challenges presented by ageing societies and to re@@ align its position in the global economy and resolve the economic crisis .
this content ran@@ ges from financial transactions but also the real@@ m of public records and official documents of that kind .
Mr Mugabe &apos;s sudden radic@@ alism of a few years back , when he had never managed to overhaul agricultural land ownership and had allowed the ch@@ as@@ m between rich and poor to continue to exist , was mainly intended to attract new supporters among a young generation and not to ali@@ en@@ ate his old com@@ ra@@ des any further .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Madam President , I am grateful to all the MEPs who have launched an urgent appeal for Zimbabwe , since Zimbabwe is facing a crisis on an unprecedented scale , and it is getting worse - not a single sector is s@@ pared .
that letter also announced the suspension , from 1 January 2009 , of disbur@@ se@@ ments from the budgetary aid programmes , as well as the opening of a consultation period with the Nicara@@ gu@@ an authorities concerning the current situation and the methods of re@@ orien@@ ting European cooperation with the country .
human rights and freedom are the most important pillars of the European Union and they must also underpin our dialogue with Russia .
the debate is closed .
four and a half years have passed , and yet the nationals of the new Member States still feel like second @-@ class citizens .
I am myself an example of the fact that in today &apos;s Czech Republic there is no anti @-@ German aggression since I was elected as a German citizen to represent the Czech Republic in this Parliament .
we see again and again how some politicians and non @-@ governmental organisations adopt a rather exagg@@ erated position over the question of gender equality .
it is not only a milestone for environmental and consumer protection in Europe , I think it is also a ma@@ gic moment for Europe .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen , and well done in particular to our two rapporteurs , Mrs K@@ las@@ s and Mrs Bre@@ yer , who were excellent negotiators in the search for a compromise with the Council .
children of users and , in particular , of farmers , are also affected .
many hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ alists fea@@ red that these crops would come under threat as a result of this legislation , but , fortunately , this fear has proved unfounded .
Madam President , I have heard much talk in this debate about science , but what sort of science is it that does not subject itself to proper impact assessment ?
I leave you with one or two last thoughts on this .
we must have more facts and not fic@@ tion , and we certainly should d@@ well on the facts .
in my view , we have before us a balanced text , which will ban the use of certain harmful pesticides , but without har@@ ming European farming .
and it is precisely because we are concerned about this development , which is an institutional dri@@ ft , whereby the European Commission has decided no longer to play the Community card , but the strictly intergovernmental one , that we are today valida@@ ted in our desire to negotiate an action plan among ourselves , to submit it to you and to ensure that the next transport commissioner makes a clear commitment regarding the follow @-@ up action to be taken on it .
author . - ( NL ) Madam President , Commissioner , it is unfortunate that Mrs Kroes is prevented from being here this evening because of an accident .
investments of this kind are ide@@ ally spread as widely as possible and developed in concer@@ t . private and public broadcasting corporations can then offer content on a shared platform , and it is in terms of content that competition should come in , so that the customer can derive maximum benefit .
( DE ) Mr President , public broadcasting is more than an economic factor .
1 .
indeed , although food needs to continue to increase in the world , the proportion of development aid devoted to agriculture has , for its part , been on a constant decline since the 1980s .
written Statements ( Rule 142 )
agriculture , education , health and transport , which are key areas for the EU &apos;s economic development and European citizens &apos; quality of life , must benefit from specific public policies .
in the mean time , I thank Parliament for its support for our approach as expressed through this report .
such an outcome will be a very welcome development for EU fund markets which have recently been confronted with many tough challenges .
there will be an improvement in marketing .
at the time , there were many who criticised the single currency both in the political and academic wor@@ l@@ ds , without mentioning the notable number of central bankers who felt that the Economic and Monetary Union could not or should not be achieved and that if , despite everything , it were to come into being , the single currency , in brief , would be weak and without a future .
we are expecting others to join us .
as Jacques Delors said , the euro is the shield to protect the whole of Europe , but the euro has not stimu@@ lated the European economy enough so far .
4 .
Madam President , first of all I would like to say that this is an excellent report .
Fif@@ thly , and most important of all , Latvian voices are heard in Europe and European voices are heard in the world .
this will allow for a progressive integration of the Baltic States into the single European energy market .
I think we are talking about a very sensible package here , so I was very happy to support it , and I congratulate the rapporteur .
however , the means of achieving this objective , namely cooperation and mutual acceptance of each other &apos;s certification findings in the areas of air@@ worthiness and maintenance , are set out in the annexes to the agreement , unlike in conventional agreements , where these measures are usually set out in separate non @-@ binding agreements at civil aviation authority level .
in writing . - securing sustainable food supply is one of the greatest challenges that faces us .
we also agree with the demands in the report for work in the Council to be more open in order to enable civil society to participate in the dialogue in a meaningful way .
furthermore , I am not in favour of EU funds being spent on promoting the Lisbon treaty through civil dialogue or any other means .
I agree with the rapporteur and congratulate her on the final report .
I am also convinced that it is right to provide for experi@@ ments on animals to be kept to a minimum and carried out only in the event of absolute need and for the use of alternative methods to be promoted so that animals are s@@ pared need@@ less suffering .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I firstly wish to thank the chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
if we want a more efficient border supervision system , it is , in any case , high time that biometric data constituted an effective part of that system .
for border countries like Bulgaria , which are exposed to intense pressure from migratory flows and the activities of international organised crime , the rapid and successful introduction of the new standards will be vitally important in terms of protecting the EU &apos;s external borders .
to be completely honest , I have to say that this varies from country to country .
it can also be seen whether they attend the committees too ; there are minutes for each of them , to which all citizens have access .
negotiation leads to the most acceptable decision for all concerned .
only if we achieve a suitable level of transparency will our activities become more comprehensible to the citizens , and therefore closer to them .
you are about to vote on the proposal for a directive on the procurement of defence and security equipment , which the Commission tabled in December 2007 as part of the so @-@ called &apos; defence package &apos; .
the principal gu@@ ide@@ line , as with so many things , is the free market for defence @-@ related products too , in other words weapons , and weapons are for killing and w@@ aging war .
over the last 10 years the Eurogroup has been a huge success and , particularly during the most recent crisis , other countries have expressed an interest in joining the group .
it believes that the greatest barrier to the development of financial systems for the most disadvantaged is not the lack of funding , but rather a lack of institutional and technical capacity .
we know what we need to do .
in light of the Madrid and London bom@@ b@@ ings in 2004 and 2005 respectively , it is clear that we are under threat from similar attacks on the EU .
( DE ) A@@ re you of the opinion that local knowledge and regional regulations should be a basic requirement to ensure that these professions can be carried out accordingly ?
but , as I said , there should be this balance and people should be aware of where this balance should be struck .
medicines are subject to strict supervision , which is why it is not possible to put any old thing on the market .
they should get properly reviewed scientific information at first hand with their medicines .
however , consumers have also been involved in accidents , although the number of accidents reported in this case is much smaller .
I hope that all my fellow Members inform their national parliaments and governments so that this Convention can be ratified as quickly as possible .
the priority tasks will be a review of the directive on capital adequacy of investment companies and lending institutions , the completion of talks on the directive regulating insurance , a regulation on the activities of ratings agencies , and a directive on electronic money institutions .
together , we can show Europeans during these six months why the European Union is so vitally important today .
this parliamentary term started with the Dutch Presidency , headed by Mr Balk@@ en@@ ende , and no one re@@ members what he said here and what we repli@@ ed .
we are making a specific request to you , Mr President ; we are asking you to persuade your colleagues to place at the heart of the spring European Council the aim of making a binding commitment to the target of 20 % energy cuts by 2020 , the C@@ inde@@ rella of the energy package last year , and to review your priorities by assessing in a less super@@ ficial manner the decisions taken in December regarding renewable energy .
it is a multi @-@ la@@ ye@@ red problem , and I certainly do not wish to be the judge of who at this moment is the short @-@ term cul@@ pri@@ t , because for us , for the European Union and for European countries , both Russia and Ukraine are currently to blame .
today more and more of us , the peoples of Europe , are Brussels dissidents .
the occa@@ sional Euro@@ sceptic remark aside - which we are familiar with from your own country - you meet with our support .
( applause )
that is not only un@@ true , it is di@@ visi@@ ve and it is a breach of trust .
( PL ) I would like to start by recalling the Polish @-@ Czech underground opposition meeting organised 21 years ago by Solidarity in the Gi@@ ant M@@ oun@@ tains on the Polish @-@ Czech border .
I apologise to all those honourable Members whose specific questions I do not answer ; I will try to gener@@ alise this discussion a little and I will try to shed light rather on the general approach to handling these specific problems .
( sustained applause )
the programme of the Czech Presidency signals continued intensi@@ fication of the anti @-@ grassroots attacks by the Ε@@ U in order to shift the impact of the crisis in the capitalist system on to the working class and poor grassroots classes , an increase in EU aggression against the people and imperialist intervention and improvements to its capability for military intervention around the world .
( NL ) Mr President , I was happy to add my empha@@ tic support to the Coelho report on biometri@@ cs in EU passports , because , if nothing else , this is a first step in the fight against the very many abuses and for@@ g@@ eries of passports .
moreover , there is one fundamental right that is missing from this report , namely the right of people , for example people of one &apos;s own nation , to feel at home and safe in their own country , to defend their hard @-@ earned prosperity , to maintain their language , their culture , their traditions and their laws .
we will now move on to the explanations of vote on the Cappato report , having already heard Mr Mitchell .
in writing . - ( PL ) The European defence procurement market is highly fragmented , which has a negative economic impact .
it notes that the recommendations of this Parliament in its report on CIA R@@ endi@@ tion activities in the EU ( F@@ e@@ b 2007 ) have not yet been implemented by Member States and EU institutions .
it can therefore count on my wholehear@@ ted support , because respect for all people and their fundamental rights lies at the heart of the Greens &apos; policy , irrespective of gender , age , nationality or socio @-@ economic background .
there is no question for anyone acqu@@ ain@@ ted with the ar@@ can@@ e my@@ ste@@ ries of the European Commission , the European Parliament and the European Council that seeking access to information on the European Union &apos;s institutions remains a journey full of pit@@ falls for the average citizen .
it gives cause for immense concern .
for example , there is the Quartet , and one of the possible tasks of the European Union within the Quartet is to enable such mediation on dialogue .
after all , a cease @-@ fire or temporary ar@@ mis@@ tice is to Hamas and company a mere pa@@ use for b@@ reat@@ h in the Ji@@ had against Israel .
there can only be a political solution to this conflict .
we are here today to demand a cease @-@ fire and an end to the slaughter of civilians .
perhaps this was so that Gaz@@ ans , with full bel@@ lies and well provided for by the EU , could devote all of their attention to ex@@ ca@@ vating tunn@@ els for smuggling in increasingly le@@ th@@ al weapons to be used against Israeli civilians .
I hope the resolution accompanying this debate will receive a strong vote in this House tomorrow , and I hope it will strengthen the hands of the Commission and the Council in pres@@ suring both Israel and Hamas to stop the killing .
while acknowledging the fact that Hamas began the rocket attacks against Israel , the Israeli reaction has , in my opinion , been disproportionate .
I would like to give you , at least ten@@ ta@@ tively , the latest information that I got now , which is in the news , saying that sources in Egypt close to negotiations report that Hamas is reacting favourably to the latest Egyptian proposals .
I know that in some other countries , which are not facing the problem with that kind of intensity , the situation is probably different , at least in pr terms .
we are genuinely able to provide a full response about where the gas goes : not one cu@@ bic me@@ tre of gas goes in a different direction without us notic@@ ing .
unfortunately , Europe &apos;s passive attitude has helped Putin to draw closer to this goal .
Ukraine is currently obliged to pay an intermedi@@ ary company an extra USD 500 million a year .
alternative sources of energy and new technologies will reduce our dependency on importing raw materials and energy .
I am here for the first time and perhaps I spent so long on the introduction that I contributed to the delay .
in writing . - ( PL ) In today &apos;s debate much has been said about gas supplies and the links , interconnections and dependency of the European economies .
in writing . - Russia blocked gas supplies at an extremely in@@ opportun@@ e time for European consumers and it is essential that the gas deliveries are restored without further ad@@ o .
so you can be sure that our presidency is keen that the Union remains fully committed to reaching a balanced , ambitious and comprehensive agreement in the WTO Doha Development Round .
it also increases food insecurity and human insecurity in general , which contributes to the conflict and the migration .
on 29 August , Ms Bir@@ tu@@ kan M@@ ide@@ ks@@ sa , the leader of a party with a parliamentary seat , was again arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment for refusing to publicly state that she had requested the par@@ don that the Me@@ les Z@@ en@@ aw@@ i Government used to release her in 2007 , along with many other political leaders of the opposition held since the elections of 2005 .
it was absor@@ bed into the Somali Republic in 19@@ 60 after fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly voluntarily re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ishing its brief period of independence , but split away again in the chaos following the death of Si@@ ad Bar@@ re in 1991 .
finally , we stand ready to develop the full range of our ENP and Eastern Partnership offer for Belarus .
the forthcoming gas negotiations with Russia could well give such simu@@ lation an extra boost .
- ( SK ) E@@ ven though positive progress has been made in Belarus , we must maintain very close communications with representatives of the Belarusian opposition and with our friend Alexander Milin@@ ki@@ evi@@ ch .
that is a great shame and we deeply regret this fact .
it is totally unacceptable , therefore , that the guilty parties and those accused of this crime are still at large .
if Srebrenica happened because there was not enough European spirit , then we should do our utmost to help this country embark on the right path .
however , we should go further still .
how can these developments be verified ?
given the very poor level of implementation of current rules and the stress involved in long journeys , even with proper rest stops , especially for hor@@ ses , does the Commission plan to come forward , where necessary and on the basis of scientific evidence , with a fin@@ ite absolute journey time limit ?
( RO ) The new Member States , and I will specifically refer to my country , Romania , need , as has already been expressed here , support in reinforcing the powers of the authorities responsible for veri@@ fying the application of the Regulation we are debating today concerning animal transport .
as concerns the specific question raised by one MEP on the request to have the Mediterranean diet included on the world cultural heritage list of UNESCO , the Commissioner &apos;s predecessor , Mar@@ kos Kyprianou , raised this topic at a Council agriculture meeting in July 2007 .
( PL ) Mr President , it is better to eat a healthy diet and avoid illness , than to undergo even the most effective modern medical treatment .
my point is not really to do with gender equality , it is to do with the fairness of Member States thinking that they have signed one Treaty , and then finding that it is interpreted in the courts by judges who give it a meaning that it could not possibly have been intended to have .
our presence only prolon@@ gs the war and the resulting suffering , rather than eliminating them .
above all , the rapporteur stresses that many Member States have not correctly transposed the definition of discrimination into their legal systems .
Europe must stand up to its responsibilities and demand a definitive end to Israeli aggression and start making an effort to find a viable long @-@ term solution .
we should not be under any illusions about Belarus and we should not hesitate to break off dialogue if the situation deterior@@ ates .
she defended the rights of Iranian women and children , fighting to change divorce and inher@@ it@@ ance laws in Iran .
something needs to change in Iran .
parliamentary elections were not called when the term of the National Assembly ended two years ago .
I call on the Keny@@ an authorities to re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish their plans to introduce censorship , to build consensus in order to foster the freedom of the press and the public communications sector .
specifically , I would ask if the Battisti affair can be included as an urgent matter .
( el ) Mr President , recently we have heard about , we have read about and we have seen civilians being bom@@ bed and children being ex@@ termin@@ ated .
Mr President , two and a half years ago , I found out that the European Commission had initiated proceedings against Denmark in the European Court of Justice because Denmark had introduced a 2 % threshold for hydro@@ gen@@ ated fa@@ ts in food .
around 30 to 40 million m@@ 3 of trees have been brought down .
( PL ) I would like to say that , while listening to the last debate in Doha in Q@@ a@@ tar , I had the impression that the developing countries have a gri@@ ev@@ ance against us , the developed countries .
I would like to congratulate you once again on the measures you have proposed for access , free trade , funds and the environment .
this is not at all a matter of promoting trade barriers .
we have also seen other cases where there was not sufficient transparency , and we definitely need a stronger coordination mechanism to address the crisis .
of course , we started with research .
Mrs Laperrouze next recommended diversi@@ fying the sources and routes of supply .
I call on the Commission and Member States to invest in modernising the European energy network , boosting energy efficiency and generating power from renewable sources .
I therefore call on you to support it in the vote in a couple of days &apos; time .
secondly , with regard to lighting , I trust we are about to go ahead with taking the most inefficient domestic lighting off the market , and the same needs to happen for office and street lighting .
I hope that Member States will be in the position , based on objective criteria , to reconsider the issue about the closed reactors .
Madam President , I am touched by the words &apos; smart &apos; and &apos; intelligent &apos; , which are very much part of this debate , because the solutions we try and use in our house to reduce energy consumption are certainly not working and they are neither smart nor very intelligent .
the more severe the winter the greater the certainty that the Russian Federation will turn off the gas supply to European countries .
it is a horri@@ ble phrase , and no doubt very few people in Germany will concern themselves with this topic , despite the fact that it will be one of the most important topics in coming years .
turning to the subject of wilderness , Europe is den@@ sely populated and only 1 @-@ 2 % of the territory has not been affected by human intervention .
it is also a very diversified sector .
we are working on this , and really look forward to collabor@@ ating very closely with parliamentarians .
just to wind up , this is a solution where everyone will be winners : society , citizens , public authorities , business , innova@@ tors and the European economy .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Mr President , Europol &apos;s organised crime report of 2006 stated that the advantages the Internet offers in terms of information and communication technology are extremely beneficial to organised crime .
we must be particularly vigilant regarding the constant challenge posed by the use of new online technologies - web ca@@ ms , mobile phones and , in particular , the use of the Internet - in this regard .
we need to promote public awareness and online safety , especially among children , but also among parents so that they know exactly what is going on and what can be done on the Internet .
given that access to , and the distribution of , porno@@ graphic material are not controlled by time and place , I welcome the timely suggestion to set up , at European level , a separate unit for combating child pornography and prostitution and I suggest that Member States and the Commission provide financial support for information and awareness campaigns .
thus , we must ban paed@@ ophi@@ les &apos; ch@@ at rooms and Internet forums , and make soli@@ ci@@ tation using such methods a criminal offence .
thank you .
( DE ) Madam President , throughout the world the hope of obtaining a well @-@ paid job has a very strong appeal .
this is co@@ war@@ dly and un@@ helpful .
it is therefore essential to establish mechanisms which will enable exploited workers to file complaints against their employers personally or through the agency of a third party .
this measure therefore comes at just the right moment .
the Member States should cooperate more closely to combat illegal immigration by strengthening action against illegal employment at the level of Member States of the European Union .
they were rejected .
we should therefore welcome any step in the direction of cooperation between the EU and Russia at various levels and in various forms .
it is therefore a sub @-@ sector that needs support and sensible regulation .
full exploitation cannot be carried out because of issues on the medi@@ an line between Malta and its Northern African neighbours .
I hope that the mechanisms of solidarity will not permit market distortions or give rise to excessively one@@ rous procedures .
this commitment must be taken into account in particular in national social security and pension policies .
these common sense proposals aim to protect the most vulnerable members of our societies .
it also applies to media advertising , which should be decent and in keeping with moral values , and should not attack young people &apos;s right to inno@@ c@@ ence .
it is disastrous , because our behaviour is worse than those people who , like Barack Obama , go there and say that despite all the risks that they themselves are taking , despite the opposition among the military , despite the opposition in the USA , because the people there are also saying &apos; leave them in Guantánamo , do not bring them here , here they represent a bigger risk &apos; , who say that despite all this opposition , there is a symbolic power which results from the fact that a new president is returning to a respect for human and fundamental rights , including the rights of those who themselves have not shown any regard for human and fundamental rights .
we have legitimate fears because , according to the Pen@@ tag@@ on , 61 former in@@ mates cleared of all charges and subsequently released are now reported to be engaged in terrorist activities .
we must also ask the Member States and European institutions what they have done to implement the recommendations that this Parliament adopted in February 2007 and , where applicable , what explanation they give for not having done so .
moreover , internal investigations have not supported the accusations either .
they have to verify the status of each deta@@ ine@@ e before they make an official request for transfer to an EU Member State .
I am relying on the efforts of Mrs Ferrero @-@ Waldner to achieve a quick result in the current negotiations .
it is shocking that the reception situation at Lampedusa should need to be discussed in this manner again .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Europe has to decide : does it want regulated immigration or the invasion and criminal exploitation of illegal immigrants ?
the Legal Service of the Council confirmed in its opinion of 28 October 2008 that , and I quote , &apos; restrictive procurement measures designed to promote domestic industry do not comply with the general principles of the EC Treaty &apos; .
another threat already identified is cyber attacks and different attempts to attack and block via the Internet .
could you outline to me the current situation regarding this level of cooperation , and if you are particularly satisfied that the level of cooperation is good enough and strong enough ?
despite the efforts undertaken by some An@@ de@@ an Community countries to overcome this impasse , the Commission could only note that a consensus on moving forward with negotiations no longer existed .
given that family carers are , and will continue to be , an inherent and indispensable part of our social and healthcare provision , can the Commission comment on what steps it has specifically taken towards developing policy responses to such challenges , particularly with regard to greater support for family carers ?
the adoption of the Framework Decision against racism and xenophobia on 28 November is a further example .
only today , as part of this process , it approved an amendment to the education act , guaranteeing that geographical names will be printed in Hungarian or Ukrainian in tex@@ t@@ books for minority schools .
I would like to launch a slogan for this : &apos; making a f@@ us@@ s does no good and good makes no f@@ us@@ s &apos; .
that is an injustice , but - I would tell Mr P@@ ī@@ ks - it is also self @-@ destructive because , in order to overcome the difficulties and the fears , we must make all of our people welcome in our states .
now , as the international negotiations start to intensify , last week the Commission adopted a communication which includes its positions on the most important points of the negotiations .
banks and fun@@ ders will have to take risks on green technology start @-@ ups .
a success because Parliament has shown itself to be one of the most responsive institutions , equi@@ pping itself with an ad hoc instrument - the Temporary Committee - to gather data and ideas on a question that affects us all and the impact of which we must face together , both now and in the future .
in order to survive and develop , mankind needs new , powerful sources of energy , and Europe needs balance and self @-@ sufficiency in terms of its energy supplies .
bilateral negotiations between two countries - Poland and Denmark - the ho@@ sts of COP 14 and COP 15 , are not enough .
these must be effectively implemented because we will be able to regulate industry and consumption successfully once we have completed our own tasks .
the second hope at the start of this year is the change in the United States as many of you here have mentioned .
these provide a solution to the climate crisis , while also revita@@ lis@@ ing the economy through creating new jobs .
it contained a specific paragraph stating that D@@ aw@@ it I@@ saak should be released .
I call upon your organisation and other organisations to support its efforts in all fields .
the camer@@ a was not on me , but on General Mor@@ ill@@ on and then on Mr Gros@@ ch .
Madam President , I abstained on this important vote in this Parliament .
yet it is precisely this uncertainty that indicates , for example , that we should take the first steps towards slow@@ ing down our carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere .
according to the Commission &apos;s figures , between 4.5 and 8 million third @-@ party nationals are living illegally within the European Union and are therefore the favoured targets of un@@ scrupulous employers benefiting from illegal labour .
we must build a suitable transmission infrastructure , create support mechanisms for countries which will lack supplies of raw materials and diversify the sources from which we obtain them .
I thank all honourable Members of this Parliament very much for their attention and look forward to your questions .
I welcome the recent establishment of Koso@@ van security forces and the participation of a section of the Serbian community in Kosovo &apos;s police force .
Mr President , the international rush to recognise Kosovo was , in my view , hard to understand .
the Commission has , in turn , undertaken to provide a swift response in cases where it is required to react .
however , both manufacturers and suppliers do need further credit in order to finance their businesses and so , too , do customers if they are to finance the purchase of cars .
that is why it comes as very good news and as a ray of hope that the Czech Presidency is announcing a new initiative here today ahead of the forthcoming Spring Summit , namely a proposal to implement a measure across Europe that would provide a dramatic stimulus to the purchase of environmentally @-@ friendly cars .
American cars play no real role in the European market , whereas European cars play a large role in the US market .
the 1995 decision is a decision between the Member States , reflecting the fact that consular assistance and protection is an exclusive national responsibility and that consular relations are governed mainly by the Vienna Convention on consular Relations .
so I have a full understanding of the issue that you are considering with care and that you are approaching with such critical insight .
therefore , despite the fact that no conclusion was possible by the end of 2008 , the Council remains fully committed to the multilateral trade system , as well as to the conclusion of an ambitious , balanced and comprehensive outcome of the WTO Doha Round .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - T@@ o conclude this rather unusual evening &apos;s debate , my mother smo@@ ked when she was pregnant , and here I am as the Deputy Prime Minister of the Czech Republic , and my bro@@ ther and sis@@ ter are both in very good condition .
how much will we have to pay in insurance bills before we realise that protection of the environment and the climate is not a burden , but an investment in the future ?
as we have been talking mostly about effects and relief funds , I would like to ask the Commission about specific projects which are actually able to implement prevention mechanisms for incidents like this so that , at least in the future , we will not have any more loss of human life .
thirdly , was Mil@@ l@@ stream implementing an H@@ AC@@ CP @-@ based risk analysis and an auto @-@ control plan as required by the food hygiene regulation ?
it appears to me that we need to encourage from the bottom up so that practices of this kind do not occur in future .
first , in order to adapt Annex III on the toleran@@ ces for the com@@ posi@@ tional labelling of feed materials and comp@@ ound feed to scientific and technical development , the Commission and its services envisage taking up examination of that Annex .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate the Commissioner and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on their excellent work and the good cooperation we have had .
our food is characterised by its acknowledged reputation and quality .
this policy provides a response to a real need on the part of Member States to promote the image of their agricultural products , especially the benefits in terms of quality , nutritional value and food safety standards , both among European consumers and consumers in other countries .
( RO ) I would first of all like to congratulate my colleague for all the hard work he has put in as rapporteur in terms of simplifying EU legislation to reduce the administrative burden , something we very much need to do .
we should take this opportunity when the discussion takes place here in Parliament on communication to make a link - how do we improve our possibilities to make it visible and make it understandable .
we are now in a global economic condition with the global recession where there are the beg@@ inn@@ ings of the wh@@ i@@ ff of protectionism coming from the developed world , especially from the United States , and I hope not from the European Union .
we are already used to the majority in Parliament approving resolutions without legislative consequences , with content that runs counter to the legislative resolutions it adopts .
it also means the adoption of a firm stance in the negotiations on trade facilitation procedures in order to lower the costs of customs formalities , which can account for up to 15 % of the value of the goods traded , as well as effective recording of the origin of goods and updated customs controls .
while Article 36 ( 1 ) of the Cotonou Agreement ensh@@ rin@@ es the conclusion of &apos; World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) compatible trading arrangements , progressively removing barriers to trade between them and enhancing cooperation in all areas relevant to trade &apos; , what the EU intends to do is to go beyond what is currently established and reach what , to date , has not yet been achieved in the WTO , even though the 10th European Development Fund is implemented for that purpose while , at the same time , reducing public development aid .
in terms of social and environmental impact , there is a clear lack of preparation by Chinese industry , and this requires greater European incentive .
since the Sri Lankan Government has the upper hand in the situation and is the internationally @-@ recognised authority in the country , our call must , by necessity and logic , go mostly to them .
atrocities such as the shel@@ ling of a P@@ T@@ K hospital make the situation on the ground much worse and more per@@ il@@ ous .
in short , we are dealing with an unacceptable situation which , above all , has no groun@@ ding in reality .
Brazil &apos;s refusal to extra@@ dite Cesare Battisti ( vote )
Mr President , my group , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , has tabled a resolution which has the support of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and large parts of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament .
there is already a new US administration , currently defining its foreign policy priorities .
therefore , this issue must be taken seriously .
this aggression is part of the strategy to overcome the legitimate resistance of the Palestinian people to the occupation and to undermine the conditions required for building a Palestinian state .
but without the military capacity , without military credibility , we are like a dog whose bar@@ k is worse than its bi@@ te .
in Chad , we have committed a total of EUR 3@@ 11 million under the 10th European Development Fund .
I think this is an absolutely fundamental question and I believe that it will be a specific ban@@ ner of the European Union , not only for its ne@@ arest neighbours , but also for countries that lie a long way beyond Belarus , Ukraine or Georgia .
in fact , future conflicts will be fought and perhaps decided in cyber@@ space , where every state has to react and defend itself , sometimes in a timeframe that does not exceed a second .
it is the super@@ powers of the United States and Russia who are active in these areas , not Europe !
each day , we realise that they are not adapted to the new challenges , new opportunities and new threats of today &apos;s world .
it is precisely for this reason that I feel that the European Union must be visi@@ bly active within its borders and proactive in any area of the world .
Mr President , the constitu@@ ent summit of the Union for the Mediterranean had , as you know , the triple objective of rein@@ jec@@ ting political vig@@ our into Euro @-@ Mediterranean relations , of changing the institutional governance of these relations in favour of a joint leadership of the initiative and , finally , of cry@@ stal@@ lis@@ ing multilateral cooperation between the European Union and its Mediterranean partners around structural projects , which will bring sub @-@ regional integration and are likely to reduce the discrepancies in development between the two sides of the Mediterranean .
I will end with a final word on the serious cases of Palestine and the Western Sahara , where women and children are the main victims of war and exploitation , in short the whole process of discrimination that affects these people and which seriously affects women and children .
in view of the dynamics of the crisis , I appeal for the recovery plan to be updated to be more in tune with the real economy .
recently , die W@@ elt wrote that Maj@@ dan@@ ek was a Polish concentration camp .
on 8 February , a public gathering in S@@ f@@ â@@ n@@ tu G@@ he@@ or@@ gh@@ e / Se@@ p@@ sis@@ z@@ en@@ t@@ gy@@ ör@@ gy , Romania , was attended by more than 3 000 people protesting against the political games of the Romanian parties and requesting that the Hungarian communities &apos; rights be respected .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mr S@@ zy@@ ma@@ ński on his comprehensive report , which will have the support of our group in the vote tomorrow .
indeed , by reducing policies to increasingly limited geographical areas , we run the risk of losing the overall direction , visibility and transparency of the neighbourhood policy that the European Union wants to pursue .
let us show that we can be the main player in the East and not allow Russia to implement its own neo @-@ imperi@@ alistic game plan .
this is why I am not in full agreement with the restrictive legal basis proposed .
unanimity was possible thanks to the good work and cooperation of the shadow rapporteurs , whose contributions also largely helped to achieve a useful report on a subject as important as the European research infrastructure .
well , you present me with a qu@@ and@@ ary .
in the next 25 years , as a result of urb@@ anisation , it is expected that almost 25 % of land will be withdrawn from agricultural use .
special attention has to be given to the most vulnerable and socially excluded girls and boys , including disabled children , migrant children and children from minorities .
social economy enterprises are an integral part of the Commission &apos;s enterprise policy .
as a relatively new science , mental health is not widely recognised as a priority , but recent technological developments have allowed us to explore more of the human brain , showing the way to new , life @-@ changing treatments for individuals .
under the Energy Services Directive , NE@@ EA@@ Ps have only a limited role .
there is apparently here in this Parliament a vari@@ ation on the Latin saying Qu@@ od lic@@ et I@@ ovi , non lic@@ et bo@@ vi , what is legitimate for Mrs Lulling , is not legitimate for an ordinary MEP .
in other words , you are targeting im@@ mobile products : local services and construction .
our answer to a unified tax system is a res@@ ounding &apos; No &apos; .
I support a significant reduction in VAT rates , particularly with regard to the construction of housing , as well as ther@@ mo @-@ insu@@ lation and renovation projects , primarily , though not solely , with the aim of protecting jobs and ensuring social cohesion .
they have more to do with the ambitions of professional politicians and the people connected with them than with the interests of ordinary Member State citizens .
and the window is open .
statistical data has shown it to be an influential sector of the economy , creating new jobs within the EU and providing jobs for 11 million people , which represents almost 7 % of the labour force .
that mandate expires on 15 March 2009 .
in less developed countries , however , and I am thinking of Romania too when I say this , limited resources and the complexity of the technical and organisational aspects present a major difficulty in terms of creating a European Research Infrastructure .
however , we believe that this must not undermine the quality of public services , particularly in areas where the social economy also plays a significant role .
this report codi@@ fies the basic principles , values and objectives of mental health policy which is necessary across Europe to promote better understanding .
in writing . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Migu@@ é@@ lez Ra@@ mos on applied research relating to the common fisheries policy .
measures such as forcing employers to check third @-@ country workers &apos; residence permits and the financial and criminal penalties provided for employers highlight the efforts of the Community and Member States to coordinate their immigration and illegal labour policies .
at the same time , standard regulations at European level must not become a bureaucratic burden but ensure that there is a constant exchange of information between Member States in a simple , effective manner .
I have therefore voted against this motion for a resolution .
in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , I supported Mr von Wogau &apos;s report .
on the final vote , British Labour MEPs joined with the Socialist Group in voting against this report , particularly due to the inclusion of an entire section devoted to the creation of a permanent EU Mili@@ tary Operational headquarters .
I would also like to draw your attention to the substantial progress that has been made in terms of creating a Euro @-@ Mediterranean free trade zone , which is to be definitively established in 2010 .
( applause )
at the same time , I request that we ask the specialist committee responsible to prepare a resolution .
( it ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in Italy , the Communications Regulatory Authority , an independent body , has issued its 4@@ 3rd resolution against the state television authority for b@@ reaching the rights of Italian citizens to be informed about initiatives by the Ra@@ dic@@ als - its 4@@ 3rd resolution .
( SL ) I warmly welcome today &apos;s decision by the Croatian government to respond positively , in principle , to the European Commission &apos;s initiative for mediation between Slovenia and Croatia .
we ask for guarantees that they fulfil their purpose .
we must , of course , do our best to ensure that the procedure is as open and structured as possible , and I am pleased to hear , Commissioner , that this is also something that you are going to do .
if we do not diversify our supplies of raw materials for energy production , especially natural gas , crises like the one in January will be repeated .
in writing .
it means companies would be able to choose between a solvency @-@ based or capital @-@ maintenance @-@ based credit@@ or protection regime .
we have called for the principle of think Small First to be a compulsory and integral part of all future legislation .
it is indeed important that we now describe and regard SMEs as a cross @-@ section , that we rethink support measures , that we give precedence to small enterprises in public tenders ( &apos; think Small First &apos; ) and that we prevent public authorities from intervening in competition .
SMEs should increase their participation in the internal market and in public procurement .
first of all , I apologise on behalf of my colleague , Charlie McCreevy , who has an Ecofin commitment early tomorrow .
I support the proposed amendments to the reception Conditions Directive , to the Asylum Procedu@@ res Directive and to the Asylum qualification Directive in order to clarify the criteria allowing asylum seekers to qualify for international protection .
does the Commission intend to draw up a European re@@ allocation programme between countries and how does it plan to build upon and apply this clause ?
that concludes this item .
the Commission services are increasingly applying common standards for control methods , ensuring improved coordination and sharing of the results .
at the same time , consumers , as we all know , are showing an ever @-@ increasing interest not only in food safety but also in the origin and production methods of food products .
a hand@@ book on the application of the regulation was produced in 2006 and distributed among all the European courts in 2007 .
on this issue , the option of a weekly publication of information on commercial stocks is currently being studied .
if you look into how environmentally @-@ friendly measures for cars can be achieved , you are sometimes surprised that so much time is spent looking into other measures .
as many as 2@@ 10 million Europeans are currently exposed to traffic noise which , according to the World Health Organisation , presents a direct danger to health .
the ES@@ P system must become accessible to everyone and no longer be an optional extra .
finally , apart from improving the application of the directive , the basic objective of the reform is to simplify the legislation and reduce administrative costs to both industry and the competent authorities , in accordance as ever with the principles of the European Union &apos;s better law@@ making programme .
in Germany , we call this kind of nit@@ pic@@ king &apos; counting pe@@ as &apos; .
at the same time , we must note that , despite the March of technology , the targets associated with our directive from back in the day have by no means been met .
some Members have raised doubts about whether all the amendments that my report proposes are within the scope of the legal basis of the regulation - Article 255 of the Treaty .
Mr President , we fully share Mr Cashman &apos;s aims and commitment to transparency , but we must not forget that there is a regulation that is being recast here .
we know that , if everything were public , the form of negotiations that we have today would no longer exist because you would be putting your head above the para@@ pet as soon as you tried to seek out and to bring about political compromises .
another fier@@ cely discussed point is Article 5 ( 2 ) concerning access to Member States &apos; documents .
Mr President , as we have decided to vote , maybe you could indicate why so many amendments were ruled to be in@@ admissible .
the next item is the vote .
to bring in soil protection is not the responsibility of the European Parliament , nor can it be done throughout the whole of the European Union .
their abuse of their position of domin@@ ance continues , with producers exploited at every turn , even to the point of having to pay for their promo@@ tions .
it is also important to evaluate existing systems so as to weigh up whether there is a real need for new instruments to be created , as well as their viability , reliability , interoperability and cost , and also whether the protection of individuals &apos; fundamental rights is being given sufficient consideration .
unfortunately , this right is not currently applied uniformly by the Member States : recognition of this status may vary from one Member State to another from 0 % to 90 % .
we also recognise that talent needs contact with the public in order to be given recognition .
this task should be wholly assigned to a Community authority , not a local or national one .
in writing . - ( SV ) A@@ t a time when cuts are being made in healthcare , schools and social care within the public sector , savings should also be made within the EU institutions .
unfortunately , however , the report has been hi@@ jac@@ ked by the protectionist elements in the Committee on Agriculture , and particularly by those who seek to justify massive market @-@ distorting CAP subsidies and who want to make it harder for produce from third world countries to be imported to the EU .
the European Commission is to be applau@@ ded in its initiatives to date and its continuing work aimed at eliminating red tape for small businesses .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
the inability to investigate the Prestige disaster or to identify clear causes of the accident showed the need for investigation methods to be unified .
coastal states are subject to yet another set of measures : effective monitoring of ships over short and long distances represents an essential preventive tool .
if one small accident , one small cra@@ ck , for example , in the tan@@ k of an oil tan@@ ker , is not contained and confined , it may result , in the event of vi@@ bra@@ tions from rou@@ gh seas or difficulties in dec@@ an@@ ting the cargo to another vessel , in a huge ecological disaster if there is no refuge where appropriate measures can be taken .
comments please , Commissioner .
they have played their part in making possible the success that we have achieved and for that I ask that we thank them .
I Harbour certain reservations , however , about the specific amendment concerning sensitive mountain areas .
partly as a result of this , freight transport has become increasingly cheap over the years .
the 20 @-@ 20 @-@ 20 target will otherwise grow ever more distant .
it should remain a matter solely for national and local determination .
I would say that I am very pleased with it on behalf of my own country because it will make it possible to obtain a contribution to the infrastructure of a transit country such as France from heavy goods transpor@@ ters that currently go through the country without buying a drop of petrol and without spending a cent .
( RO ) I would like to start by saying that the current directive was implemented badly or in@@ adequately , which is why I would like to ask the Commission whether it is considering cutting VAT on products too in the future .
apart from this legal approach , the Commission is promoting a set of measures for the safer use of the Internet .
I would also like to draw attention to the Framework Decision on combating certain forms of expression of racism and xenophobia , which aims at crimin@@ alising inten@@ tional conduct , such as incitement to violence or hatred towards a group of people or against a person belonging to that group .
with the introduction of the export refunds , however , we should see a situation where we can increase the chances for the European Union &apos;s dairy producers to be present in the world market .
it turns out that the Member States with the highest birth rates are precisely those which have introduced the most highly @-@ developed policies on the work @-@ life balance and which record the highest levels of employment of women .
of course , life is not like that and mothers often work outside the home .
the Barcelona criteria are definitely not a policy of the last century , they are a policy which attra@@ cts lively discussion and which will surely continue to attract discussion .
1 .
keeping Qimonda going in Germany and in Portugal is of such strategic importance for Europe that European Union support is well justified .
two of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries , Mrs Fraga Est@@ é@@ vez and Mr Romeva i Ru@@ eda , were in Mar@@ ra@@ kes@@ h and will be talking about this during the debate .
not respecting the new recovery plan will have serious consequences and will lead to a collapse of the stock .
this is a clear lesson from the crisis , and prevention is no less important .
these reports and the resolutions on which your Assembly will vote this week , in particular , those from the Lisbon Strategy coordination group , will make what I consider to be an essential contribution to the European Council .
other countries , the Nordic countries , for example , where I come from , are doing very little , despite the fact that their economic situation is good .
then the Council comes up with nice little resolutions , such as the fiscal stimulus of 1.5 % of GDP this year or next year .
we cannot sign a blan@@ k che@@ que to bail out the countries of eastern Europe .
now is the time for us to show solidarity and innovation .
the banking sector , closure of production capacity , lack of fresh money and the contra@@ ction of the labour market are basic problems for Member States .
I therefore truly believe that , today , we are very far from a response that matches what is being implemented , for example , by the Obama administration in the United States .
today we will be debating Amendment 25 on the resolution concerning the Lisbon Strategy , which covers precisely this subject .
without a shared com@@ pass which will guide us through this crisis , we will unfortunately all get lost together in the fo@@ g that caused the crisis .
just cutting budget deficits drastically would not help much in this regard either .
we can only ensure that the gas and energy crisis situations which occurred in certain regions of the EU will not happen again in future by implementing a sound policy in this area .
there are 150 000 people tra@@ pped with no way out .
until a few minutes ago , things looked quite different .
without any success .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this report as I was pleas@@ antly surprised that our proposals against tax havens were adopted by the House .
I have already expressed my support for Mr Böge &apos;s report on mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund in this particular case , and I wish to confirm here my support for the measure - provided that it focuses - as stipulated in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2006 , on the swift and effective restoration of decent living conditions in the regions affected by the natural disaster , and not on the payment of compensation for damages suffered by private individuals .
the experts do not agree on the best response to this crisis and the best way of stimulating the economy in order to keep the unemployment figures in check .
although I support the Commission &apos;s initiatives to prevent oil prices from so@@ aring over the next few years , I do not believe that the situation as a whole has been analysed correctly .
in addition , the Recovery Plan must also serve the purpose of delivering a fair international agreement to give poorer countries the opportunity to escape poverty without fuel@@ ling global warming , by helping to finance massive investment .
we also invite the Commission to review and consolidate all the instruments aimed at stabilising the Member States affected , which includes stabilising exchange rates , so that security provisions and rapid , effective response packages can be implemented .
at their informal meeting of 15 January 2009 in Prague , Justice and Home Affairs Ministers were informed by the Commission that the outcome of these tests had been less than satisfactory .
this is why the public is justifi@@ ably asking why it is that we have no professional institutions at an EU level which are sufficiently competent to address any technical problems that might arise from the operation of exceptionally large and comprehensive databases .
we are following very closely developments in this area and we invite the Croatian authorities to ensure that full cooperation with ICTY is maintained .
it should be genuinely respected , as it is the very foundation of any open society , and thus of the continued democratic transformation of Turkey .
a year ago , Parliament endorsed my proposal to start these negotiations as quickly as possible .
in this respect , I share to some extent the Commissioner &apos;s optimism about Kurdish television , about the open@@ ings that have been created between Turkey and Armenia .
with Croatia and Slovenia we assume that , without double standards and without any veto , things are going well and that the border disputes can be set aside and we hope that negotiations will be started with Macedonia as quickly as possible .
Turkey has to deliver on long @-@ awaited reforms .
nevertheless , Hungary did not prevent Romania from joining , because it considered European solidarity and tolerance more important .
the Socialist Group has proposed two amendments to plenary .
I would like you to comment on that because , as far as I can see , in order for care to be delivered to those who are dependent on care in a way that respects human dignity , we have to keep that principle in mind .
indeed , that proposal focuses on the rules and arrangements needed to provide access , in equitable conditions , to safe and high quality healthcare for patients moving across Europe .
working in this sector demands a great deal from workers , and is often under@@ paid .
water shortages have spread beyond the traditionally ar@@ id areas .
I believe that it is worthwhile incorporating the conclusions of the Charter and also of the Water Tri@@ b@@ une into the European discussion and debate materials that we , as the European Union , are dis@@ playing at the pa@@ vi@@ lion at this international exp@@ o .
author . - ( NL ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Africa is the only continent that has not made any progress to speak of when it comes to meeting the Millennium Goals , particularly in the area of health , that is , in mother and inf@@ ant mortality , the fight against HIV / AIDS , T@@ BC and malaria .
end of quo@@ tation .
since the adoption of this report , migration to SEPA has progres@@ sed very slowly , much too slowly .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I very much welcome this debate in the presence of the Commissioner , whom I thank very much for her serious , her strong and her profound statement .
this government is now probably lab@@ ouring under the illusion that it managed to achieve a major success , whereas in reality , a peaceful , harmonious co @-@ existence of the two peoples as equal partners will be even more difficult in future .
however , we want to extend our influence , not by violence , not by threats and not by coer@@ cion , but by offering to support precisely those countries in their search for stability and democratic change .
I am pleased that the PPE @-@ DE delegation was in Minsk the day after Mr Solana , and we especially emphasised the human rights situation and requirements for freedom of the press .
it gives support for both political and economic reform .
the creation of a strategic relationship between the European Union and Brazil is of mutual benefit , firstly due to Brazil &apos;s changing position at global level to become a leading force in the developing world and , secondly , because Brazil plays a vital role in bridging differences on questions of global interest .
we stress the need for our respective executive powers to strengthen collaboration in the political , economic and cooperation spheres , particularly in view of the new challenges of all kinds resulting from the financial and economic crisis that is causing ha@@ vo@@ c in our continents .
let us pool our peoples , our resources , our intelligence , old and young from both sides and create , without delay , an area of free movement for students , researchers , intelle@@ ctu@@ als and intelligence .
our priority should be to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the field of trade and cooperation to protect Brazil &apos;s forests - which are , after all , the l@@ ung@@ s of the world .
this memorandum has been published and contains their demands .
these efforts have been effective only when countries and international organisations have been consistent in their actions and demands .
( PL ) Madam President , in the early 195@@ 0s , the Chinese Government forced Tibetan representatives to sign an agreement in which it guaranteed Tibet far @-@ reaching autonomy .
I would then also withdraw my Amendment 3 and I hope for fair treatment from the other side .
these are its values and we think that they are not appropriate for Europe .
- ( SK ) I have also voted for the resolution on the situation in Tibet on the 50@@ th anniversary of the Tibetan u@@ prising because the Chinese authorities have tightened the security in Tibet recently and have forbid@@ den journalists and foreigners from entering the region .
children should not be able to purchase video games that are not intended for their age group .
as the old Indian pro@@ ver@@ b says , we do not inher@@ it the earth from our parents ; we borrow it from our children .
the Greek Communist Party supports the united , anti @-@ imperialist fight of the peoples of the Balkans and opposition to the US / NATO / EU policy .
in writing . - The EP@@ LP wishes to see the Single European Payment area a success .
we condemn attempts to resolve conflicts by means of a coup d &apos;@@ eta@@ t ; we call for presidential elections to be held in Guinea @-@ Bissau within two months ; and we call for these elections to meet democratic standards and for constitutional order to be restored .
the economic development of the Philippines and its membership of the Association of South @-@ East Asian Nations are positive signs .
the population has been affected by one of the most serious humanitarian crises in the world .
it is no coincidence that the greatest breaches of human rights are in countries where there are great natural resources and in particular in China , which dri@@ ves this pressure for natural resources .
they remain vi@@ vid memor@@ ies for many people who , today , are EU citizens .
the Commission should cooperate with Parliament and the Member States , not dictate to them .
the monu@@ ment has been damaged and da@@ ub@@ ed with pa@@ int si@@ x@@ teen times to date , most recently just over a week ago .
we must fight against the financial and economic crisis , against the energy crisis , climate change and against terrorism which is threatening everything we have built to date .
this affects foodstuffs just as much as industrial goods and , ultimately , creates a vicious cycle .
I have been delayed getting here and have managed to arrive at the last minute .
regional integration will undoubtedly be strengthened as soon as all regions sign comprehensive agreements adapted to their specific requirements .
the text contained in the SADC @-@ EPA Resolution presents a good compromise .
Mr President , we all know that there have been many criticisms of Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) .
the second point I would like to respond to from the debate concerns the question of the development dimension of EPAs .
vague promises to be flexible in the implementation of the agreements are no substitute for concrete commitments .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , Parliament is coming to the end of its term and some of us are starting to make preparations for the elections .
if ethanol had been prohibited in cosmetic products it would probably have created problems and at the same time it would have seemed a little strange , as we drink it in relatively large amounts .
I would like to mention that the amendments adopted within the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety form part of an agreement with the Commission and the Council as they feature in the final draft due to be voted on in plenary tomorrow .
it is therefore vital - not least in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals on overcoming poverty and disease and on agricultural and educational development - that these should be included , along with all the topics that have been raised , from desertification to climate change and energy .
I would remind you that last year , at European level , we spent the contribution of the Commission and Member States , knowing that each one put in EUR 46 billion .
in this context , it is true that budget support - that is , financial aid directly included in the budget of beneficiary countries - could use@@ fully contribute to providing more predictable aid that is targeted at priority sectors and is therefore more effective .
a joint alternative resolution by the PPE @-@ DE , ALDE and UEN Groups has now been tabled , because it was felt that the original committee decision was the up@@ shot of a rather un@@ representative vote , which left the report with several protectionist clauses in@@ tact .
in the communication on food prices adopted in December , the Commission also proposed , in the form of a road map , several solutions for improving the operation of the food supply chain in Europe .
there is something absurd about the fact that Eur@@ one@@ ws broadcas@@ ts in Ara@@ bic or Russian but not in Hungarian or in some other Member States &apos; languages .
as we know , he always pays great attention to human rights issues and tragedies in Africa .
I welcome the general support Parliament has given to our approach to multilingualism .
it is a report which at the same time provides guidance and offers inspiration on how to adapt the Structural Funds rules so that they better suit the needs of European cities and metro@@ po@@ lises .
I share your view on the importance of delivering European public goods in all regions .
in addition , with regard to including the &apos; territorial &apos; concept , we must be aware of the need to take account of the specific features of certain regions , such as their geographical disadvantages , their outermost position or the de@@ population processes in certain regions .
implementing these priorities in operational programmes should allow the regions to tackle the challenges of globalisation , structural , demographic and climate change , and boost the harmonious , long @-@ term sustainable development of the regions .
we must emphasise these benefits during the upcoming elections , since they are of clear interest to citizens who have seen their quality of life triple in some cases , and for regions that , after having been in debt , are now making real head@@ way .
( BG ) What are the basic objectives of the micro @-@ credit initiative ?
this sector has been successful in many developing countries , including in some European countries , both as a means of generating economic activity and as a tool for increasing social inclusion and promoting job creation .
we had that debate way back in the early 1990s under ray Mac@@ Shar@@ ry and we are not returning to it .
I am pleased that the Commissioner pointed out the need to reduce the disparities in development levels and the importance of synergies in implementing EU policies .
at a time of financial crisis , simple financial instruments that are able to fund business , especially in under@@ developed regions or the above @-@ mentioned social groups , are of particular value .
11 .
this is fundamental and we should therefore be having a debate about that instead of just one passage being devoted to it in a report .
may I ask those who ban@@ g on about the EU being this mag@@ nific@@ ent machine to ask themselves that question ?
I agree with the rapporteur that tariffs to be charged by the air carriers designated by Nepal for carriage of passengers and goods wholly within the European Union should be subject to European Community law .
Lisbon , after all , has been legally dead since the referendum in Ireland .
there are those who profit from the opening of borders to all movements of people , goods , capital , and so on , and then there are the vast majority who suffer the consequences : unemployment , insecure jobs , reduced purchasing power , insecurity , loss of identity , and who know who is to blame for it .
few opportunities to exchange experiences ; and
we therefore support this report , but new tests should not be performed on finished products if known information on the ingredients they contain proves compliant with legislation .
in Ireland F@@ GM is viewed as an expression of gender @-@ based violence .
that is what bears witness to linguistic diversity , not the other way around .
I have supported the resolution , I congratulate the rapporteur and I am proud to have been the first Slovak Member to launch a discussion on multilingualism within institutional frameworks through a written declaration .
the report , which concerns the subject of micro @-@ credits , is aimed at the disadvantaged groups in society , such as minorities , the Roma community or inhabitants of rural areas , who have un@@ tap@@ ped potential and want to set up a small business , but are not able to because they are not eligible to obtain a loan from a banking institution .
( applause )
at the current juncture , this means we must cus@@ hi@@ on and mitigate the effects on employment of the economic downturn in the European Union .
how can we reform its decision @-@ making structures to reflect the demand for more democratic oversight and the power of emerging economies ?
please let the peoples of Europe decide their destiny .
when the EU &apos;s guarantees in respect of the European Investment Bank were renewed and extended to cover more countries than before , it was the European Parliament &apos;s view that the decisions should come under the codecision procedure and , furthermore , fall within the competence of the European Parliament , and not just that of the Council .
one more comment to Mrs Sta@@ un@@ er who has just referred to the supervisory regulations .
I believe it is in this context that we may find divisions of labour , applications of joint expertise and the necessary mechanisms of cooperation , including common standards , which you have called for .
with regard to the financing priorities , I am pleased that the current version of the report also features my proposal to include a necessary clarification about the energy projects in Eastern Europe and the Southern Caucasus , namely that they must be &apos; in line with the objective of Community policy of diversi@@ fying energy sources and with a view to guaranteeing stable and secure resources for consumers . &apos;
with regard to Lisbon this means that if they really acquire more rights , there will be no parliamentary and public control over the eight billion .
there are initiatives by the Commission aimed at making it easier to obtain funding .
this assumes that we are following the paradigm shift and moving into new technologies .
only today , Mr Brown and Mr Barroso reaffirmed their refusal to protect Europe , our industries and our jobs in the name of the all @-@ important free market and globalisation .
therefore , we must provide more support for new technologies , innovation and , most importantly , for sustainable transport systems than we have done in the past .
the compromise reached following the negotiations with the Council reflects the need to speed up the formation of functional airspace blocks .
its opposition was not as successful as it had hoped and therefore even I can vote in favour of this report .
on the subject of &apos; public use &apos; , this is the description which excludes even airports for air clubs or airports for pleasure flying .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , we are today discussing a subject that is of special interest to consumers , namely the standard connection for mobile phone char@@ gers .
you know that my group strongly opposes the extensive introduction of biometri@@ cs .
however , I am not as pleased about the fact that we cannot take fingerprints from children from the age of six up@@ wards .
nevertheless foods must be included in this regulation , because otherwise ...
I would , however , like to point out to you that Parliament has already adopted a resolution in which we make clear that we do not want meat from cloned animals on the market as a food@@ stuff .
due to the quantity of methane released into the atmosphere , it should also be included in further work .
not only is the path taken by the US itself dis@@ credi@@ ted by history but also , as I said earlier , social security levels and the general provision of social needs to ordinary people are stri@@ k@@ ingly different in the US and at a far lower level .
the second major decision was to double the maximum amount of support granted for the Member States &apos; balances of payments : EUR 50 billion is a very strong commitment .
in any case , you were top@@ pled by two Civil Democratic Party votes and two Green votes .
he won because he had the trust even of those US citizens who lost a lot of economic income in the economic crisis of the 1930@@ s .
I will allow myself one jo@@ ke today .
we are on your side and will support you in getting that .
we have an ideal historic opportunity with our partners in the US to cooperate on all of the issues of today &apos;s globalised world , from the economy and the environment to the resolution of conflicts in the Middle East , Afghanistan and so on .
they must have been extremely disappointed with the results of the most recent summit .
simple : the Irish Government is te@@ aring the heart out of health services , education , childcare and training .
in order to do so , however , we urgently need to agree on the development of a global carbon dioxide market , on financial compensation for developing countries , on technological support and on capacity building , as well as clarifying at last the principles of burden @-@ sharing among Member States .
I think , with regard to the car industry , that we have placed far too little importance on the development of completely new types of car , cars that run on hydrogen , bat@@ tery @-@ powered cars and cars driven by fuel cells .
the recent decisions by the Commission on permanent spending cuts will have painful consequences on public health and care and workers &apos; insurance rights and pensions which , in conjunction with the demand for higher taxes , will drastically reduce the standard of living of the grassroots classes .
the proposals concerning the two EPAs &#91; i.e. the reports by David Martin and Erika Mann &#93; were formally announced and referred to your committee &#91; i.e. the Committee on International Trade &#93; only at the sitting of 19 February 2009 .
the problem exposed is one that , actually , we have created .
but we also need better regulation and principles for future EU legislation when it comes to motor vehicles .
as we argued in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , genetically modified organisms must be excluded , and novel foods must not pose any risks to health or mis@@ lead consumers .
nevertheless , our absten@@ tion is a warning : we intend to judge the Commission &apos;s action on the basis of actual evidence , and do not want to give it a blan@@ k che@@ que for the future .
the second is a stronger European Union that is more able to act externally than the EU of 1995 , when the New Transatlantic Agenda was agreed ; furthermore , soon it will be an EU but@@ t@@ res@@ sed with the Treaty of Lisbon &apos;s instruments on foreign policy and defence .
I very much agree that the institutional links between the EU and US should reflect the importance of the relationship .
secondly , we need greater ambition in the transatlantic dialogue in relation to subjects to which both the rapporteur and the Commissioner allu@@ ded : Iran , Iraq , the Middle East , Afghanistan , etc .
as was mentioned earlier , there is a new tone , but I sense too that this is a tone from the Americans looking to what Europe can do to be a partner in the global system and that we then have to think what we are going to be able to contribute to this process .
in principle , we unequivocally support stronger links between the EU and US legislators .
Parliament must have the right to petition the Council and the Commission to that effect .
the launch of new structured dialogues such as that which we have heard on human rights is another positive point .
however , in my opinion , it is in no way sufficient for us to approve this agreement now .
so we have to help Turkmenistan to help itself .
the Schengen visa , which costs EUR 60 , is too expensive a treat for many Belarus@@ ians .
it is an opportunity not only to remember the fall of the iron Cur@@ tain , but also to draw lessons from the totalitarian past across Europe as a whole .
it is simply outrageous that people cannot get to know their own past .
we will not be signing any declaration of re@@ pen@@ tance for the imperi@@ alists .
this week it became known that in Latvia the leader on the list of European election candidates for the harmony Centre association , whose newly @-@ elected representatives are to join the socialist group here in the European Parliament , will be Al@@ f@@ r@@ ē@@ ds Ru@@ bi@@ ks , the former leader of the Latvian branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , who was tried in Latvia for the crimes of the regime .
I view the expansion of the EU in a broader sense and precisely for that reason I am able to identify the different forms of totalitarianism that have been mentioned , the different forms in different countries .
there are three things which help piracy to spread : technological facilities and the cheap cost of cop@@ ying , adverse economic conditions and the penetration of the Internet .
I truly hope that we can achieve this with the cooperation of the industry .
secondly , I should mention protection of intellectual property in connection with artistic material which can easily be passed on via the Internet .
finally , good progress has been achieved in setting up EU social dialogue structures in sport .
of course UEFA or its partners should have the concrete responsibility for this , but we can help .
your first question concerns the phasing @-@ out of the be@@ aching method - the method of dismantling end @-@ of @-@ life vessels directly on the be@@ ach .
this position should not be understood as a denial of the policy of Community competence as a legal basis for the legislation , but as an upgrading of the requirements of the ordinary procedure in this sphere , to meet the higher values recognised in the Treaty .
it is beyond me .
I very much hope that today , as the Commissioner said , a large majority will vote in favour of this report so that we can give a clear signal to the Council .
at present in Lithuania about 20 % of residents are considered to be living in poverty .
it is estimated that 43 million EU citizens are at risk of mal@@ nutrition - that is a shocking figure .
the Commission has been examining the problem that consumers face in obtaining redress for mass claims .
we have already found - and in future this may increasingly be the case - that , for many non @-@ governmental organisations and many consumer protection associations , the possibility of arran@@ ging mass claims is becoming advertising material .
it became clear in the debate yesterday that the majority in Parliament would be able to agree to the signing of the interim agreement , even if it pa@@ ins them to do so .
this is only possible by means of a European statutory regulation , a liability scheme for general undertakings .
&apos;@@ because &#91; he has &#93; nothing else here for you ,
otherwise , the EU would fall into the trap of protectionism and of heavy subsidies to various groups within agriculture .
my action here does not imply a sof@@ tening of my attitude to the EU and its im@@ penet@@ rable , inflexi@@ ble and un@@ accountable structure .
this is particularly the case where political action is concerned .
this is the classic kno@@ ck @-@ on effect , which is best illustrated by the effects of the splendid European Capital of Culture programme .
at the same time , we must encourage programmes promoting cross @-@ border mobility among those working in the cultural sector and the sta@@ ging of cultural and artistic events on a transnational basis .
calendar of part @-@ sessions for 2009 : see Minutes
when it comes down to it , Russia and the EU have , as Mr Vondra said , entered into the same commitments in the UN , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) and the Council of Europe .
however , the text of the report does not look to me like recommendations for diplomatic negotiations .
in order for a new agreement to be signed , Russia must fulfil its commitment on Georgia &apos;s territorial integrity .
so the real key is how Russia sees power .
I agree that we need greater trust and understanding between the EU and Russia .
relations between the EU and Russia suffered a great blow last year .
coastal states should avoid discriminatory steps concerning navig@@ ational rules .
the EU should try and convince the five Arctic lit@@ toral states - the United States , Canada , Russia , Norway and Denmark - of the wisdom of such an approach .
I also welcome the excellent report submitted by Mrs Buitenwe@@ g and approved by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , as well as the remarkable contribution from Mrs Lynne and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
there is no reasonable explanation for the fact that the law against discrimination offers protection beyond the workplace to a black homo@@ sexual on grounds of sk@@ in colour , but not of sexual orientation .
anyone valu@@ ing freedom of choice for parents will not allow this freedom to be curta@@ iled .
indeed , if it did , it would be corrected by the Council of Ministers .
if this is true , it is true ; therefore anyone who has a religious faith is a person , as the fact that he or she is a person comes before the fact that they have a religious faith .
relations must be made clear so as to avoid infringing anyone &apos;s rights , including the rights of those who belong to the churches san@@ ctioned by legal regulations .
the directive grants injured parties the right to compensation .
or should I say what will change when we adopt this tomorrow ?
it suggests , specifically , the adoption of action in areas prioritised by the Lisbon Strategy in order to achieve growth and employment .
this is badly needed anyway .
this is particularly important for the Czech Republic because up to 26 % of Czech citizens live in aging to@@ wer blocks .
if we make a reasonably optimistic assumption , the new regulations could enter into force in the coming weeks and therefore make a swift impression on the operational programmes .
to achieve this situation in Romania , the population needs to be informed about the economic benefits which can be gained through energy efficiency management practices , providing , with this purpose in mind , consul@@ tancy to all those who are interested in accessing ERDF funds for the latest energy @-@ saving methods .
in this respect , a realistic evaluation needs to be made of the opportunities which Romania offers to investors interested in investing in the agricultural sector , which seem , during the current crisis , to be most in demand .
that is the real cause of the deaths off the coast of Libya a few days ago .
as a human rights activist in my previous life I especially thank Mr La@@ x for this provision .
I believe that one of the most important aspects which the Commission must bear in mind is the value of transposing Directive No 22 / 2006 into Member States &apos; national legisla@@ tions and the harmonisation of national provisions drafted as a result of Article 19 of Regulation No 5@@ 61 / 2006 .
this of course starts in the home and with the parents , but schools and society also need to be in a supporting role in children &apos;s up@@ bringing , thereby allowing pupils to develop their person@@ alities more wholly .
I believe we now have a complete picture of the Member States &apos; transposition and application of the Directive on the ground , and I think that the time has now come for real action .
much has been done to aid integration , as well as to help new@@ com@@ ers benefit from the same rights as citizens of their host countries .
that is a very ambitious target .
for the SMEs I mentioned , it is obvious that we should have to abolish the bureaucratic difficulty of the authorisation .
there was considerable debate about the costs of this system and I think we have found a sensible compromise at a minimal cost which will still cover the transaction costs for introducing these labels .
as regards the monitoring of progress made by EMAS , this will lead to acceptance of the scheme and the creation of conditions for positive development in this area .
I also believe that people will soon manage to categor@@ ise the products and foods that attracted so much discussion in the debate and in my opinion this will enable EU citizens to contribute actively towards protecting the environment through their consumer choices .
for various reasons it refers to all the Member States and also to the very subject that you have asked to be deleted from the foot@@ note , relating to the very subjects that appear in other parts of the resolution .
it would be much better to refer this back to committee and have a full and considered report in the new mandate .
this will help better cultural exchange and cooperation between the EU and third countries .
( PL ) Mr President , I voted against the report on equal treatment of persons , despite , and perhaps precisely because , I am opposed to discrimination .
Mr President , thank you very much indeed for calling me , and I apologise for being missing when you called me earlier .
we would once again point out that , in today &apos;s EU , the Member States have exclusive responsibility for the organisation of teaching .
for this reason , I consider that Member States must take all necessary measures to transpose effectively the norms intended to harmonise European citizens &apos; rights .
once again the EU has proven that it is the enemy of the people , of immigrants and of refugees , by hand@@ ing the ho@@ stages over to the sa@@ va@@ ge exploitation of capital .
in writing . - This Parliament has played a key role in promoting equal treatment of people across the Union on grounds of sex , race , religion , belief , disability , age and sexual orientation .
however , this resolution has no impact on the legislative process .
European integration was a direct response to the war and the terror caused by totalitarian regimes on the continent of Europe .
no update has taken place . I requested in my 2008 letter to Commissioner Kyprianou that the original recommendation be revised , as it was then four years overdue for rev@@ isions , but there have still been no updates .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
I believe that on an issue as important as this it would be useful to understand what the Commission wants to do : to continue , to stop , to withdraw or to present a legislative proposal .
all I would like to say is that the big f@@ us@@ s and b@@ other about my parliamentary assistance expenses , covered by the media over the last nine or twelve months , has been a har@@ ro@@ wing experience .
this is why I believe that we can say that these five years have been a very sharp learning cur@@ ve .
in addition , I am pleased that , as a result of the negotiations conducted , a better balance was achieved between the powers of the European Network of transmission System operators , the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators and the European Commission , with a view to creating a smooth @-@ operating , efficient , competitive market .
having been at the Han@@ no@@ ver messe , we have seen a huge drive from industry for energy efficiency , not only in the areas we have now legisla@@ ted on , but also in other branches of industry such as different appliances used for end consumption and to produce tools for different types of industry .
unfortunately , action taken to date in this area has not been transparent and convincing , which may produce unfavourable results for citizens and the economy over the next 15 years .
this is legislation that is being adopted by debate and through compromises .
another important development is that the new regulation will make it more difficult for third countries to attempt to purchase energy .
however , when it comes to price ca@@ pping , I still have some concerns .
today , that figure is 155 .
around 27 % of cohesion policy falls within the remit of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
however , I also note that there is still progress to be made in terms of strengthening the monitoring and control system , since there is still a significant level of errors affecting certain transactions .
I know that many of you think that these points are very controversial , but in my opinion at least they are a given .
if regulatory bodies in all of the other countries were as independent as the regulatory body in France we would already have made a great deal of progress .
had the Council been here I would have liked to have asked them for a guarantee tonight that they will do everything possible to reach a common position before the summer , because this situation is incredibly urgent .
last week the bluefin tuna fishing season began .
amendments 104 , 108 , 109 and 110 are also problematic since they restrict the competen@@ cies of Community inspectors , restrict their ability to perform autonomous veri@@ fications and autonomous inspections .
( SV ) Mr President , as a euro@@ sceptic , I often feel a certain S@@ cha@@ den@@ fre@@ u@@ de when various EU institutions come up with unreasonable and ridiculous proposals like Article 47 .
each of the seas in Europe has its own specific@@ ity , and it is important to recognise the level of knowledge and expertise that can be provided by the stakeholders on the ground and to resist the temptation to micro @-@ manage on an EU level .
in this respect , we must totally commit to active cooperation with the countries where the illegal immigrants come from .
I think that is quite significant .
a substantial amendment relates to simplified mergers and divisions , when general meetings will no longer be required to approve them .
turning now to some of the things in the package , changes to Article 27 specified that supervisory authorities must have relevant expertise and capacity .
the Commission has yet to even consider this solution .
let us acknowledge that and be radical and brave .
this is regrettable , to my mind .
( DE ) Madam President , three brief points are important in my eyes .
the facility for supporting Member States &apos; balances of payments is , by definition , foreseen for exceptional circumstances and was only used on a few occasions in the past .
I would like to congratulate the Commission on its quick reaction , and also to thank our rapporteur , Mrs Berès .
11 .
36 .
( FI ) Mr President , first of all I would like to say that Mr B@@ ele@@ t &apos;s report is excellent .
the European Union will supposedly need an extra 60 million non @-@ European immigrants by 2050 , despite its millions of existing unemployed and poor citizens , its mass redundancies , and its business closures .
in writing . - ( EL ) The Commission proposal on which the report has been drafted creates an information and warning network between the Member States for their public and private infrastructures which are characterised as being &apos; critical &apos; .
this programme facilitates effective and efficient cross @-@ border and cross @-@ sector electronic interaction among European administrations , thus enabling them to provide electronic public services that can help them to carry out their activities and to implement Community policies for citizens and businesses .
as a result , this report on the mobile communications market is vital .
in 2009 , it has already been announced that 225 will go .
at the same time , it proposes that measures be taken for the next stage , at the expense of immigrants and in an even more reactionary direction .
I also thank all the voluntary organisations and individual citizens who did what they could and made a personal contribution or gave money to express their solidarity and provide real help ; they are a truly outstanding example of efficiency and humanity .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , the decision that we are about to take is a very important one .
congratulations to this committee , which adopted Mr Sø@@ n@@ der@@ gaard &apos;s report by an overwhelming majority - 27 : 2 .
however , I will make sure that the Presidency @-@ in @-@ Office understands the concerns of Parliament , as expressed in the last debate about the budgetary discharge .
in addition , in order to avoid &apos; du@@ m@@ my companies &apos; , further guarantees must be supplied as regards companies &apos; registered offices .
I am the listening e@@ ar on behalf of everyone in our group who is involved in this subject .
that is why I would like to thank Mr Te@@ y@@ ch@@ enn@@ é and Mr Albertini for the important contribution they are making to protect the rights of citizens as passengers in all transport sectors , because the need to intervene in the area of bus and coach transport and maritime transport represents an attempt to fill a gap that , as you have all pointed out , exists in European law .
I should like to point out in connection with the Te@@ y@@ ch@@ enn@@ é report that it proposes a cohesive framework for the protection of consumers / passengers which also respects small transport companies and protects their business and competitiveness in the event of accidents due to circumstances beyond their control or in cases where maritime transport is affected by bad weather .
as far as can be expected with such a complex regulation , you have deemed the work carried out to be reasonable .
in order to further support the real economy , the Commission , the EIB , the EBRD and the Council of Europe Development Bank have jointly developed an infrastructure initiative that provides technical assistance and cofinancing to priority infrastructure investments in transport , energy , environment and social sectors .
does the Commission consider it necessary to continue to apply these outdated rules at the expense of healthy competition in terms of pricing and consumer choice for the sole financial benefit of a number of major groups who are in the comfortable position of deri@@ ving the bulk of their revenue from exclusive legal rights regarding these products ?
in the country that the honourable Member comes from there is a marked focus on ICT , but relatively weak participation , for example , in health , socioeconomic research and space .
we will also assist in their dissemination through national , regional and local broadcasters in the Member States .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate our rapporteur and all the Members who have worked on this issue .
I believe that the adoption of the report by this House - and I hope that the Council will align itself with the Commission and Parliament - will serve to ensure that in the next term of office the Commission will continue along this road , will make proposals to Parliament and that we will make progress within the framework of the protection of intellectual property , which is vital for the development of our European Union as a great institution based on a common culture .
in this way , the political framework should be outlined for other future intervention in fields in which action at Community level is deemed useful , or indeed essential .
it would cost a great deal of money and generate a great deal of paper , which would simply be fi@@ led away in Brussels .
at the same time , it is also crucially important for the European car industry that we can keep on moving .
I regret , though , that Mr Stock@@ mann deem@@ s our amendment - number 24 - undesirable .
in that way , the transport of goods by train can clearly never compete with road haulage .
therefore at present I am not able to tell you whether the Council will achieve political agreement at the end of the Czech Presidency , i.e. at the EPSCO Council in June .
they can move around , just as is self @-@ evident for every worker , every student and for goods , services and other things .
however , being a citizen means being a human being and we are all citizens , just as surely as we are all human .
in fact , it may lead to the creation of thousands of jobs in the hos@@ pita@@ lity sector as well .
( PL ) Mr President , it is not good when the Court of Justice decides on citizens &apos; rights , but it is very bad when this situation repea@@ ts itself and when , instead of Parliament and the Council , the European Court of Justice does this constantly .
we hesitate , and many in this Parliament - including the Swedish Social Democrats - want to make things more difficult for patients and to hamper their chances of receiving healthcare abroad .
I should particularly like personally to thank - and my apolo@@ gies for not mentioning this earlier - the rapporteurs from the six committees , who have produced such valuable opinions , for their comments and their insi@@ ghts this morning .
this will enable subsequent assessment of the effectiveness of measures and interventions aimed at increasing patient safety and easier communication of experience and information between Member States .
the Czech Presidency believes that after the Council adopts the draft proposal on European action in the area of rare diseases there will be significant advances and improvements in the diagnosis of rare diseases , which is currently problematic due to the nature of rare diseases .
we must stand up resolutely against genetic discrimination .
( for results and other details of the vote : see Minutes )
therefore , I would request that we vote on Amendment 80 as an addition to 37 , if Members like it - which is a different matter - as it looks like we are also doing with Amendment 81 .
31 .
these are a few steps in the right direction for citizens right across the EU to be able to make a decision on where to go for health @-@ care services .
moreover , from an environmental point of view , we cannot accept restrictions such as the requirement that the goods carried in the course of an incoming international carriage have to have been fully delivered before a cabotage operation can be carried out .
why not give a clear @-@ cut exemption from the scope of this new European regulation to regular urban , sub@@ urban and regional transport services , which are themselves covered by public service contracts ?
as a result , patients &apos; rights in cross @-@ border healthcare do not safeguard the exclusive competence of Member States with regard to deciding how to organise and finance their healthcare systems .
in writing . - There are many issues in this resolution which I support .
the EU countries must pay sufficient attention to this forthcoming reform because it may result in many EU Member States , large and small , losing the possibility of their national representatives participating directly and indirectly in IMF decision @-@ making and losing direct access to information .
next time it will be 5 % , when unemployment increases to 27 million unemployed .
that has not only inflicted a great deal of damage on the climate and security of energy supply , but has also ga@@ m@@ bled away the opportunity for thousands of new jobs .
as Mr Daul said , we need more , not less , trade .
the country has constantly expressed its desire to deepen its relationship with the European Union .
we all know that we are still living with the consequences of the tragic events of the 1990s , as Mrs Ib@@ ris@@ a@@ gic has also mentioned here .
this needs to change if Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to continue its progress towards the European Union and avoid falling behind its neighbours .
for this reason - and we have repeated this many times here - the effective reforms required for entry into the EU must be implemented .
it is a message that is particularly important to send out at a time when the economic crisis is in danger of leading to ever more people and politicians in Europe wanting to close the door behind themselves and not allow any more people to live , work and trade where they want to on our continent .
this involves strengthening all three closely linked pillars of the Non @-@ proliferation Treaty , in other words nuclear disarmament , non @-@ proliferation of nuclear weapons and peaceful cooperation in the area of nuclear technology .
despite containing some positive aspects , this proposal for a European Parliament recommendation falls short of the fundamental demands with regard to nuclear disarmament , particularly as it focuses solely on non @-@ proliferation .
firstly , in becoming the eigh@@ th rati@@ fi@@ er , the European Union is saying to the EU Member States that they too should ratify and implement , including the optional protocol .
Minister , I am sure that in your country , as in Ireland , voters sense and worry about the Or@@ wel@@ lian feel to the EU at the moment .
we must strengthen market access for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises above all through more monitoring of the market and of individual sectors in order to identify and tackle barriers to the internal market .
I hope you will endorse this compromise agreement as a way forward and you will continue keeping up the pressure to optimise the full potential for environmental improvement and stimulate the design of eco @-@ friend@@ li@@ er products .
according to reports we have all seen , improving the energy efficiency of buildings is one of the most economical ways of protecting the climate .
national marks do not indicate that additional properties of a product have been tested , nor do they say anything about the quality of a construction product .
in other words , businesses should not bear the responsibility for the shortcomings of administrative cooperation between Member States .
taxation at source is not only more efficient , but also offers greater transparency during collection .
problem of profiling , notably on the basis of eth@@ nic@@ ity and race , in counter @-@ terrorism , law enforcement , immigration , customs and border control ( debate )
its results should provide the Commission with elements that will feed its reflection and guide it when dealing with the problems that profiling can pose in the areas of justice , freedom and security .
- the report by Mr P@@ ur@@ vis , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking up , pursuit and prudential supervision of the business of electronic money institutions , amending Directives 2005 / 60 / EC and 2006 / 48 / EC and repealing Directive 2000 / 46 / EC - C6 @-@ 03@@ 50 / 2008 - .
the value is that we reduce the costs involved in exchanging money as well as other transaction costs .
I would now , however , like to mention another detail , which is important for protecting biodiversity and small @-@ scale entrepreneurship in nature tourism in my country .
in Afghanistan , women are more and more being pushed back into the position they were in under the Taliban regime .
the European Union therefore made a representation to the Afghan Government on 12 April .
for Iraq@@ is , Iran cannot be wished away .
two thousand of these people have registered themselves with the High Commissioner for Refugees , hoping to be transferred to other countries ready to accept them , and for several years now the Iraqi Government has been working closely with UNHCR asking other countries to accept them .
this is why I am suggesting that the postponement of the Council &apos;s autumn discharge procedure should only be accepted , provided that the Council also puts this report on its agenda .
the principles of the convention are respect for dignity , autonomy , freedom of choice , independence , non @-@ discrimination , social inclusion , respect for difference , equal opportunities , accessibility and equality between men and women .
the review uphol@@ ds the principles used to regulate in the EU the use , processing , disposal , traceability and allocation of A@@ B@@ Ps not intended for human consumption , thereby ensuring a high level of food safety and consumer protection .
until then , this period of stag@@ nation will persist .
it is time for us not simply not to upgrade that agreement , but to suspend that agreement .
thank you very much , Mr Pan@@ nel@@ la .
it is hard to do anything with this Council .
the debate is closed .
in most cases , these amendments clarify the Commission &apos;s proposal and therefore aim for greater legal certainty .
( SL ) In my ne@@ ck of the w@@ oods , we have a saying that children are our greatest t@@ reas@@ ure , because they are our future .
as I have said , it is not in the interests of the workers .
the first involves an interesting and unexpected development which is taking place in the new Member States .
let us return to this issue in 10 years , when the situation in the Member States may be quite different .
I therefore call on all my fellow Members to reject Amendment 54 , so that the dialogue remains open and we can help workers who are being exploited and who claim to be &apos; false &apos; self @-@ employed persons .
the citizens can now be sure that seal products will no longer be available on the market .
in the countries of the European Union and in Canada appropriate legislation exists , and there are also appropriate services whose role is to ensure that this legislation is observed .
the issue is whether they are killed human@@ ely or not .
moreover , numerous scientific agencies made a significant contribution to this procedure .
already giving a final deadline for banning animal testing would be ill @-@ advised and perhaps even hazardous to human health ; I agree with the rapporteur on this .
this will fill the legal vacuum created following the ruling by the Court of Justice annul@@ ling Framework Decision No 2005 / 6@@ 67 , which established the nature , type and level of criminal penalties for the illegal discharge of polluting substances at sea .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I thank Ar@@ lene McCarthy very much for her words because a lot has really been done on this directive .
this helps these organisations to remain independent .
they are important for consumers because they offer better services at fairer prices .
we need fast Internet access throughout the whole of Europe , and not just in cities , but also in rural regions .
any policy for network management is justified only for the purpose of maintaining a minimum level of service quality and should not lead to discrimination between services and applications , everything being under the control of national regulatory authorities .
what is technical may , in fact , affect principles of cohesion and access for everybody .
the problem has already been pointed out by numerous MEPs , including my fellow Member from France : governments have attempted to introduce the element of &apos; three strikes and you &apos;@@ re out &apos; into the compromise through the back door , which actually has absolutely nothing to do with the Directive .
I am proud that we shall make it clear tomorrow that citizens &apos; freedoms and rights on the Internet , in particular with regard to the possibility of not being excluded without a hearing in court , are something that the European Parliament will support .
the procedure in place up to now was also sensible and it worked well .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission takes note of the decision of Parliament to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution accompanying Mr Cashman &apos;s report until the next parliamentary term .
I do not know .
in writing . - ( EL ) I voted in favour of Amendment 54 because it is an important political message to the Commission and the Council .
however , the protection of animals , like the protection of public health , requires a fight against the monopolies , against the power of capital , which protects drugs with patents in order to secure huge profits from the commerci@@ alisation of health .
when this Presidency draws to a close , giving way to the Swedish Presidency , Europeans will express their views through the European elections , and I hope that the choices they make will help us to collectively take on the important commitments that await us .
we urgently need economic and social cohesion to stop being merely an expression without any clear content , and we need the principle of &apos; save yourself if you can &apos; to be dropped .
now all that is missing is for the Em@@ pe@@ ror President in Prague Cas@@ tle to de@@ ign to sign the Treaty but , anyway , we do seem to be making progress .
it has problems but we need to extend a helping hand and offer them help to fix those problems .
its implementation at national and European level is already playing a major part in keeping existing jobs and creating new ones .
the open method of coordination must also be reinforced , as this is an essential complement to the European Union &apos;s legislation .
Mr President , as the shadow rapporteur on the active inclusion report , I shall concentrate mainly on that one .
secondly , we need to avoid exclusive concentration on protecting those still in work at the expense of those who seek it and those employers who seek to provide it .
this approach remains crucial today as we face one of the worst economic crises in recent times and also has its part to play in this week &apos;s summit .
written statements ( Rule 142 )
they have also founded a Covenant of Mayors &apos; Office for coordination and promotion .
after two years of negotiations , we now have a comprehensive agreement within reach with the EU &apos;s fourth @-@ largest trading partner outside Europe .
the Commission therefore wishes to meet citizens &apos; expectations in practice .
other Members have said as much , that food counterfeiting will reign ever more .
we also adopted the addition of sugar to wine .
while for countless years the wine growers of the European Union have put in considerable effort and investment to produce high @-@ quality rosé wine , the Commission &apos;s decision will un@@ do these enormous efforts , which have nevertheless had a very positive effect on the economy and the regional development of our territories .
Turkey is an important neighbour , an important , respected NATO partner .
the rights of the communities not listed in the treaties are regularly tram@@ pled on , under the blind eye of the European Commission , which continues , as does Parliament , to support the accession of this country to the European Union .
in this respect , we can accept in principle , subject to re@@ wording , amendments that reflect the approach of the current legislation , which pre@@ serves the right of freedom of religion while allowing Member States to adopt or maintain stricter rules .
I am going to be quite controversial now .
I myself have grave doubts about whether that is a good idea or not , but it came from the reform working group on which you sat .
they will also see that the primary committee does not respond to the requests of the Committee on Petitions , it absolutely cannot be bo@@ thered to respond to anything that the Committee on Petitions says , does or proposes .
I would like to thank Parliament for its support for our proposal , as well as its flexibility and sense of compromise shown in the course of interinstitutional discussions .
whether it was always a pleasure is another matter , but you were always prepared to engage in dialogue , and I hope you can say that of us too .
now , a compensation is to be created with EUR 100 million .
I believe that , in three to four months &apos; time at the latest , we will have it .
the projects differ in their importance .
the programme must be flexibly designed and adequately funded to ensure that the requirements of at least the level 3 committees , including C@@ ES@@ R , C@@ EI@@ OP@@ S and CE@@ B@@ S , are covered .
finally , you should have also decided to introduce guarantees for bank deposits .
my Group supports the proposals developed in the trialogue negotiations , especially the proposals for a new Capital Requirements Directive for banks .
there is nothing that was said here today that did not also play a role in the agreement presented - in some cases not a very strong role - but everything played a role .
8 .
now Parliament also participa@@ tes in the institutional and constitutional deliberations of the summits .
( applause )
instead , let me say this : the President of this Chamber is meant to embo@@ dy the entire House , including those who es@@ po@@ use minority views , and when you treat us differently you open the door to de@@ spo@@ tism .
in paragraphs 13 and 36 , &apos; minimum income &apos; has been translated by the Swedish word &apos; minim@@ il@@ ö@@ n &apos; , which means &apos; minimum wage &apos; .
they shall not have the right to vote or to stand for election to positions within Parliament .
our priority , which gu@@ ides everything we say or do , is to make jobs secure and to fight unemployment , while also promoting sound ecological development .
there was never any common ground , so there was never an EU position before the conference .
we are launching a pilot programme aimed at 10 countries on different continents .
countries whose friendship we want to maintain , because they are large and economically powerful , or those which are important trading partners or whom we see as our allies , are able to get away with more than small , power@@ less countries .
on the death penalty , it is clear that we must make abolition the achievement of our generation .
my proposal clarifies the second ground for detention ( Article 8 ( 2 ) ( b ) ) , placing it within the framework of a preliminary interview in accordance with the guidelines for detention laid down by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees .
the question of solidarity is evidently at the heart of Parliament &apos;s concerns , as it is of mine .
finally , as the Dublin Regulation is not aimed at ensuring a fair distribution of responsibilities as regards the examination of requests for international protection , it seems essential , in my view , for other instruments to be created in order to strengthen solidarity , as you said , Commissioner Barrot , with the Member States located at the Union &apos;s external borders .
therefore I too would insist that , in this area - above all in this area - a way must be found to apply European solidarity .
the proposed instrument establishes a special procedure .
the objective of the two proposals covered by the reports from Mr Z@@ wi@@ ef@@ ka and Mr Deprez is to establish a procedure which will allow the Member States to negotiate and conclude agreements with third countries on aspects of judicial cooperation in civil matters falling within the exclusive competence of the Community .
in its Opinion 1 / 03 of February 2006 , the Court of Justice held that the Community has acquired exclusive competence to conclude international agreements with third countries on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters .
as I asked one of your colleagues before , could I have assurances now , as we approach the critical meeting that will be the UNF@@ CC COP @-@ 15 in Copenhagen this December , that we will have the enthusiastic support of the Czech Government for an adequate and fully equitable global agreement to reduce carbon emissions worldwide ?
finally the Council is also examining a set of draft conclusions on equal opportunities for women and men of the age 50 @-@ plus generation , tabled by the Czech Presidency .
I am very happy that this House has adopted four e@@ min@@ ently interesting and important reports - no , five reports , as Mrs Guy @-@ Qu@@ int also presented a report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon - as a kind of final act of this legislative period .
this is behaviour that is neither credible nor forward @-@ looking .
we affir@@ m that this Service should be assigned to the Commission for administrative purposes .
the peoples of Europe know that the only legitimacy is that which comes from human rights , and that the only authority belongs to the powers that respect them .
I believe we should be more mili@@ tant .
likewise , to show respect for a minority opinion while ignoring the majority decision is offensive to both the given majority and the general principles of democracy we all claim to cher@@ ish .
never before in the field of human politics have so many been con@@ ned by so few .
there are also lost opportunities .
I think it has been an interesting debate , whatever one &apos;s view is on the European project and on the Lisbon Treaty .
I basically support the timetable proposed for appointing the Commission , but I feel that certain stages could probably be shor@@ tened so that Europe &apos;s institutions are not paraly@@ sed for months on end whenever we have European elections .
we actually chose that we did not want to have a further single market measure .
so what we are really talking about is taking money out of taxpayers &apos; pockets and giving it to bureaucra@@ cies , national or international , to spend on our behalf .
many thanks .
it is also obvious that the audiovisual field is primarily the domain of the younger generation , who use television and devices operating via Internet protocols and multi@@ channel digital television as one of their basic sources of information , together with other Internet technologies .
and the promotion on the distribution has been done , for instance , by the European producers club , which organised co @-@ producing workshops in China and in India .
the European Parliament is doing its bit to compensate for the failings of others .
I will keep my fin@@ gers cros@@ sed for you that the next five years will bring more of the same .
I was highly sceptical of the liquids affair when I was an MEP , I remain so today and I am working precisely in order to reach that objective .
this newly elected Chamber of Citizens in the European Union can fulfil the promise we have made to achieve a better EU with more democratic control and more transparency .
it is not unusual for airlines to ho@@ ard airport slots .
I hope that when Irish voters go to the polls later this year they will reject the Lisbon Treaty again .
although I have cited the example of Portugal , I feel it is equally important for all EU citizens that this regulation be negotiated as quickly as possible .
I can accept that Member States need to cooperate in trans @-@ national matters related to criminal justice but I do not accept the development of an EU criminal justice area .
the Treaty of Lisbon , which is 96 per cent identical to the draft Constitutional Treaty , was rejected by the referendum in Ireland .
shame on them and shame on the brutal mul@@ lah@@ s .
it is a country in a difficult situation .
it is the worst punishment that can be inflicted on a politician and we , who are politicians in this House , must all be aware of this .
a little under half of the 7@@ 36 Members have been elected to the European Parliament for the first time .
Jerzy Buzek has therefore received the absolute majority of the votes cast .
European parliamentari@@ anism has always provided a forum for various opinions .
others were unexpected and some were entirely unexpected , such as the conflict in Gaza and the crisis over Russian gas supplies in the very first hours of the Czech Presidency .
Mr President , during the Czech Presidency there were also very important developments concerning the Lisbon Treaty .
the Czech Presidency was against extending the duration of maternity leave to 20 weeks and it was against including paternity leave , which is essential to ensure that family responsibilities are shared between men and women and therefore to promote gender equality .
in cooperation with the Czech Government , we will consult the Canadian authorities in order to get more information on the reasons behind their decision and we will make all the necessary efforts to restore visa @-@ free travel .
moreover , measures to counter climate change have very useful side effects - effects which in themselves justify the measures .
the Stockholm Programme will shar@@ pen the instruments that create security in the EU and that fight organised crime and terrorism .
these are the headline priorities - and rightly so .
the second point is that we hope that you , together with the Commission , can also present a new recovery plan , because 27 different recovery plans will not produce the necessary results in the coming years .
Turkey can be a good neighbour , but it does not belong within the European family .
I would like to take this perspective one step further .
I can tell you that we have high expectations of you , as you have had the reputation right from the very beginning of having gone into b@@ at for European integration and for our European values .
however , and most significantly , it will also mean that Parliament will have greater capacity to monitor the legislative initiatives that the Swedish Presidency implements as part of the Stockholm Programme .
Europe &apos;s largest inland sea can and must be saved .
the voice of areas heavily dependent on farming , like Northern Ireland , must be heard during those discussions and in the debate on reform of fisheries policy .
these demand our continued attention and cooperation , and we hope that Iran will share this view .
this was organised by the largest opposition party , F@@ ide@@ s@@ z , which is well represented here in the EPP , and basically they won the elections this year in Hungary .
( el ) Mr President , I should like to express my deep regret about the tragic aircraft accident which occurred today in the province of Q@@ az@@ v@@ in in Iran .
it is only then that we can hope to be able to start resolving not only the immediate issues , but also the other issues that need to be addressed .
the society is also not harmonious as the Communist Party of China claims .
we want journalists to be able to move around freely so that the situation as it really is can indeed be reported .
at the same time it is wrong to acc@@ use China of cultural genocide .
I therefore welcome the Organization of American States &apos; decision to suspend Honduras &apos; involvement in the organisation , and the acceptance of President Os@@ car Arias as a mediator helping to find a solution .
request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity : see Minutes
Article 2@@ 14 ( 2 ) of the EC Treaty , cu@@ ri@@ ously mentioned as the legal basis of the resolution , concerns not the nomination of a commissioner in the event of a resigna@@ tion , but the vote to approve the entire Commission as a college .
rational mutual dialogue on a constant basis is also the way to deny sus@@ ten@@ ance to extremists on both sides of the border and thereby ni@@ p in the b@@ ud or severely restrict potentially dangerous activities they might undertake in the future .
thousands of Polish shipyard workers are still suffering the painful consequences of the Commission &apos;s antis@@ o@@ cial policy for their communities .
Mr President , I just want to say very briefly that an er@@ rone@@ ous and somewhat con@@ de@@ scen@@ ding statement was made this evening about the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland by a British colleague .
it is a good thing ; it li@@ vens up our debates , which have been a little du@@ ll at times .
State aid can and , in my view , must also be linked to achieving an institution@@ alised employee participation with extended rights of codecision .
where would we be today if we had not taken steps to bring about the trus@@ tees@@ hip solution ?
I ask him to do everything possible to secure that production and the jobs that are associated with it at the same time .
we need a policy of prevention , but also a policy of coordination .
therefore , for us it is important to go much further than the pilot project that you mentioned , Commissioner .
I think it is too early to be discussing disaster prevention as a European competence .
one is that in this House , we tend to speak only on those issues that directly affect our own countries and , given that we are having a debate in Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty - where we are talking about solidarity across the European Union - I think it is a ha@@ bit we should break .
that will give a boost to farming exports of , amongst other things , por@@ k , wine , wh@@ is@@ ky or dairy products .
nor is Switzerland an in@@ significant trading partner either : 80 % of Swiss exports go to the EU , and it is the EU &apos;s fourth largest trading partner .
but I still want to solve the same problem , and I believe the mechanisms we have in place in this agreement do precisely that .
I am an enthusiastic supporter - unlike some , I know - of economic partnership agreements , provided , of course , that the specific situation is taken into account and transitional periods are introduced and , above all , provided that the Member States honour their commitment to provide this inf@@ amous EUR 1 billion sum each year to help trade .
it is for this reason that we are proposing a reserve of 5 % against the resources earmarked for translation in the budgets of the various institutions .
that is all as regards asylum .
the European Union was born out of the refusal to deny others their dignity , and it is to this that it must remain true .
a rational European immigration policy would involve some common framework of criteria for economic migration within which Member States accepting such migrants can operate under their own decisions on the numbers they take .
since May , over 1 000 migrants have been pic@@ ked up at sea by the Italian authorities and handed over to Libya in the course of informal and indiscriminate ref@@ ou@@ le@@ ments without identifying the people , giving them the right to appeal or access to asylum procedures , with the danger that they will be subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment in Libya .
in writing . - In January 2009 , a storm took place in south @-@ west France causing severe damage and enabling France to apply for funds from the European Union Solidarity Fund .
the report on Draft amending budget No 8 / 2009 of the European Union for the financial year 2009 includes some contradictory points .
it is regrettable that we will not see a real change in the staff@@ ing of the European Commission because it is becoming apparent that the main player behind yesterday &apos;s concepts , Mr Barroso , will continue to head the Commission during the next parliamentary term .
on that day , a huge number of police , or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra@@ ted by the government , attacked peaceful demonstrators , pedestrians and even numerous groups of foreign tourists in restaur@@ ants as they were qui@@ et@@ ly having a me@@ al .
it is very important that we maintain a balance .
my colleague , Kinga Gö@@ n@@ c@@ z , a Member of Parliament in my group and former Hungarian Foreign Minister , was insul@@ ted in the debate this morning by Kris@@ z@@ tina Mor@@ vai from the fascist Job@@ bik party in a completely unacceptable way .
the first test case for such a social impact assessment should be the revision of the Working Time Directive .
unfortunately , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe did not continue to support their leader , otherwise this would have been possible .
from what you have said , I understand that you do not think much of this .
you have an ob@@ session with me .
why Mr Barroso ?
( PT ) Mr President , Mrs Malmström , President Barroso , I shall begin by offering you my congratulations .
we need an industrial base in Europe and the problems of the world , such as hunger , poverty and disease , can only be solved if Europe is a strong economic power with a base of this kind .
that is my question .
( SK ) I would like to discuss a topic which is causing concern to many people in the European Union , including myself .
I also want to draw your attention to the still fragile political situation and the difficult economic situation in the Republic of Moldova .
I believe that we must invest renewed energy in this field .
the common agricultural policy actually sanctions two Europe@@ s - the old and the new .
that is why , I might add , we launched the interconnections programme in the Baltic states , and that is why it was the Commission that broke the deadlock on the Nabucco issue - and let us be clear , it was completely dead@@ locked .
we are world leaders when it comes to financial services .
the next item is Question Time ( B7 @-@ 020@@ 3 / 2009 ) .
( DE ) What investment incentives should be put in place to speed up the move to renewable energy sources in private households and not just in industrial and commercial enterprises ?
we are also proposing monitoring by civil society institutions on the implementation of labour laws .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing ( see Annex ) .
this has involved intensive regulatory work over the last year .
there will be no first @-@ mo@@ ver advantage in financial regulation .
our national politicians are saying one thing , but here in the EU we seem to be doing another .
this clearly shows that more effective results can be achieved when there is true coordination .
neither the US nor the EU may use the system to investigate other kinds of crime or for other purposes .
we would also need to prohibit the dumping of cod and this should take effect immediately .
it can only be a success - it can only become real , and not just fine words and rhetoric - if all the Member States genuinely acknowledge ownership and feel a real responsibility for ensuring that the project is realised .
this election will strengthen the democratic nature of our institution .
the political guidelines for the next Commission outlined by President Barroso present an ambitious , modern vision for Europe , to which the fight against climate change and the areas of the knowledge triangle are central .
we need to set up a European reaction force capable of acting quickly in case of natural disasters .
this is a country which shares a nearly 1 500 km border with Afghanistan , and which lies close to the Sw@@ at Val@@ ley in Pakistan .
this will have undeniable consequences for the credibility of the large amounts of criticism that will still have to be made later on .
I , for one , would be delighted if we were to devote an equal amount of attention to the monitoring of the implementation of this agreement , and we will soon have the opportunity to do just that .
we should not give these states a free re@@ in .
the main obstacle to progress in Bosnia is the state of mind , the feeling of power@@ lessness , which is paraly@@ sing people and institutions there .
there were already ethnic tensions before the war , but they have still remained following the war .
( SL ) I would like to express my satisfaction with the progress of the visa liberalisation process over the past 18 months .
I am confident that removing the visa system for these three countries mentioned above is only the start of the process , with the measure being extended later on to Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina .
compatibility between national legislation and the treaties is not a matter for the Council , nor is it a matter for the Agency for Fundamental Rights .
we are talking about a draft law in Lithuania which is causing a problem , which is causing such a problem that Mrs Grybaus@@ ka@@ i@@ th@@ as become involved .
the Swedish Presidency aims to maintain the debate on animal welfare and good animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
to this end the EU should support a global partnership for agriculture and food in accordance with the EU &apos;s action plan for the Millennium Goals .
the Council has urged the Russian authorities on several occasions to do everything in their power to protect these people in Russia in accordance with the universally acknowledged UN Declaration on human rights defenders .
the US appears to be closer to the others within the EU , maybe , than they are to the French and British ideas that were announced yesterday by Gordon Brown .
in order to deal properly with all these ideas for the medium and long term , I want to establish a working group with experts from the Member States and the Commission so they can go to the heart of these issues .
Madam President , when farm women start protesting you know there is a serious difficulty .
the Commission &apos;s intervention measures have also succeeded in preventing milk prices from falling even further and the market seems to be rela@@ xing .
have we not seen what happened in the dairy industry after the Commission decided in the spring gradually to withdraw these quotas ?
we will assess your new proposals very carefully , Commissioner , and it will be my job to ask the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to issue an opinion on the new ideas immediately , without delay .
secondly , we need to work with partners because it is very clear that we cannot just say we will take your territory , we will put solar panels in and transport electricity to the European Union .
firstly , there needs to be a global switch to more renewable sources of energy , more energy efficiency and energy saving .
if Afghanistan constitutes a test for NATO , then energy security is certainly a test of the European Union &apos;s met@@ tle and maturity .
at the same time , the requirements made of the large infrastructure projects that are needed must be clear with regard to both environmental impact and the countries &apos; independence .
now , the March European Council declared that , in order to achieve its energy security objectives , the European Union collectively , but also each of the Member States , must be prepared to combine solidarity with responsibility .
I would also like to make two further quick points .
in writing . - We try hard to encourage a coherent energy policy , but such a policy exists and is fully implemented .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the last few days the legitimate protest of milk producers about prices , about the lack of European Union intervention and about the authorisation - not in the future , but immediately - of labelling , especially that of artificial dairy products , has been taking place throughout Europe .
the European Union is currently going through one of the deepest crises ever recorded in the dairy sector , which is due to the increase in production and significant drop in global demand .
and most importantly , to ensure that farmers receive a fair and adequate price for their production .
however , all these measures have been rejected by the European Parliament .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as well as offering my condolences and support to the people of Taiwan , I would like to emphasise the time@@ liness of the European Union &apos;s humanitarian effort in this disaster .
with Parliament &apos;s support , in 2008 we launched a pilot project and a preparatory action on the EU rapid @-@ response capability .
such an unacceptable practice is becoming the norm in Russia , especially in the case of crimes in Chechnya , where impunity is thri@@ ving .
it is only through the effective and lawful prosecution of these killings that the climate of fear and impunity can be dis@@ si@@ pa@@ ted .
with respect to the signature of an association agreement we , the Greens and EFA , have proposed the adoption of a road map prior to the signature of the Association Agreement which would ar@@ tic@@ ula@@ te our objectives in terms of improvements to be made in the human rights field .
decisions concerning certain documents : see Minutes
are there any questions about this ?
this was a good decision for Ireland ; it is a good decision for Europe .
the time has come for Europe to set institutional questions aside and dedi@@ cate itself to what really matters to the 500 million Europeans : the social market economy , energy , the climate and security .
she did not use the word &apos; only &apos; but she might easily have done .
I am hopeful that all Member States will have ratified the Treaty within a short while and that the institutional and democratic and social reforms can be implemented without further delay .
he is hope@@ lessly compromised by going around with the chief executive of one of the biggest corporations supplying transport .
Europe has fallen behind in international terms .
that is not possible .
I would , however , like to highlight one issue which I do not think has been raised so far : there were many reasons why the Irish people previously rejected the Treaty , but one was the fear , among some voters , that the European legal system could violate , in I@@ rel@@ and@@ . certain fundamental values concerning the right to life and the notion of family .
( HU ) Ladies and gentlemen , when almost 84 % of Hungary &apos;s citizens voted in spring 2003 in favour of our country joining the European Union , they felt as if they were returning to where they belon@@ ged , among the united family of European peoples from which they were excluded by Communist dictatorship s@@ pan@@ ning more than 40 years .
Europe is facing tough challenges on issues such as the financial crisis , climate change , immigration problems , and the creation of more jobs in Europe .
I want to thank Parliament for having decided to give these MEPs observer status while we wait for the formalities once the Treaty is adopted .
the most significant progress in this respect will be the increase in the number of areas where decisions are adopted by the EU Council by qualified majority ( rather than unanimously ) , as well as the increase in the number of areas where the European Parliament will have the role of colegis@@ lator , along with the EU Council .
he has humi@@ lia@@ ted them , because he has allowed killings , he has allowed ra@@ pes .
I believe that he must be supported by our diplomatic efforts .
I would like to suggest a new advertising message for the Slovak hos@@ pita@@ lity sector : we love having foreign tourists in Slovakia , provided that they learn Slovak before they set foot in our country .
the expansion of the protection area does not , however , extend as far as the location where the fishermen are fishing , and that is why we are issuing a call to the ship operators , asking them not to go outside the security area , and we are urging the European Union and its Member States to grant an extension to the south of the coverage of Atalanta and more resources to guarantee the free movement of the 20 000 vessels crossing an ocean whose surface is three times greater than that of the Mediterranean .
examples are accreditation of for@@ en@@ si@@ c labor@@ ator@@ ies , harmonisation of the policy on interpreters and the transfer of criminal records .
this is a complicated problem , which means we need to carefully ap@@ praise the measures to be adopted .
it may be that the recent Bratislava n@@ ight@@ m@@ are will be repeated at another European airport .
if we really wish to win public confidence and obtain the sort of positive results that were achieved in Ireland , we must legislate to show citizens that the Community institutions are on their side , that they are not simply gra@@ vy trains , but places where work is done to safeguard and protect the rights of European citizens .
under the pressure of this procedure , the Italian authorities are now changing their approach .
we are all the more concerned , really concerned , because one of the founding countries of the European Union features among those countries .
this is a highly dangerous development .
I could also cite the very recent example of my own country where my party , Vla@@ ams Bel@@ ang , the second largest party in Fland@@ ers , suffers discrimination at the hands of the taxpayer @-@ funded public broadcas@@ ter ; discrimination that , just recently , was described as electoral mis@@ representation by Belgium &apos;s highest legal body , the State Council .
we therefore ask the Commission to respond to the requests made by this Parliament in recent years and to put forward a definition of specific criteria to evaluate possible infringements of those rights and freedoms in each of the Member States .
I think , in the end , that is what the Parliament wants .
what I do strongly oppose , however , is the feder@@ alist tone of various amendments .
we should continue to support these practical measures to provide assistance to Member States during times of genuine need .
it is important for people affected by the crisis to be able to receive support and help , but this is best handled at national level , not by a bureaucratic international system .
decisions concerning certain documents : see Minutes
the money is largely directed towards developing sustainable economic growth and creating jobs .
also , while we are talking about agreements , banana producers are also following negotiations , in some cases bilateral negotiations with third countries , with a great deal of concern , because such dealings could have irre@@ par@@ able consequences if they do not go hand in hand with compensa@@ tory measures .
I believe that a Mar@@ shall Plan is an absolute necessity with a much more specific and tangible objective , which is to help the billion of our fellow human beings suffering from hunger rise above the subsistence threshold .
however , a closer analysis highlights that certain principles of interinstitutional cooperation are being ignored , both at European Union level and between EU Member States .
therefore , the evaluation mechanism will have to be based on a consistent allocation of the tasks currently shared between the first and the third pillars .
visits will be planned in si@@ tu , on the basis of risk assessments ; there will be un@@ announced visits and a high level of expertise throughout the evaluation exercise , and the number of experts taking part will make the visits effective .
as Vice @-@ President Barrot reminded us , we are opening them in accordance with the rules .
anyone who has the <<unk>> famili@@ arity with the installation of large IT works in the public sector in their own Member State will know that all these technical and budgetary problems frequently arise .
we should therefore prevent any additional financial burden for the Member States which might come out of the analysis or the tests and any further delay in the system .
the Commission talks of restructuring .
the countries must have a full participatory role , no matter what financial mechanisms are in place to distribute this financial support .
I would like to ask Mr Carl@@ gren whether he has the Council &apos;s backing for his high ambitions .
the most important thing is that the developing countries themselves be given a say when it comes to spending the Climate Fund transparently .
a shortage of this gas will be far more serious than a surplus .
it does not merely scrutinise the carbon issue , but is also a comprehensive policy on climate .
an action plan is needed for the most affected areas , which includes : using certain plant vari@@ eties which are resistant to the new climate conditions , adapting the calendar of farming activities to the new conditions , forestation , building green@@ houses , managing water resources from agriculture and making polluted land more environmentally friendly ;
provision of audiovisual media services ( codified version ) (
the current Commission proposal for a codified version of the Council Directive laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries is a step in this direction and therefore has my backing .
this ch@@ ari@@ table remedy ( the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ) that is being proposed will not make people forget that the European Union is , in fact , directly responsible for the tragedy being suffered by the redundant employees , because of its choice of free and fair competition .
that is indeed important , as it means that Commissioner Verheugen should choose his words more carefully when he says that there are no problems .
I cor@@ di@@ ally invite and expect to see Mr President and all my fellow Members .
I think that the response to this question was given by Parliament , which gave me a new mandate recently , so it shows that this Parliament believes I am credible to go ahead with this policy .
I think that it is in Europe &apos;s best interests to maintain open global markets .
year after year , we also see that , as the year progres@@ ses , the Commission and the Council have to resort to a variety of specific measures which are not in tune with regular budgetary methods in order to finance the needs which we all knew were there right from the beginning .
the first is the question of implementing supervision structures at European level .
indeed , in some Member States , the debate is not about where the money is going to be contributed but about the levels of cuts which will be needed to bring the expenditure back into line , as it is in my own country .
in view of this , I wonder how the Swedish Presidency can claim that it sees the Baltic Sea Strategy as a priority .
in recent weeks , representatives of the regions have been meeting at the Open Days in Brussels , and have said that they can put these resources to very good use in enabling better participation in policy in all kinds of fields .
in fact , I know of a contributing country whose leaders say that their revenue has substantially increased thanks to enlargement which has granted them access to a huge market .
this is a thank@@ less , difficult role .
what good practices have been identified , particularly through the work of the European Network of Women in Decision Ma@@ king in politics and the Economy ?
my answer to this question is a definite &apos; yes &apos; .
from the Commission perspective , the Bologna Process should , in the coming years , focus on how to further promote mobility in higher education , strengthen the social dimension through equitable access to higher education , and develop the global dimension of the process , meaning cooperation between European higher education institutions and their partners worldwide .
I will speak later about the studies which we have completed and evaluated on this subject , and it is very clear that there are two sides to the coin .
as regards the long @-@ term measures mentioned in your resolution , we have set up a high level group .
the other large group that should be considered are farmers in the new Member States , especially small@@ holders .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , yes , we should agree to milk being incorporated into Article 186 , and I hope that we will do so tomorrow .
finally , I would also like to say that this cannot be the end of the line just yet .
agenda of the next sitting : see Minutes
first of all , I think this European Council should be able to take the final decisions to see the Treaty of Lisbon pass into force .
the Treaty of Lisbon has two main objectives : on the one hand , more democracy in Europe , which includes more parliamentary democracy , in particular in the European Parliament
I certainly would .
I hope that there will be agreement on a financing concept next week at the summit .
these are not new subjects .
that cannot be allowed to happen !
the first is about the Treaty of Lisbon : following the &apos; yes &apos; vote in Ireland and the signing by the President of Poland , it is expected that the Constitutional Tribunal of the Czech Republic will deliver its opinion and President Klaus will do what he should , and sign the Treaty .
this means that , in the European Union , we remain bound by the principle of unanimity .
we will not manage this by the end of the year , partly because we need the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force first .
one of the prime objectives of the next European Council will be to ensure the success of the UN Conference on climate change , which will take place in Copenhagen in December .
of course , we cannot re@@ jo@@ ice at this because we would have preferred to have come to Parliament and talked about the real problems for which people are asking us for solutions , but we can take comfort in the fact that at least Europe has given a verdict that not even Antonio di Pi@@ et@@ ro will be able to question .
and we should ensure that this applies right across the European Union , as we should not be discussing only one particular country .
I share my group &apos;s concern that , with its demands for Europe @-@ wide legislation on media pluralism and ownership , Parliament would be doing more to destroy freedom of the press than to establish it .
what we needed to do was to set out clearly the role of the European Parliament : we are a legislative assembly and not a Tribunal on the internal affairs of the Member States .
we and the Council Secretariat will work together with the High Representative Vice @-@ President to ensure that there is no gap .
some of our requests aim to produce the same results .
it is therefore of concern to us that the Lisbon Treaty , if it becomes law , appears to set in train a series of developments that could end up undermining that preroga@@ tive .
consistency is pivotal in this connection .
this will also apply in the EEAS , but appointments also have to be on merit , so merit and gender mainstreaming have to go together .
we have regular and ever closer cooperation in connection with crisis management , which found expression , for example , in the US &apos;s participation in a civil CSDP task , the EULEX mission in Kosovo .
we are in the final stages of preparing a statement that will aim to renew our transatlantic partnership in these areas .
secondly , when there is a conflict , either it relates to defending our economic interests - for example , as in Airbus - or it poses a risk to our health or environmental rules - in the case of beef containing hor@@ mon@@ es , for instance , or ch@@ lor@@ inated chic@@ ken - and we should therefore not prioritise the improvement of economic relations over our own internal model , our social model , our environmental model , or development model , as if economic relations were an end in themselves .
the SWIFT agreement is needed as it sets out specific safeguards on data .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to thank Mrs Malmström for her excellent , detailed answer .
it is an ongoing process that is progressing desperately slowly , but we hope that this can be a tool we can use to make progress .
I would also like you to say that this probably is the case and that during its Presidency , Sweden will continually follow this matter inten@@ tly and will take appropriate steps .
the response to a pandemic is actually based , first and foremost , on having health infrastructures that are better equipped and treat cases early in order to have available , in a fair manner , preventive resources when they are available .
( RO ) I , too , wish to welcome the Commission &apos;s intention to support the Republic of Moldova .
an IMF delegation is currently in Chişin@@ ău .
Fa@@ its ac@@ compli@@ s created by the use of force are not acceptable and can never be acceptable .
there is no one truth , there are several tru@@ ths and they often contradict each other .
this adjustment list usually features every year and represents good work from the Secretariat .
Mr Buzek very kind@@ ly said that it may have been because he was speaking too quickly .
the MEPs have today confirmed their support for a European cohesion policy that really does have the resources to meet its ambitions .
however , I believe that the Commission should enjoy these powers for only a maximum of two years in order to ensure the smooth delivery of this package .
we have a huge responsibility as one of the world &apos;s most important and largest players when it comes to trade and also development .
I also wish to mention a point that was emphasised before .
the no@@ torious th@@ ug@@ s known as the B@@ asi@@ j have now been incorporated into the Iranian Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Guard Cor@@ ps , another sin@@ is@@ ter organisation .
author . - Mr President , the people of Sri Lanka - Sin@@ hal@@ ese and particularly the Ta@@ mil@@ s - have suffered enormously over these past 30 years from a ru@@ th@@ less terrorist campaign conducted by the LTTE .
this is simply not true .
evil cannot be appea@@ sed , as it is in the nature of evil to exploit every appea@@ sement for its own ends .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights , as the text which formu@@ lates the values or ideals on which the Union is based , which it stri@@ ves to conform to and which it bears in mind when taking decisions , would naturally form an organic component or actual first section of such a Constitution .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified by the 27 Member States of Europe and has an obligation to produce results .
however , what we actually need to strive for - particularly given how strongly we applau@@ ded Mr Ha@@ vel &apos;s speech - and what we actually need to achieve is to agree that we need strong men and women to be appointed to the top political positions in the European Union and that individual interests , including the interests of the countries that are actually opposed to stronger integration , should take a step back .
that is not possible , as we could never then deliver on the 2 ° C target .
in so doing , we will lead the countries of the South and force an agreement out of the Americans .
we must have the political will to transpose and implement the treaty .
secondly , I want to rein@@ state the reason underlying the European Union - what the European Union is striving to achieve .
I think we should also look at the title .
( applause )
( PL ) Madam President , the forthcoming EU @-@ Russia Summit will confirm the importance which the European Union attaches to relations with Russia .
otherwise , we may soon not only have to worry about a bilateral ice age , but also about citizens freezing in Europe on account of the gas dispute .
on Ukraine and , especially , the transit of gas , we at the Commission have been working with the Ukrainian authorities , but also with the international financial institutions , on a loan package that would address both payment difficulties for the storage of gas from Russia and the reform and modernisation of the Ukrainian gas sector .
that is not good enough .
Mr President , I am grateful that we are able to debate this topic today , as it is such an important one .
we were therefore very pleased with the decision taken on the Services Directive , which we believe means that the right to negotiate , enter into and apply collective agreements , and to take industrial action in accordance with national legislation and practice , would not be affected .
the directive has opened up many possibilities , both for consumers and for entrepreneurs .
in my view , defining priorities that are political means that they should be scrutin@@ ised , should be transparent and should be democratic .
the illness also involves the suffering of close relatives .
for these reasons , the stand taken by the Council , which not only has failed to commit to a specific amount in financing for developing countries , but also has failed to say anything about financing to maintain the world &apos;s forests , is unacceptable at a time when there is no uniform policy or coordination at European Union level on the protection of forest eco @-@ systems at risk in southern Europe .
this decision e@@ ases the way for Po@@ we@@ o to in@@ sta@@ ll a methane termin@@ al at Anti@@ fer and restric@@ ts a project to create an offshore wind farm off F@@ é@@ camp , despite the support shown for this project by local elected representatives , the population and even fishermen .
there you have it , Madam President .
these are : firstly , that there should be quality in public expenditure , that money should not be wasted ; secondly , that social security systems and sustainable growth should be adhered to ; thirdly , that the policy of full employment of a decent quality should not be abandoned ; and , four@@ thly , that climate change should be combated .
however , it is worth asking what proportion of these not in@@ significant sums has reached those most affected by the crisis or those most in need in this difficult situation .
here , we are all democrats and , therefore , fighters for freedom .
( es ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my extreme concern regarding the suspension of the San José Agreement .
I agree with my colleagues that we should adopt the 2005 approach to origin marking .
they go hand in hand .
in this regard , it would seem right to draw attention to the improvements in the bank &apos;s cooperation with NGOs and other civil society players that make this cooperation easier and more transparent , and we are grateful for these .
secondly , and perhaps even more importantly , the definition accor@@ ds the Ombudsman a capacity for intervention that other institutions may easily regard as discre@@ tionary , because it is not properly defined and regulated .
I consider that Mr Diamandouros has been efficient and consistent and has worked to promote transparency and to address issues relating to a lack there@@ of .
the procedure is going to be complex and , depending on the extent of agreement or , more likely , lack of agreement between Parliament and the Council , it is going to be complicated .
however , I wish to make it clear that the Council can take part in our meetings at any time .
in addition to infringing the rights of immigrants in such situations , this amounts to unacceptable pressure and blackmail on these countries .
I hope the energy dialogue and the commitments resulting from the forthcoming EU @-@ Russia Summit will , in the long term , lead to greater transparency and viability for the energy sector , and that this sector , in turn , can help to establish new structural relations between the two blo@@ cs through the development of commercial and economic cooperation .
unfortunately , no cure exists at the moment , and preven@@ tion@@ - and treatment @-@ related knowledge is limited .
( DE ) Mr President , in times of climate change and global warming , this much is obvious : we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions and we must save energy .
it provides 14 % of the industrial GDP , 9 % of industrial jobs and 12 % of exports .
I already presented to you my declarations at the May plenary , saying that the Commission will build on the reforms by consulting widely next year on the scope of the future universal service and a wider application of the principles relating to data breach notification .
the compromise sends a strong signal to the Member States that things like the French H@@ AD@@ OP@@ I law or the Mandelson method in the UK are simply not acceptable .
I still have to make my mind up about how I am eventually going to vote because , as I said , there is a great deal that is good about this package .
this is a debate in which problems of both procedure and substance have arisen .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , these reports lay down the rules for Europol gathering and exchanging information between EU Member States - and , indeed , third @-@ party nations - of the most personal kind about EU citizens .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as shadow rapporteur of one of the dossiers on Europol , I can only reas@@ ser@@ t what has already been said by the Members who have spoken before me .
what is most uncertain in the decision is control by the European Parliament .
just now , Mr Coelho referred to an issue , one that has also been mentioned by others , including Mrs Ver@@ giat , which has given us much food for thought .
in the context of the real problems which the country is having to face , the economic crisis and also the problems resulting from the war with Russia , which has significantly weakened the impetus of economic development in Georgia , that assistance is certainly not very great .
I would like to begin with the point that the rapporteur just finished on , namely that it is of paramount importance that we can actually exercise these rights as soon as possible .
now it is time for an agreement .
at the same time , it is essential to conclude agreements to ensure that these funds make an active , effective contribution to reducing climate change , and also agreements on technology transfer and the protection of intellectual property rights .
we have four weeks and negotiations have a momentum of their own .
let them become aware of their great responsibility .
when it comes to technologies , we must remain impartial .
thirdly , politics must take note of a debate emerging in science .
without those commitments , we are heading for a climatic , political and moral disaster .
we should have also referred to bi@@ opi@@ ra@@ cy and the autonomous property right of indigenous peoples as being fundamental tools for combating climate change .
Madam President , this was a very interesting debate with some exceptional and constructive interventions .
this is the only way we are going to maintain production and , by extension , jobs in the European Union .
in order to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda , we need to provide sufficient incentives for investment in new high @-@ speed networks , so as to support innovation in content @-@ based internet services and to enhance the EU &apos;s competitiveness at international level .
lengthy experience with the collection of data on the sale and use of pesticides has shown the need for harmonised methods of collecting statistical data , not only at the national level but also at the Community level .
this Parliament must fully assume its new powers in these matters .
a conviction was not made .
it will take time for all of us to learn how to use new arrangements to deliver the best results in terms of the European Union &apos;s increased role in the world .
President of the Commission . - I agree with your general point that the institutions are also the way we shape them in practice .
this is necessary because , unless there is resolution of the issues I have mentioned , the External Action Service will be just a tor@@ so without the requisite budgetary provision and without the requisite abilities to determine content .
increasing cooperation with the countries of origin and transit is also of major interest .
if , for example , we are dealing with the fight against illegal migration , we must not just take on NGO positions , we must be a serious partner .
that is all well and good , but there are already first signs and tendencies , expressions of opinion , that do not correspond to the consensus of what has come to be called political correc@@ tness , to restrict , to prohibit and , who knows , sooner or later , to punish .
European rules are dicta@@ ted by Community rules and by the case @-@ law of the European courts , but they also derive from the conduct of workers , businesses , students , and judges , both national and belonging to the European networks between operators of justice .
nevertheless , it is important to ensure that these targets are met .
the first one is the question of form .
I certainly see this as a powerful means of driving forward this area of freedom , security and justice that the citizens so very much want .
moreover , the Member States are bound to ensure that no return operations are carried out in violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which obliges the Member States to guarantee that a person will not be sent back to his country if he is liable to suffer persecution or serious attack upon his return .
what is worrying this House and me is that the situation regarding security in Afghanistan is such that we do not know whether anyone can be returned there .
however , let me also clearly state that we both expect and require that this step expresses a change of attitude on the part of the Council with respect to Parliament .
the first was that the Council refused to accept any kind of official , formal meeting with Parliament .
question Time ( Commission )
this , at a time when the Commission and the Member States alike are emphasising in their energy plans the need to reduce consumption and the possibility of compar@@ ing prices with the aim of potentially changing supplier .
Commissioner , will you require anybody selling goods to have a direct contact number where people who have difficulties can make direct contact with those who have sold them def@@ ective goods or services ?
the potential savings from those measures that the Commission has proposed and that legislators have not yet adopted amount to EUR 31 billion per annum .
what do you have to say to women who , on the pretext of equality between men and women , have been told that their retirement age is to be increased by 5 to 17 years , as is happening in Greece ?
the very fact that we have Dell workers &apos; committee representatives here tonight watching this shows just how deeply this fund has reached the workers of Dell and how they welcome it so much .
thanks to financial means obtained for people who have lost their jobs , both Belgian textile workers and workers from the Dell factory in Ireland have been given an immediate opportunity to re@@ train and find new work .
the Euromed Free Trade Area also has a South @-@ South dimension .
if you were to spend this money on safety , we would have a European railway market and guaranteed safety , which is the order of the day .
together , we have a range of problems . Slovakia and Hungary , too , have problems together , such as the problem of the Rom@@ ani .
unfortunately , S@@ inn F@@ e@@ in has used culture - especially language - as a weapon in its campaign against the state , and this has led to controversy and con@@ tention .
( SK ) I originally wanted to respond to Mr B@@ ok@@ ros but you did not give me the floor .
we cannot negotiate against the scientific advice , and this is the minimum : to reach an agreement compatible with the 2 ° C objective .
or are we threatened by intensifying conflicts on Europe &apos;s borders resulting from the purchase of gas , oil and other raw materials ?
what I would like to make very clear is I am not ashamed of anything at all that the leader of the Conservative Party is saying or doing and , in particular , it is clear to all of us that we have always indicated that , if the Lisbon Treaty had not been ratified , we would have wanted it to be put to the British people .
( protests )
we will also be forced to undertake an evaluation process to learn from the experience .
our duty is to question the im@@ penet@@ rable ha@@ gg@@ ling that surroun@@ ds appointments to the posts that resulted from the Treaty of Lisbon .
it will continue to be one of the main tasks for the European Union and the new Commission .
in any case , I want to thank every candidate from my area , especially the Estonian President , Too@@ mas H@@ end@@ ri@@ k Il@@ ves , and the Latvian President , V@@ air@@ a V@@ ī@@ ķ@@ e @-@ Fre@@ i@@ ber@@ ga .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , we should be happy today , as we are emerging from an institutional difficulty .
( DE ) Mr President , just now the interpre@@ ter asked for Article 20 and not for Article 22 which makes it difficult to do what you intend .
however , just because something is said a thousand times does not mean that it is justified .
the auditors consistently report that levels of control and scrutiny of the use of EU funds within the Member States are inadequate .
how can European citizens have faith in the &apos; benefits &apos; of Europe when it author@@ ises this kind of &apos; tri@@ ck &apos; ?
industrialised countries and emerging countries with more advanced economies should be subject to comparable efforts .
additional funds must also be allocated , taken from the contributions made by the states signing the global agreement , which reflect the economic development and solvency of these states .
the current situation confirms that these predi@@ ctions were right .
on the subject , I note that the drawing up of plans within the framework established in Paris in July 2008 in strategic sectors such as new infrastructures , cooperation between SMEs , communications and exploitation of renewable energy sources may contribute positively to development and the facilitation of exchange and investments , because the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean so@@ rely need this .
guaranteeing safety is a priority for us .
I do believe that we must remain an open Europe and that we should remain committed to an enlargement process that brings good governance , the rule of law , reconciliation , peace and prosperity to larger and larger parts of our Europe .
there is one thing about Kosovo that the speaker before me has already said .
we should offer Ukraine a clear possibility of membership .
as an accession candidate , Turkey is already receiving EUR 2.@@ 26 billion for the period from 2007 to 2010 .
for this reason , all of us must give both sides friendly encouragement to find a long @-@ term solution with a broad scope and a broad application .
when speaking in this Chamber , we need to use the terms which everyone has accepted and FYROM , the candidate country , has been accepted as &apos; FYROM &apos; and not as &apos; Macedonia &apos; .
I do not see our Union as &apos; absor@@ bing &apos; nations .
however , most important of all is that bilateral disputes be resolved by involvement of the parties .
women who have the freedom to utilise their whole potential are less vulnerable to violence than women who are excluded .
and , because it is a criminal law issue , it is a sovereign state matter , and it is up to the nation state to lead .
for instance , in Europe , it is estimated that 20 @-@ 25 % of women are victims of physical violence during their grown @-@ up lives , while 10 % of women even have to abide sexual violence .
but , we all know that much more has yet to be done .
above all , I do not see what value the EU can add and I believe that the money would be better spent on other projects which the Commission is already running .
in fact , tuna boats are particularly vulnerable , insofar as , on the one hand , they have a very low free@@ board and , on the other , they are im@@ mobile and not manoeuv@@ rable during se@@ ine fishing : that is , during a four to five hour period .
we can now help those people and prevent them from becoming sick in future , and this is an opportunity that we must take .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( Thursday , 26 November 2009 ) .
finally , the 2008 decent Work Report provides for the monitoring of the policy developments with regard to the ratification process .
over one billion people in the world presen@@ tly do not meet their daily basic nutritional needs , and the situation is threatening to get worse in many developing countries , owing also to the effects of climate change , which is posing additional challenges to these countries &apos; capacity to become food secure .
honestly , though , can we , here , have a clear conscience when a child is dying of hunger every five seconds ?
and , thirdly , food security , and all that it implies to the European Union , involves cost .
( es ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the wake of the recent conclusion of the Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) World Summit on Food Security , I would like to express my disappointment at its limited social , media and political impact .
very detailed standards and requirements have been established at the level of the World Organisation for Animal Health to prevent the spread of F@@ M@@ D .
we need to see a clean bill of health to reassure farmers , taxpayers and consumers that they are protected and that free and fair trade can resume between Brazil and the EU .
my problem is that both the Commission and the F@@ V@@ O consistently play down the impact of their findings and they minimise any adverse information .
I am obviously jo@@ king , but the rules , if rules are to be applied , must be the same and mandatory for everyone .
it is therefore too early to say whether changes to rules or systems have reduced the level of errors .
I believe that it must be reiterated today that the Court should always be guaranteed independence and autonomy when carrying out its work because this is fundamental if we are to be able to evaluate properly and to make good decisions .
for example , is it prepared to ask the countries that should never have spent the money to pay it back ?
could information on the effectiveness of policy be included in future ?
it is also important that these improvements in the transposition of European legislation be implemented much more emphatically in the procurement rules , that there be improvements in the powers to overcome obstacles and in enforcement , particularly in the Member States .
the aim here is to identify in@@ accurate and incorrect data in all the different areas of spending and to correct the errors .
the agreement applies to books from all over the world published in English in countries which are covered by the Convention .
so I say , &apos; to every cow her cal@@ f , to every book its copy &apos; and to every author and ar@@ tist their copyright and intellectual rights .
Mrs Sen@@ y@@ sz@@ y@@ n accused the Catholic Church of op@@ pressing women .
I cannot help seeing the question of solving hunger and poverty as a media topic rather than a concrete problem requiring an urgent solution .
it cannot remain a club which is closed to other European states , but it cannot open its doors indefin@@ itely either .
I welcome the vote in the European Parliament on the resolution for eliminating violence against women on this International Day for the elimination of Vi@@ ol@@ ence against Women .
on the other hand , I also believe that Member States should promote smoke @-@ free policies , but that they should not impose any restrictions on freedom of choice for operators , particularly in the hotel sector , where owners should have the option of being smoke @-@ free or not .
we do not believe that these support measures and payments will help to bring increased security of food supply to developing countries in the long term .
we must not forget that Mr van B@@ aal@@ en is the president of Liberal International and on the website of the Fri@@ ed@@ rich @-@ N@@ au@@ mann foundation , it states that he discussed the possibility of a coup with the armed forces in Nicaragua .
in La@@ os , a country under military dictatorship , the leaders of the students and teachers movement set up a decade ago are still being held in secret detention .
it certainly has everything in it : Tibet , the Dalai Lama and his succession , the religious crus@@ ade and even , in case anything had been missed out , criticism of any present , past and future Communist regime .
only recently , I was on a visit to Pakistan , where I met the President , the Prime Minister and prominent ministers to discuss human rights and the fight against terrorism .
( el ) Mr President , the fact that the Commissioner present , Mrs Boel , called a text on the review of the Community budget in connection with the common agricultural policy inadequate at a public meeting of the European Parliament &apos;s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is a good sign .
indeed , a number of obstacles will have to be overcome - of a legal , psychological and technical nature - to unite national air@@ spaces and to succeed in getting control@@ lers from the various countries to work together .
as regards fruit and vegetables , the economic crisis has led to lower domestic consumption , and also we have seen a certain decrease in some export markets .
in this sector , the rules that govern intervention in the event of a market crisis do not allow us to make a significant response to the requirements of the agricultural sector with specific protection of farmers , at an extremely difficult time that affects agriculture as a whole and , in particular , the fruit and vegetable sectors , such as , for example , ap@@ ples and peac@@ hes , and cereals , such as wheat and maize .
price stability is required at consumer level , on the one hand , because , due to other financial commitments such as mort@@ ga@@ ges , par@@ en@@ ting and leisure activities , the consumer does not have enough le@@ f@@ to@@ ver income to cope with price fluctuations .
then on the issue of the regulatory framework - I did not hear this exact phrase , but I think that is what is behind the comments on this issue .
we must now also raise the public &apos;s awareness .
( it ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to point out that several months ago , outside a meeting of the World Trade Organisation steering committee , of which I am a member , a colleague from Na@@ mi@@ bia expressed his disappointment that the prices of certain European agricultural and non @-@ agricultural products in Na@@ mi@@ bia are lower in comparison with local products .
you tell us that the European Social Fund cannot be the only source of funding .
we should carefully analyse the results of this funding to see where we have used best practice and where we were actually able to help secure jobs and , above all , where we have succeeded in re@@ integrating redundant workers into the labour market as quickly and as efficiently as possible .
( FR ) Madam President , I note that , throughout the previous debate , you referred to the debate that is now to take place as a debate on Progress .
on account of this , in 2006 , this Parliament , in its wisdom , established that resources from the European Social Fund could also be paid out as micro @-@ credits or subsidised loans , as laid down in Article 11 of the European Social Fund Regulation .
unfortunately , help is not reaching people at risk of losing their job in time , and it is they who will feel the effects of the present crisis the lon@@ gest .
I would like to reiterate that it was no easy decision , and I do not even think that it was the only decision and , in the debate over a compromise , a decent basis will surely be found , or at least I hope so .
I do not imagine that there are many Members of this Parliament , even if everyone were here this evening , who could claim to understand them .
the register should be an important element of the mechanism of the system for protecting consumers , including the youn@@ gest and most hel@@ ple@@ ss .
I would like to remind Parliament that in 2008 , when we adopted the 2009 budget , our priorities were also the competitiveness of the European Union , growth and employment .
if people are dis@@ satisfied with the system , they must change the system .
colleagues , listen to your conscience and vote against this budget .
yet the request for more dis@@ po@@ sa@@ ble funds , which rec@@ urs every year , is at odds with this .
the special report from the Commission on the use of EU funds in Bulgaria until this summer did not mention Kozloduy , although it has received money from PH@@ AR@@ E .
the second point is the inclusion of EU staff pensions in the budget .
nevertheless I would like to draw attention to the speech made by my fellow Member , Mr Go@@ d@@ man@@ is , in which he mentioned that for more than a year , individual states have failed to manage financial support .
preparing an EU budget in conditions of economic crisis and the transitional period from Nice to Lisbon was a very difficult task .
this will help businesses across Wales , and I am disappointed that colleagues from UKIP were unable to support this progressive initiative .
secondly , there is another issue in the detail which seems totally unreasonable to us and that is that green genetic engineering , which you , Mr Barroso , are in favour of , now forms part of the health portfolio and is no longer included in the environment or agriculture portfolio .
what is wrong , surely , is that the Commission has had some good programmes , but the Member States just do what they like .
we have been supporting this idea , not only in terms of ideas but in terms of funding .
however , we believe that in some cases , it makes more sense to spend a euro at European level than at national level because of the potential benefits of exploring the European dimension and the European internal market .
the EU will continue to support and work closely with the US via the Quartet .
I have several fundamental objections to the said Council statement .
we saw the hopeful s@@ miles on the faces of the Palestinian representatives .
however , I regret that we have heard far too often today the message that Israel is a democratic state .
there have already been enough cases of people listed wron@@ g@@ fully for many years who had to fight for due legal process .
Article 215 addresses the role of Parliament and Council and the legislator should not devi@@ ate from the treaty .
in principle , Article 215 seems to be the most appropriate .
we need to enhance access to documents .
in addition , other legally protected rights , such as data protection or the right to privacy , are disregarded .
I am very proud to have played a part , together with Mr Cashman , and with contributions from the Commission through Mrs Wallström , in its ad@@ vent .
it remains to be seen whether the new people at the head of the EU will prove their worth in this case .
let me also speak about the Tag@@ lia@@ v@@ ini report .
clearly , the idea is not to change the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact - no one has asked for that .
the European Investment Bank can also help by providing targeted credit to the region &apos;s small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , while the EU &apos;s institutions can help by adapting the rules for using the money from the Cohesion and Structural Funds to suit the extreme situation .
Cre@@ dit@@ worthiness is , of course , always a prerequisite of liquidity and , therefore , the discussion about the credit@@ worthiness of companies , banks and employees is particularly important .
in many respects , we are already acting in line with the points that he made .
the new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe have proven to be the most vulnerable .
in my opinion , we need to start with education and information .
we have to say that subsidiarity is a rule of European law that has no application in this case , because its concept and applications have nothing to do with this case .
yes of course , the principle of subsidiarity must be respected and recognised by all European institutions , organisations and courts , especially freedom , whether it is freedom of opinion or freedom of belief .
Mr President , could you please discuss this with the rapporteur , Mr Martin , in order to come to a solution as soon as possible ?
it was a victory for European cooperation .
I now expect our partners to do the same .
the European Union should be leading the peace process , and should be the main force striving for peace in the Middle East .
on the adoption of the Stockholm Programme , we support the principle that the Member States of the Union must cooperate more to combat problems related to immigration , cross @-@ border crime and terrorism .
this is not necessarily the Swedish Presidency &apos;s fault , but rather the European Commission &apos;s .
in writing . - The green light has been given to the Lisbon Treaty , which has created all necessary circumstances for institutional reforms .
such situations , which are happening at an alarming rate , require decision makers to think carefully about the European economic and social model as well as its sustainability and its future .
its main thrust , however , is the emphasis on total liberalisation of the world market .
the report in question is not clear enough in terms of its approach and also says too little about past failures and data protection issues .
yet what happens ?
Pakistan is a country that has been through major changes in recent years .
our civilian aid therefore amounts to more than 20 percent of the yearly Afghan GDP , a figure that has the potential to reverse the destiny of the country if properly used .
we need a radical change of strategy away from the military and , above all , towards a more people @-@ centred strategy .
the sense of insecurity has also spread to the main cities , despite the ongoing commitment and monitoring action of the IS@@ AF forces .
but I do agree that we need to be more efficient .
although I understand the historical and political circumstances of Belarus , I firmly believe that the time has also come for Belarus to join the ranks of those countries that have out@@ la@@ wed the death penalty .
there was a conference just a few weeks ago in Brussels with civil society .
the EU is firmly committed to continuing to help bring about peace , stability and development for the population of the country .
moreover , last month , a group of Congolese women came here to remind us of this - and rightly so - with the aim of en@@ listing our support against this scandalous strategy .
a rapid response by the European Union is therefore crucial .
in these conclusions , the Council welcomed Serbia &apos;s commitment to EU integration and its work in implementing key reforms in line with European standards .
climate issues have been top of the agenda on all these occasions , so there has been a wide variety of meetings .
in response to your question , without first having the general overall far @-@ reaching directive , it is very difficult to set standards of a European character in the area of discrimination against disabled people .
I think everyone in this House supports the efforts .
however , this cannot be an excuse for any delays , and the Court of Justice has not accepted such delays in six judgments so far .
I do not think that we can resolve this issue with this Commission and there is no point in trying to do so .
we must move to a new area of entrepreneurial innovation , where in Europe we are working together to make the world &apos;s most cutting @-@ edge products .
in relation to your question whether the Commission intends to publish a White Paper on Terri@@ torial Cohesion , at the current stage , a separate White Paper on Terri@@ torial Cohesion is not foreseen .
these elements also exist in the Lisbon Strategy and the EU strategy for 2020 .
consultation on the post @-@ 2013 budget and the future objectives of this policy must involve all the actors concerned : the Member States , the regions , the European Commission and Parliament .
I think that two main points have come out of these speeches .
the barriers between the various funds must be eliminated so that the maximum possible allocation of resources can be achieved .
I repeat , the information should have been passed to us yesterday , before the joint resolution was debated .
rapporteur . - Mr President , it is proposed that Amendments 3 and 7 , which are identical in the text , be voted in three parts , and that an oral amendment be made to the second part .
European military engagement contributed to the prevention of a situation similar to the one in Rwanda .
I would also point out that energy security is crucial for the Union , and I therefore welcome the signing of the Nabucco project .
today , we have adopted a European Union budget for 2010 amounting to almost EUR 123 billion .
they are often connected with the illegal exploitation and pl@@ undering of raw materials either by insur@@ gent forces or by regular troops and their leaders .
I will therefore return to the agenda .
I have asked for the floor simply to add my voice to the@@ irs before voting accordingly later .
we call on Azerbaij@@ ani authorities to release the journalists in jail without further delay .
2 .
Mr President , &apos; let us not allow fear to guide us &apos; , we often say .
our objective must be to prevent such situations in the European Union .
the public consultation ran until the end of last week , that is , 15 January , and we are still conducting hearings for the new Commission , who will only take up their posts next February .
European food surpluses must be ship@@ ped out to the Haitian people as a matter of urgency .
( FR ) Mr President , Mrs Ashton , that is enough !
I disagree with those of you who argue that the presence of soldiers and other law enforcement personnel might h@@ eral@@ d the beginning of a colonial approach on our part towards Haiti .
secondly , as far as civil protection and its coordination is concerned , since the 2004 tsunami , EU civil protection coordination has grown stronger and much more efficient .
it rejected the out@@ stret@@ ched hand pro@@ ff@@ ered to it by President Obama and rejected the latest plan suggested by the Si@@ x , which involved Russia and France .
I do not now see a better way forward for the residents of Iran .
I hold no brief for the regime of the Ay@@ at@@ ol@@ lah@@ s in Iran or for its anti @-@ democratic stances .
I think that it does not give a good impression of us if a failed bomb attack on an aero@@ plane only leads us to a general debate on Yemen .
we need to help counter this .
there are not many ways to combat terrorism and the way in which the West is going about it is certainly not one of them .
Madam President , I , too , would like to thank the High Representative for her words , which struck the necessary note of optimism .
in recent months , there has been an encouraging re@@ configu@@ ration of alli@@ ances , which has done much to overcome the ethnic @-@ religious spli@@ ts that have marked Iraqi politics in recent years .
we fully support Iraq remaining a unified and sovereign state .
in your report , you express the concern that the conclusion of EPAs and increased region@@ alisation might undermine the coherence of the ACP Group .
this freedom should be , first and foremost , freedom from bureaucracy , which is becoming more and more excessive in the ACP countries and is constantly an obstacle to economic growth .
it would only be a drop in the ocean , but it would be symbolic , and it would show that we really do mean , in practice , the many fine words that are spoken in this House .
Pu@@ zz@@ l@@ ingly , British courts seem sh@@ y of invo@@ king this clause to block surrender .
thank you , Mr Watson .
this subject is the focus of the Spanish Presidency &apos;s programme for the next six months and has received in@@ dubi@@ table support in all the speeches I have heard , based on a variety of arguments and seen from different perspectives : the need to move towards harmonised procedural guarantees .
finally , in the course of 2010 , the Commission will publish its first report on the implementation of the directive relating to residence permits issued to nationals of third countries who are victims of trafficking in human beings and who cooperate with the competent authorities .
the two basic parameters that I should like to highlight , without underestima@@ ting the importance of other parameters are : firstly , the European institutional framework for combating this crime , which is cross @-@ border and is exacerbated by illegal immigration , is - as has rightly been said - inadequate .
therefore , it is very important to strengthen cooperation between the Member States and with third countries , to ensure a dialogue with non @-@ governmental organisations and to call on the Commission to establish the position of a European coordinator for these matters .
I believe that a hard @-@ hitting information campaign is required , especially among minors from disadvantaged areas and groups , to improve the effectiveness of preventive actions .
progress has been made in the field of energy , but not the progress that we want .
I see the next six months as a s@@ pr@@ ing@@ board to set ambitious goals , goals I have presented in my political guidelines and which we debated last autumn here in the European Parliament .
it was not that it would not have been possible to implement it .
unfortunately , my group feels that your programme does not resolve the fundamental problems .
Mr Schulz , thank you for your words .
( LT ) I also hope that the Spanish Presidency will be a success and that , in addition to the priorities laid out , Spain will also devote attention to a problem that is particularly relevant these days , that of human rights and freedoms .
unless , of course , we are confusing Haiti with Tah@@ iti .
after all , in that regard , Parliament was disappointed in the compromise on financial supervision reached by the Council last December .
his emphasis on jobs and growth is vital to us all as we come out of the financial downturn , and I very much look forward to working with a fellow socialist government .
I wish to refer to immigration .
this should be a priority for both the current Presidency and subsequent presidencies .
ethnic and religious minorities are still being discriminated against in this A@@ na@@ to@@ lian country and Ankara stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly refuses to recognise Cyprus , which is an EU Member State .
the latest figures , which come from 2008 , show 3 4@@ 06 complaints in comparison with 3 2@@ 11 the year before .
the outermost regions can act as the prime intermediaries for the EU in economic partnership agreements .
this agreement formally expires on 31 January .
Mr President , honourable Members , I stand in Parliament today in order to share with you my views on the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit and the challenges that arise from it , both for the European Union and for the rotating Presidency that Spain holds for the first half of 2010 .
we must be innovative : innovative on the carbon markets by imposing an upper price limit , and innovative in terms of financing methods .
I would like to see us specify this 30 % target to the UN Secretariat in Bon@@ n on 31 January , not the old 20 % target .
that must give us pa@@ use for thought , because we are always emphasising the fact that we are the ones who want to take a leading role in the global fight against climate change .
I therefore think it is absolutely essential - and I echo my fellow Member Mrs Le@@ page here - that , at some time in the future , we give thought to implementing a carbon tax at the borders of the European Union .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in this Copenhagen agreement , a two percent goal was accepted by 180 member countries , but it is still not legally binding .
firstly , I think that one of our problems is a lack of humi@@ lity and realism , as my colleagues have already said .
priority would be given to financing measures which would contribute to a real reduction in emissions at the lowest cost .
the time has come when no effort will seem too great when we are talking about the future of the planet we all share together .
I think you are off to a very good start this week .
in fact , for example , the high @-@ level group of the Member States meets every six months to share experiences relating to social responsibility .
this is what the treaty ultimately proposes
in modern Europe , quite simply , they are not .
I am not clear at all how the government intends to strengthen its democratic opening in this context .
the P@@ KK is like a mafia , with a structure carrying out criminal activity , raising funds and bol@@ s@@ tering support .
political assassin@@ ations and violence by the prosecu@@ ting authorities continue .
work is now under way to this end , including a completely new orientation for preparing our planning documents on a multiannual basis and moving from projec@@ t- to sector @-@ based programming .
this is why I hope that the new European Commission will consider this matter and not avoid funding based on public @-@ private partnerships .
this means that my bro@@ ther &apos;s farm in that area is at risk .
I am also glad that this strategy was included in the eigh@@ teen @-@ month programme for the coming presidencies of the European Union .
the new Danube Strategy seems as if it will be approved , most likely under the Hungarian Presidency .
EU @-@ Tunisia relations are governed by an association agreement signed in 1995 .
the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left was instrumental in the organisation of the debate .
a quarter of politicians , local officials and journalists are women .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - Mr President , all who are committed to democratic rights and freedom of religious expression will condemn outright the murder of Christians in Egypt and also the fire@@ bomb attacks on Christian churches in Malaysia .
so I welcome this resolution .
Mr President , China is a large country with a rich history and with huge development potential .
we are also attached , by the way , to the protection of the right to sexual expression and orientation , as mentioned by Mrs Trü@@ pel .
this makes it the greatest massacre of journalists in world history .
although , in this trial , the death sentence could have been com@@ mu@@ ted to lifelong imprisonment , the prosecution rejected this possibility at the end of January .
if you consider , for example , the situation in railway stations , it is fundamentally similar to that in airports .
it is no secret that gambling goes together with criminality , violence , organised crime , prostitution and various other related phenomena .
I do not intend to provide an exhaustive commen@@ tary , and will focus on the main amendments .
concerning the amendments aimed at providing for more defined rules on the protection of private data , I would like to underline that in any case , Member States are compelled to respect the existing Community legislation on this subject and that therefore , these rules will have to be respected without any further amendment of the present draft directive .
however , as my grand@@ mother used to say , that is another story .
I sincerely hope that it will be adopted on Wednesday at our plenary sitting .
this is exactly why the issue surrounding the exchange of information is relevant , where we must consider the decisions that have been made by international organisations that have really studied this matter such as , first and foremost , the OECD .
as we have heard here , gross domestic product is now at crisis point in different parts of Europe .
we have to ensure that we do not penalise honest citizens who pay and do not evade tax .
the European Commission stood by as General Motors tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed .
S@@ py@@ ker cars becomes Saa@@ b S@@ py@@ ker in a EUR 400 million deal but , make no mistake , this is not a normal commercial deal where one company pays and another company is paid .
( RO ) I would like to begin with three vital questions .
I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr Tarab@@ ella , for the support expressed by Parliament for the approach adopted and the actions taken by the European Commission to promote equality between women and men .
it is time to take significant steps towards improving the lives of the majority of women , including in the area of sexual and reproductive health , and putting an end to the hypocrisy that still surroun@@ ds the issue of abortion .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , the motion for a resolution by Mr Tarab@@ ella , who joined us in the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality at the last European elections , is ambitious .
there are many aspects to this , and many have been included in this report .
I believe this is the solution we should and ought to be working towards , particularly in challenging economic times .
women cope better with , for example , micro @-@ enterprises , but their participation in the management of large companies is quite small .
there are measures in place to achieve equal pay and now is the time actually to put them into practice .
and , not least , they are the fruit of intensive discussions with this House .
an answer to the question of whether the European Union counts in the world could be seen in Copenhagen .
every time the opportunity arises to have a political Europe , we blow it !
Mr Száj@@ er , you cannot deny that we have a better team now than we had at the time of the original hearing of the first candidate from Bulgaria .
( FR ) Mr President , we have come to the end of the procedure that prec@@ e@@ des the appointment of the commissioners , with hearings that are completely run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mil@@ l .
it furthermore rules out the su@@ i gener@@ is construct .
thank you , too , for presenting your vision of the European Commission &apos;s work and the aims of that work .
we see there is strong support across the political spectrum ; this is an important moment for Europe , a real mandate for bol@@ dness .
we expect you to embrace this assumption and to come forward with clear , firm and ambitious proposals and reforms in all these fields .
would we employ an assis@@ tant here who becomes a laugh@@ ing stock like Günther Oettinger has done on You@@ Tu@@ be in &apos; Oettinger talking English &apos; ?
Mr President , I voted against the appointment of the new EU Commission because it will simply continue with the same right @-@ wing , neoliberal economic policy that has already resulted in disastrous crisis in the capitalist economies of many EU States .
increasing the number of meetings between the Commission and Parliament &apos;s bodies is not the way to arrive at more effective European policy .
what &apos;s more , Baroness Ashton has not , at any time , given us the impression of being able to cope with the pressures of this post .
when it comes to economic and monetary issues ( the Lisbon Strategy , supervision of the euro area ) , the failings of the previous Commission are well known .
this is a dangerous tendency .
I think that , in contrast to the representatives of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I am not really an advocate of the intervention by the Commission .
none of the member countries of the zone , no matter what its export strategy , no matter what its deficit level , no matter what its public debt level , has a chance of emerging from the crisis if one of the links is attacked .
my own country and others , however , lost as a result of those statements and the policies which are currently in place .
it should , after all , be said that the euro has been incredibly successful in wea@@ thering the most severe financial crisis .
firstly , I think that there has been a general confidence in the euro area during the debate .
however , let us also remember the victims - those who are the victims of terrorists .
for you said most categorically , Mr Pa@@ pani@@ ko@@ la@@ ou , that illegal prisons existed in Europe , including in Poland and Ru@@ man@@ ia .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great honour for me to be here on behalf of the Presidency @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
there will be no fish left in the Mediterranean by then , but people will still be able to eat sus@@ hi if they can afford the bill .
the policy needs to be fair , and therefore we need to seek a path that does preserve tuna but that does not , of course , punish these traditional fishing methods .
let us assume our responsibility coura@@ ge@@ ously and with the honour that the European Union is worthy of at this time .
together , we have said , &apos; This was actually already an agreement under the Treaty of Nice &apos; .
for this reason , we must carefully consider ring @-@ fen@@ cing at European Union level some of the resources exclusively for bringing some of the LA@@ U level l statistical units up to standard .
( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , allow me to begin by highlighting the role of the rapporteur , Mr van Nistelrooij , for his work in search of consensus in this matter and also for the willingness that he always demonstrated to include other contributions in his report .
allow me to remind you about the conclusions on Croatia adopted by the Council in December .
however , the Commission has concerns following the decision of the Constitutional Court to close the pro @-@ Kurdish party represented in Parliament , the DTP .
this includes recognising that the policy on minority groups in these two countries is better than in many Member States of the European Union and that all the minorities and ethnic groups in both countries are represented in their governments .
1 .
bringing Croatia into the family of Member States of the European Union is part of our strategy to build a continent of democracy and prosperity .
lastly , we must also remember that Turkey , with its 90 million inhabitants , will be the most populated country in the European Union by 2030 .
this reference makes the problem an international problem , as indeed it is , not a bilateral problem , and sends out a more accurate message than just generally hoping that the problem will resolve itself .
we wish to back the membership of the Former Yugosla@@ vian Republic of Macedonia and this is why we call for compliance with the method of consensus , part of the history of the European Union , and we call on the European institutions to offer their sympa@@ thetic support for the views of all of the Member States on the reasons that still block this path .
the Greek Government knows that the process requires new momentum and is genuinely determined that the issue be resolved .
furthermore , we cannot break the commitments we have made with candidate countries , although we should also respect the well @-@ known principles of consolidation and conditionality .
I understand that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , as a new independent state , is undergoing a re@@ tar@@ ded eth@@ no@@ genic phase .
nonetheless , the country continues to face many pressing challenges , including the political criteria .
Mr President , after discussing this with Mrs Bran@@ tn@@ er from the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , I would like to recommend voting in favour of the first part and against the second , contrary to the list which we have drawn up .
we are about to mandate a bail @-@ out in plain violation of Article 125 of the treaties .
we have to ask ourselves how we can make progress jointly with other states .
we still earn less , women are at greater risk of poverty and it is more difficult for women to develop an academic or business career .
( SK ) An@@ y country that is making efforts towards joining the European Union must not only formally complete but also internally identify with minimum requirements in the area of democracy and respect for human rights .
it has a duty and the means to ensure this .
in writing . - The increased mobility of both persons and capital lies at the heart of the EU and has been a great success .
I warmly welcome the recent debt @-@ relief pledges to Haiti and urge all the donor countries to help with long @-@ term and sustainable reconstruction .
it is extremely important for us to re@@ open the dialogue with Iran .
consequently , whatever you may think about it , illegal immigrants will claim this status and this welfare , and you will grant these to them !
a new &apos; climate diplomacy &apos; is required to achieve this purpose .
Parliament reiterates its aim of increasing this reduction to 30 % .
it is a pity the text does not tackle the basic problem or attempt finally to put the fair distribution of the wealth produced for the common good on the European policy agenda .
the report also emphasises that women must have access free of charge to consultation on abortion .
following this , the General Assembly of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tun@@ as ( ICCAT ) set a considerable reduction in the fishing of bluefin tuna by 13 500 tonnes and the European Commission res@@ tated its concern at the reduction in tuna stocks and committed itself to carrying out more reliable scientific studies .
international trade in endangered species is estimated to be worth billions of dollars a year and to involve hundreds of millions of plant and animal speci@@ mens .
some opponents of Turkish integration are guided by reasons un@@ connected with the substance of the matter , and others by fears that Turkey is a big country which will have a big influence on EU decisions , because , in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon , the voting power of each Member State is dependent on the size of its population .
all countries have endeav@@ oured to improve internal and external coordination , to be better informed and , ultimately , to cooperate with those who are engaged in the same struggle .
I would like to make that very clear .
we are ready to consider the postponement of the vote but if it is not granted , then we should vote in favour .
U@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ c@@ tedly , they have listened to this institution , something which I hope will be repeated in the future .
but I think we need to understand and remember why we have an interim agreement .
we must not stop in our efforts to track financial movements and establish the source of funds used to support terrorism .
but this stock@@ taking does not mean that I am not fully aware of the fact that the threat of terrorism has not dimin@@ ished .
we need to consider what kind of Europe we want to live in , because total security does not exist .
it has only succeeded in increasing the problem .
Manch@@ ester Air@@ port , where one of the scanners is being tri@@ alled , insists the black and white images are not porno@@ graphic or ero@@ tic and are viewed by a single officer at a remote location after which they are immediately destroyed .
it is up to Ukraine to choose the model it wants to adopt .
Commissioner , be bold and be the first person who starts to say that there is room .
what we must do here in the European Union is to support the legacy of the O@@ range Revolution and our common shared democratic values with Ukraine .
I would like to emphasise that Hungary , with Ukraine being its largest neighbour , is particularly interested in political and economic stability being established in Ukraine .
I thank the Council for its reply .
it is also the result of systematic monitoring of trade restrictive measures by the WTO , the OECD and the Commission .
Madam President , in the current global economy , most borders are allowing a more efficient flow of people , capital and services .
I am not talking , here , about protectionism , but about a policy of equal opportunities which , at present , our producers do not have .
if this was accepted , it would have cost EUR 2 billion to the European economy and hundreds of jobs across the Union .
the next item is the debate on the motion for a resolution by E@@ liz@@ abeth Lynne and Pervenche Berès , on behalf of the EM@@ PL committee , on the proposal for a Council directive implementing the framework agreement on prevention from sharp injuries in the hospital and healthcare sector concluded by H@@ OS@@ P@@ EE@@ M and EP@@ S@@ U .
it is crucial to create a work environment which is as safe as possible for workers , for families and for citizens .
in the United States , it is estimated to be a matter of around 380 000 , but the Americans themselves say this figure is an underestimate .
Member States claim that , when it comes to online gambling ( and this applies to the liga Portugu@@ es@@ a and San@@ ta Cas@@ a cases , as well ) , they are capable of implementing the objectives of consumer protection and efficiently tackling any atten@@ dant crime on their own , without any European involvement .
I firmly believe that there should also be a ban on advertise@@ ments for online gambling which target young people .
personally I would rather buy sho@@ es , but others do other things for their k@@ ic@@ ks .
the Commission continues to face a paradox@@ ical reality between Member States &apos; jurisdiction to regulate this area and the complaints lodged by gambling providers against the restrictions imposed nationally .
I am against protectionism when it comes to gambling and wish your green paper could in fact solve this problem for everybody &apos;s benefit , for the benefit of consumers and national administrations and for the benefit of the principles underlying the European Union .
he is , I believe , a living example , in that we are either imprisoned by our history or liber@@ ated by it .
democracy simply does not exist .
these desperate attempts to cen@@ sor information and expression remind me of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s behaviour .
the security forces which he direc@@ ts have frequently intervened in a violent manner to dis@@ per@@ se opposition demonstrations and there have been deaths and injuries .
tens of thousands of people have been displaced against their will .
( RO ) someone was saying earlier that we have already discussed Burma in this House .
because it is only natural for there to be concerns about one thing or another in connection with any legislative proposal , we have resolved the open questions by means of a compromise in the Committee on Legal Affairs .
I think that all European institutions can , and must , work together for those goals .
what answers can you give them ?
we cannot expect to have dynamic economies if we make even greater demands on those who are generating growth and jobs by imposing heavy tax regimes and bureaucratic regulations .
our task now is to produce a new Lisbon Strategy , in other words , EU 2020 .
I address this in particular to Mr Barroso .
I would now like to say a few words about the social dimension of the agenda : that is where the demands , dre@@ ams and fears of citizens are manifes@@ ted , the dre@@ ams and fears of those that are within and outside the labour market , of the victims of the arrogance of the financial markets , which has taken control of the real economy and destroyed it .
ladies and gentlemen , one of the most important challenges facing the EU is the reas@@ sessment of the Lisbon Strategy , with the associated fight against poverty and exclusion and the strengthening of social cohesion .
I believe that it is in the European Parliament &apos;s interest for this body , the Human Rights Council , to be as powerful and effective as possible , because I would say that we need a credible partner in the dialogue on human rights .
the next item is the Council and Commission statements on the implementation of Goldstone recommendations on Israel / Palestine .
furthermore , based on the conclusions in the report , suspension of action to upgrade relations between the European Union and Israel and the application of the provisions of the association agreement should be examined immediately .
Mr President , if we can achieve that unity on Friday , I will be very pleased and then , perhaps , a solution in the Middle East would be within our reach .
I would like to make a strong appeal for us not to enter@@ tain such an idea until Hamas un@@ ambigu@@ ously recognises Israel &apos;s right to exist and renoun@@ ces violence .
the European Union takes care that economic relations with Israel are as good as possible .
we do not want political sanctions , we want a rap@@ pro@@ che@@ ment of Belarus and the European Union .
the Republic of Belarus is one of the European States for which involvement in the European Union &apos;s Eastern Partnership marks an important step forward in the development of bilateral relations , as well as in the relations between Belarus and every EU Member State .
we need women if we want Europe to overcome its difficulties , and these new indicators will , of course , help us in this way .
it is not only the face of poverty which continues to be female , but also the face of il@@ literacy , unemployment and low wage rates .
women &apos;s rights campaig@@ ners from Islamic countries approach us , hoping that something will be done about it here .
the implementation of the Platform for Action falls under the sovereign responsibility of each Member State , taking into account and showing strict respect for diverse religious and ethical values , and for the cultural heritage and philosoph@@ ical convictions of individuals and their communities .
schools for national minorities have had their subsidies reduced , and preparations are being made for their closure as part of what is being called a &apos; reform &apos; .
the order of speaking is the order in which you asked for the floor : you are registered in the order in which you asked for the floor .
Tor@@ ren@@ tial rain , strong win@@ ds and heavy seas rendered the centre of the tourist city of Fun@@ ch@@ al un@@ recogn@@ is@@ able and left devasta@@ tion and death in their wake .
similar mistakes were made here to those made in our country .
secondly , we also want a political debate with Parliament and the Member States in order to draw conclusions from this .
I congratulate the rapporteur .
I have my doubts .
I could not agree more that we need radical reform to turn around the structural failings of our policy .
the European Conservatives and Refor@@ mists endorse the report , in the hope that the current system will change .
we have an opportunity today to make a difference and to change the direction of a policy that everyone agrees has been a dis@@ mal failure .
we have succeeded in this : the provisions relating to transfer@@ able individual quotas have been withdrawn , and support for small @-@ scale and coastal fishing has been maintained .
( the President cut off the speaker )
it is therefore necessary for this House to recognise recreational ang@@ ling in all its forms as an important stakeholder in the fishing industry , and for the reformed common fisheries policy to take its economic and social benefits into account in its White Paper .
third countries like Taiwan , to give just one example , have also chosen ERTMS , and not just for oper@@ ability reasons .
indeed , these are questions that need to be asked , as the SN@@ C@@ B can hardly use lack of money as an excuse !
the funding must be increased immediately in order to speed up the planned modernisation programme .
it will be up to the investigation to determine the extent to which those characteristics were responsible for the tragedy .
I am also delighted that perhaps even a post @-@ Soviet country will soon enter a visa @-@ free regime with the European Union .
we have a duty to set a good example , but today we are setting a bad one .
the reliability of the system is important , as operation must be continuous .
following the dis@@ integration of the Eastern bloc and the Union of Soviet Re@@ public@@ s , the Ukrainian people and institutions have been strongly committed to the democratisation of the country and the construction of a modern society by developing a social , economic and political system that can consolidate the rule of law and respect for human rights , despite the difficulties that are normally inherent in a state that is in the process of regener@@ ating its structural organisation and political identity .
the European Union must actively participate in the work of the Council , while remaining aware of its limitations and problems , and try to im@@ part a balanced , yet strict and exac@@ ting , view of what respect for human rights should be .
the Swedish Conservatives have today , 25 February 2010 , voted in favour of the resolution on Beijing + 15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality , .
at the same time , under the pretext of an alleged increase in work@@ load due to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and of Parliament &apos;s supposed concern about the quality of its legislative texts , the MEPs are awarding themselves a &apos; small &apos; budget increase to the tune of a few million euros so that staff can be recru@@ ited for the political groups !
I would like to begin by highlighting the excellent report produced by Mrs Pat@@ r@@ ão Nev@@ es .
last week , there was also an earthquake in Chile , which claimed nearly 300 victims , and stor@@ ms ra@@ ging across Europe caused the deaths of over 60 people , most of whom were citizens of France .
there are many underlying cultural causes and these too must be accor@@ ded great importance if the position of women is to be improved .
I want the Spanish land @-@ gra@@ b problem to be debated and resolved , to end the suffering of many women and men who risk demo@@ li@@ tion of their houses and cannot live in them .
Mr President , I would like to ask you to pass this information on to the relevant authorities so that they can examine it properly and ar@@ range the necessary remedy .
unfortunately , this wine has now come under attack from some Labour Party politicians .
economies exist , or should exist , to serve our peoples .
in this regard , I welcome the written statement which was agreed between Parliament and the Council during the trialogue , stating that this file should not be treated as a precedent .
the Swedish Board of Agriculture , which is the relevant authority in Sweden , has said that , without the option of special controls , the tape@@ wor@@ m , for example , would probably become established in Sweden .
Fourthly , I believe - and this is something you have pointed out - that the assessment of the work of travel agents that varies from country to country also means that the cross @-@ border provision of goods and services is being made very difficult for travel agents .
the state &apos;s debt crisis guarantees that this will be a critical year for Greek tourism , this we know .
many financial transactions are intermediate , not like end sales , so the intermediaries - banks and the like - will bear the tax .
naturally , the issue of whether the European Union can take this step forward on its own is being raised .
that must be paid for another way .
there are several elements that must be taken into account .
the next item is the oral question to the Commission by Shar@@ on Bowles on the Single European Payment Area ( SEPA ) .
however , its rules should apply to the functioning of the single market , to cross @-@ border trade , not issues that are only of concern internally to the national economy .
if annual accounts are no longer compulsory and thus lost as a source of information , the only remaining possibility is to request the documents prepared for tax purposes .
micro @-@ entities , moreover , cannot afford this effort at all .
secondly , it is , in fact , completely correct that the compromise provides for minimum provisions .
the Commission &apos;s current record clearly shows that it has remained very stead@@ fast on these principles : preventing all distortions of competition , even during periods of crisis , whilst being flexible and open on procedures when necessary .
however , I feel that at present , they provide an adequate basis for establishing priorities and drawing conclusions concerning the further analyses that need to be carried out .
here I intend to make sure , together with Vice @-@ Presidents Almunia and Reding , that the Commission moves forward in a coordinated manner .
in plenary today , we are discussing Mrs T@@ hu@@ n &apos;s report - an excellent report , I would like to add - but it is a report about the Internal Market Scoreboard for 2008 .
it is citizen @-@ centred , and it tries to help those who come up against barriers and problems created by the EU and to solve the problem in 10 weeks .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , this joint debate this morning and the high quality of all three reports indicates the high priority given to internal market and consumer policy in Europe .
I can well imagine that it is something you would like to work towards .
I believe that SOLVIT offers consumers a practical solution .
the truth is that various Member States have been providing long @-@ stay visas and , subsequently , residence permits , without first consulting the SIS , in particular , with respect to the requirements of Article 96 on the effects of a refusal of admission .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the report proposes that Member States may issue long @-@ stay visas for up to 12 months for third @-@ country nationals which will be recognised by other states within the Schengen group .
as such , we should all be positive about these prospects and the SIS II system , which is a necessity , must , come what may , proceed quickly .
consumer protection (
furthermore , publication of current data and effectively informing citizens and business people about their rights and the situation in the market will help improve the market &apos;s function and will improve transparency of its principles , ensuring equal conditions for competition .
I recognise that public action should take place not only through this form of promotion but also , and crucially , by removing artificial and bureaucratic obstacles to entrepreneurial activity .
the present protocol is directly linked to issues such as environmental protection , climate change , safety , public health , regional development , relations with third countries and development cooperation .
the safety of products circu@@ lating in the domestic market requires a combination of efforts with the authorities of third countries , and therefore justifies the Commission &apos;s initiative to step up international cooperation and sign formal agreements with the relevant authorities of third countries , especially China , the US and Japan .
with this in mind , the Commission is urging the Member States to duly promote the SOLVIT network amongst the public and firms , bearing in mind its capabilities and the added value which it represents .
for this reason , it is inconsistent that a student who has obtained a visa to take a course in Portugal should not have the option to go , for example , to Belgium to gather information from a specialised library for the writing of his thesis .
protectionism and fragmentation of the single market must be avoided , as they weaken Europe &apos;s position within the global economy .
in writing . - I fully support the concept of the Internal Market Scoreboard as a tool for measuring the success of the single market .
I consider this to be a risky strategy that our citizens will not find at all acceptable .
tell us if there is some sort of timetable so that I know , when we go out to borrow on the international market , if we will have some support from this mechanism .
under the European instrument for democracy and human rights , the Commission programmes around EUR 150 million each year to support human rights NGOs across the globe .
so for all of us to whom it is very important to get an international deal , I also think it is very important to pursue this ste@@ p@@ wise approach and to try to do whatever we can to ensure that the world gets a legally binding deal before 2012 .
to Mrs Has@@ si , it was the point of view of the need to stick to 30 % and , in many respects , it relates also to what Mr Cal@@ lan@@ an says .
I think it is a logical thing also vis @-@ à @-@ vis the citizens .
do CO2 emissions , therefore , also have any connection with an economy which is &apos; green &apos; like this ?
I think this initiative will be a welcome moment to take stock of developments at national , European and international level since 2008 .
I would like to make it quite clear that no child should fail because of educational or language barriers .
for this reason , we welcome the directive on non @-@ discrimination in all areas - a directive that has not always received support from all the political groups in this Chamber .
unfortunately , a huge discrepan@@ cy persists between plans and studies and putting them into practice in order to tan@@ gi@@ bly improve the life of the Roma community , which remains the most vulnerable ethnic group in Europe , at a time when they are facing the highest level of poverty and social exclusion .
the process of educational reform requires the involvement of not only State institutions but also of non @-@ governmental organisations which no longer need to make it their main objective to identify acts of discrimination , but to educate ethnic groups .
in situations where there could be a cross@@ border impact , it might even be appropriate to promote insurance schemes that are Europe@@ wide rather than national .
what the Commission can do is to use the open method of coordination and the analytical and reporting capacity available to it to help Member States to better focus the social protection measures .
the problem with drugs , as you know very well , is that , although we have relatively developed technology to find drivers who are under the influence of alcohol , it is much more difficult to detect the influence of drugs .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - The plan is to deploy the ERTMS system on main European railway networks before 2015 , so there is a date where we think that this deployment plan will be implemented , but this does not mean that every line , especially regional lines , will be equipped with such high @-@ level equipment , so there must always be other systems as well .
that is not a failure of this Parliament .
now to the matter in hand .
that is why I delivered it as such , so I really do not think I should be subjected to abuse from the other side of the Chamber from that group of ro@@ gues .
when I read that online and off@@ line are both supposed to represent the digital world , does that essentially mean that there are also to be restrictions and search@@ es of lap@@ top@@ s , i@@ Po@@ ds and MP@@ 3 players at borders ?
therefore , we have listened to you and we ask you to introduce an ongoing , transparent consultation procedure on the Anti@@ Counter@@ feiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , ensuring that the European Parliament and the citizens represented by this Chamber are regularly and fully informed of the progress of the negotiations , whilst respecting the confidentiality clauses which , as you have just indicated to us , are related to the agreement .
this agreement should fundamentally improve international cooperation in dete@@ cting counterfe@@ i@@ ters , but I do not think that our aim should be to prosecute secondary @-@ school students who download games from the Internet .
here , of course , I refer to the inf@@ amous &apos; three strikes &apos; laws .
but when we asked whether some of the ACP countries that had specific concerns could be given GSP + as an alternative , we were told this was not possible because they violate certain of the conventions and therefore do not qualify for GSP + .
Parliament is ready to play its full role , its full positive and constructive role , to help you realise this ambition , which is a common ambition .
in Bosnia , we have adjusted ALTHEA as the situation has stabilised and developed a training programme .
however , we have also witnessed a series of events which have clearly illustrated it : the natural disasters that keep on happening , the horrific attacks that keep on happening , the fact that some governments in the Middle East , despite being democratic , have nonetheless taken decisions which have severely ham@@ pered the peace process , or the little that remains of it , and so forth .
but I think it is absolutely essential that , as we look ahead , we look at the priorities that have been set out with which I think this House will largely agree and make sure that my actions are addressed to those priorities , one of which is setting up the Service , which does not yet exist .
( DE ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , I would like to thank Mr Danje@@ an for his excellent report , in which he explains where we now are in relation to the common security and defence policy .
that would get you to the moon , and most people now would like you to stay there .
you and your success@@ ors will be manda@@ ted by the Council only on paper .
it is essential that it does that as otherwise , we will end up fragmented again .
let us change this .
I am convinced that we must prepare common European Union rules .
the report is non @-@ partis@@ an and balanced and therefore , we must create the conditions necessary for implementing its recommendations .
this paragraph - carefully wor@@ ded though it may be - suggests that this is a desired outcome .
I am voting in favour of the Lehne report regarding the accounts of micro @-@ enterprises because I support active measures for de @-@ bureaucra@@ tisation and those that support small and medium enterprises , which , in Portugal and in Europe , are responsible for the greatest amount of job creation .
I also welcome the decision of the European Council for its greater strategic realism , which provides it with greater clarity and fewer but quanti@@ fied objectives .
I voted against this resolution because it does not place enough emphasis on the objective of full employment .
this impetus towards structural reform is reflected in the &apos; 2020 strategy &apos; proposed by the Commission .
according to the latest information , so far , only the Palestinian side has complied , which is a great shame .
the absence of freedom of speech , problems with registering political and even social organisations and the use of State media for propaganda purposes are symp@@ to@@ matic of excessively authoritarian functioning of the State .
the Single Euro Payments Area ( SEPA ) is a concept whose introduction will make everyday life easier for millions of Europeans .
the idea that China , which is the largest source of counterfeiting in the world , will sign up to a negotiated agreement later is unrealistic .
as for the reduction of nuclear arsen@@ als , the priority is to continue to reduce the two main arsen@@ als , that is , those of Russia and of the United States , which hold 95 % of the world &apos;s existing nuclear weapons .
Mr President , a while ago , US Secretary of State , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton , stated in an interview how difficult her job was and said that it was about moving from one crisis to the next .
the Arctic is being transformed from an out@@ post to the centre of interest of countries seeking new shipping routes , endless sources of natural wealth and stocks of fish .
I believe that we should implement targeted policies towards Russia in order to avoid a competitive race .
Europe must actively involve itself here .
it is therefore our personality , our most genuine personality .
is this being condemned ?
besides , it is in their interest .
I have a final thought : I would like to remind the Council that , in its own conclusions in June 2009 , it said that the future of political dialogue with the Cuban authorities was dependent on progress being made , in particular , on human rights .
one of the things that resolution asked for was the possibility of establishing a clear legal basis in this area .
( el ) Thank you , Minister , for your reply .
a great deal has happened and a great deal has changed since the 1990s , and we need to move forward towards this new agreement , in which we are ambitious .
the draft conclusions to be debated at the Council meeting will include the subject of financing , although this matter will be approached with due caution .
I think it is one of the most important challenges , as mentioned in the communication .
the Commission must co@@ finance as many large @-@ scale projects as possible in order to facilitate the use of smart me@@ tering and smart networks as standard , including in Member States which still do not have these technologies .
it is absolutely necessary for mankind that the world &apos;s remaining oil reserves be managed very wisely , which means , first and foremost , very spar@@ ingly .
the main sources , as I said in my introduction , will have to come from where the main sources are , and that is industry and the Member States .
together , we need , after the visit by the Commissioner - whom I sincerely thank for going and seeing for himself the scale of the disaster , and I know that he too has been deeply affected by it - unite our efforts to improve the use of this fund , so that progress can be made more quickly .
I would like to express my respect and gratitude to all the professionals and volunteers who have contributed to the rescue and reconstruction effort in the affected areas , and I would like to express my particular condolences to the families of the victims .
let us , however , show solidarity with Chile , today , and remember that the people there are still suffering from a lack of hygiene supplies and a lack of access to drinking water , as well as a lack of food , medicines and blan@@ kets .
in writing . - ( PT ) After Haiti &apos;s earthquake , we are confronted again with a terrible catastrophe , with 800 confirmed victims and damage totalling to approximately 15 % of Chile &apos;s GDP .
in writing . - W@@ hile we recognise that Cuba is a Communist ty@@ rann@@ y and while we want to see Cuba transformed to a peaceful democratic state , we do not recognise the EU in this process .
for this reason I urge a new approach on energy policy , one that is based on clean energy , more efficient use of the natural resources at our disposal and heavy investment in research and more environmentally @-@ friendly technologies so that we can maintain European competitiveness and allow job creation within a framework of an innovative and sustainable economy .
over the years and on a number of occasions , including at the latest Association Council with Israel last June and in the Foreign Affairs Council conclusions of December 2009 , the EU has consistently called on those holding Mr Shalit to release him without delay .
without human rights there is no rule of law or democracy .
even more important is the fact that an execution is irreversible ; there is no way back .
we also particularly note the further views expressed by three of the five judges who found that the death penalty was in line with the Constitution .
I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for the invitation for me to address the sitting of the Pan @-@ African Parliament which will be held in three weeks &apos; time .
no .
( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is quite clear - and it has already been stated , Mr Langen - that Greece must do its own ho@@ mework .
( es ) Madam President , I think we are all aware that five hundred million members of the public will be following the European Council to be held next week with unusual attention .
this is exactly what the Commission has in mind and these very proposals will come very soon .
particular focus should be on encouraging the participation of lower socio @-@ economic groups , as they are the most likely to be excluded from the digital society .
furthermore , I wish to recall here the names of Mr Lamassoure and Mr Ma@@ yer , because it was they who drew up the Citizens &apos; Initiative proposal , a popular initiative that is today incorporated into the treaties .
for example , I would like to point out that the costs involved in having a no@@ tary valida@@ te the signatures must be reasonable .
rather , I have two requests to make of you , when you now take this Regulation into its final phase .
it is clear that there are different systems for the verification of signatures in the Member States .
in the meantime , the David versus G@@ oli@@ ath struggle continues , especially with China al@@ tering the demographic balance in Tibet , which is of great concern , and , when necessary , even using military repression , as happened two years ago .
we closely followed the latest development in this dialogue , and the dialogue between the Chinese Government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama is taking its course .
...
Madam President , it has now been over a year since the aircraft maintenance firm SR Tech@@ n@@ ics announced that they were closing their facility at Dublin airport , with the loss of over a thousand jobs .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I am in a listening m@@ ood this evening .
I believe that these questions go to the very heart of the debate .
spending someone else &apos;s without their permission is not bud@@ geting , it is theft .
we should develop programmes such as those which make milk and fruit available at schools .
this reflection is certainly to be seen in the report on the European Parliament .
quality is a key issue for the entire food chain and an essential asset in supporting the competitiveness of European food producers .
we also need to make sufficient instruments available to farmers so that they can develop their own quality policy and , last but not least , we need farmers from Member States in the West and East to enjoy equal opportunities .
I should like to make a proposal for the benefit of consumers , and I am not sure whether it will be welcomed or not : why not ask consumers what they want to know ?
the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development believe that unemployment has not yet reached its peak in industrialised countries , and that soon , more than 200 million workers could be thrown into extreme poverty .
tuberculosis is a cross @-@ sector issue and it is linked to many of the public health challenges we face in the European Union , including the spread of anti @-@ microbi@@ al resistance , the lack of new effective tools to diagno@@ se and treat tuberculosis , the ste@@ ep rise of co @-@ infections such as with HIV , and the inequalities , with tuberculosis disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable groups .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur for this very comprehensive report .
I hope the Spanish and French police will bring to justice not only the kil@@ lers themselves , but also those who ordered the killing .
the euro , a stable common currency , has played the part of a real monetary shield .
certainly all this needs to change ; we also need to request this social protection indicator and not content ourselves with general calls not to do anything that will overly affect low incomes .
it is true that many are demanding economic governance .
we must not allow the financial crisis to slow down the switch to a green economy .
that is true outside the eurozone as well as inside it .
firstly , looking at the different opinions here in the House , we do not have the same opinion on the question of imbalances .
the oral amendment aims to fill this gap , and the text that I propose to the European Parliament meets this need .
( CS ) I appreciate the fact that the report on agricultural product quality policy ties in with the steps taken previously towards strengthening the policy on quality .
we voted for a Tob@@ in tax to ham@@ mer already weakened financial institutions in the west and give the money to a whole bun@@ ch of people who will probably ste@@ al it .
even though this might be only the ti@@ p of the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g of the unemployment problem in Lithuania , the financial support will help those most in need .
it suddenly became apparent that the Stability and Growth Pact , which was , in principle , to be a guarantee of meeting convergence criteria , was being disregarded by national authorities and also by EU authorities .
the EU and its Member States are significant contributors to the UN &apos;s budget .
otherwise , the legitimate call for respect for a minority is in danger of turning into a form of reverse discrimination , to the detriment of all those honest citizens who suffer the crimes and abuses of many Roma .
this is why programmes like Erasmus , especially the Erasmus scheme for young entrepreneurs , must feature as a priority which is also reflected in the 2011 budget .
in fact , I do not want to help obstru@@ ct such anti @-@ produc@@ ti@@ vist ideas as the desire to introduce &apos; ecological footprint &apos; labelling and to relocate part of agricultural production .
I voted for the Guer@@ re@@ ro Sal@@ om report , which reminds Europe of its responsibilities and demands respect for the commitments made in relation to official development assistance , in particular , the goal of contributing 0.7 % of GDP to this by 2015 .
the Bank did not see a major crisis coming , and it did not exactly sh@@ ine in terms of its regulation either , which is far from being perfect .
the parts of the text for which the European Council is competent were discussed and agreed by the European Council itself .
you all know that it took sustained work and complex negotiations to achieve the solution that ultimately proved acceptable .
Greece will have to abide by its agreements by actually implementing the reform plans .
it is ines@@ capable that we must coordinate our economic policy , our tax policy , how we draw up our public budgets , how we ensure competitiveness , with each other much more and that we must assume joint responsibility .
the first truth - and I have heard it now and again here , but not enough for my lik@@ ing - is that the problems we have to address first appeared in a country with budgetary irregularities .
I can only agree with the President of the European Council that we are very optimistic about the future of this strategy and about reaching a political agreement on the targets .
I also wanted to say to you again how much Parliament - or , at least , some of us - appreciate your being able to come here and prepare for the European Council meetings , instead of sending the Council , which is not a member of the European Council .
O@@ th@@ mar Karas is , of course , from Austria , but he was talking on behalf of Herbert Reul .
it will be an interesting balancing act to see how this will be resolved .
in view of processes which are taking place in Europe , such as the demographic decline in the indigenous population and the economic crisis , a well @-@ thought @-@ out strategic action plan has my full support .
before we begin , I would like to make an announcement .
Madam President , travellers whose holiday plans have been ru@@ ined by the volcanic ash face confusion over insurance .
I would like to underline that the Commission strongly supports the idea of common understanding , or even interinstitutional agreement between the three institutions on the delegated acts , because this will bring the necessary order into the preparation of the legislation .
they listened to us out of poli@@ teness , but the deadlines were so short that Parliament did not even sit during that period .
do we really have a water@@ tight system ?
I can also promise that all the questions that have been asked will be forwarded for a written answer because if I follow up with answers to the questions , I will definitely not be able to do so in the remaining one and a half minutes .
Madam President , this intervention - which is totally acceptable - is interfering with a debate on a subject .
this means that various items can be confis@@ cated .
Parliament is going one step further , in looking at the whole of the aviation security sector .
however , the EU refuses to make a legally binding promise for the period after 2013 and , as a result , is leaving the aforementioned countries in a state of uncertainty .
I believe this debate will help us to shape our proposal for methodology , which basically means that the Committee on Transport will have a chance to speak about it if everything goes well in May .
otherwise , all of our good intentions on safety , on job creation , are doo@@ med .
Commissioner , I wish to take advantage of this opportunity and debate to reiterate my request to the Commission to capita@@ lise to the maximum extent on the European Union &apos;s direct access to the Black Sea , a region of particular geostrategic importance .
we must therefore do everything to guarantee the competitiveness and sustainability of this sector , while not forgetting environmental and human factors .
Parliament underlines that Europeana should not just give access to public domain works , but should also include material that is still in copyright .
we also agree on the need to promote fair competition between EU and non @-@ EU producers .
to what extent is the common agricultural policy already implementing the requirements of climate protection , and what instruments can be applied in the CAP in this area in the future ?
however , it is particularly the case for small holdings , where the input of bureaucracy is sometimes quite simply disproportionate to the output represented by the money received .
we do , of course , have a problem with getting to Strasbourg and Brussels , but that is our problem and we should definitely not make a point of this .
the main thing - as everybody , including the airlines , said - was that it was very important to resume flights .
what we are now experiencing is the reality of the future of transport .
coordination between the national authorities could also be improved , but you have made the point yourself , President @-@ in @-@ Office , that Europe does not currently have the powers to make those improvements .
the final thing that they have a right to be guaranteed is State aid for the airlines .
( DE ) Mr President , as if we had been able to predict what was going to happen , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , which is also responsible for civil protection , has an own @-@ initiative report on the community approach to the prevention of natural disasters in the pipeline .
( es ) Mr President , the Commissioner talked about the procedures being absurd and obsolete .
today , yesterday &apos;s decision by the extraordinary Council of Ministers is being implemented .
they are also asking why it was not possible to get to Kra@@ ko@@ w by road or rail on Sunday , but it was possible to get to Strasbourg by these means on Monday .
bringing the single market into the 21st century is a priority for the Commission , which will make new proposals by 2012 .
they are in Strasbourg , but they are not in the Chamber where they should be .
there is still a lot to do .
if there is one area that comes under national jurisdiction , it is European air traffic control .
I would like to draw attention to the situation in the outermost regions , which , because of their permanent structural characteristics , face obstacles that have a serious effect on their economic development and therefore require special measures .
delaying the reconstruction effort would be equally irresponsible .
it is the people &apos;s perception that the aid is not reaching the places where it is needed .
they are the guarantee that , if the process is well organised , it will be successful .
in particular , it is argued that the Commission should provide at least 50 % of the staff of the External Action Service and that the service should not be subject to influence from inter@@ govern@@ menta@@ lism .
President of the Commission . - The European Digital library , addressing the challenge of putting online the colle@@ ctions of our national libraries , mus@@ eu@@ ms and their archives , this is a major task of our times digit@@ ising , making available , preserving the wealth of our culture .
respect for the political , social , environmental and cultural rights of indigenous populations must be at the heart of our transatlantic relations .
( es ) Madam President , I , too , would like to congratulate Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Ney@@ ra .
however , I believe that it is vital for us to ensure that this strategy considers including civil society and non @-@ governmental organisations in this dialogue and in the actions involved in implementing the strategy &apos;s objectives .
Kyrgyzstan has attracted quite some media and political attention , and I have followed developments closely from the beginning , making two statements , one on 7 April and the other on 8 April .
despite some discussions , the European Union still does not have a great enough presence in this region of the world .
it seems that this was an attempt to provo@@ ke an international conflict which could put the whole of Central Asia at risk .
taking into account the post @-@ Copenhagen context , adaptation to and mitigation of climate change will continue to top the agenda and will require supportive energy policies .
( DE ) Mr President , as if it were not embarras@@ sing enough that information has le@@ ak@@ ed out in the middle of the negotiations on the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ( CETA ) , the accus@@ ation has also been made that Canada is being forced to adapt its copyright laws to US and EU standards as part of the CETA and the anti counterfeit trade agreement ( ACTA ) .
this is one of the reasons for a large number of visa applications .
conflicts are now suddenly arising from the fact that operators are removing these services from the networks and are not prepared to provide the necessary support .
I travelled here with great difficulty from part of the European Union and I do not accept the response from the Commissioner that he has no time .
the communication may include proposals to reinforce the preventive and corrective arms of the Stability and Growth Pact - proposals for more effective and broader surveillance of intra @-@ euro area macro @-@ economic imbalances - and explore the options for the creation of a crisis resolution mechanism for euro area countries .
S@@ tran@@ gely , however , these same Member States seem to suffer memory lap@@ ses when it is case of shifting from words to actions and trans@@ lating their commitments to common rules into texts .
it is not just another agency .
we urgently need to speed up the implementation of these programmes .
can you answer that ?
Mr Kiri@@ lov &apos;s report is a good example of this .
the issue with which we are concerned results from the general crisis being experienced by the entire agricultural sector .
operating results fell to EUR 29 300 ( minus 45 % ) and to EUR 43 000 ( minus 18 % ) .
this is an extremely large amount of money .
this general increase is certainly impressive .
there is simply a great need for information on this directive in the European Union .
these days , when the crisis places great burdens on each citizen , we must be particularly careful in spending taxpayers &apos; money .
what is all this travel money spent on ?
I also propose shor@@ tening the deadlines .
ladies and gentlemen , we all know this little tri@@ ck : if you want to embarras@@ s someone , ask them a question with a wording like , do you still actually s@@ ma@@ ck your children ?
I also think it is important for us to look at the functioning of our procurement procedures here in Parliament .
in addition , there are fundamental principles that must be respected when personal data are transferred , such as the right of the person whose data are being processed to be informed , or the right to amend or delete such data if they are incorrect .
in this respect , I can only say that I do appreciate the new spirit of cooperation demonstrated by both the Council and the Commission to engage with this House .
it seems to us that the mandate in its present state provides solutions to many problems but leaves many others without a solution .
the resolution that we will adopt in May very much reflects those things that specifically concern the protection of our citizens , both their data and their judicial remedies , including extra@@ territorial protection , particularly when their rights could be violated extra@@ territori@@ ally .
it is extremely important to bear in mind that a short delay will be far less damaging to EU @-@ US relations than a second rejection of a draft agreement .
but it is - as the Council also said - a very important part of the negotiation .
perhaps in future , there will also be room to consider combating terrorism and crime together with our transatlantic partners in a joint institution .
I believe that the strategy adopted by Parliament on the PNR agreement demonstrates that even Parliament understood that it has more power and therefore needs to shoulder greater responsibility .
any personal data must be processed in accordance with Directives 46 / 1995 , 58 / 2002 and 24 / 2006 .
I would also like to point out that the task force that was set up to investigate the accident in Ba@@ ia M@@ are has established that the plant design was un@@ suitable for the storage and disposal of mine waste , that the authorisation of this design was not checked by the supervisory authorities and that there was insufficient monitoring of the da@@ mming and plant operation , so there were many mistakes on the part of the plant operator .
this is because the risks of cy@@ an@@ ida@@ tion are disproportionately high in third world countries in particular , where there are lower levels of environmental protection .
I see great potential for trade in this .
I have been given clear assurances that the engineers will be extremely discre@@ et and will not cause any disruption to our work .
power of legislative delegation (
under the consultation procedure of the European Parliament , I voted for the report by my excellent Spanish colleague Mr García @-@ Marg@@ allo y Mar@@ fil on the proposal for a Council Regulation concerning administrative cooperation and combating fraud in the field of value added tax .
I believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
I believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
these are : non @-@ discrimination , consultation and remedy , transparency and cost @-@ rela@@ tedness of security charges , and establishment of a supervisory authority .
if we want the port to remain competitive we need to modernise its current infrastructure and remove red tape .
I support the call for Europeana to reach a stock of at least 15 million different digit@@ ised objects by 2015 .
for these reasons , we must make every effort to create a legal framework specifying the minimum standards valid throughout the EU for all forms of livestock hus@@ band@@ ry .
these policies must be backed up by ambitious targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions with an adverse environmental impact because we are going round in a vicious circle .
I also welcome the reference to &apos; field capacity days &apos; , which helps to take into consideration the interaction between the type of soil and the climate .
moreover , this agenda will enable us to provide support for innovative research and development , thus facilitating a rapid growth in knowledge and access to heritage .
I am pleased that certain ideas to which I am very attached have been taken up : the organisation of an interinstitutional conference involving all the parties concerned , in particular the national parliaments and the national auditing bodies , with a view to reforming the discharge procedure ; the shor@@ tening of deadlines so that discharge is voted on in the year following the year under review ; and the call by the European Court of Auditors for a single opinion ( the application of the &apos; single audit &apos; rule ) on the reliability and the regularity of the underlying transactions as provided for in the Treaty .
all the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function .
the ultimate goal is to create a Euro @-@ Latin American global inter@@ regional partnership area by 2015 , in the areas of politics , economics , trade and social and cultural affairs , intended to ensure sustainable development in both regions .
terrorism has to be fought decisively , but the means employed cannot be allowed to create an environment of insecurity for citizens &apos; rights which is the very objective of terror attacks in the first place .
it is only through a consistent approach and the establishment of general principles and rules regarding the use of PNR data that we can bring an end to this impasse and move on to conclude any international agreements in this field , whether with these three countries or with the aval@@ an@@ che of similar requests that will soon come .
it poses a serious threat to the environment and human health .
moreover , we are enabling 12 countries that have the right to re@@ ar@@ range their situation in this Parliament , because they have an agreement with the entire European Union that they should have greater representation than at present , to exercise that right .
it is the European citizens who choose who they want to represent them in the European Parliament , not the governments of the Member States .
therefore , we coordinators - and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them , most especially Mr Já@@ u@@ regu@@ i and Mr Duff - have agreed on Amendment 2 , which will be voted on tomorrow .
this includes divergences in their competitiveness , as this is one crucial element that causes other types of imbalances .
we share this responsibility jointly , and time will not stand still for us .
let us take the initiative , a common initiative by this House to amend the Treaties , so that , at last , there is a European monetary fund that can actually combat speculation .
you all thought that was great , but now Spain has 20 % unemployment and it , too , is in deep trouble , as is Portugal .
I have to tell you , from the preparatory work going on with our partners in the G20 , there are many who oppose this idea ; nevertheless , I think we should pursue it .
let me make a comparison .
we must show solidarity , of course , but it must not be a one @-@ way street .
the only cul@@ pri@@ t is that political and economic philosophy which has sided with multinational companies against workers , small@@ holders and small local entrepreneurs .
in this context I consider it key to retain the strategic focus particularly on economic growth and jobs .
this requires a comprehensive initiative for these potential green jobs .
however , it is clear and necessary that we need to set up a permanent crisis resolution mechanism with strong in @-@ built condi@@ tion@@ alities and also dis@@ incentives for its use .
in the Soviet Union , it was common practice at certain times to promise the arrival of communism after ten years , regardless of the actual reality .
I know that the Spanish Presidency is doing everything in order to bring these discussions forward .
I agree in principle with this view , Commissioner , but I fear that the process , including its individual components , will not be at all easy .
we therefore feel it is entirely justified for the European Union to sign this Convention .
if we let sli@@ p this opportunity , we could find ourselves in a fragmented market for many years ; not only would this be negative for consumers and European businesses , it would also be un@@ wise given the numerous competing international initiatives .
we now want a standardised electric car in the European Union .
today , there are already hybrid cars on the market , and the hybrid model works for both electric and hydrogen vehicles : hydrogen with methane , and the others with traditional diesel or petrol components .
in order to enable Europe &apos;s car industry to retain its global competitiveness and to ensure it plays an important role in green technologies , the European Union must create a suitable framework for promoting innovative technologies , encouraging research and developing the infrastructure required to support the transition to an efficient economy based on low carbon resources and emissions .
they have been 120 years of bri@@ lli@@ ant advances , of painful set@@ backs and of te@@ na@@ cious resistance by workers .
fellow Members , let us not de@@ lude ourselves that ordinary Greeks are totally bla@@ me@@ less for what has happened in Greece .
we need a strong distribution system .
we will be able to get closer to the Commission &apos;s ambitious goal only if we join forces both ver@@ tically and horizon@@ tally .
however , it is enormously difficult to be faced with a progressive disease , and families must not be left alone in this predi@@ ca@@ ment .
the next item is the report by Mrs To@@ ia , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on mobilising information and communication technologies to facilitate the transition to an energy @-@ efficient , low @-@ carbon economy - .
the Commission appreci@@ ates that Parliament strongly underlines the joint responsibility of the EU institutions and the Member States in this respect .
the second area that was prioritised is support for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises : we increased our loans to the banks so that they continue to lend to small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , with a new product that will allow us to have better control over the actual use of the funds that we lend .
we think that this is very good .
the third operational priority is energy and the fight against climate change .
according to the Constitution , acting President J@@ ona@@ than automatically becomes the substantive President .
it should be pointed out that its three main re@@ fin@@ eries are out of action and , worse still , its oil production has decreased considerably in recent years due to the constant attacks on its oil installations .
the debate is closed .
I would prefer that we had a science @-@ based approach to animal welfare rather than one driven by emo@@ tion .
a further important step would be the transfer and dissemination of successful methods of treatment to all countries of the European Union , including centres with less experience in the treatment of cancer , in order to improve the provision of effective treatment .
to those sceptics who , in spite of all these accomplis@@ h@@ ments , continue to question the state of transatlantic relationships or my country &apos;s attitude toward a United Europe , my answer is this : even if the United States and the nations all of you represent were not united by shared values and common heritage of many millions of our citizens , myself included , our global interests alone would in@@ ex@@ or@@ ably bin@@ d us together .
we need each other more now than we ever have .
a transitional measure must in fact be found to reconcile respect for the Treaty of Lisbon with Article 5 of the 197@@ 6 Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suff@@ rage .
in writing . - ( ET ) The events that took place in Kyrgyzstan at the start of April , already a month ago , have had a serious impact both upon the country &apos;s internal governmental situation and upon international relations .
this is why we are using this motion for a resolution , which I supported , to clearly state our reservations about some of the proposals on the table .
statistical indicators for the various types of cancer are among the worst in the whole of the EU .
revenue generated by the Emissions Trading Scheme must contribute to the adaptation effort and the EU budget needs to reflect the urgency of coping with such challenges .
separate political and financial c@@ lan@@ s are forming in these countries that aim to control the distribution of European Union funds .
there were 11 Members of the European Parliament with me .
the debate on the Bauer report will be postponed until the next part @-@ session .
I would suggest the justification of exceptional oc@@ curren@@ ces fails to take into account the fiscal ir@@ responsibility that created this mess .
I believe that the European Union directive concerning the seasonal workers scheme must reach Parliament as soon as possible so that we can deal with the problems in as helpful and efficient manner as possible .
however , let us not forget that there is another directive on the table which also highlights the need to extend this leave - and I insist that it is leave and not absence due to si@@ ck@@ ness - on the grounds of equality .
from now on , self @-@ employed women and the spouses and de facto partners of self @-@ employed workers have the right to maternity pay , identical in duration and remuneration to that of sal@@ ari@@ ed workers .
there is just one amendment .
the movement towards nearly zero energy cost in buildings means that the bar has been raised even higher for buil@@ ders than hitherto planned when discussing passive house technologies .
only if we increase the absorption level of the 4 % ERDF allocation earmarked for energy efficiency in buildings during the 2010 @-@ 2013 period will we be able to ask later on for a significant increase in this rate for the 2014 @-@ 2020 financial period .
the work that we have carried out in Parliament to date has certainly allowed us to broaden the original scope , introducing standards for other labelling requirements that we consider absolutely indispensable .
it is very important and absolutely right .
it is definitely an extremely sensitive and important piece of information , and it is important because the European Union has become an added value , the European Union guarantees safety and protection for consumers .
perhaps in future , however , people will simply need to delete their RFID number from Google street view .
we consider it essential to simplify standards and achieve greater legal certainty .
the debate is closed .
we are all aware of increased competences , but more competences do not necessarily require more spending .
that committee has very many legislative tasks under the codecision , or ordinary legislative , procedure .
thirdly , the necessary legal flexibility to carry out the development through an alternative technical scenario would be foreseen and I believe that we all agree on the rationale of this .
we need to be cautious about financial aid for Member States that take in refugees for the first time , particularly due to comparative injustice .
we have proposed a temporary suspension mechanism in the Dublin Regulation and we have established the European Support Office that will open in Malta later this year .
our group fully supports this compromise , because it is very important and obvious that the economic and social development of the EU &apos;s outermost regions is greatly determined by their periph@@ ery , difficult climate and geograph@@ y and economic dependence on a short range of goods and services .
that is why - and I am also answering Mr Ti@@ ro@@ li@@ en here - we have not introduced other amendments .
14 .
the European Union &apos;s farmers should be able to spend more time in the field again , rather than behind a des@@ k .
issues relating to immigration and , especially , the right to asylum are particularly sensitive .
2 .
this is one of the eligible criteria under the ER@@ F .
if the EU really wants to spend further millions , they should be spent on border protection or on benefiting indigenous families .
from this point of view , for the future of both our education system and our economic system , which is made up almost entirely of SMEs , one hopes that the need to strengthen the connection between institutions , particularly vocational training institutions , and the world of enterprise , will be recognised .
that is a long @-@ term struggle , but it is something worth fighting for .
as for questions of organisation and structures of cooperation in the area of young people , we should be more clear and specific .
while respecting state prerogatives , I believe there is a need not only to formulate a minimum standard of protection for self @-@ employed women @-@ mothers , as well as for assisting spouses and recognised life partners , but also to make their degree of protection equal to that of women @-@ mothers who are employed , as opposed to self @-@ employed .
origin mark@@ ings are essential to ensure transparency , safety and information for European citizens and , at the same time , to give our enterprises clear , common rules .
I voted against Mrs Trü@@ pel &apos;s report .
for these reasons , it is necessary to take account of the implications for prices when reforming the CAP ; that is , compar@@ ing the place of production to the place where the direct prices are recorded .
the European Court of Justice has examined a disproportionate number of infringement cases in the area of public procurement , indicating that many Member States have strugg@@ led to comply with the public procurement directives .
yet Mrs Kel@@ ler &apos;s report talks , for example , of a developed services market and clear competition rules as obstacles to meeting the Millennium Development Goals .
standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation - Action plan on organ donation and transplantation ( 2009 @-@ 2015 ) ( debate )
however , the scope of the proposal is limited to quality and safety as stipulated in the public health article of the treaty .
I really do not believe that we need to harmonise the differing systems .
( PL ) I am pleased that the question of organ donation and transplantation is a priority for the Spanish Presidency , because it can be said that this is a matter of life and death .
what does this mean ?
( it ) Madam President , Mr López Garrido , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this membership is surely a sign of one of the European Union &apos;s missions : the mission to defend and promote human rights .
( es ) Madam President , I would like to clarify two things .
the EU &apos;s accession to the ECHR will supplement the level of protection established by the Treaty of Lisbon through the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which has binding legal force .
whatever happened to the agreement being negotiated by Frontex with Turkey today ?
we have to build this mutual trust with the legislation and with the measures to boost the rights of citizens in all our Member States , so that the judges also implement the rules we have been looking for and , yes , we are advancing very quickly on this .
I announced that when I appeared before you on 13 January , and this is precisely the principle that will guide my action .
Member of the Commission . - The most recent edition of Eurostat crime and criminal justice statistics that was published date back to 29 May ; it covers the period from 1998 to 2007 and it does not indicate the increase described by the honourable MEP .
you recently told us in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , when you came and updated us on matters within your jurisdiction , that the final agreement with Turkey on illegal immigration issues was , as you said today , making good progress and was close to being w@@ rap@@ ped up .
the Commission has also drawn up a series of programmes that offer financial support to help small and medium @-@ sized enterprises to gain access to capital that they need to develop their activities .
furthermore , this point was emphasised more recently in the Protocol on Services of General interest .
that is why I would be strictly against any principle that would restrict the concept of social housing to only the poorest groups in society , especially with respect to the diversity of European countries and the principle of subsidiarity .
what measures are planned for offshore oil exploitation at greater dep@@ ths and , in particular , in the F@@ ar North ?
( ga ) Madam President , it is good that we are discussing this important issue but , at the end of the day , I do not know what will come of our talks or what effect we will have on large companies - the oil companies who own the oil wel@@ ls which caused this damage and this disaster .
further areas where we have recognised the importance of greater cooperation include the acceleration of the Single European Sky initiative and the creation of a mobility action plan to help the EU cope better during such crises .
we are a hi @-@ tech location , we have a lot of opportunities , and researchers in Germany , for example , have called for a specialised monitoring network for those aero@@ sol@@ s , those min@@ us@@ cu@@ le items , that volcanic ash contains .
finally , it is important to realise that current legislation was put in place to stop airlines cancel@@ ling flights because it suited them , but we are now in a position where airspace is closed and airlines cannot fly .
in recent days , we have seen that it is clearly not only in the financial sector that major speculation takes place but that a few of the airlines , too , are prepared to ga@@ mble with the safety of passengers , at least in words - though lu@@ ck@@ ily not yet in actions .
we have no reports of other forms of transport being used to bring people home .
ten days ago , the European Union took bold and necessary decisions to safeguard financial stability in Europe .
so that is the first assurance we should give them : that their savings are protected .
it has been a tradition for us for many years .
those speeches did , indeed , run over by some seconds .
the fact is that the European currency simply cannot be a hard currency in the long term , because it has brought together very different national economies , some of which are in a weak position , under the same umbrella of monetary policy .
is it Europe@@ anist rhetoric if we complain of errors in the construction of the euro , for which there are still no common fiscal and pension policies ?
( PT ) Mr President , several colleagues from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) have already drawn a very complete picture of the situation .
the Commission has simply forgotten to include objectives to strengthen small and medium @-@ sized companies in this programme .
please read those 10 pages of the communication on reinforcing economic governance in Europe .
the report spe@@ l@@ ls out exactly the important contribution made by the Structural and Cohesion Funds to Europe &apos;s economic life and in achieving the objectives which have been presented to us as part of the EU 2020 Agenda .
it might be said we are in a significantly better position than last year , because then we did not grant discharge until November .
Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is naturally present in all meat .
however , past experience is less encouraging than was indicated yesterday by several Members during the debate .
energy efficiency ratings will also be displayed on all advertising containing information on energy consumption or which relates to product prices .
however , the principle of not paying for organs will not prevent live donors from being compensated , provided that such compensation is strictly limited to covering the costs and loss of income resulting from the donation .
doubts persist about the possibility of using un@@ pac@@ ked re@@ constituted products , compromising the information necessary for the consumer , as well as about the effectiveness of banning the use of these products in restaur@@ ants and other public establishments that serve food .
in Romania , 13 people on the transplant waiting list die every day due to the lack of donors .
therefore , donation should be as accessible as possible - promotion may often be effective .
politically , I fundamentally object to the driving mo@@ tive of EU accession to ECHR as &apos; a move forward in the process of European integration &#91; involving &#93; one further step towards political union &apos; .
the first is to maintain support measures until the recovery has been consolidated .
with regard to several of these issues , which have already been considered in the legislative debate , I truly hope that Parliament and the Council will be able to rapidly overcome their differences with regard to the texts under discussion .
it clearly explains that the Stability and Growth Pact criteria do need to be applied , but that if they are applied solely to expenditure , through cuts in expenditure , this will almost certainly lead to a recession .
these are the hopes that have been for@@ ged by a siz@@ eable majority of the Members on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , leaving aside the si@@ re@@ n calls of those who want to return the &apos; every man for himself &apos; idea , thus destroying solidarity with all .
I would love to see Europe pione@@ er a different type of consumption , one that is based on the knowledge triangle , on sustainable development , a Europe that is capable of developing production conditions and products which are of interest to consumers , which are created with them , a Europe which is focused on quality and no longer on quantity for quantity &apos;s sake .
it has been a very interesting report to work on .
the quanti@@ fied targets for this 2020 strategy - increasing the employment rate , reducing the poverty rate , and so on - are just pi@@ ous hopes , because they use the same model as the Lisbon Strategy , which failed .
that alone will provide our successful exit from the crisis in the long term and regional policy can make a significant contribution to that .
given my limited time , I would just like to make three brief points .
as it states in the report , an assessment is required of the impact of the Cohesion policy &apos;s expenditure on regional development , based on specific indicators .
it would also make the EU 2020 strategy relevant to individuals and citizens right across Europe .
that has to be our starting point .
perhaps nation states should encourage , as far as states can , a rise in the birth rates of their populations .
however , if the coordination of budget policies means overriding national parliaments so as to put their citizens on a star@@ vation diet , then I fear that that might be a fine EU idea which will itself end up star@@ ving to death .
in Finland , we have an excellent example of cooperation between business and universities , the A@@ al@@ to University , named after the famous Finnish archite@@ ct , Al@@ va@@ r A@@ al@@ to .
if business and universities cooperate , we cannot assume that one will necessarily learn from the other , because one is training those whom the other might some@@ day employ in their company .
neither is there mention of any kind of system for education and training which would allow those shortages to be reduced .
the dialogue between the academic community and business , which is intended to modernise universities in Europe , should take account of their present condition , which is adapted to the Bologna process , and should also take account of the economic challenges related to innovation .
I would like to take this opportunity to ask you all to try and speak more slowly , because our estee@@ med interpreters are constantly sending me S@@ OS messages telling me that they are unable to follow us when we speak very fast .
this is because the Balkan states as a whole - including Bulgaria - are a vulnerable part of the European Union , as the current economic crisis has shown us .
nuclear power production does not generate carbon dioxide emissions , not to mention that monthly household energy bills are lower in Member States where nuclear power is used .
Fourthly , progress needs to be made on creating a positive relationship which avoid@@ s obstacles and clashes and which instead seeks out synergies between the U@@ f@@ M and the Mediterranean structures of the European Union .
looking ahead to the Barcelona Summit in June , I think that it is very important for us to reaffirm Parliament &apos;s commitment to the success of this project in an area which , as we are all aware , is located at the crossroads of three continents and which is obviously important to Europe in geostrategic and cultural terms .
the resolution on the Union for the Mediterranean is an important political act which , after more than two decades of considerable energy devoted to eas@@ tw@@ ard expansion , draws the attention of the Council , the Commission and the Member States to the need to modify their geopolitical outlook and place the promotion of relations with countries of the Mediterranean basin at the heart of their foreign policy , starting with the adoption of a common position on the Middle Eastern conflict .
I would like to see a joint solution found in the near future for the two problems which Turkey is or may be partly responsible for , in other words , those relating to its neighbour Armenia , on the one hand , and to Nag@@ or@@ no @-@ Karab@@ akh , on the other .
just as importantly , we need more stability in Georgia , because if Georgia is broken up , as many people in Moscow want , then the whole region will be de@@ stabilised .
I hope that the competing South Stream project will have more success , so that the resources from the Caspian area are not lost to China .
however , one thing is completely clear . there has been a move away from the content which enjoyed general consensus in February and , given the serious crisis , this is not surprising .
our cities are already gro@@ an@@ ing under the problems of mass , uncontrolled immigration .
links between universities and businesses need to be strengthened in order to make it easier for students to access work and for businesses to accept un@@ typical careers more easily .
in this context , the strategy for EU intervention must ensure support to encourage the creation of new jobs and sustainable industry in the areas affected by the decommissioning .
this is crucial for economic development and growth in the different regions .
we completely disagree with the guidelines established in this report , which essentially aim to increase the economic domin@@ ation of the EU &apos;s big companies over the southern part of the Mediterranean ; access to , and control of , natural resources , energy in particular ; the exploitation of labour power ; and the repression of immigrants .
the cle@@ arest manifes@@ tation of this is the Pakistani Taliban , a terrorist movement whose intentions were again made only too clear recently in the , mer@@ ci@@ fully failed , Times square bomb plo@@ t in New York .
let us want something !
we Europeans therefore have the right to tell others not to take that path .
among the dead , there are medical doctors and children .
Burma will need our help , not least to develop a strong civil society and a legal system which should focus on transitional justice for the many crimes committed by the junta .
that , I am afraid , is the problem , but your comments have been noted .
as you know , this House , together with the Council , adopted new driving time rules , introduced modern , reliable digital recording equipment and adopted a specific directive on enforcement .
it would also encourage social dumping and the deregulation of employment due to the increased numbers of drivers who fal@@ sely state that they are self @-@ employed .
we believe that there are several reasons for their inclusion .
it would be absurd and incomprehensible .
I would like to draw attention to the fact that &apos; false &apos; self @-@ employed drivers weaken the overall labour market , and the main problem is that in practice , it is difficult to prove &apos; false &apos; self @-@ employment .
it is thus regrettable that the amendments tabled would undermine the aim of having measurable criteria as a basis for enforcement .
consumers have different requirements and we need to try to satisfy as many of those as possible .
at the very least , they should appear on packaging labels in order for us to know what we are buying , when , for example , we purchase bis@@ cu@@ its , cho@@ co@@ late , pota@@ to cris@@ ps or ice crea@@ m .
for the same reasons , I am opposed to labelling of mandatory daily in@@ take .
on the issue of the claims made and the appro@@ vals mentioned by Mr Davies , I must state that , under Article 13 , we did have about 44 000 claims by Member States .
with that history , it takes time to regain trust , and lack of trust contributed to why , in the recent trou@@ bles , Member States had to put a lot of cash on the table .
those who want to vote &apos; yes &apos; press the &apos; yes &apos; but@@ ton , those who want to vote &apos; no &apos; press the &apos; no &apos; but@@ ton , and those who wish to abstain from voting press &apos; 0@@ &apos; .
of course , the USA played a huge part - and I would like to thank them for that - as did Canada , Australia and New Zealand , but it is important to point out that , in the period 2006 onwards , the European Union is actually funding 57 % of the Fund .
I do not think that in our Parliament , it should happen to be different .
however , it gri@@ ev@@ es me that today , he has been the victim , first of a computer error which wrongly counted 168 votes , and that then those 168 votes were added by the person cha@@ iring the proceedings to the overall total , which has been the cause of general controversy .
as it is an exceptional measure , the EGF must have autonomous financing , and it is a serious mistake for EGF financing , a conting@@ ency measure , to be provided to the detriment of the European Social Fund or any other structural fund .
the aim of the EGF is to help workers who are victims of the relocation of companies , and it is fundamental in facilitating their future access to new employment .
this compromise with the Council is an effort to improve the situation ; therefore , I vote for it .
I would urgently advise Deutsche Bah@@ n to look into taking legal action against this decision .
on the other hand , it is also essential to increase rates of EU cofinancing for countries with weaker economies , particularly for social programmes and productive investment .
combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important .
the rich countries are responsible for the current financial , economic and climate crises , but the developing countries are the most affected by global warming .
Mr President , I just have a brief supplementary question .
I would also like to know whether you are debating urgent improvements to technical inspections on platforms .
the Commission does not enjoy any discretion in the level of corrections , which follows established principles to ensure equal treatment to all Member States .
moreover , it should be inclusive , above all , for the more than 20 million Europeans who feel excluded because they have been shut out of the labour market by the brutal crisis .
therefore , a rating may be legitimate , but is it legitimate to issue ratings as the agencies do ?
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , not so long ago , voices were raised to say that rating agencies should not have downgra@@ ded Greek and other bonds .
not even an impressive and unprecedented EUR 750 billion package seemed to convince them .
at this point , I should like to add an element , so that we can try to understand if the operating framework for these agencies is ultimately clean , if it is transparent and if it is form@@ alised .
it laid down harmonised rules as to what European companies must publish when issuing securities , with one major innovation .
this was based on the notion that all investors should be treated equally .
everybody who was part of the conciliation is aware that this was necessary and that is why we should defend it .
while respecting and understanding the differences between regions , we must strive with might and main for the elimination of negative con@@ tras@@ ts and gross social dis@@ proportions .
we need solutions to resolve the social crisis as well , which has evol@@ ved as a result of the economic and financial crisis .
what we are trying to do now is set up a basis for what I would call critical engagement .
it can also provide training and retraining of staff to facilitate the transition from institutional care to community @-@ based services .
since 1999 , the year when this approach started , we have already had 84 studies within the Community , with approximately two million involved .
I think that this compe@@ ls us to stop and think , which is what we are doing in this report .
it is almost half a year since Commissioner Reding was appointed .
in summary , there are three areas in which I want EU action to be very effective and very tangible , although when I speak of three areas , that does not mean that they are the only three areas , but I think we could perhaps make out of those three areas our main goals .
for instance , a woman who has not received child maintenance payments for months needs information on what to do , whom to contact for help .
I am sure there are many dossiers , perhaps not all but certainly quite a few , with the scope to include equality concerns .
aware of all these dangers , let us try to apply horizontal solutions in order to maintain the level of employment from before the crisis and not allow a downward trend .
we need to remember , however , that research cannot solve everything .
( PL ) I would like to thank Mr Coelho , who is our parliamentary Schengen specialist , and who has , indeed , done a huge amount of work in this area .
( the sitting was closed at 2@@ 4.@@ 00 )
I will not go into detail now but I want to say that we are committed to using this opportunity to reinforce economic governance at European level .
one approach which will help to ensure that they lose and that we win is to cla@@ mp down on the current tendency for renation@@ alisation in Europe .
the treaties are not giving us everything we want .
on longer @-@ term challenges , the European Council should re@@ visit the planned Europe 2020 strategy .
who is paying the price now ?
( SK ) We are debating the way out of the relatively complex economic and financial situation in Europe .
only Community solutions can lead the European Union out of the crisis ; national e@@ go@@ ism and intro@@ version only aggra@@ vate the problems .
I think that this is a fundamental change , which features both in the conclusions for the Council meeting tomorrow and in the motion for a European Parliament resolution .
thank you .
nevertheless , I believe that there are some signs of hope .
( DE ) Madam President , many things were not achieved at the EU @-@ Russia Summit .
in writing . - Russia still sees the West as primarily responsible for the collapse of the Soviet Union and the chaos of the Y@@ el@@ tsin years .
that is much more transparent for consumers .
it is not for you : you are not a country .
I therefore call on Parliament and the Commission to consider the possibility of creating a joint research programme for south @-@ western Europe , focusing on areas of great importance , such as the sea and energy sources from the sea , with a view to the sustainable development of the European Atlantic axis and its neighbouring regions .
in writing . - easy vote as well , the one on the European Earth observation programme ( GMES ) ( 2011 @-@ 2013 ) ( G@@ lan@@ te ) , text that we have supported too .
the Estonian example demonstrates that , thanks to balanced and focused policies , it is possible to achieve compliance with all the requirements for convergence .
in writing . - This was not at all a controversial report for our group , which is why we supported it with no major debates .
this situation is all the more unacceptable in that it seems to reflect the defence of market interests over the interests of the people .
yes , there have been reports that lorry drivers have breached EU safety and work regulations .
for the first time , we have uniform regulations on food labelling throughout the entire internal market , with no possibility of individual countries going it alone .
we also rejected the idea of special national provisions , because the labelling system should , as far as possible , be standardised .
they can opt for local and regional products and avoid unnecessary food miles .
I listened with interest to the statements by Commission President Barroso and President Van Rompuy .
I also agree with the importance of the requirement that the EU budget should reflect the need to fund the transition towards an environmentally sustainable economy .
we have to answer these questions together .
surely they had not expected to be received on board with tea , coff@@ ee and ca@@ ke ?
suspend the EU @-@ Israel Association Agreement until something is actually done .
with 95 % of its industrial establishments closed , 42 % of its workforce unemployed , and 75 % of its population in a situation of food insecurity , the Gaza Strip depends almost entirely on humanitarian aid .
I welcome the steps taken by Israel to set up an inquiry commission , but I feel that they do not go far enough .
this is why we are using the resolution which we drafted to urge the Commission to publish a detailed report on the trade in goods used for torture .
with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , I also feel we are bound to make the most of the new External Action Service by making sure it encom@@ passes organisations and figures distinguished by their respect for human rights .
I would once again like to make it clear at this point that Parliament and your c@@ abinet worked very well together .
the facts are very clear , and British and Swedish experts participated in the international investigation into this incident .
people are not even taking part in our programmes because they do not have the necessary expertise .
this country needs a complete education system which is worthy of its great history , from multinational nur@@ series through to a new European university .
secondly , we must emphasise the bilateral nature of these agreements .
on the independence of essential functions , the Commission has already made its position very clear in its communication of May 2006 .
unfortunately , the Commission , the Council and the majority of this Parliament have dog@@ matically chosen to make rail transport not an instrument of freedom , but a commodity like any other , left to the mer@@ cy of the market and of competition .
the debate is closed .
indeed , it must be our primary objective for the future .
as Europeans , we should always be prepared to join forces and help those who are in need .
we would also like to help them from our national budgets , but our national budgets are exhausted because we have had to deal with the full scope of the economic and financial crisis , and they are exhausted because we were committed to follow the rules of the Growth and Stability Pact .
these areas face a daily struggle with difficulties which are the result of specific features of their ter@@ rain and their poor infrastructure .
it is indispensable for all media to broadcast in ways that are accessible and un@@ impe@@ ded ( with sub@@ ti@@ tles , accompanied by clearly visible visual information ) and to help people at times of natural disasters ; furthermore , mobile telephone operators should cooperate in providing their subscri@@ b@@ ers with preferably free and immediate information tailored to individual preferences and needs .
the principle of mutual recognition , which is a fundamental one , requires mutual trust , and trust in the legal systems of other countries .
to Spain : thank you , mu@@ ch@@ as gra@@ ci@@ as .
the attitude in this House to the statements made today - namely , that we are all satisfied - sur@@ prises me .
( DE ) Mr Schulz , we are not in the German B@@ unde@@ sta@@ g here , and neither are we in Germany .
however , for us MEPs from other Member States , it is very important to watch what is happening in Spain , too , because the Presidency is not only about leadership , but is also about leadership of the whole European Union .
it may be that the objective , which is entirely legitimate , is not shared .
it em@@ powers a European public authority , namely Europol , to verify that each and every request is tailored as narro@@ w@@ ly as possible in order to minimise the amount of data requested .
the agreement is neither ideal nor perfect , but I think this is the best possible agreement we were able to reach in such a short time .
the effectiveness of these data transfers in the fight against terrorism has been highlighted many times these last few months .
it should not be used as an excuse for the EU institutions , the Commission , to have access to the national budgets of Member States before these national budgets are presented to the parliaments of those countries .
Mr President , the Committee on Petitions is one of the great successes of the European Union .
the European Union itself cannot accede to the Paris Convention , as only sovereign states can be parties there@@ to .
our every effort to strengthen Frontex is therefore to be welcomed .
the Chief Official ethics Commission of the Republic of Lithuania has issued a public ad@@ mon@@ ition to Mr T@@ oma@@ š@@ ev@@ ski on the basis of the Code of Conduct for State politicians .
it seems to me , however , that this cooperation could very easily take place without the interference of the European Commission .
our SMEs , which make up 99 % of Europe &apos;s productive fabric , need freedom from bureaucracy .
this report aims to improve the rights of bus and coach passengers , an ambition which I welcomed by voting in favour .
these include : the liability of operators , which much be brought into line with that in other modes of transport , with particular attention to assistance and advance payments in case of accidents ; the rights of passengers in case of cancel@@ lations and delayed depar@@ tures ; and the rights of persons with disabilities or reduced mobility .
in turn , Member States should take the necessary measures to ensure the effective and harmonious deployment and use of transport modes and services in the Community : the updating of road transport information and cooperation between management centres .
greater efforts and innovative ways of investment are needed that will make it possible to finish a trans @-@ European transport network and ensure the sustained development of transport in the medium and long terms .
I feel that we cannot be re@@ signed to losing young Europeans to social exclusion .
the requirement for this is that inter@@ ns must work under fair terms where the focus is on the provision of training and not on replacing permanent employees .
we would also like to introduce a &apos; European Youth Guarantee &apos; so that young people do not have to remain unemployed for more than four months and in order to guarantee them high quality intern@@ ships as well as a decent wage .
I today voted in favour of the Grun@@ y own @-@ initiative report on atypical employment contracts in the EU .
the production of bio @-@ waste is inevitable by definition , but what can be avoided is its inadequate management , particularly in the case of it being deposi@@ ted in landfills , which constitute the main source of gases em@@ itted into the ozone layer .
they constitute an answer to the challenges that our single currency is facing in Europe , but they also have an important impact in the global financial markets .
I commend the Commission &apos;s focus in addressing the key issues of concern and believe that although by very different methods , we will soon end up with a global financial system which is safer and better serves our economy .
( applause )
this was another case where we had to fight against the suggestions being watered down .
it is not in our hands to prevent the bankruptcy of banks , but rather to ensure that their re@@ organisation or possible win@@ ding up are carried out in an orderly fashion , limiting the collateral effects in the rest of the system and , above all , preventing the taxpayer from being the one who foo@@ ts the bill for the resulting crises .
any other situation , without regulations , would pose a danger to the euro , a single EU and democracy .
please , next week , keep an open dialogue during the negotiations at ECOFIN .
however , precedence is given to national supervisory authorities , which are finally cooperating with each other and keeping each other fully informed , thereby preventing risky transactions .
I would like to end by expressing my thanks to the rapporteurs : my com@@ patri@@ ots Mr T@@ remo@@ sa and Mr García @-@ Marg@@ allo , Mr Gieg@@ old and Mrs G@@ oul@@ ard , Mr S@@ kin@@ ner and Mrs Ferreira .
this sounds a really good idea , but it does not by any means get rid of the basic problem .
risk management arrangements should be reviewed in detail by the Supervisor , and companies should establish an internal procedure to address problems and conflicts which may occur between risk management and its operational units .
as we lost , we have had to make compromises .
Mr Chris@@ ten@@ sen , you stressed the need for transparency .
subject : full implementation by Turkey of the Association Agreement and the Addi@@ tional Protocol
Member of the Commission . - R@@ espe@@ ct for human rights and fundamental values and adherence to democratic standards are at the heart of the European Neighbourhood Policy .
well , these are products that were not on the EU market before 15 May 1997 because they had not yet been inven@@ ted or were not yet recognised as food in the EU , for example .
we want the Commission to present a legislative proposal without delay , and we are really pushing for this .
had the precautionary principle existed a few decades ago , the first heart transplants would never have taken place and hundreds of sick people would not have been cu@@ red .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to speak about the use of nanomaterials in foods as there is a great deal of uncertainty among citizens about this .
I have heard many arguments in this debate .
huge efforts have been made by all concerned to prevent this text from being sent back to the conciliation stage .
however , we will only meet this challenge if we implement best available techniques in as many branches of industry as possible .
we must not prevent other countries that are currently poor from exporting and trading .
five years ago , I took the case to Louis Michel , the Commissioner at the time , and said we needed a measure like this .
furthermore , in order to guarantee that this regulation is effective , we should emphasise the need for regular controls and a system of stringent , deterrent penalties for offenders .
my own experience of witnessing contractors &apos; attempts to in@@ ject di@@ r@@ ty water under the ground to satisfy EU rules tells me what problems lie ahead .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , agricultural policy needs a coherent framework .
it is absolutely essential that farming and the CAP are seen as part of the solution to meeting these objectives , and not part of the problem .
although the most important task of agriculture is to provide food , the importance of agriculture to the public interest is increasingly recognised , whether this manifes@@ ts itself in social policy , environment or culture .
many poultry farmers , particularly in Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y , paid the price for that deal .
this will be the fourth EU @-@ Brazil Summit at which we will aim to take stock of progress in our relations and discuss the main global challenges .
Mr President , I am extremely concerned that the Commission is a@@ da@@ man@@ t in continuing trade talks based on a mandate from 1999 , which will undoubtedly have a negative impact on agriculture across the EU .
the joint debate is closed .
this sensitivity is taken into consideration in the implementation of the common commercial policy .
another way to enable European fisheries to survive would be through better marketing .
4 .
Mr President , there are many reasons to vote against this resolution but too many to cover in just 60 seconds .
we are the fourth @-@ largest military power on the planet and the fifth @-@ largest economy .
it is a fact that , in the wake of 11 September 2001 , no human being takes his or her security and physical safety for granted .
it is after extensive reflection that I have decided to vote in favour of this new agreement , because a legal framework for the fight against terrorism is necessary and because we are eventually heading towards a future European system for data transfer control allowing data extraction on European soil .
this compromise was the subject of extensive negotiations and it currently seems satisfactory and balanced to me .
the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left has always been against the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo because it represents an act that is against international law .
we should be concerned with the people , their illness and the suffering it causes them , and the impact of this on society , particularly in the least developed countries .
however , we take the view that nothing must be done to im@@ pair the operational effectiveness and security of our armed forces .
I voted against Amendment 69 of this proposal because it brings the global construction of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) under threat and en@@ dangers the interests of Portuguese agriculture , as it proposes cancel@@ ling funding for structural measures without guaranteeing that these will be replaced using the changes to the first pillar .
however , the report assumes that the problems can , to a certain extent , be solved by providing protection against competition from the outside world .
the arrest of F@@ ara@@ i Maguwu , the Director of the Centre for Research and Development , following an interview with Mr Ch@@ ik@@ ane , a monitor for the Kimberley Process , is therefore , unfortunately , just one more ep@@ iso@@ de to add to the long list of human rights abuses in that country .
the government of Zimbabwe voluntarily joined the Kimberley Process ; we must insist that the obligations that this entails be fulfilled .
that is why we have this campaign of vi@@ li@@ fication .
therefore , I would , in particular , like to urgently call on the EU emb@@ assies to take in people who manage to fle@@ e to these emb@@ assies and help them to get to safer countries and to find sufficient support there to start a new life .
( PL ) Madam President , North Korea and Cuba are the last rem@@ nan@@ ts of Communism in the world .
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see Minutes
agenda for next sitting : see Minutes
on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , the EPP always welcomes good and thorough discussions on social topics during our plenary sittings , but they have to be well prepared .
( applause )
I welcome the debate that is taking place in this House today , as it is quite clearly a display of our commitment to a fundamental value of our Union .
therefore , it is important to have an effective system for the pursuit and prosecution of criminals .
these are all very tangible things that are set out in this resolution .
the pressure to maximise extraction does not go hand @-@ in @-@ hand with measures intended to improve safety or with proper risk assessment .
the matter of species preservation - and this is my point - is not some kind of ch@@ ari@@ table institution for a few poor little bu@@ gs that we should simply manage to do without .
as Mr Mitchell bri@@ lli@@ antly put it , this wall of poverty - and , may I add , de@@ priva@@ tion - must come down .
for that reason , I believe this gives us a real opportunity to show in this House that we are serious in what we say .
recent studies show that our natural resources are seriously threatened , particularly marine areas of Mediterranean countries .
as some of you mentioned , it is truly and fundamentally a moral and ethical question but , for those who do not understand that , it is becoming more than obvious that it is an issue of our quality of life and an issue of our economic success .
we must also take the social dimension into account in the Europe 2020 strategy , which , as you know , was adopted by the European Union during the June European Council .
it therefore contains a horizontal social clause which states that the promotion of a high level of employment , adequate social protection and the fight against exclusion must guide the definition and implementation of all EU policies .
however , there are many other issues .
by supporting the free regime , we are not only sending a political message .
but we should be insis@@ tent on all of these countries reaching and maintaining high standards of passport biometric security .
it is a fact ; it is the reality .
this has also proved that the principle of conditionality used by the European Union for visa liberalisation has worked well and brought positive results .
the facts are clear .
this gives cause for concern .
for this reason , I agree that it is advisable for Parliament to be more involved in the negotiations with the aim of making the changes needed to ensure that European industry and the European economy are not at a disadvantage .
last year , we asked for proposals by the Commission for more sophisticated instruments .
on the grounds of Regulation ( EC ) No 1@@ 107 / 2006 , these two groups should be provided with assistance by the airport .
is the EU - or should I say the Commission - considering the social , and indeed economic , consequences of insisting that Ireland comply with the Stability and Growth Pact by 2014 ?
that is to say , why in@@ sure yourself or pay for any ep@@ iso@@ de of ill health , for sur@@ gical intervention , if there is no hospital , if there is no doctor , if there is no medi@@ cation ?
the third is that it causes less pollution .
that is why I support my political group , which is calling for greater visibility for the ESF , particularly to improve its uptake .
we in Northern Ireland receive significant funding from the ESF administered through the Department for Learning and Employment , and I note that in a recent House of Lor@@ ds enqu@@ iry into the ESF , it was noted the ESF continues to make a significant contribution to supporting economic growth in Northern Ireland , aimed at creating a knowledge @-@ based economy with a highly skilled and flexible workforce .
the first is to make sure there is a second chance .
as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , I think it is very important that we aim for a greater degree of harmony and synergy between regional and rural development policies in the future .
it therefore needs to be closely coordinated with the Regional Development Fund .
one of the priorities in this area is the route across the P@@ y@@ rene@@ es between France and Spain , which specifically concerns the European constituency of the South West .
the application of funds is not helped either by the fact that Latvia counts as one region .
those days were momen@@ t@@ ous for our continent and we can be proud of it and we will forever remember those days .
other states and peoples have also defended our freedom and have done everything in their power to help us to achieve unity .
it was my duty to send a message of welcome and hope to our East German friends .
in fact , you called out to vote on the original paragraph .
written explanations of vote
the EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries , so we should now grant this aid to the 7@@ 03 workers made redundant from 82 clothing industry enterprises in the region of Galicia .
in writing . - ( PT ) The EU is a space for solidarity and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) is fra@@ med within it .
this is a process which follows on from recent events with Serbia , Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
the countries mentioned have made great progress in complying with the requirements of the European Union .
in writing . - ( LV ) quite recently , more than 500 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo fell victim to a mass gang rape .
I voted for this resolution because I feel the EU should use diplomatic instruments to contribute to the abolition of the death penalty , applying pressure on government authorities to impose a moratorium on capital punishment , with a view to its complete abolition .
I have therefore voted in favour of this resolution as it is essential that we lay down strict European rules for preventing accidents on oil platforms and for the Union to strengthen legislation on environmental responsibility .
the risk of serious accidents in European Union waters is high and Europe is , quite simply , not equipped to deal with the devastating consequences of such an accident .
I agree with the appeal contained in the resolution for support for efforts to enhance synergies and links between biodiversity and climate policies .
I voted against this cover for speculation .
these data can only be seen as striking , aler@@ ting us to the urgent need for humanitarian aid to these countries to be properly directed to the area of health and the provision of basic medical care to highly deprived communities .
attracting and making the best use of these funds would have resulted in a 15 % rise in GDP over the next five years .
the EU must give the regions the opportunity to intervene with targeted subsidies aimed at re@@ popu@@ lating areas experiencing demographic decline .
the opposite action should , in fact , be taken : this fund should be closely linked to the others , particularly regional policy instruments , so as to increase its effectiveness .
however , introducing paternity leave under the maternity directive is neither in line with the overall objective we are pursuing , nor with the legal basis on which the proposal is made .
this is the debate that we will have during the vote on Wednesday .
the majority of the cases of false declarations or undeclared work that are un@@ covered concern women .
in this case , we have no alternative .
we want mothers to enjoy adequate protection ; but if such protection is carried too far , specifically for ideological reasons , this will represent a major obstacle to women &apos;s employment - which is something that we must remove , not encourage .
we must also respect the diverse social and cultural differences of various Member States .
( ga ) Madam President , we had an excellent debate here this evening and , in general , many good points were made in the Chamber .
the social agenda of the European Union includes , amongst its priorities , the need to promote policies aimed at supporting the reconciliation of the working , private and family life of women .
the call for full pay during maternity leave is also an important step in narro@@ wing the differences in income between women and men .
it is &apos; consensual &apos; democracy rather than the &apos; confli@@ ctive &apos; democracy that we have in our countries .
the oral question to the Commission by S@@ oph@@ ia in &apos; t Veld and Alexander Alvaro , on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , and Bir@@ git Si@@ p@@ pel , on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , on data transfer to the US by Member States on the basis of Memor@@ anda of Understanding - B7 @-@ 05@@ 55 / 2010 ) ,
I agree with you : I would also like that .
the Commission therefore considers this regulation to be without prejudice to any future position of the institution as regards the use of Articles 290 and 29@@ 1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union for the transposition of Regional Fisheries Management Organisation measures .
we have wonderful coastal communities that are dependent on fishing , but , as I have said here before , I have never encountered more dis@@ illusi@@ on@@ ment amongst any group of people than I have among those fishermen .
thank you , Commissioner , for your words , and I am counting on further good collaboration in the future .
( RO ) Democracy is being violated in Romania , a European Union Member State , by the actual party in government , without any fear of repercussions .
I would also like to ask all Member States to support standardisation , and my fellow Members to support this report by Mr Ko@@ ž@@ u@@ š@@ n@@ í@@ k .
as originally structured , the EEAS still suffered from a number of draw@@ backs deri@@ ving from its complex , decentralised structure , with ra@@ mi@@ fications throughout the world .
this week &apos;s work will conclude the complex work of laying the legal and budgetary foundation for the EEAS .
however , it is the intergovernmental crus@@ a@@ des and quotas all over again , and when all is said and done , candidates should ultimately be judged on their merits .
for us , there are two priorities : conflict prevention and civilian crisis management .
Mr President , while the idea of having a European External Action Service was never really welcome around Europe , the EU bureaucracy managed to sell it , saying it would be budget neutral .
I want crisis management fully in , I want human rights main@@ st@@ reamed and linked to trade , and I have sympathy with what many of our eastern European colleagues say , but do I have absolute confidence that you are creating this service fully in the spirit of the treaty ?
this criterion and competence are not mutually exclusive .
the European Commission will present a European Platform against Poverty by the end of this year , setting out concrete measures to support Member States in reaching the target of lifting at least 20 million European citizens out of poverty by 2020 .
answer : more regulations and red tape for businesses , falling most heavily on the SMEs who , between them , employ half the workforce .
the data on child poverty in my country are devastating .
the EU 2020 strategy also goes in this direction .
the number of active European citizens will drop by millions even in the next decade .
no nation , no group , no region can do it alone .
Europe &apos;s dar@@ kest chapters have been written in language such as this .
( SK ) I supported the report , although with certain reservations .
since data collection is already mandatory for statistics on other modes of transport - road , rail and via inland waterways - I think a common framework which includes the col@@ lation of maritime transport statistics is appropriate , and it can also help to ensure maximum comparability between the different modes of transport .
given that the Netherlands has submitted requests for assistance for 5@@ 12 cases of redundan@@ cy at N@@ X@@ P S@@ emi@@ conduc@@ tors Netherlands , which operates in the electronics sector , in the NUTS II regions of G@@ el@@ der@@ land and E@@ ind@@ ho@@ ven , I voted in favour of the resolution as I agree with the Commission &apos;s proposal , combined with the respective amendments introduced by Parliament .
Council Regulation ( EC ) No 10@@ 06 / 2008 concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters and the access of third country vessels to Community waters , establishes that EU fishing vessels are obliged to be in possession of a fishing permit in order to conduct fishing activities outside EU waters .
initial and ongoing training , improved information on rights and a real examination of women &apos;s professional and family life must be promoted , as opposed to these situations , because the way that women &apos;s income is considered as a second income can be misleading , as it is often the sole family income .
unfortunately , none of these new roles is accompanied by appropriate financial means .
it is true that here , obviously , I am going to limit myself to informing you of the main themes of the Council &apos;s position , and it is , of course , within the conciliation procedure , which should take place in the event of your Assembly voting for all of the amendments - one never knows - that we shall be able to ref@@ ine all the political positions .
then there is EUR 10 million for the People programme , which is intended to increase the mobility of doc@@ toral candidates and Ph@@ D students , provide the opportunity for closer cooperation with industry and modernise the EU &apos;s universities , and money for communication .
we would have liked to have seen a few different figures in parts of the agriculture budget .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
the aim of this would be to achieve real convergence , promoting the potential of each country , the sustainable use of its resources , investment in production and the creation of jobs with rights .
all these years , surely it is the dog@@ matism of the so @-@ called free market and the ambitious Lisbon strategy which have been to blame for acute unemployment and the increase in poverty and unde@@ re@@ mployment ?
( NL ) Madam President , my party does not see any need for the budget for 2011 to be any larger than the one for 2010 ; it is not necessary .
for the first budget voted on under the Treaty of Lisbon , this would send a strong political signal from our Parliament , which does not intend to make do with using its new codecision powers to manage pen@@ ury , that is , to choose which of Peter or Paul is to go without clothing .
it is , of course , the first time that we have had this new procedure following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , but I believe that all of us , right down to the real anti @-@ Europe fra@@ ctions and sceptics , have to be clear in our own minds once again , in the face of all of the criticism , including specific targeted criticism , that the European Union makes us stronger .
it is so easy to criticise the present system as being unfair , complex , and contrary to the treaties , but it is also so easy to provo@@ ke unfounded accusations if we enter into discussions on this matter .
the elimination of the re@@ ba@@ te and the creation of a new European tax - let us call it by its correct name - will not require a change in the treaty .
indeed , I think we cannot talk about the EU budget today without opening the debate both on own resources and commun@@ it@@ isation , or without mentioning certain areas of expenditure .
ladies and gentlemen , it was the citizens , the taxpayers , who paid once - will they pay a second time ?
does the Commission agree with the NGO &apos;s proposals to restrict commercial transport in the Baltic Sea ?
I therefore think that we should take account of this issue ; the appropriate budgetary solution must be found to be able to speed up this process if necessary .
the Commission is seeking to secure a level playing field throughout the world for our fisheries and the fisheries that produce the products we are obliged to import .
therefore , it should not be difficult to pay its creditors pun@@ c@@ tually .
a new rate of 1 % could be imposed for reimbur@@ sing the costs of recovering late payments - for individuals , businesses and public authorities - whereas in the event of late payments of individual instal@@ ments , the interest rate and penalties would be calculated exclusively for late payments .
the tragic event in Hungary is also a loss for Europe .
the criteria for hazardous waste definitely need to be clarified , in such a way that high al@@ kal@@ ine levels , or high ph values , are made one of them .
for a hazard not to turn into a catastrophe , the key is in monitoring , preparedness and prevention , and I could not agree more with those speakers who have ham@@ me@@ red on this point .
recently , one municipal@@ ity in the Netherlands planned to create an ethnic file , but it cancelled its project in response to the recommendation of the Dutch data protection authority .
many of us have taken note of your previous statements and have even supported you .
agenda for next sitting : see Minutes
some other matters still need to be settled .
what we are asking for is strong action based on the added value of the European project so that we can lift Europeans out of this recession and ensure that , in the future , everyone in Europe has a job , is out of poverty , and can once again have faith in the European project .
what Nicolas and Angela did - this self @-@ appointed Franco @-@ German management committee - is an assa@@ ult on the institutions of the European Union .
can you not see the danger that is threatening us today ?
I would like to thank un@@ reserve@@ dly Mrs Berès and my colleagues in the Special Committee on Financial , Economic and Social Crisis , who have shown that we in the European Parliament can reach across the party boundaries and find common solutions in the interests of Europe .
we need to intensify our integration , we need to harmonise our economic and budgetary policies more , we need European infrastructure projects in the areas of energy , transport and telecommunications .
it is a wage battle - a wage competition .
this is extremely dangerous .
Mr President , I propose that in future , we have one representative for economic issues .
the Europe of economic governance is not the Europe of two @-@ party summits : it is the Europe of institutional voices , of the European Parliament and of the public having a voice .
global economic recovery is still fragile , with the pace of the process varying from country to country .
I have named them , in particular , because they put an enormous amount of work into ensuring that we obtained a good agreement on the European External Action Service .
I really appreciate the way you exercised your chair@@ manship today , and I hope you will share your wonderful skills with other vice @-@ chairs of Parliament .
these changes mean that the European public now has a new role in relation to decision making at EU level .
France , which can pride itself on having the oldest diplomatic service in the world , will have to yet again hand over diplomatic prerogatives to a European Union whose citizens are totally indifferent to the positions it adopts .
in writing . - T@@ o those of us from the new Member States , the o@@ mission of any legally binding commitment to geographic balance in the European External Action Service is a disappointment .
struggling businesses should also carry on receiving support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund which should be permanent and have its own budget .
I welcome this Chamber &apos;s decision to follow the guidelines of the Committee on Budgets and the Member States , which are often forced into debt following excessive EU cash advances .
enabling women to reconcile their family life with their professional life , but also fulfilling gender equality objectives : that is what we are protecting today for all European women .
in the end , it is likely that the minimum leave will be the one proposed by the European Commission and supported by the MO@@ DEM delegation , namely , an 18 @-@ week period of leave , which would be in line with recommendations from the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) .
the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) has pointed out that many of the proposals ( amendments ) put forward exceed the scope and purpose of the directive .
the adoption of this scheme would have major consequences on the budgets of the Member States and businesses ; for France , the additional annual cost would be EUR 1.3 billion , an un@@ be@@ arable financial burden at a time of budgetary cuts .
I welcome the adoption of this report on the proposal for a directive on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are b@@ reas@@ t@@ feeding , and of measures aimed at helping workers to achieve a work @-@ life balance .
along with the European Parliament &apos;s recommendation for SMEs to be charged VAT only after in@@ voices have been paid , setting a definite deadline for paying in@@ voices will help those who are worried about their survival at a time when markets are in decline .
I therefore hope that at the implementation stage , other factors are also considered , establishing a loo@@ sen@@ ing of stability pact ties for public authorities and , at the same time , a gradual reduction in payment terms .
precisely to ensure that this does not happen , it is recommended that anyone receiving this income is also able to provide some hours of work for the benefit of the community .
behind these figures , extreme poverty is the most worrying and is making progress , especially in these times of recession , which is why a minimum income is crucial .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the Berès report because of my support for the vast majority of its contents .
I believe that the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis has carried out its tasks well and that in this document , it sets out new paths , measures and initiatives which will allow the EU to be much better prepared for any crises that might occur in the future .
I voted in favour of it because I consider it of fundamental importance to improve the economic governance of the European Union .
to my mind , the Feio report is the most professional report we have had in the last three months .
Kin@@ dly do not inter@@ rupt the session with such points .
the Commission is open to discuss with Parliament in order to find a way forward that addresses Parliament &apos;s concerns .
this democratic accountability is vital , especially at a time when Member States are themselves making severe cuts to their national expendi@@ tures .
instead of giving to European consumers , we are taking away from them .
Transnistria is committing serious violations in the areas of democracy and respect for human rights .
this is why it is important and we consider it necessary to promote every technical facilitation that will enable these organisations to access the aid that is often crucial to their survival .
you have actually pain@@ ted a rather g@@ loom@@ y picture of what is currently going on in Ukraine , even going so far as to compare it with China .
it is an achievement that we cannot question before the next elections are over .
for a week , there has been no change to laws , nor to the composition of the electoral Commission .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
there are three reasons for this relative pessi@@ mism .
honourable Members , combating violence against women is a goal shared by both the European Parliament and the Council .
as for flexibility regarding the 3 % limit , as you know , we really are being flexible ; we have been flexible since 2009 , we have been flexible in 2010 , and we will continue to be flexible in 2011 and 2012 so that our various Member States can return to healthy budgets , because if we wanted to apply this 3 % limit ri@@ gi@@ dly , with absolutely no margin for error , then this year for instance , practically every one of us would have failed to comply with this budgetary restraint plan , and that is not the case .
I welcome that because it still gives an incentive to Pakistan to come into line with social and human rights standards between now and 2014 in order to qualify for GSP + in 2014 .
the regulation proposed by the Commission concentra@@ tes , above all , on the suspension of duties in the textile and lea@@ ther goods sectors - which represent 60 % of Pakistani exports with a turnover of almost EUR 200 million for textiles and EUR 5@@ 10 million for the lea@@ ther industry , both of which are characterised by production located in neighbouring areas that are not clearly affected by the floods .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
it is made of cotton from Egypt , which was wo@@ ven into cl@@ ot@@ h in Italy .
I am in favour of more truth in product labelling and therefore oppose this proposal from the Commission .
I should feel quite a f@@ ool if I went all the way to Sweden to buy something that was produced in my local area .
I am concerned that a blan@@ ket exclusion of patents - an important intellectual property right - might risk depriving many industries of the benefits of this chapter .
this is because the questions that we were able to ask the Commission in the de@@ brief@@ ing sessions which you recently offered us after the negotiations , and for which I would like to thank you , were not really answered to our complete satisfaction .
secondly , it would seem that the ACTA committee has the possibility of integrating amendments into texts .
the initi@@ alling of the agreement is part of the Commission &apos;s prerogatives and it does not definitely bin@@ d the Union .
progress sig@@ ni@@ fies political will , hard work and dedication , which need to be rewarded .
however , in order for the process of reforms to be continued after 28 November , a clear signal from the European Union is needed , so I am hoping that the forthcoming Council summit will manage to push through the visa liberalisation process .
I attended a convention , organised by the Minister for Culture , on Mol@@ dava &apos;s integration into Europe with particular reference to culture .
we are aware of the large increase in the number of containers that are lost and , as I said earlier , Commissioner Kallas is looking at this problem .
Mr President , Commissioner , sustainable use of the maritime environment is vital to the sustainability and growth of the whole of Europe , especially countries whose economies are directly linked to the sea .
it is not enough to promote the protection of the environment within the EU , as we are always so keen to do , because it is a well @-@ known fact that wind and waves are no respec@@ ters of borders .
unless we liberalise our ports resolutely , they will not be able to expand the key role they will be required to play in the context of co @-@ mod@@ ality .
however , the establishment of differing emission limits within EU waters conflicts with the integrated maritime policy , which aims to take all factors into account .
it was simply a question of how we should implement it , of whether we should create a new fund at a European level for ref@@ itting old ships or whether we should put in place a strategy .
Madam President , if we cannot find a majority , then I want to ask the House to move the vote on the resolution to the next meeting in Strasbourg .
even though trade between these two regions has intensified , mutual trading between the EU and Latin America is less dynamic compared to trade relations with other regions of the world .
in its legislative proposal for the mid @-@ term review of the DCI , the Commission only suggested a technical amendment to allow the costs relating to taxes , duties and other charges related to the financing of the actions covered by the DCI in beneficiary countries to be financed from the DCI budget .
on the other hand , extending the geographical scope of Regulation ( EC ) No 19@@ 34 / 2006 brings the developing countries concerned within the scope of two different external action financial instruments .
the aim is to create a level playing field between European producers and producers from third countries ( the United States , Japan and Canada ) , which , moreover , as stated just now , lead the way where these kinds of measures are concerned .
the processes described here do not take inequalities into account .
it is also necessary that the legislation in force strengthen the safety of oil exploration and extraction .
South America , for a whole host of historical , social and economic reasons , has many things in common with Europe .
the Government of Zimbabwe is committing eg@@ regi@@ ous violations of the civil , political , economic and social rights guaranteed by the African Charter on Human and peoples &apos; Rights .
clearly we will need to follow how these are implemented in practice .
these organisations should be supported , therefore , and it is also necessary to condemn the re@@ prehen@@ sible deeds which are being perpetrated in the North Caucasus , to speak out for the growing number of people who have disappeared and to remember the suffering of those who have been displaced .
the government should strive to convi@@ ct those who carry out abduc@@ tions and murders , rather than si@@ len@@ cing those , like Ole@@ g Or@@ lov , who bring these issues to light .
however , we would also like discussion to take place regarding the fact that the opposition was disadvantaged in the regional and local elections , that it was not able to stand everywhere and , moreover , that there is increasingly little separation of the executive and the judiciary .
we must support the Middle East peace process , with the aim of achieving a framework for agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority within a year .
we believe that dialogue and relations between the European Union and the United States should be conducted in a spirit of mutual understanding and independence .
some hope of that if we continue to embrace glob@@ alism .
if we want Europe &apos;s voice to be heard on the major issues , however , it really has to take the initiative and to speak with one voice .
after the Copenhagen climate summit , and after the way Mr Obama ignored the Spanish Presidency , the Americans have once again humi@@ lia@@ ted us and the rest of the world by making a unilateral decision to print money .
thank you for this debate .
in this brief introduction , I should like to make it clear that , whilst these PNR data are a real priority of the Council &apos;s , the Council also really wants to take the utmost account of Parliament &apos;s justified concerns with regard to striking the good balance between privacy and security that is always needed .
I am pleased to hear that the Commission is looking into the profiling issue , but I think that we need some further discussion on that .
the existence of a number of parallel legislative initiatives shows the need for consistency .
just as questionable is the issue of whether , in the case of travel to the US , the F@@ B@@ I needs to know someone &apos;s name , address , email address , credit card number and baggage number and be permitted to store this data for up to 15 years .
I would like to thank and congratulate him , as well as all the coordinators and shadow rapporteurs , and of course , as Mr Re@@ yn@@ ders has just said , the Belgian Presidency and the whole team , for the very important and very te@@ na@@ cious work that has been accomplished over these last few weeks , and before it , by the other Presidencies .
it is still left up to national rules to limit how far the funds can go into debt , and that also means that we are not learning the lessons from the crisis .
in that case , too , my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left declared that there was a regulation on the table in this House that was not perfect , not complete , and yet for years now , they have been grateful for the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament managed to push it through in this House .
T@@ han@@ k@@ fully , the new supervisory architecture will go a long way to ensuring that is the case , and today we will hopefully complete the picture through the A@@ IMF .
from now on , alternative investment funds ( hedge funds ) entering Europe will be more strictly monitored and regulated by Europe .
the current European and international context , characterised by the globalisation of trade , technological evolution and the emergence of new actors on the world scene , surely requires a serious re @-@ launch of the single market , striking the right balance between the protection of all those parties involved : businesses , consumers and workers .
this will also be the case , Mrs Ver@@ g@@ na@@ ud and Mrs Au@@ con@@ ie , for the quality framework which President Barroso has committed himself to regarding services of general interest .
we also call for a renewed political will to resist the temp@@ tations of economic nationalism and to exploit everyone &apos;s full potential .
our Council had a first informal debate on the matter in July , then a formal debate on 12 October , and that debate enabled the Presidency to submit some draft Council conclusions , which are currently being examined and which , as I have already said , are on the agenda of our Competitiveness Council on 25 and 26 November .
we therefore need to do much more capacity building , innovate in capacity building and innovate in administration for research , in order to manage research and help businesses to get to work on this very difficult and complex undertaking for the future .
the OSCE &apos;s capabilities in all three dimensions must be strengthened so as to enable it to better fulfil its early warning , conflict prevention , crisis resolution and reconstruction role .
there are many serious human rights violations , terrible prison conditions , etc .
it meets all the necessary technical requirements .
one of the possible developments that we should consider is the negotiation of a more comprehensive trade regime with Taiwan , especially now that it has signed the milestone Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement .
in my opinion , it is a very serious judgment , because it rela@@ ti@@ vis@@ es the content of a very important European Union directive on terrorism .
instead , the national pension@@ able ages should be observed .
the large co@@ hor@@ ts born during the baby boo@@ m are approaching retirement , while new co@@ hor@@ ts arriving on the labour market are much smaller .
last but not least , another key aspect is the provision of support to entrepreneurs in accessing funds for agricultural projects , which must be considered as an incentive , especially for getting young people involved in agriculture .
the Commission &apos;s services are now reaching out for solutions which can be swiftly implemented .
this verdict is a positive sign that our efforts to further improve control are having a concrete impact .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , year after year over the last 16 years , the auditors have been refusing to clear 90 % or more of the budget , and this year is no exception .
we are not inven@@ ting facts ; we are not being kind to the Commission or kind to the Member States .
this means that we are doing something which will have an immediate local impact and which will act as a benchmark for my future activities relating to smart cities .
priority issues in this project are , in my opinion , support for cross @-@ border gas and electricity infrastructure projects , including inter @-@ conne@@ ctors , and also support for carbon capture and storage projects .
at present , the EU livestock sector is experiencing difficulties caused by a range of factors , including rising production costs , competition from imports from third countries , and , of course , various issues which contribute to the rising cost of feed .
Madam President , I very much welcome the fact that we are dealing with the situation in the livestock sector , because it is a serious one .
Fourthly , livestock keepers are at a disadvantage in the supply chain compared to pro@@ cess@@ ors and traders .
now that the European Parliament &apos;s decision on the abolition of visas for citizens of the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) travelling to the European Union Member States and Schengen States has been adopted by such a huge and significant majority , I sincerely congratulate the people of Taiwan .
however , due to ageing Europe , it seems that it will be quite difficult to achieve this .
the EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries , so we should now grant this aid to Ireland , which has requested assistance for 850 workers made redundant from the company SR Tech@@ n@@ ics Ireland L@@ td , operating in the air transport sector , in the NUTS III Dublin region .
it has taken the financial crisis to make the Member States and the majority of Parliament agree to adopt binding legislation on alternative funds .
the EU directive on hedge funds , private equity funds and other alternative investment funds , launched by the European Commission in April 2009 , in response to the financial crisis , and in accordance with guidelines agreed at the G20 summit , has finally been approved by a very wide majority .
after its first democratic elections in 1996 , Taiwan embarked upon a major process of democratisation with important institutional reforms for the respect of civil liberties and citizens &apos; rights that have helped to consolidate its political stability .
in some countries , projects for the renovation of buildings , gas and electricity infrastructure projects , inter @-@ conne@@ ctors , wind farms , and carbon capture and storage projects ( CCS ) are taking a long time to move forward .
the military option for ensuring domin@@ ation of resources markets is gaining dange@@ rously in importance , along with greater &apos; strategic cooperation &apos; on &apos; transatlantic security &apos; between the US and the EU within the framework of NATO .
in my opinion , the Commission must ensure that any agreement or measure on the transfer of personal data must also stand the legal proportionality test and protect the confidentiality of personal data .
if this is to change in future , it is important that the balance between freedom and security is preserved .
at a time when the economy , technology and information science are undergoing dynamic development , we must not forget the most significant factor - human capital .
moreover , women of all ages often care for young and elderly depend@@ ents .
as it is to be expected that the retirement age will be increased , working conditions for older people should be adapted and made more attractive .
we are willing to do all of these , and the submitted report talks about all of these .
I therefore considered that this report , aimed at simplifying the way in which funds are granted for research , development and innovation via the Seventh Framework Programme , deserves to be supported .
the role of this Parliament should be limited to two areas .
I voted in favour of the resolution precisely in order to get started down a path which will shortly lead to a re @-@ stabilisation of incomes for those people who have made livestock farming their life &apos;s work .
secondly , we have seen in recent years that vir@@ uses that occur in living animals can rapidly mu@@ tate .
I believe that this is an issue that deserves a debate in plenary with Baroness Ashton present .
the second topic concerns the currencies of emerging market economies which have current account surpluses and exchange rates that are not sufficiently flexible .
it is unacceptable to have huge austerity programmes on the expenditure side while countries continue to have un@@ constra@@ ined tax competition on the revenue side .
For@@ ty @-@ eight of the 50 states in the American Union have a deficit budget .
perhaps Mr Bat@@ ten does not understand that word , or that Ireland needs England as much as England needs Ireland and its economy .
we try to do that .
at this stage , the Commission cannot commit on a date to table a proposal on VAT rates .
the Commission has reinforced its humanitarian presence with relevant medical expertise and mobilised funds - EUR 12 million - to support partners in Haiti .
I would like us to be positive and place the pressure where it needs to be .
I have not yet been to Haiti , but my feeling is that cancel@@ ling or postponing the elections might actually de@@ stabilise a very difficult situation .
the action plan adopted on the basis of my report must eliminate discards in the Baltic Sea , for example , by the introduction , where appropriate , of a complete ban on discards in the Baltic Sea fishery .
I sincerely believe that , given this background of uncertainty , the Commission should seek to send a positive signal to the sector today in Parliament .
I understand the problems , and we have to find a syn@@ thesis and a solution .
we have therefore rejected any so @-@ called &apos; push channels &apos; , such as advertise@@ ments on the radio , television or in newspapers .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as the 21st century da@@ w@@ ns , patients particularly need appropriate information so that they can be fully involved in the treatment path@@ way , know where to find treatment , decide on the best treatment with healthcare professionals and follow the planned treatment to the letter .
therefore , we must apply certain safeguards to ensure the wellbeing of European patients .
Commission &apos;s position on the amendments tabled by the Parliament :
it has brought about important changes in the design of electronic products in the European Union and worldwide .
another complex subject was the detailed definition of nanomaterials , which has been suspended , pending a proposal by the Commission .
however , such massive decisions would require courage and strength from our politicians .
victory for the democratic forces , currently united in the Alliance for European Integration , guarantees the continuation of the progress made during the last year - progress towards democratic government , rights and human wellbeing .
what can the EU do about this ?
finally , if we then experience a new emergency , we will need to ensure that we are able to take better coordinated measures to improve water disposal .
wars take their greatest toll on the innocent civilians , and in times of armed conflicts , civilians largely consist of women .
in the general strike which is to take place in Portugal tomorrow , men and women will again protest against anti @-@ social policies .
I wonder how the College of Commissioners pic@@ ked the year , for example .
that is also the stage which the Council &apos;s discussions have reached on this regulation .
on the other hand , the deadline of 2020 specifically proposed by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy did not receive sufficient positive feedback .
( RO ) Madam President , our fellow Members in this Chamber have mentioned that this is a recur@@ ring debate in the European Parliament .
I would like to say that the Union &apos;s economic problems during the crisis are not only the result of dis@@ honest global financial specu@@ lations , but there is also a lack of a sound , uniform and fair industrial policy in the Union itself , particularly a fuel and energy policy .
however , since I feel it is much more important for the sector to have a long @-@ term plan for anch@@ ov@@ y fishing , I am going to vote in favour , and I am going to take this opportunity to ask the Council , which has so many reservations , to accept Parliament &apos;s codecision capacity granted by the Treaty of Lisbon and to please set a date today for negotiations to begin , because if this plan does not move forward , it is the sector that will suffer the most .
our first step was therefore to dis@@ solve the KG@@ B and fire the entire police force ...
they could play such a major positive role in the ongoing transformation of our common region , accepting other countries as partners and not as vas@@ s@@ als .
although the total losses remain below the normal threshold , the request made by Ireland falls under the criterion of &apos; extraordinary regional disaster &apos; , which sets out the conditions for mobilising the Solidarity Fund &apos; under exceptional circumstances &apos; .
six more applications have been made to mobilise the Solidarity Fund , corresponding to the closure of hundreds more companies in Europe .
this support is essential for helping the unemployed and the victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised world .
during the nine @-@ month reference period from 1 April 2009 to 29 December 2009 , there were 5@@ 98 redundancies in a total of eight companies in No@@ ord Holland and Z@@ uid Holland .
lastly , I support the mechanism implemented , which protects the interests and health of European consumers .
its renewal therefore confirms this success and we hope that it will continue to do so in the future .
I voted in favour of this resolution , as it addresses the resolution adopted by Parliament on 25 February and the Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy , with regard to the need for regional cooperation and sustainability beyond EU waters .
this report concerns the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the minimum standard value added tax ( VAT ) rate of 15 % , extending for another five years the current period - which was to expire at the end of this year - because they could not reach agreement on definitively standardis@@ ing VAT rates .
during the crisis , the ECB adjusted interest rates down to 1 % and continued unprecedented non @-@ standard measures to support credit throughout 2009 .
this report , which I voted for , also draws attention to the fact that the austerity packages adopted by the governments of the Member States should not compromise their ability to promote economic recovery , with an emphasis on ensuring a balance between the process of consolidating public finances and meeting the need for investment in jobs and sustainable development , and using measures and instruments which can give a direction to the sacrifices imposed on the public , along with an end in sight .
the Treaty of Lisbon has made the establishment of a common defence policy into one of the EU &apos;s concrete objectives .
I agree with the rapporteur as regards area access for vessels fishing horse mackerel .
as regards the process of drawing up the report , I welcome the fact that the Commission has incorporated the proposals adopted by the Committee on Fisheries in its proposal for a regulation .
on the basis of the Commission impact assessment , and as a logical follow @-@ on to Regulation ( EC ) No 14@@ 07 / 2002 , the 2018 deadline is an appropriate one , ensuring a socially acceptable solution without enta@@ iling mass redundancies in a number of Member States .
it has succeeded in demonstrating the high quality of its work , which is based on the principles of cooperation , consultation , transparency and democratic dialogue , and on ever greater interaction between European and ACP parliamentarians .
the implementation of the Stockholm Programme has , and will continue to have , its difficulties .
I strongly condemn the attack by the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Korea against the South Korean island of Ye@@ on@@ p@@ ye@@ ong .
if there is no budget , there will be no ITER project , no nuclear fusion reactor .
rather than your dispar@@ aging remarks about the Irish looking for help , do you not accept that by helping Ireland , is the European Union helping herself ?
I hope that it really is with this aim in mind that we take advantage of the next few weeks to ensure that this first procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon is a success rather than a failure .
President Barroso &apos;s speech this evening was good .
the European Parliament has shown a lot of goodwill in accepting the figures for 2011 because we understand the economic situation in the Member States .
personally , I think the fi@@ as@@ co of the 2011 budget negotiations is a defeat for all of us .
equally , the critical approach to EU taxation has nothing to do with an apparent lack of solidarity .
we believe that the proposals made in this area are too weak .
I would like to say , Mr Vice @-@ President , that I am rather sceptical about this .
likewise , we would be glad if this year , when we will have two se@@ mes@@ ters of successive new Member State presidencies , namely from Hungary and Poland , cohesion and integration within the EU could continue .
finally , a further important task is work on the objectives and the multiannual financial frameworks for 2014 @-@ 2020 .
to this end , I will propose a European skills passport , which will enable citizens to record their skills in a clear and comparable way .
there are a lot of positive approaches here which two colleagues from my group have referred to .
it could collaborate with the southern Member States to employ a skilled European labour force .
I am relying on a close partnership with the Member States regarding the use of the different energy resources .
( el ) Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to come back to an issue raised in my honourable friend &apos;s question .
simplification was also one of the main reasons that motivated the Commission &apos;s &apos; health check &apos; proposals .
however , above and beyond simplification that would benefit all farmers , and small and medium @-@ sized producers particularly , a profound sha@@ ke @-@ up of the CAP is also needed that reinforces intervention instruments , guaranteeing farmers fair prices ; that rest@@ o@@ res the instruments regulating production , such as quotas and production rights ; that - since we are talking about simplification - guarantees each country something as simple as the right to production , as well as the right to food security and sovereignty ; and that establishes the principles of mo@@ del@@ ling and ca@@ pping for aid , overcoming the current imbalances between producer countries and production levels .
the European Parliament has expressed its opinion on this matter many times , including recently in the Ash@@ worth report on simplification of the CAP .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
as the number of bee@@ keepers is constantly falling , we also need to invest more in education and training .
it covers the common agricultural policy , biodiversity , food security , pesticide use , veterinary regulations , and even the lab@@ y@@ rin@@ th@@ ine way of funding through the EU .
Member States have their own various initiatives , but there is very little or no coordination .
the action intended is a further , crucial step to safeguard the financial stability of Ireland , the euro area , and the European Union as a whole .
moreover , I do not know whether the revision of the EU Treaty will be accepted in Ireland as smoothly as it would seem from your report on the European Council .
we know that it is only a matter of time until they will also be looking for solidarity and crisis management .
secondly , and finally , the European Council opposes automa@@ tism in the system of sanctions : no treaty amendment , no opening of Pand@@ ora &apos;s box .
we will have our say in the codecision procedure .
what is Europe now ?
Mr President , as an Irish MEP , it gives me no great pleasure to come in here this morning and hear almost every speaker refer to Ireland because of our economic situation , particularly when a few years ago we were seen as almost the p@@ in @-@ up boys of economic success in the European Union .
we would have discovered the property bub@@ bles .
as Europeans , we were well prepared for these meetings , both at ministerial level and at the level of Heads of State or Government .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in her speech this morning , Mrs Harms posed the question of why the spar@@ k is no longer being passed from the summits to the people and why new courage and new confidence is not eman@@ ating from the summit discussions .
therefore , in the short term , we will have to introduce a minimum level of coordination and , in the medium term , move towards a resolution framework that harmon@@ ises to a much greater extent the crisis resolution arrangements , in particular on the basis of the Commission &apos;s legislative proposals .
we call upon the D@@ PR@@ K to avoid any further escalation and to undertake all necessary efforts to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Pen@@ insula .
I see you are in a difficult ...
we voted in favour of the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for Ireland , following the floods that hit that country last November .
any other approach will simply lead to an escalation of tension in Moldova , and not to a positive solution of problems that were partly caused by the EU through its uneven approach in the past .
in the area of health , access to comprehensive , good quality information guarantees better results , insofar as patients are more likely to follow a treatment that they are able to understand .
these are the two important messages sent this lun@@ ch@@ time with the adoption of the legislative package on information for patients .
the amendments made by the European Parliament to the European Commission &apos;s legislative proposal highlight that manufacturers of medicinal products must provide basic information such as product characteristics , a label , patient information le@@ af@@ let and a publicly available version of the assessment report .
I abstained on the Evans report on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment because I find Parliament &apos;s approach strange .
criteria for deciding on the duration of exemption / gra@@ ce periods
the agreement introduces a full international framework to strengthen the fight against infringements of intellectual property rights .
energy policy is , today , increasingly related to the foreign policy of the European Union .
J@@ ens Roh@@ de is right .
I recommend that we exercise caution in this area , to ensure that our ambitious plans do not pose a threat to our industrial and commercial competitiveness .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are entering into the debate here , and if I take the points on which your speeches focused , we have a broad energy mix in the European Union , in the Member States and also in Parliament .
I am confident that structural changes supporting the efficient realisation of a single market will soon be implemented , and that we will achieve a speedy and transparent licensing process , create regional initiatives and provide access to new financing instruments .
the EU alone under a second commitment period is neither sufficient nor credible .
according to the Ernst &amp; Young 2010 B@@ aro@@ meter , China and the United States are the most attractive countries for the development of renewable energy .
( LT ) Mr President , soon the world will once again receive good , or as has been the cus@@ tom of late , bad news on climate change , this time from Cancún .
Commissioner , we can trace the causes of climate change back to the ir@@ ra@@ tionality of this economic and social system .
the debate is closed .
we can also build on joint successes so far : peace and security , and regional integration .
with this in mind , strengthening the African Union in institutional and operational terms is a priority ;
firstly , we need to focus our priorities on more infrastructure , greater food security and more support for gover@@ na@@ bility .
I believe that this is an opportunity for Portuguese traders to make closer connections in the African market as part of their business networks , but the issues of insecurity and the high levels of crime perpetrated by the Portuguese community , particularly the Made@@ i@@ ran Community resident in South Africa , must nevertheless be addressed .
UN security forces have been restricted in their activity in Western Sahara , whereas they should be able to exercise complete control and oversee humanitarian aid .
if our resolution is directed at anyone , then in this context it should , in my opinion , be the Ukrainian citizens , who with this protest are guaranteeing that Ukraine &apos;s development as a democracy continues .
Ukraine is a country divided between a pro @-@ western west and a Russian @-@ facing east .
this regulation concerns the States and their economies , but it is clear that the main economic players are undertakings and , in particular , multinational corporations : they are the main players in world trade .
last but not least , since 20 % of emissions are due to transport , we must move towards short distribution channels , first and foremost in agriculture , which will lead to the creation of jobs in our own countries as well as in developing countries and to a reduction in our emissions .
the conditions in sub@@ contracting companies and suppliers , including in the production of raw materials , are often appalling .
I would like to express my thanks and sincere congratulations to my colleague Mrs Saï@@ fi for this document , which provides an example of the fact that Parliament is making progress
the vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , 25 November 2010 , at 12 : 00 .
China remains , by and large , the main source of unfair trade ( around 35 % of cases launched by the EU are against China ) .
a con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous example are children &apos;s toys - dangerous ingredients contained in the pa@@ ints or plastic parts can cause health problems , and poor work@@ manship can cause an accident which ends up with a visit to hospital .
in 2009 , my office closed 3@@ 18 inqu@@ i@@ res , 70 % of which were completed within one year .
at the same time , the Commission recognises the importance of ensuring the timely provision to citizens of a full and clear evaluation of the outcome of work done with the Member States in EU pilot , and it is committed to ensuring that compla@@ in@@ ants have an opportunity to comment on the outcome .
the actual complaint form is similarly complicated .
the worthy and good work carried out by the European Ombudsman notwithstanding , does the office of ombudsman have to cost almost EUR 9 million ?
( PL ) Madam President , at the outset , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her very good , comprehensive and balanced report , as well as the Ombudsman for his un@@ ce@@ asing work in combating maladministration as well as raising administration standards in the European Union .
in answer to Mr H@@ ef@@ ner &apos;s question concerning the EU pilot and why it is so named : this is because , when we started with this new project on creating additional possibilities for the Member States to correct their mistakes themselves more quickly , it was an accepted procedure which was started by a few Member States .
I believe it is of central importance that the 2002 communication should be revised , particularly in relation to the rights of the compla@@ in@@ ant .
although this does not completely remove the risk , it does reduce it .
thank you very much indeed .
nor , for that matter , is there much advantage in having in Europe a bloc of similar industrialised economies , where we have cut ourselves off from the growing markets of the rest of the world .
the crisis area has also been bloc@@ ka@@ ded so that it cannot even receive international aid .
in writing . - ( SV ) I regret the fact that the negotiations have not as yet managed to achieve a result .
cooperation between international organisations should be stepped up as part of a global agreement on climate , especially at the level of carbon inclusion mechanisms for the EU &apos;s emissions trading scheme , while ensuring , however , that existing leakage is stopped .
the post of European Ombudsman was established in the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992 , creating an intermedi@@ ary between European citizens and the authorities of the European Union .
in the context of the consultations provided for in Article 4 ( 4 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 1049 / 2001 , the Commission must establish a deadline for the third @-@ party author of a document to reply , and it should exercise this power in a way that enables it to abide by its own deadlines .
it focuses its analysis on the &apos; EU pilot E@@ valuation Report &apos; , in which the Commission proposes conducting an assessment of the achievements of the EU pilot project 22 months after its implementation .
I support the recommendations made , with the emphasis on the incentive for the exchange of best practices between Member States and greater cooperation between national media regulators within the European Platform of Regulatory Authorities ( EP@@ RA ) .
ten years have passed since the adoption of the aforementioned resolutions and , as outlined in the resolution that I voted for , there is still a long way to go .
this has a negative impact on the whole environment and on agriculture , as bees are important pollin@@ ators .
moreover , the target of reducing carbon emissions has to be considered with great care , so as to minimise the risks of carbon leakage and loss of competitiveness for European industries .
I support a binding agreement fea@@ turing an international system of sanctions for the climate summit in Cancún .
global warming is now scientifically proven , and so the target must be to stabilise global greenhouse gas emissions no later than by 2015 in order to hal@@ ve emissions by 2050 .
however , it is unfortunate that the text was produced before Parliament had access to all of the facts and detailed information about the circumstances that triggered this tragedy , including the exact number of victims .
the EU has to adjust its trade policies towards some form of discrimination of products on the basis of their climate impact , thus stimulating the paradigm shif@@ ts required in methods of production and consumption , and of investment strategies .
the expansion in international trade is universally beneficial only if certain conditions are met , hence the need to manage the liberalisation of trade , including practical arrangements and the volume of trade , a need which has come to be felt even more strongly as the globalisation process has accelerated .
the Christian minority in Mes@@ o@@ pota@@ mia has been exposed to outright religious persecution for years .
these Thursday afternoon sittings are taking a more and more sur@@ real turn in this House , both in the emp@@ tin@@ ess that we observe and in the subjects addressed and the way in which they are dealt with .
it is truly incredible that there are people who are not free to wor@@ ship a symbol of freedom because they are slaugh@@ tered as they leave a church merely for having been inside .
for this reason , we should express our opposition to the attempt to take the Tibetans &apos; basic tool of communication away from them .
people should not live in small or big prisons for their thoughts .
we acknowledge the decision of certain opposition parties not to participate , but also the fact that some other parties , including from ethnic groups , did participate .
I feel a little aw@@ k@@ ward doing this , because it is not only my group &apos;s request ; several other groups support this idea .
in this process , they abolished the former par@@ ity @-@ based media supervisory body , and set up in its place one consisting of dele@@ gates of the government party .
after bankrup@@ ting the country economically and socially , the current Romanian Government is now implementing ridiculous measures , amounting to a serious violation of the fundamental rights recognised in the European Union - the right to a pension , trade union rights , the right to a salary and the rights of young mothers .
I should like you to confirm once again , whether sole@@ m@@ n@@ ly or otherwise , before this House , that we shall therefore not be kept on the side@@ lines , or too little involved or poorly informed , concerning the commen@@ cement and the progress of negotiations on agreements since your declaration .
Member States will apply uniform and simplified procedures .
Commissioner , I can tell you without the slightest hesitation that the current visa regime is defici@@ ent and is particularly damaging to the EU .
it shows political will , and that is very important , but the achievement of this goal can only be very technical and very strict .
the next item is the report by A@@ gus@@ t@@ ín Díaz de Mera García Consu@@ eg@@ ra , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation ( EC ) No 3@@ 77 / 2004 on the creation of an immigration liaison officers &apos; network - C7 @-@ 00@@ 55 / 2009 - .
of course , no one can say that we have reached our target level .
we know that well @-@ managed migratory flows will be of benefit to everyone .
accepting this would violate the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
let us be clear : the abolition of internal borders between Member States has made it essential to harmonise national legisla@@ tions on the conditions of admission and residence for third @-@ country nationals , to guarantee them equality of treatment , and to ensure that they are guaranteed rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens .
once adopted , the directive will be a very important tool in the fight for the protection of migrant workers and against social dumping .
in terms of increasing the European Union &apos;s global competitiveness , I think that part of the funds allocated to the cohesion policy should be used to establish and maintain Europe &apos;s role as global leader in the sectors where it already enjoys a competitive edge and in the sectors where there is potential for it to become global leader .
a series of amendments have been tabled on these points to optimise the impact of cohesion policy and thus increase the Union &apos;s economic competitiveness .
the handi@@ caps and problems that these regions experience reflect the limitations of European integration .
furthermore , I must specifically highlight the fact that it may not even be the traditional media , such as television or radio , that pose the greatest threat to young people , but the world of the Internet .
I believe that the exclusion of major investments from the scope of stricter supervision is a meaningless and outright mistaken step .
we have a two @-@ speed Europe where some people are equal and others are not .
( HU ) Mr President , the European Union has always been ready to criticise countries outside its borders in order to promote fundamental rights .
we are not going to give up on such a fair and necessary aim that is supported by the majority of Europeans just because there are some who are afraid and never dare to take that one step further .
I also see these orders as being extremely difficult to enforce in the UK , for we will end up in a situation whereby an order is handed down by a foreign judge in a foreign land who knows nothing about the conditions of a British town or our way of life .
I think that we have made some progress with the proposals for penalties contained in the legislative proposal .
another point worthy of recognition is the fact that , when dealing with this problem , special account must be taken of pregnant women and people suffering from illness or disability .
( da ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if we know that several hundred thousand people are sold as sla@@ ves each year to Western Europe , we have a duty to take action .
the European Union &apos;s action on trafficking in human beings cannot be limited to denoun@@ cing it , but recognises the need for precise , ex @-@ post actions to ensure that those responsible for such a barbaric practice do not go un@@ punished .
I believe that the whole of the European Union wants Georgia to join the family of European nations .
many investments co @-@ financed from the Structural Funds have proved their worth , among which I would like to emphasise infrastructure improvement , because it has resulted in foreign investment being attracted into many regions , contributing to economic development .
I therefore voted in favour of the report .
in light of structural changes in international trade , it is important that the European economy is able to quickly implement assistance policies for workers affected by such changes whilst also giving them the skills required to return swiftly to the labour market .
I also agree that :
I am voting in favour of the report , as immediate action must be taken to respond to increased levels of unemployment , particularly in small regions with struggling economies .
furthermore , clear mechanisms for coordination between the Commission and the Council should be ensured , also in relation to the coordination and the use of EU military assets in a disaster response .
I also agree with Mrs Z@@ an@@ ic@@ chi &apos;s view that the encouraging results of the 2008 preparatory Action should be further assessed and that the idea of a voluntary pool of Member States &apos; assets on stand @-@ by for immediate deployment in EU operations should be further developed .
although the number of incidents in the EU involving C@@ BR@@ N material has so far been relatively small and have been due to industrial accidents or to the increase in , and worldwide spread of , dangerous pa@@ tho@@ gens , there remains a risk of C@@ BR@@ N disasters , whether acci@@ dental or inten@@ tional .
I voted in favour of the draft directive on the European Protection Order , which aims to protect victims of crime throughout the European Union .
this new directive , for which I voted , replaces the former framework decision , in accordance with the new powers in this regard .
trafficking in human beings is also an extremely profitable business for organised crime , with high profit possibilities and limited risk @-@ taking .
my colleague , Na@@ th@@ ali@@ e Gri@@ es@@ be@@ ck , was rapporteur on both of these agreements that concern the movement of persons between the EU and Georgia .
the support we so mag@@ nan@@ im@@ ously demand for this or that represents money taken from the pockets of taxpayers ; mothers and fathers who decide every month what is their real priority and what will have to wait .
thank you for your answer .
will the Commission be successful in getting China to remove its subsidies , allow its currency to appreciate or , for that matter , to respect international property rights which apparently amount to something like 5 % of Chinese GDP ?
my question is this : do you think this is being used to sup@@ press the facility to transfer data ?
we have to find the right balance and that is why , in all our initiatives , we have to take on board those two principles , which are sometimes difficult to harmonise but nevertheless very important .
I have to praise the efforts of the budgetary rapporteur , Reimer Böge , and Minister Wathelet to find agreement in this very area , involving also a degree of flexibility .
the ho@@ the@@ ads here must c@@ ool down , particularly the Greens .
in particular , it is unacceptable that Parliament &apos;s request to obtain a dialogue on the EU &apos;s future own resources has come to nothing .
this will ensure financial security for the vulnerable agriculture sector .
we are also aware that this regulation still does not tackle all the problems in a sector which , in recent years , has been seen to have exacerbated the crisis .
these ratings , which are a far cry from reality , clearly hinder countries in recovering from the crisis .
there are two new structures being created : the Executive Technology Committee and The Centre and Network for Climate Technology .
even China , this time , recognised that there are limits to national sovereignty and accepted that there should be international verification of its emissions because we are in this together : one race , one species on a single planet .
one could ask what exactly the EU is going to do to strive for a deal in Durban .
it is sli@@ pping out of the li@@ me@@ light and perhaps that is a good thing .
they include young people from migrant backgrounds and those from ethnic minorities like the Roma .
for instance , there is a very nice project in Germany which we could gener@@ alise to other countries where , in public spaces , there is a meter measuring how much longer a woman has to work in order to reach the same medium salary as a man .
if that is satisfied one day and they do join the European Union , is there not a danger that they will return to type and go back on a lot of the things that we are looking for and which have not been attained yet ?
with the current initiatives , it looks like we will achieve 10 or 11 % .
Mr President , Commissioner , energy efficiency is one of the main challenges facing the European Union over the next 10 years .
from this point of view , the road map that he is proposing today is outrageous .
that will take us up to 20@@ 70 but , meanwhile , we have set ourselves targets which we have to reach by 2050 !
it does not always have to mean more money ; it is also about spending existing resources wisely .
the report discus@@ ses arguments for the advantages of greater energy efficiency : social ( potential creation of 1 million jobs or decline in energy poverty in the EU ) , economic ( potential energy savings of up to EUR 100 billion ) , strategic ( retaining the competitiveness of European companies through energy savings ) and , last but not least , energy security ( greater energy self @-@ sufficiency for the EU ) .
in future , Member States may wish to enact national rules .
it is important , as Mrs Com@@ i also said , that no legal vacuum arises .
with regard to the other specific issues raised in the question tabled , I would like to start with the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental risks , which refers to a study conducted by the Joint Research Centre to analyse the methodology used in labor@@ ator@@ ies to identify tra@@ ces of heavy metals such as lead in toys .
this offers a real growth prospe@@ ctive for Europe .
that is simply not enough .
the tough austerity packages imposed on Greece and Ireland will result in the people bearing the cost of the crisis which they did not cause .
Mr Rehn has just pointed out that the Commission has proposed the use of a European mechanism , but that the Council was not prepared to participate .
we want to see it resolved at a European level by a decisive return to fiscal discipline across the Union .
we ought to remember what happened in 2005 when the Stability and Growth Pact was watered down .
Gro@@ tes@@ que and irresponsible behaviour caused by the populist policies of both the left and the right has brought us to this point .
you will not be surprised that solidarity is being presented by Euro@@ sceptics as a loss of Ireland &apos;s independence .
secondly , we need to advance the next round of bank stress tests and do them in an even more comprehensive and rigorous manner than last time by using the new European architecture of financial regulation and supervision which will enter into force as of January next year .
most importantly , we have succeeded in almost completely removing the barrier which , right from the beginning , threatened to be extremely unsuccessful and which required an ad@@ missi@@ bility check to take place after 300 000 signatures , before the citizens could continue collecting more signatures .
it is certain that Europe will benefit considerably from this instrument .
Parliament undoubtedly exercised its prerogatives in an exemplary manner , significantly improving the original proposal .
it has been described wrongly as an example of direct democracy .
the European Parliament is encouraging rapid , effective implementation .
Parliament &apos;s position on the new 2011 Draft Budget as modified by the Council (
7 . future of the Africa / EU strategic partnership on the eve of 3rd Africa / EU summit (
Mr President , I believe that the citizens &apos; initiative could be useful because it will allow citizens to speak directly to the Commission , but the question remains as to how the Commission will react to proposals it does not like .
yesterday , the Italian Parliament launched its first day in favour of leg@@ alising the corruption of Members of Parliament .
what Members say in the room , in a democratic room such as this , is their business , not mine .
their role is becoming clearer by the day .
this is very important , not only in view of the fact that a provisional budget has been avoided , but principally in view of the fact that we can be sure of the programming of expendi@@ tures related to cohesion policy , which is extremely important for the residents of the EU , and above all for the beneficiaries of Union funds .
in writing . - ( PT ) The request submitted by the Netherlands for assistance under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) in relation to 6@@ 13 redundancies that occurred within two companies operating within division 46 ( wholesale trade , except of motor vehicles and motor@@ cycles ) of NACE Rev@@ . 2 within the NUTS II region of North Holland fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria .
what happens if the German hus@@ band wants to be divor@@ ced in Germany , but his wife wants to be divor@@ ced in S@@ ic@@ ily because her mother is S@@ ici@@ lian ?
but has this called into question the domin@@ ation of the three American agencies which call all the sho@@ ts on the European markets , sovereign debt and hence the rates at which European States can borrow ?
as we prepare to revise this legislation , a number of instruments now appear obsolete and should be removed to make it more rea@@ dable .
I regard it as a victory for Parliament and EU citizens that the minimum number of Member States from which signatures need to be collected is a quarter and not a third , as had originally been proposed .
it is also calling for the creation of an easily accessible , free @-@ of @-@ charge online collection system for signatures .
it should be recognised that at a time when many European initiatives are viewed rather critically by the public , from the outset the European citizens &apos; initiative has largely been met with positive assessment and approval .
at the same time , those same citizens have long regarded not only this Parliament , but all European institutions as too distant and in@@ sensitive to their problems .
I welcome the re@@ va@@ mp of the EURES job information and advice portal aimed at young workers to make it more accessible to them .
stresses that the Africa @-@ EU joint strategy &apos;s founding principles should be designed to support developing countries &apos; sustainable needs in order to fight poverty , guarantee a decent income and livelihood as well as the fulfilment of basic human rights , including social , economic and environmental rights ; 3 .
the emphasis on these points , together with the explicit reference to people belonging to minorities , another fundamental value of the European Union , was the reason for my vote in favour .
in writing . - ( DE ) New media , in particular social networking sites and blo@@ gs , are opening up new opportunities for communication and advertising .
with the 2005 unfair Commer@@ cial Pra@@ c@@ tices Directive , which does not guarantee an appropriate legal framework for combating misleading and aggressive advertising , a set of new and more persu@@ asive forms of advertising is developing through the Internet .
it is significantly simpler to implement measures of this kind in new buildings than in existing older ones . listed buildings present particular problems .
the interest rates you are now charging to Ireland for borrowing , according to today &apos;s newspapers , are 3 % more than were charged to Latvia , Romania and Hungary .
in other words , it is a worse version of the reci@@ pe which led the EU into the crisis and recession and drastically exacerbated its social problems .
however , the value of the report lies in its bre@@ vity .
where do we stand on this ?
I should also like to express congratulations on the adoption by the Council in 2009 of the L@@ GB@@ T tool@@ kit .
out of cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sity , why do you always sit next to the Council ?
the final point I want to make is how I think that , more than anything , we have to look , within the review , for practical and innovative ways of getting our messages across .
A@@ lig@@ ning our efforts and our approach is a key aspect of the plan .
the US invasion of Afghanistan was undertaken not to advance the interests of the Afghan people but the geostrategic interests of the United States in Central Asia , which of course is rich in energy , oil and gas .
we have heard some fine words about combating corruption , but nothing has been done about the corruption in and around the presidential pal@@ ace .
( RO ) Madam President , while both women and children are undoubtedly an important topic , what is important , however , in Mr Ar@@ lac@@ chi &apos;s report is its clarity .
I was very pleased to have participated in some of its discussions .
the Cold War is now gone and the threats we face are increasingly asym@@ metri@@ c and global .
after parts of the Commission and some Member States had pushed for an election observation mission in Ethiopia and the report by the head of the mission could not be presented in Addis A@@ be@@ ba , it was completely hus@@ hed up in Brussels .
in particular for small , neutral countries like Austria , strengthening the strategic partnership between NATO and the European Union is of decisive importance .
that is the approach we are taking today but of course we do not participate in all aspects of NATO for exactly the reasons that have been well understood in this House .
for our part , it is imperative that we do not sla@@ ck@@ en in our efforts until the situation has stabilised .
rapporteur . - Mr President , it is only about one year since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , which envisages considerable changes in the delegation of powers by the European Parliament and Council to the Commission .
after the budget , I think this is the most important file we have to vote on , because it re@@ draws the balance of power between the European institutions .
I have done this alignment - the om@@ ni@@ bus - before , and the same commitment was given by the Commission , which it honoured with very minor exceptions .
( DE ) Mr President , a label of this kind makes good sense , but only under two conditions : the first is that it should have high visibility to ensure awareness - after all , we already have an ab@@ un@@ dance of symbols like this .
it would be very important for them to launch competitions aimed at young people in schools and universities to start a process to identify the sites , which would also become a way to recon@@ stru@@ ct a common European history and destiny and mean that they , too , would contribute to the sense of belonging and European citizenship .
this is a signal to the next generation that their active participation is very welcome .
what a g@@ lar@@ ing in@@ consistency .
at the same time , however , we must support producers who undertake to comply , but who are unable to afford the high cost of adapting by the deadline set .
the vote will take place shortly .
( FI ) Madam President , I wish to say that the Lifelong Learning programme is one of Europe &apos;s success stories , and Mrs Pack should be than@@ ked for her excellent work .
it is this diversity , along with a rich history and a great respect for heritage and its preservation , that makes Europe a unique place .
the European Union can be proud of its well @-@ developed student exchange system and of its open labour markets , which mean that every young European has a great many opportunities for intellectual and professional development .
the European Union needs to do whatever it can to ensure that the principles and freedoms governing human rights are applied , so that it can play a leading role in this sector .
preventing civilian massac@@ res remains a priority , of course , but we must not deny ourselves the use of d@@ ron@@ es , which are performing well in the areas around the border with Pakistan .
two parties are fighting for power and serious incidents have cost supporters from both sides their lives .
in this debate , it is essential to be sensible and to find a solution which takes into account both animal welfare and the economic interests at stake .
thousands of people are subject to can@@ ing in Malaysia every year .
in many African countries , sadly , homosexuality is indeed out@@ la@@ wed .
the wh@@ i@@ pping up , by some religious elements and by sections of the media , of a vicious and reactionary hom@@ ophobic campaign , which includes threats to kill gay people , means that very many les@@ bi@@ ans , ga@@ ys and bis@@ ex@@ ual and trans@@ gender people in Uganda are now living in great insecurity and fear .
when I hear the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) refer to all the things that need to happen in Egypt , then I think : what is it that we have to do and how can we refuse to accept that people are at risk here , simply because we are reluctant to take on the responsibility ?
I shall read it : &apos; invites Member States to tackle this humanitarian emergency through the voluntary resettlement in the European Union of all the asylum seekers involved in this crisis ; asks the European Commission to coordinate this operation and use available funding through the European Refugees Fund &apos; .
I understand their mo@@ tives , but as I shall demonstrate , this is not , at present , a human rights case .
this implies a complete overhaul of the partnership and neighbourhood policies that have been followed thus far , and I would insist that you attend to this , Commissioner .
countries like Spain , Portugal and Ireland may soon follow Greece as their economies become un@@ te@@ nable in the stra@@ it@@ jac@@ ket of the euro .
I believe that we still have work to do with regard to labelling .
the single market for construction products requires support appropriate to its size and specific nature , including for the vulnerable aspects which I mentioned at the start of my speech .
I believe we are in agreement that we need a positive list of what feed is actually permitted to contain .
they do not break down .
moreover , it an@@ gers me to find out that this happened because of persons who have inten@@ tionally broken the law , and that it was not out of genuine error .
the V@@ P@@ As ( Voluntary Partnership Agreements ) are good for the planet , good for our partner countries and good for the EU .
however , it is clearly better to have voluntary agreements than no agreements at all and therefore I support them .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , as shadow rapporteur for the PPE Group , I would like to start by saying that we welcome the increasing role of the EU as a trading power in every region of the world , including the Pacific region .
I therefore want to ask the Commission to take into account the dramatic consequences that this concession is going to have , firstly , for the European can@@ ning industry , and secondly , for the sustainability of the environment and natural resources of Papua New Guinea , and the very negative precedent being set for future negotiations .
we have to remember that the provisions of the Charter are addressed to the institutions and bodies of the Union , with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity , and to the Member States , only when they are implementing Union law .
in this regard , and with all our legislative ze@@ al , we must not lose sight of the fact that the EU must cooperate with the Hague Conference on International Pri@@ vate Law in order to ensure a coordinated procedure .
this applies twice over to international adop@@ tions .
finally , I will convey to Vice @-@ President Reding the points that have been made here this evening , including the question raised by one Member in relation to which an answer is expected .
this Hungarian scien@@ tist created the centre to develop scientifically @-@ based teaching methods for very young children .
the Commission has yet to produce a proposal to harmonise the maximum amounts of vita@@ min@@ s and miner@@ als that can be included in food supple@@ ments as required by the directive .
I am not going to go over all the things she mentioned , but I would like to reiterate two points .
agricultural policy must respond to European and global challenges , particularly when we take into account the fact that , according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation , food production has to increase by at least 70 % to meet the needs of a world population which , by 2050 , is set to exceed 9 billion .
I wish to stress that it is vital for the Copenhagen criteria to be implemented properly , ro@@ bus@@ tly and scrupul@@ ously for the whole region , which means Serbia as well , because they alone guarantee respect for European values , the rule of law and viable democracies .
let us not look for pre@@ texts - and I stress this once again - to pro@@ long Serbia &apos;s path to the European Union .
the future of Serbia and the Western Balkans is in the European Union .
it committed itself to undertaking a range of undoubtedly difficult reforms .
this applies to our Presidency , but it also , in fact , applies to the European Parliament , although you must be the judge of that .
one such achievement is the free trade agreement signed with South Korea on 6 October , which is , quite simply , the most ambitious commercial agreement ever concluded by the European Union , and which must remain a benchmark for our future bilateral commercial agreements .
if we have ended up with an arrangement for European supervision whereby the objectives of the European Parliament have finally been attained , then that is because the Belgian Presidency told our colleagues in the Council : &apos; that will not work , it has to be a European solution &apos; , unlike the solution developed by the finance ministers in December 2009 .
to be honest with you , this has been a somewhat une@@ ven@@ tful debate , but also one that we can take pride in , and so I happily join my fellow Members &apos; ch@@ orus of praise for the Belgian Presidency .
this was not least because - and I can say this , speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) in relation to transport - you also did not choose the easi@@ est subjects to deal with .
that means that this is a clear case of the EU exceeding its competence , which ultimately makes a proper amendment procedure for the Treaty indispensable .
in response to some of the speeches , it seems to me that we have nevertheless put the issue of services of general interest on the European agenda .
( FI ) Mr President , firstly , I would like to thank Mrs S@@ tih@@ ler for this excellent report .
this is why I , too , supported this report .
nevertheless , while our internal market is now protected , can the same be said about the globalised market we are in ?
in order to secure the survival of companies and thus jobs , barriers to trade should be eliminated .
the European Union is a global player .
the whole world knows and recognises the key role of the EU in humanitarian aid .
the Union &apos;s humanitarian policy is the practical expression of its commitment to supporting people in third countries in need of assistance when they are at their most vulnerable .
it must be consistent in the sense that it does not allow surpluses in production which distort the market and cause environmental problems , and it must be socially engaged by ensuring that all people from all social backgrounds have access to quality food .
agriculture is enormously important for global food security and we therefore need to take action .
a strong common agricultural policy ( CAP ) is essential and indeed the CAP follows this line , but it needs a reform that will make it sustainable and improve food security .
so the minimum we can and should do is to increase the capacity of the fund .
until now , the Polish Government has not asked the Commission to investigate the reasons for the Sm@@ ole@@ ń@@ sk disaster .
what additional measures would the European Union need to introduce in the energy sector , or do these measures also include the conditions you mentioned when re@@ plying to my fellow Member &apos;s question .
this will create the necessary pull for participation .
this may be the case for patients who live in border regions , where healthcare provided abroad is sometimes closer than that provided in their own country .
I am grateful to the rapporteur , Mrs Grossetête , and to my fellow Members for their cooperation .
that was how things stood before and , in light of that , the fact that we have a decision at all constitutes an enormous success .
in thanking you for your attention , I appeal for support for this directive , regardless of the final form of what is being called the safeguard clause .
what clearly emerges within this context is that the current rules that are in place are not adequate - on the contrary , they are unclear and inconsistent .
this directive is essential for our people , because the current system is complicated and it is difficult to obtain appropriate information .
during the debate in committee concerning the draft directive on cross @-@ border patients &apos; rights , there were few who , similarly to my colleague , Mr Peter Liese , did not see the dangers but rather the opportunities in this law .
at the end of the procedure , they also questioned the legitimacy of the request made by the government of upper Ba@@ vari@@ a and invited it to initiate the safeguard clause procedure pursuant to the afore@@ said directive if it continued to have doubts .
all over Europe , the costs of medicines and health insurance are rising , and everybody is trying to find ways of bringing them down .
as you can appreciate , these statistics are disturbing .
at present , one in 20 people over the age of 65 and one in five over 80 suffer from dementia .
that should also send out a signal for the coming programming period , perhaps to universities , which , in the final event , also have concrete effects .
I would like to ask you whether you intend to create a European framework to increase SMEs &apos; participation in accessing European funds for developing tourism .
as we stated in the Europe 2020 strategy , it is vital for Europe &apos;s future as a knowledge @-@ based and inclusive society that education systems are reformed and modernised to match the best in the world .
secondly , good progress can be reported on access route approaches on either side .
the Haitian people were the first in the world to free themselves from French col@@ oni@@ alism .
however , how long can this situation last ?
this is why I believe that the EU must make every effort possible to support a legitimate , transparent electoral process .
if this is a serious debate aimed at helping the Campania region and trying to find a solution to a long @-@ standing problem , then surely the resolution that we expect to vote on in February can be a common resolution .
through a dialogue with the populations concerned and with the necessary resolve , they are overcoming obstacles and objections that are often caused by N@@ im@@ by Sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me , or the idea that people do not want others &apos; rub@@ b@@ ish in their back@@ y@@ ard .
the debate is closed .
Europe should fight against all forms of discrimination and that includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation .
the complete separation of church and state is important , as hom@@ ophobia is spreading in those areas where religion plays too great a role .
two other points concern work to be done by the Member States and the institutions of the European Union together .
I think we are speaking the same language on this issue .
you claim to be democrats , but you en@@ sla@@ ve the working people of Europe to the markets , the financial markets , which lead you around by the no@@ se .
technically , do we want to acknowledge reality , which is that the euro is a virtually bankrupt currency ?
that is why I want to appeal to all those who share the European ideal to not let us be dis@@ tracted by what can be some differences of policy orientation .
ladies and gentlemen , those who support the European project are very much in the majority in Parliament .
however , I am convinced that this is exactly what the citizens of Europe expect us to do .
the aim is to develop a more coordinated approach to bring European added value to this region .
my first demonstration , holding on to my bro@@ ther &apos;s hand , was in 19@@ 56 against the Soviet invasion of Budapest .
the Hungarian Presidency and Hungary , my home country , must show that this is not true , that the em@@ pe@@ ror is na@@ ked .
they are in an honourable place , ad@@ or@@ ning the President &apos;s table .
you explain that your law is similar to that of other Member States , but even if some of them - and I am thinking in particular of my own country - clearly still have progress to make , in what other country of the Union does any part of the media risk a fine of EUR 700 000 for infringing moral standards ?
I am sure that the European Parliament will support this work and will play its role in a spirit of loyal cooperation .
( FR ) A@@ re you going to be quiet up there ?
now , at the beginning of 2011 , this mission has almost been accomplished .
the Hungarian Presidency of the EU Council has adopted as its broad objective the strengthening of the European Union &apos;s institutional , economic , social and political aspects .
I welcome the fact that it out@@ laws completely something which could be abused and that is the whole area of medical tourism .
long may that continue .
for any European strategy in this area to work , it is crucial - I am finishing - that the various countries give priority to drawing up national action plans .
it must be said that today , there is too much uncertainty surrounding the issues of access to care , reimbur@@ se@@ ments and responsibility for clinical follow @-@ up in relation to cross @-@ border healthcare . this directive is intended to allow all patients - and not only the best informed or rich@@ est - to enjoy a series of healthcare rights which have already been recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Union .
furthermore , I agree with Parliament &apos;s position that , in order to avoid discrimination against people on lower incomes , the Member State of origin must pay directly the hospital in the other Member State that is providing the treatment , without requiring citizens to settle an account in advance , or any costs incurred by the patient should at least be reimbursed immediately .
for three years now , Parliament has been fighting to establish legal certainty for cross @-@ border healthcare and to clarify the terms of reimbursement .
the market value of goods made from timber is also considerable .
environmental organisations claim that the government of Cameroon is aware of the environmental crimes being committed by the forestry industry , but that corruption is preventing the companies from being monitored and prosecuted .
in order to ensure that corruption dec@@ lines , it is important to support measures designed to guarantee the independence of the local judicial system and the creation of new judicial procedures .
I am in favour of the development of this region but I consider the derogation from the rules of origin for processed fishery products to be unacceptable .
in writing . - We Greens / EFA have abstained .
as it aims to become an important player in guaranteeing security and stability in the region , Serbia &apos;s future is closely linked to the European Union and therefore , it must make maximum effort to ensure that it becomes a full Member of the EU .
the EU &apos;s international credibility is closely linked to its capacity to act among its neighbouring countries .
Alzheimer &apos;s disease and other forms of dementia are diseases that have been aro@@ using justified attention and concern .
it is therefore vital to step up extra @-@ pharma@@ col@@ o@@ gical intervention , promoting interventions that improve the wellbeing of those affected .
in summary , this is the reason for my vote .
I therefore agree that the EU and the Member States should include the recovery and rebuilding of Haiti among their most important priorities and that the time has come to help Haiti become an economically and politically strong independent country .
all of us , whatever our views of individual religions , must admit that people have the right to practise their religion in peace .
have this House , my group and I , myself , not already asked many questions about the systematic suppression of Christians in these Islamic countries ?
I would , in any case , have acted the same if this concerned any other religion .
the European Union must develop a set of tools which will protect the right of every religious faith in practice .
we must also be careful not to label all Muslims as terrorists , because those who favour violence and extremism are in the minority .
I think it is important that we see our delegations across the world as a source of being able to see and recognise the kind of discrimination that honourable Members feel &apos; bub@@ bles below the surface &apos; , if I can use that expression , and notify us when they see it .
we should build on the national strategies that we have - where they exist - and encourage the setting up of regional initiatives and tools to jointly address security threats .
we can thus state , cal@@ mly and in full awareness of the facts , that the Belarusian democratic opposition can claim a moral victory in these elections .
our only partner should be civil society .
the response to their actions was unjustified .
he has even succeeded in char@@ ming a few politicians here , like Mr Ru@@ bi@@ ks , whose greatest concern in this situation seems to be whether the opposition will acquire help from abroad .
incidentally , it is also a disgrace that Saudi Arabia does too .
I would like to stress the need to cooperate with Libya in managing migratory flows , including an agreement to read@@ mit illegal immigrants including third @-@ country nationals , as is the case in all readmission agreements concluded by the Union .
because from the outset , these harmonised procedures will help the authorities to identify bo@@ gus applications more easily and will provide clearer guidelines for the grounds for decisions .
others provided certain elements , mainly on the costs of legal assistance and interpretation .
these differences demonstrate that the directive must be reviewed .
yet this is something we have to achieve .
first of all , I request what I believe to be a necessity , that Parliament should be informed regularly about all initiatives launched in this field .
in this respect , I think that it would be advisable to include a chapter devoted to small enterprises , with an emphasis on fair competition .
I am confident that this draft policy document will provide better guidelines for a comprehensive and successful Arctic policy in the EU that will also benefit our northern neighbours .
we , the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , demand that the Arctic should not be allowed to become the next geopolitical hot@@ spot .
I would also like to tell Mr Sø@@ n@@ der@@ gaard that I listened very closely to what he said about the majority in Iceland .
but in dealing with the High North , it is important that we are seen to be diplomatic , not dida@@ ctic ; cooperative , not coer@@ cive ; and expl@@ or@@ ative , not explo@@ itive .
again , this report is welcome and we are keen to draw on its recommendations .
the area combines EU Member States and countries which are important to regional cooperation .
I think that , as Mr Brok stressed in his bri@@ lli@@ ant remarks , the report which we are preparing to vote on today is a very good example of cross @-@ party cooperation in this House ; I have to give special thanks to Mr Pa@@ ş@@ cu , who proved to be a very active and honest supporter of this report .
5 .
it is important for us to remember our roots , which are to be found in Ju@@ da@@ e@@ o @-@ Christian values .
it is appalling that , in this area , which is simply a matter of techn@@ ic@@ alities , we have not once been able to reach agreement .
however , it also lists a whole series of violations of human rights and democracy by a regime it describes as authoritarian .
religious intolerance is becoming an increasingly frequent phenomenon in various parts of the world , and the terrible attacks against Christians in Egypt and Iraq over the last few weeks are the latest dangerous challenge posed by fundamenta@@ list terrorism .
also , I see not holding the 2014 World ice H@@ oc@@ key Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships in Minsk as being one of the most efficient le@@ vers in the proposal for exerting influence on the Belarus authorities to abandon their repressive politics .
I am voting for this report , taking into account the fact that three EU Member States are members of the Arctic Council , while Iceland is in membership negotiations .
the Arctic is therefore a major contributor of energy , raw materials and also fish for Europe .
achieving peace and stability in the region is , in my opinion , a priority objective , and guaranteeing energy security through the Nabucco project is of no small importance either .
I would like the European Union to consider the ra@@ mi@@ fications of the application of such inhumane laws on relations with Pakistan .
today , the European Parliament is asking loud and clear that the Charter of Fundamental Rights not be regarded as just a collection of papers , and that citizens not be seen as mere consumers of the common market , but as holders of inalienable and non @-@ negoti@@ able fundamental rights .
( the President asked the speaker to continue )
Mr President , while I have the floor , may I ask you to encourage our Italian colleagues to be quiet because it is really dis@@ tra@@ cting when they start speaking in the Chamber after their business has been dealt with .
her only crime is that she was prac@@ tising her profession , which is defending people unable to defend themselves against Iran &apos;s brutal regime .
the European Union holds the position that the death penalty can never be regarded as an act of justice .
it is unacceptable that , in the 21st century , Roma people still have to face discrimination on the basis of their ethnic origin .
freedom , equality and solidarity are not the privilege of a few , but a right for all , because human rights and civil rights are indi@@ visible .
ladies and gentlemen , I trust that we will have a European Council dealing with very difficult issues , where specific questions can be formulated , which will also determine the work of the Council for the coming months , and President Herman Van Rompuy will report to you about this after the meeting .
( applause )
this is a considerable victory and renewables will continue .
yes , Mr Saryusz @-@ Wolski , they include the EU &apos;s dependence on energy imports .
energy is part of the ETS and carbon price must be the main driver of development .
in the medium term , Mr President , it is important that the European Union reflects deeply on a strategic approach to reforming our neighbourhood policy as we also requested of Mr Füle yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
the EU &apos;s diplomatic efforts in Tunisia and Egypt must be focused entirely on ensuring stability and order , and resis@@ ting those who would wish to spread violence and fear as we see today .
( DE ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , I would like to repeat the call for you to provide us with the list of recipients of EU money in these countries .
( el ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , obviously the overwhelming majority in Parliament supports the u@@ prising in Egypt and that is , of course , quite right , although there are a few exceptions , as we heard just now .
the impact of this cannot be underestimated .
however , if we recall the revolution of 1989 for a moment we will remember that we had the same dilemma then .
we have no guarantee that the revol@@ t in Tunisia , Egypt and other countries in the area will not become a pretext for the seiz@@ ure of power by Islamic extremists , as happened in Iran .
we must not allow a strategy of fear to be created to make them go home .
but there is massive potential for oppres@@ sive behaviour , practices and policies within Egyptian society .
however , as in the case of a small child , it is also necessary to support this young state until it is able to be independent .
I would like us also to revise our policy , which , up until now , has consis@@ ted in not recognising the efforts of the people of the Republic of Som@@ al@@ iland , who have built a free and democratic Muslim state in the region , but one which we treat as if it did not exist .
Mrs Győri , this is very important .
ladies and gentlemen , it is now necessary for everyone to get swiftly to work because , frankly , I note that the markets are moving very quickly , much more quickly than us , in this , our time of democracy , and the authorities need to work very quickly .
to what extent has the Commission already stepped up its activity in this area ?
tuberculosis is currently a fully trea@@ table disease .
together we must defend our rights , our freedoms and our democracy .
the recommendation for second reading by Mr Mitchell , on behalf of the Committee on Development , on a financing instrument for development cooperation ( amending Regulation ( EC ) No 19@@ 05 / 2006 ) &#91; 164@@ 42 / 1 / 2010 - C7 @-@ 04@@ 26 / 2010 -
the accompanying measures are intended to support 10 banana @-@ exporting ACP countries in their adaptation to a reduction in their preferential margin as a result of the Geneva Agreement .
this is why we must remove the be@@ am from our own eye and then see the spe@@ ck in our bro@@ ther &apos;s eye , which will finally give us real , tight control over these resources .
we are demanding nothing more and nothing less than that .
Italy was condemned at the time and there is still no proper plan on the table .
there are about four or five in my city and they are only open at certain times .
I would like to thank Mr Florenz for his excellent professional work .
I welcome the proposal of stronger provisions which seek to prevent illegal shipments of this waste and to close loopholes in the law .
the majority recommendation of the committee now is to approve all the candidates , with which I personally agree .
I want to say one more thing about this which has not come up in any of the debates .
( es ) Mr President , I believe that the situation in Tunisia has caught the European Union on the ho@@ p .
I do not believe that a simple complaint , where the person is accused of making what are seen as de@@ fa@@ matory public statements , is reason enough to request the waiver of parliamentary immunity .
the need to reduce the tariffs applicable to products imported by the European Union results from the World Trade Organisation classification .
if we fail to ensure human rights and democracy , then we risk losing far more .
in writing . - ( PT ) I regard it as fundamental that Europe establishes strong relations with certain regional and global players by supporting them and establishing strong political and economic links .
under the agreement , the EU will gradually lower its import tariffs on bananas from Latin America from EUR 176 per tonne to EUR 114 per tonne by 2017 .
I approve the present report , because it takes into account the current need to integrate and increase the fun@@ ction@@ ality and effectiveness of the disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment .
these products are reaching the markets of these countries and they should be subject to the laws of the market there .
therefore , it is difficult not to agree with the rapporteur that it is the Member States which are responsible for correctly implementing the directive and establishing effective control procedures for the storage and processing of waste equipment .
I voted for the motion for a resolution on the situation in Tunisia as I agree that we need to express our solidarity with and support for the Tunisian people , and their demands for democracy and social improvements .
vaccines are the cheap@@ est and most effective public health measure for protecting Europeans from infec@@ tious diseases , but it is also important for healthcare to reach developing countries , so as to contribute to increasing life expectancy and to combating poverty .
on the other hand , some of the main risk factors increasing mor@@ bid@@ ity are alco@@ hol@@ ism , drug use and huge poverty .
there will be confusion about who is responsible for what .
the Commission and Council share the responsibility for this situation and it is important that lessons are learned for the next round of appointments .
it is therefore necessary to quickly implement a waste management plan under which , in accordance with Directive 2008 / 98 / EC , respect for the waste cycle hierarchy is fundamental .
we ad@@ m@@ ire their courage , determination and aspirations for democracy .
it is about the procedures of the European Arrest Warrant and whether it is being misused for political purposes .
they must be easily accessible , both physically and electron@@ ically - as has been said - and they must be effective and interoperable .
now , when it is still to be fully implemented in all countries , we already know that these expectations have , at least in part , been bet@@ ra@@ yed .
perhaps this will result in some kind of desirable outcome in the future .
we are very proud of this , because we achieved it at a very difficult time for Greece , in a period of crisis , and the fact that we achieved it is very important , because the first to be supported by the Services Directive , especially the points of single contact , will be small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , which we need in the European economy above all else .
since 2000 , the European Parliament has , on dozens of occasions , called in its resolutions for progress to finally be made on the European patent - with a view to the Lisbon process and the new 2020 process .
many Member States have therefore asked to enter into enhanced cooperation in this area .
the procedure is loaded with uncertainties that are concerning the large technological companies of Digital Europe , such as Bla@@ ck@@ ber@@ ry , I@@ B@@ M , Nokia , Phili@@ ps , and Sie@@ mens , the manifes@@ to for which I hope will reach everyone , despite the regrettable attempt by a European Commission Head of unit to block it .
those two languages will have no legal value , but they are of great value in terms of providing information about and communicating what is included in the patent .
this project has been on the table for more than 10 years and has regrettably been pla@@ gu@@ ed by divisions among the Member State governments .
many of us will remember how anxious members of the public were at that time and just how long the radioactive contamination lasted in certain places , such as the English La@@ ke Dis@@ tri@@ ct , where soil conditions and heavy ra@@ inf@@ all caused the ground to be contaminated for many years .
once again , this is not an accus@@ ation against you , on the contrary , but we do think that an enormous opportunity has been missed .
is it not rather the case that we are creating more bureaucracy and complicated procedures ?
I can only speak for my own country , but bearing in mind the support that the SME sector has received from the taxpayer in Ireland , that sector is the engine of growth in the economy .
thank you .
we believe that there are basically three prerequisites for implementing the strategy effectively : a list of priorities and common projects , coordination at Commission level and appropriate funding so that we can achieve the goal we all want .
if we regard the Danube and its tribu@@ taries as one large ecosystem , then I can see that this strategy for the Danube region represents a major opportunity , although , on the other hand , it requires a great deal of fore@@ sight in the way the strategy is drawn up .
the current regional differences can only be dimin@@ ished through the application of a thoroughly considered and transparent strategy which distribu@@ tes unused funds effectively , supporting local entrepreneurs and investments directly .
( SK ) Mr President , I would like to talk about the issue of collecting and st@@ oring cord blood , which is a major source of stem cells .
some done , but a lot more to do .
in this case , it was possible because we came to a compromise between the proposals of the Commission , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , and the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy on the most controversial topic .
in this case , I strongly disagree with what was said by the previous speaker , Carl Schly@@ ter .
Mr President , does the right honourable gentle@@ man really think that it is correct to vote for legislation that will , in effect , push up the cost of vehicles ?
the initial short @-@ term goal which has been set of a limit of 175 g , with a view to achieving the goal of 147 g by 2020 , will significantly increase the cost of manufacturing light commercial vehicles , making them more expensive for many small companies which use them as tools for their daily work .
that said , we need to combine ambition with realism and good sense .
the railway companies pay track access charges for every kilometre travelled , but the same system does not apply to buses and co@@ aches , which benefits bus companies .
non @-@ discrimination against and the provision of assistance to persons with disabilities and reduced mobility , as well as the right of passengers to be informed before and after their journey , have been incorporated into the regulation as fundamental rights which will be applied regardless of journey length .
a modernisation agreement between the EU and Russia will only be successful if it is based on a modernisation agreement between the Russian leadership and its own population .
you may know that since last year , a regular European Council meeting has been dedicated to discussing issues with our strategic partners .
that concludes the vote .
Madam President , I strongly support passenger rights and , in particular , increased rights for disabled people .
( it ) Madam President , we live in a market in which our enterprises operate according to global competition .
I voted in favour of this document , because it includes important amendments .
established in 1994 , the agreement permits Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway to participate in the EU &apos;s single market without conventional EU membership .
I agreed with this report , because the EU has exclusive competence with respect to various aspects of external aviation which were traditionally governed by bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries .
there are also three associated states integrated : Norway , Iceland and Switzerland ; Liechtenstein should become the fourth .
in the light of the successfully concluded negotiations with Liechtenstein and the amended legal basis , consent should be given to the conclusion of the protocol .
my absten@@ tion in the vote on the report regarding the agreement between the European Union and the F@@ ed@@ era@@ tive Republic of Brazil on short @-@ term visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports expresses a position that goes beyond the scope of the matter .
the sentence -@@ which Mr Battisti should serve in Italy - was handed down by an ordinary judge , applying ordinary laws to a common crime : mass murder .
the system established has significantly reduced the amount of administrative obstacles .
1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers ;
the agreement on the rights of bus and coach passengers that was reached by Parliament and the Council within the Conciliation Committee re@@ defines the scope of the regulation established at second reading , restricting it to passengers using road services known as &apos; long distance &apos; - defining these as services involving a journey of 250 km or more .
this text provides for , among other things , the introduction of several types of compensation : s@@ n@@ ac@@ ks and ref@@ res@@ h@@ ments if the delay is more than 90 minutes ; the cost of one night &apos;s accommodation in the event of an interrupted journey , accident or delay requiring an overnight stay ; and an upper limit in terms of refund of at least EUR 1 200 in the event of loss of , or damage to , luggage left in the company &apos;s care .
I also agree that this question should be addressed in several phases by 2011 , and not only in 2014 as the Commission proposes .
this compromise includes the short @-@ term goal of reducing emissions to 175 grams per kilometre by 2014 .
the 2020 target has been left at 147 g / km and the penalties for non @-@ compliance have been reduced from EUR 120 / g to EUR 95 / g .
I therefore voted against the recommendation since I think enhanced cooperation is unacceptable in such a delicate context as the political equality of languages , as it would create discrimination in terms of the right of equal opportunity to access the EU &apos;s fundamental freedoms .
although the purpose of creating an EU patent is positive in the sense that it would help to revita@@ lise and promote innovation in Europe , nevertheless , I would argue that this cannot be pursued with the violation of the fundamental principles of European citizenship itself , with the breaking of Community cohesion and fragmentation of the internal market or with the introduction of new factors of discrimination , inequality and imbalance .
indeed , China &apos;s intention with the programme launched in 2006 was to become a country focused on innovation , and it managed to increase the number of patents by 14.@@ 1 % , 3@@ 3.@@ 55 % and 15.@@ 9 % compared to the US , EU and Japan respectively .
it is in@@ conceivable that power should be delegated in this way to the irresponsible Commission , especially when it comes to public health .
let us be very clear : the Member States must all show respect for a responsible financial policy .
this is an absolutely clear position , and I would like to share this aim with you .
the European Union is being politically transformed for the future .
recently , 90 % of immigrants and asylum seekers in Europe have arrived via Greece .
we must make it possible for Tunisia to achieve rapid and positive economic development by means of trade with the EU and subsidies for projects there .
some Member States , such as Italy , Greece , Malta and so on , quite rightly have to deal with them and have a duty of solidarity , whereas most Member States stand on the side@@ lines as passive on@@ loo@@ kers and conf@@ ine themselves to just le@@ c@@ turing the others .
it is Italy that needs concrete help today ; tomorrow , it might be another country .
thus , a public health crisis is developing on a scale never before recorded .
to fulfil their family commitments , women are therefore more liable than men to have to accept precarious or part @-@ time work , resulting in an average gender pay gap of 18 % in the European Union .
rapporteur . - ( NL ) Madam Presiden@@ t@@ . look , I do not want there to be any misunderstanding about this .
the report recognises that in a time in which European Union citizens are particularly vulnerable , it is essential that the Member States ensure that social protection measures , and pensions in particular , are higher and more reliable , thus guaranteeing peace of mind to an ever ageing population , and ensuring that they remain economically independent .
why is the current conservative government in Hungary also dismantling the ineffective second pillar of pension provision ?
F@@ al@@ si@@ fication of medicinal products Harms both the patients and the pharmaceutical companies in the Member States .
according to the WHO &apos;s expert group , many countries in Africa , parts of Asia and Latin America have areas where more than 30 % of the medicines on sale may be falsified .
we cannot allow counterfe@@ i@@ ters to benefit from a legal vacuum , thereby endan@@ gering patients &apos; health .
these enqu@@ iries have taken place either on a systematic basis or in response to information received on the potential mis@@ appropri@@ ation of funds .
so far , this is a staff working document , which will be discussed with business leaders in two months &apos; time , and then the public consultations will start .
we ask Commissioner Füle and managing director L@@ aj@@ č@@ á@@ k to do their best in order to assure international assistance and international monitoring of these elections in such a way as to make sure that they will be free and fair , or at least that we could assess their freedom and their fairness .
Commissioner , I will be the first one to admit that this is easier said than done , but the@@ irs was a cry for help , nonetheless .
we have to go before the constitutional court or the election commission .
we also need your support to make sure that the leaders of the main opposition party and the prime minister of Albania understand our message .
internal political problems are the responsibility of the competent authorities in Bulgaria , who have to refer the issues to themselves to resolve them .
according to information from the Supreme Court of Cas@@ sation , in 2010 , 15 9@@ 46 wi@@ reta@@ pping warrants were issued , while only 1 9@@ 18 were used in court , which is 12 % of the total .
this is what we promised at the climate negotiations , and we should stick to our promise .
we have , finally , a set of statements , specifically regarding the need for the World Bank to give priority to access to local energy on a small scale .
we have energy facilities : EUR 200 million .
with regard to combating corruption , courageous steps have already been taken , but there are a few final steps that are still needed .
however , based on our experiences with other countries , I would say that Croatia needs to work on reforming its judicial and administrative systems in its own interests , too - irrespective of the accession process .
what will prove possible , however , depends on the Croatian Government and the cooperation between it , that is the ruling coalition , and the opposition in the Croatian Parliament .
in writing . - ( HU ) Croatia is one step away from the fulfilment of its historic goal .
the policy guidance and recommendations should be adopted by the Council before the summer .
in the case of economic governance and budgetary consolidation , you are quick to state : 1 January 2011 -@@ 1 January 2012 .
( el ) Madam President , poverty , climate change , low birth rates , immigration , energy and , more importantly , combating unemployment are the main problems we face today in the European Union .
( DE ) I@@ f you take a look at the measures that have been adopted here in the last few months and calculate the costs that have resulted from these , they have - not always , but very often - contributed to the disruption of economic development .
( it ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I agree that Parliament must be allowed sufficient time so as to be able to propose the best employment policy guidelines for 2020 .
on the institutional questions concerning the Employment Guidelines - which I believe continue to be our focus and provide guidance and substance - there is a clear role for the European Parliament under Article 148 of the Treaty .
given that European citizens &apos; main concern is still linked to job security , I think that the Europe 2020 Strategy will only succeed if social Europe becomes a reality .
it is therefore necessary to introduce a new European strategy to combat the ram@@ pan@@ t phenomenon of the spread of falsified medicines , with the dual purpose of being able to respond to this growing threat to public health and of being able to ensure the safety of all patients .
we are in fact facing serious demographic challenges .
I applaud the significant progress achieved in the area of public administration , the economy and the judiciary , and I am pleased that Croatia is actively cooperating over the prosecution of war criminals .
I fully agree too with the proposal to include the online distribution of drugs in the directive .
the other gives the European Food Safety Authority the power to authorise or not health claims for food supple@@ ments , including plants , an authorisation which it gives so rarely and refuses on such arbitrary grounds that it has even upset the Commission .
however , I consider the measures fea@@ tured in the report to be insufficient .
it should be remembered that in the current situation it is more important than ever to have strong institutional and financial support for SMEs , as they are the backbone of the European economy and will only manage to grow with adequate and sustainable finance is@@ tru@@ ments .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this document , because 23 million small and medium @-@ sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , which account for around 99 % of all businesses in the EU and provide over 100 million jobs , make a fundamental contribution to economic growth , social cohesion and job creation , are a major source of innovation and play a vital role in sustaining and increasing employment .
the future of the European public &apos;s pensions is one of the key challenges for the future of Europe and I acknowledge the difficulties that the Member States &apos; pension systems are en@@ countering .
if we want the European citizens of tomorrow to be motivated in their work and to be open to cross @-@ border activities , it is important , even today , to offer them the prospect of adequate and sustainable retirement pension provision , harmonised at European level .
in writing . - ( DE ) Before long the population py@@ ra@@ mid will be turned on its head in the EU : the over 55@@ s will represent the largest proportion of the population , life expectancy will continue to increase , the birth rate will remain low and young people will start their working lives ever later .
the Greek Communist Party voted against the EU &apos;s abor@@ tive anti @-@ labour paper on European pension systems .
I find it regrettable that , in her motion for a resolution , the rapporteur has chosen to give opinions about issues such as sexual orientation and its constitutional protection , which not only have nothing to do with the real issues in question , but should also be the exclusive competence of the Member States .
we want to contribute , together with our G20 partners and more broadly , to more effective regulation of deriva@@ tive markets in the interest of producers and users alike .
so far only USD 9@@ 25 million has been paid .
it is up to the Commission and the Council to translate it .
Commissioner , this situation , this crisis is providing you with exceptionally strong arguments .
however , it may be necessary to decide what role such stocks can play and how they could influence the proper functioning of the markets .
Michel Barnier , Commissioner for Internal Market and Services , has proposed new measures to curb speculation on basic commodities in the derivatives market .
I mentioned at the beginning that the High Representative and Vice @-@ President is travelling in the region as we speak .
its terms are very clear : any countries signing association agreements with the European Union must observe international law and human rights .
yesterday it was rela@@ yed in Di@@ y@@ ar@@ ba@@ ki@@ r in Turkey , and in Teher@@ an and other Iranian cities .
Ge@@ o@@ graphy and history make Europe the natural ally of the countries in the Mediterranean region .
a group of lawyers has been briefed and will have 10 days to table its proposed amendments .
all of that , too , while Hungary is holding the presidency of the Council .
there is still no source protection .
the Commission , as guardian of this legislation , has done its job very well in the past .
however , while the many advantages are both immediate and con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous , I welcome more than anything else the fact that the FTA has an effective bilateral safeguard mechanism - a safeguard that allows the EU to restore M@@ F@@ N duty rates , should it be that this particular FTA has led to or threatens to cause serious injury to EU domestic industry .
and thank you also for your words .
that is also good .
I only pick on that because I am involved in agriculture .
subject : initiatives on the management of water and drinking water
however , it is not the Bureau that makes the decisions about the timing of debates , the content of debates or speaking time - it is the Conference of Presidents , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ rely , which always tries to put too much on the agenda .
just five years ago , however , hardly anyone would have thought that it might be possible to implement it in the foreseeable future .
it is time to take clear decisions on the inspection and taxation of capital .
tomorrow &apos;s vote , therefore - and I will finish on this - is in favour of this report and the principle that the financial services should now pay its way .
the second is that we have Millennium Development Goals - poverty , water , forests , infrastructure , education and health - which have yet to be financed and which require USD 300 billion by 2015 .
at a time when supposedly ma@@ gical cost @-@ cutting policies paradox@@ ically require more income , I think it is more than necessary to institute the tax .
we managed to send out a strong signal , especially by adopting the most problematic amendment , which aims to introduce the tax at European level , rather than globally .
to maintain a balance and ensure that these goods are distributed fairly for exploitation , initiatives such as those discussed in this report should be supported .
this is what we want .
( es ) Mr President , Commissioner , it is very good news that the Commission has requested a mandate to commen@@ ce negotiations for the renewal of the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Mauritania , which will replace the current protocol as from 31 July 2012 .
killing do@@ gs is also a lu@@ cra@@ tive business for the mafia .
we cannot communicate with a regime where there are political prisoners and where there is no freedom of expression for civil society , or a free media .
as consumers , we are always reading in newspapers and other forms of media that consumer organisations have carried out tests and have always found products that do not satisfy requirements .
two months later , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) declared an influenza pandemic .
the fact that there is a systematic correlation between state of health and social class shows that these differences arise from the inadequate conditions for accessing basic social services .
firstly , the so @-@ called Economic Partnership Agreements , which we have been imposing on developing countries despite their resistance , and which severely constra@@ in these countries &apos; tax systems , along with causing other severe damage .
one of the most important contributions that the EU can make in this regard is to open up its markets for oil , for example , in order to really help the people in these countries to see a future for themselves in their own countries .
it therefore does not justify any sof@@ tening of the application of the precautionary principle or of zero tolerance of the presence of genetically modified organisations , nor ...
any kind of food dependency puts the EU in a very vulnerable position .
we have plenty of competent people in the various Direc@@ torates General and I am sure that we will be able to bring them together in an effective way .
they also need to strike a better balance between work and private or family life and to remove other dis@@ incentives to participation in the workforce by second ear@@ ners , who again are mostly women .
I should like to thank the rapporteur , as this is a genuinely good and comprehensive report .
those countries where quotas are applied , where they were already being used 20 years ago - I am thinking here of Northern European countries - have indeed shown that our objectives can be achieved through this measure and these days , people have re@@ considered their behaviour - quotas are not necessary to the same extent as they were in the past .
it will not deterior@@ ate if we remain realistic , but it will deterior@@ ate if we adopt a ut@@ op@@ ian and unrealistic approach .
it is obvious that a day like today , a day to remind us of the inequality of women , is more than necessary .
there are many aspects to this question .
equality is not an isolated value , either .
yet this holiday primarily serves to remind us that we should remember the most important issue in Europe today , namely , equality of rights for women and men , during the remaining 3@@ 64 days of the year .
thus , in the final report , the word &apos; ret@@ f@@ æ@@ r@@ di@@ g &apos; , meaning &apos; equitable &apos; , will be used .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the current economic and financial crisis has revealed serious shortcomings in the regulatory and supervisory framework of the global financial system .
if this is indeed the case , I foresee major problems in many sectors of agriculture , and especially in the livestock sector .
the lack of access to support services for their depend@@ ents , such as children , the disabled and the elderly , to adequate leave schemes and to flexible working arrangements , all impede women from working .
the German Public Prosecutor has requested the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of a Member , Mr Brok .
I would like to highlight how the report emphasises the issue of standardisation as a regulatory instrument which , in its essence , comprises an example of &apos; smart regulation &apos; , and therefore regulation which is not top down , but which comes from below , from the interested parties .
more transparency , lastly , in the sense that the text calls for an assessment of the effectiveness of vaccination strategies .
improved coordination between the responsible authorities in the Member States and the European agencies is also important .
in writing . - The EP has today thrown a spot@@ light on the disproportionate response to the s@@ wine flu outbreak in Europe .
in fact , it states that the provisions contained in the regulation can be changed under the &apos; comitology procedure &apos; whereby the Commission is assisted by management committees , chaired by a representative of the Commission and composed of representatives of Member States .
it has often been pointed out in this House that the economic crisis has highlighted the lack of regulation and supervision of the global financial system .
the European Commission , however , ob@@ st@@ in@@ ately refuses to proceed with these proposals .
global agreement would be the best way to introduce such a tax , but the UK &apos;s stamp duty on shares demonstrates it is possible to introduce a successful , well @-@ designed financial transaction tax ( FTT ) without undermining competitiveness .
the challenges facing the European Union , the result of demographic changes , require a concrete plan for combating health inequalities in rural areas .
it also argues that Member States should call a halt to budget cuts in healthcare services .
a rise in the unemployment rate and the austerity measures could exacerbate the health inequalities which already exist in the EU .
it is also important to underline the fact that a Communication on Corpor@@ ate Social responsibility will consider how to develop a system for mandatory disclosure of governance information in annual accounting .
the report also touches briefly on the problem of so @-@ called &apos; vul@@ ture funds &apos; , which I believe should be completely banned .
there is a close link between the future of the CAP and EU external trade policy .
it is therefore our duty to ensure fair competition in trade relations between the European Union and its partners .
the problem is made worse by the fact that price volatility on international markets has substantially increased .
one important consequence that this crisis has had for women concerns employment : women were affected later than men because more of them worked in sectors that have with@@ stood the effects of the crisis for longer ( health , education , etc . ) .
all these figures prove that it is now necessary to introduce binding measures .
it also calls on the Commission , the Council and the Member States to prioritise binding measures instead of non @-@ binding strategies on gender equality , and to pay particular attention to vulnerable groups of women : disabled women , older women , migrants , les@@ bi@@ ans , bis@@ ex@@ u@@ als and trans@@ sexu@@ als , women belonging to ethnic minorities , and women with little or no education and with depend@@ ents in their care , disabled women and single mothers .
the recent economic and financial crisis has resulted in a series of negative consequences that have affected the standard of living and the working lives of citizens and of women in particular .
women are traditionally at a higher risk of poverty , especially single mothers and women over the age of 65 .
one really does begin to wonder whether there are any signs of green shoo@@ ts in the economy .
they are both cle@@ ver strate@@ gis@@ ts .
the Council , with your col@@ lusion , Mr Barroso , is currently taking upon itself the right to both decide and control , in other words , basically to do nothing .
Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are likely to be able to force their proposals through , despite opposition from other countries in the euro area .
let me also recall that the Council strongly condemns the acts of terrorism committed in the territory of Turkey .
briefly , just two more areas of concern .
in his recent appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Commissioner Füle called for a new realism that avoid@@ s a strictly short @-@ term vision .
the economic development of Turkey over recent years has been truly remarkable , and its industry is becoming a significant partner of European firms in many areas .
it refuses to norm@@ alise its relations with a Member State , the Republic of Cyprus ; it maintains the threat of war against another Member State , Greece , and it refuses to recognise and apply the Convention on the Law of the Sea .
I also agree with those who are saying quite clearly that moving on the Addi@@ tional Protocol , the Ankara Agreement , and achieving progress on the comprehensive settlement talks on Cyprus , would create a momentum for the accession negotiations .
no matter how small it may be , it is certainly one that works extremely hard .
the European Commission &apos;s seven key priorities are clear and I would suggest that Prime Minister Ig@@ or Luk@@ š@@ i@@ ć &apos;s government addresses them in a determined fashion and in this way opens negotiations on Montenegro &apos;s full membership .
let me briefly outline the most important principles and recommendations of my report .
rather , it was their circumstances that did not allow them to learn .
we are not doing these people a favour .
I believe that , more than any other policy aimed at social integration , education is the most powerful instrument for improving this community &apos;s situation .
maybe they have reached a point where all they expect from the state is to provide them with aid .
the recommendation calls on the Member States in particular to &apos; recognise the individual &apos;s basic right to resources and social assistance sufficient to lead a life that is compatible with human dignity as part of a comprehensive , consistent drive to combat social exclusion &apos; .
it is now time to offer companies a single set of rules to make it easier and cheaper to do business in the single market .
who decided that , Madam President ?
we cannot think of overcoming our current difficulties - a situation that is being made worse by the ongoing crisis in the Mediterranean region - without solid action to promote our industrial and business policies , because they are the only ones that can enable us to develop and create new jobs .
I think that this is a significant step forward and I am grateful to Mr Tajani for highlighting this so clearly .
lastly , one element missing for me is the digital agenda .
industrial policy cannot function without an integrated market .
in addition to securing already existing resources , we must also be able to realise our recycling efforts .
when our industries play in Europe , they must see the same rules applied as when they play outside the European Union .
Madam President , honourable Members , as you know , at the beginning of February , the Commission approved the updating of the EU strategy on raw materials , which is based on three pillars .
the extraction of rare earth elements ( RE@@ E@@ s ) has led to serious environmental damage in China , as was the case in the past in the USA and elsewhere .
in addition , the first agreement with the African Union has involved several months of work and has cul@@ min@@ ated in an agreement within the African Union / European Union action plan , which sees Africa directly involved in a joint effort with the European Union and with the Commission .
secondly , at a time when we are trying to substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions , it would appear to be totally inconsistent with EU policies for an impact assessment of the purely climatic impact in terms of greenhouse gases of the exploitation of these deposits not to be carried out before any in @-@ depth research were undertaken .
if it is exploited locally , this asset will reduce the EU &apos;s dependency on Russian pipelines .
I do not think that there are any important events going on elsewhere .
I am glad that agreement was found in New York on the European demand to include a refer@@ ral to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court .
for years , this European Union , these Member States and Mr Berlusconi negotiated the return , for example , of refugees to Libya .
it is therefore imperative that the conflict ends immediately , but Gaddafi must not prevail .
( es ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , I believe that this debate makes it clear that the entire European Parliament is aware that this trans@@ forma@@ tional crisis in North Africa is no longer a test of European foreign policy , but is now a test of the very viability of Europe having an external policy .
moreover , humanitarian aid - meaning food , medical supplies , a ro@@ of over people &apos;s heads - must be provided for those forced to fle@@ e the war zone .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Mr President , honourable Members , thank you very much for what has been an important and , I think , very significant debate in this Parliament .
we will also take the views , through the institutions , ready for Friday and the Foreign Affairs Council which meets tomorrow .
the Commission should also propose a regulation governing such matters in order to incorporate them into Community law .
none of you , it appears , seems to understand the concept of international money .
only by changing their financial policy to be more like that of Germany will these countries be able to kick @-@ start their economies .
( PL ) Mr President , only a year ago , in view of how difficult it was to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon , none of us considered the possibility of having to amend its provisions .
that is why I do not have the slightest doubt that we shall be able to be sufficiently clear @-@ sighted and wise to overcome this crisis and give a new stimulus to development .
however , the crises of the recent past have also illustrated what can happen when the fate of people is approached from a purely financial or tech@@ no@@ cratic aspect and the major objectives , the principles holding things in place , are forgotten .
I am inclined to think that I see a fortuna@@ te conjunction of the sta@@ rs in this .
however , more could probably have been done with regard to the recognition of reciprocal rights and duties because it is essential to keep in mind the joint responsibility of Roma communities for their effective inclusion .
( SK ) Mr President , industrial policy must , as part of economic policy , aim for sustainable growth , higher employment and a decent quality of life for all Europeans .
the Democrat MEPs voted against that decision .
in this situation , it is more than justified that the European Parliament should lead by example with its proposed budget for 2012 .
as the resolution hardly , if at all , covers this area , I abstained from the vote .
we think it is important to continue the membership negotiations with Turkey and to put pressure on this country to comply with the Copenhagen criteria , because that will force it to comply with the human rights requirements and adopt a more progressive attitude to minorities like the Kur@@ ds , Armen@@ ians , As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans and Sy@@ ri@@ ans , who we believe would perhaps be the ones to benefit most from Turkey joining the EU - an EU that is genuinely democratic and prepared to accept diversity .
the Union has been reduced to an aggressive and preten@@ tious liberal doctr@@ ine .
while respecting the principle of subsidiarity , the Union must fully perform its role as a driving force and unite the actors involved at all levels so as to increase the beneficial effect of EU funds and make the Roma fully fledged European citizens at last .
the development of European industry will not happen without ambitious funding , especially in the areas of research and energy , telecommunications and transport networks ( TEN ) , and therefore in the public services which sustain the business environment .
I agreed with this report , because EU industry accounts for roughly a third of gross value added in the EU , with almost three quarters of European exports being made up of industrial goods , and a third of employment , providing subsistence to some 57 million people .
in recent years , we have witnessed the adoption of measures which cause heavy burdens for European industry and which favour the unfair competition of products imported from third countries .
when Iranian people wished to demonstrate peacefully on 14 February in support of the situation in Egypt and Tunisia , the demonstrations were forbid@@ den .
what are we waiting for in order to impose travel restrictions on these figures of the regime ?
what is more , he oppres@@ ses his own people in an appalling way .
this test is , however , a prerequisite for study at most Ang@@ lo @-@ American universities .
a particular concern is the dramatically increasing number of death penalty cases - more than 100 so far this year , as we discussed in our previous debate - and the repression of those exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly .
you are quite right , Baroness Ashton : it is not enough to decide to do something , we must also take care that it is implemented .
today , in a lengthy debate , we have listened to and largely welcomed the speeches made by Baroness Ashton .
the terrible thing is that when we come down to earth from these lo@@ f@@ ty he@@ ights - to reality - we experience considerable problems .
I should therefore like it if you could shed some light on this matter for us , Baroness Ashton .
many of them do not end up in the final documents but people - and this is right and proper - spend time thinking about the different positions .
we therefore express our solidarity with the young workers and teachers who are going to protest over the forthcoming week@@ ends , including this Saturday , 12 March , and at the large national demonstration by the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers ( C@@ G@@ TP ) in Lisbon on 19 March .
they spring from the fact that a social Europe is becoming over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed by a &apos; market Europe &apos; .
we need to be ambitious .
the author has already mentioned the idea of providing some assurances for agriculture .
author . - Mr President , I welcome the opportunity that this oral question gives us to re@@ visit the problems experienced by travellers and the wider aviation industry during last year &apos;s Icelandic volcano crisis .
last but not least - and you mentioned this - the airspace blocks , or what are referred to as FA@@ Bs : the proposal is to have seven instead of 27 .
this situation cannot be repeated in the future : there should be a plan in place for how people can be better served as regards these alternative arrangements .
no terrorist or criminal organisation is able to weaken our faith in the values which underpin our united Europe .
EU approach towards Iran (
last week in Egypt , four thousand Muslims attacked a Cop@@ tic village not far from Cairo .
freedom of the press can bro@@ o@@ k no compromise ; this is the message that Parliament wished to convey not only to Budapest but also to the European Commission .
I strongly support UN Security Council Resolution 1970 / 2011 and the measures to be taken by the Security Council , including the embargo , banning equipment that is being used for domestic repression and freezing the funds of people involved in human rights abuses , calling attention to the need to implement the EU @-@ Africa Resolution , which allows the freezing of goods that have been acquired illegally .
we must seize this opportunity to rid the Middle East of a conflict that has already caused too much pain , tragedy , res@@ en@@ tment and misunderstanding .
we must do everything in our power to eliminate negative discrimination and social repression in Iran as soon as possible , thus ensuring that the country can take its first steps towards democratic change .
the sele@@ ctiveness surrounding the countries criticised in this report and the self @-@ serving nature of this debate is clear .
only about a month ago , I met Mr Bhat@@ ti .
the European Parliament resolution on this brutal murder is our expression of opposition to the growing brutal religious ex@@ termination in Pakistan , but also unequivocally testi@@ fies that we are not leaving religious minorities , whose rights are very commonly violated , to f@@ end for themselves .
3 .
however , we have seen , for instance , how they have pur@@ pose@@ fully destroyed this heritage , which means this identity , in several places like Tibet , and now they are doing the same in the Uy@@ g@@ hur places like Kash@@ gar .
the Bureau has decided that we must learn the lessons of this unfortunate incident .
amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro (
the work@@ ings of this mechanism must respect the fundamental principles of democratic decision @-@ making , such as transparency , parliamentary monitoring and democratic responsibility .
as Parliament has said before , the structural causes of the crisis need to be tackled .
the Hungarian Presidency &apos;s aim is to close the first European Semester by the time of the European Council in June 2011 .
we need indeed to tap the full potential of the Single Market , and the Commission will soon put forward the Single Market Act with a set of a do@@ zen priority proposals to put our biggest asset to work , to deliver growth and jobs and reinforce Europe &apos;s competitiveness .
I also do not know whether we have yet rescu@@ ed the Community method .
we need to start somewhere .
( PT ) Madam President , the Portuguese Parliament will today vote against the fourth stability programme tabled by the government in 12 months .
any non @-@ euro Member State could have the same public finance problem .
if Sweden wants to belong to the EU &apos;s in@@ ner circle , as the Swedish Government says it does , it is no good sitting outside the meeting rooms .
I believe that Par@@ agrap@@ h 8 of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 provides an ir@@ refu@@ table legal basis for ensuring , by every means possible , respect for the no @-@ fly zone established with the precise aim of protecting civilians .
with this we can bring the crisis to an end ; with this we can lay the foundation for severely restricting the occurrence of similar crises .
secondly , safety .
( FR ) Madam President , the terrible disaster which struck the T@@ <<unk>> ho@@ ku region in the north @-@ east of Japan has naturally aro@@ used com@@ passion and sympathy on the part of all Europeans .
the tragic situation in Japan highlights to us once again that we need to do our utmost to create rapid response mechanisms for tackling disasters .
we should think about whether the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) should be made legally binding and whether this new regulator should be given the power to order an immediate sh@@ ut@@ down if standards are not met .
we have not lo@@ wered the targets for 2020 .
in writing . - ( IT ) Fol@@ low@@ ing the earthquake on 11 March , the consequences of the crisis in Japan for nuclear safety and the global economy have shak@@ en the European Union , which is already gra@@ pp@@ ling with instability in North Africa .
obviously we refer to global needs .
since these countries lack reception facilities , many refugees have to endu@@ re unacceptable conditions .
the matter of resettlement is one of our important tools in this regard .
thank you very much , Mr President .
thus , as we know , US Pri@@ vate Bra@@ d@@ ley Man@@ ning has gone to prison for passing information to Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
we have come a long way .
we insisted from the outset that social services , health services and gambling should be exempted from the scope of this directive , as they have nothing to do with the relationship between trader and consumer and take a different approach .
of course it is a compromise , it is not perfect .
in preparing its proposal the Commission has considered that the appropriate legislative approach needs to balance the accuracy and complexity of the reporting method with the degree of vari@@ ability in the GH@@ G intensi@@ ties of different fuels .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , firstly I would like to thank Parliament for the very clear message it has given here tonight .
I believe that the next tariff preference scheme will have to address these issues as well .
in some countries , like my country , Romania , this amounts to 50 % of all deaths .
E@@ ster@@ h@@ á@@ zy assisted in the escape of hundreds of Jews , Czechs , Slo@@ vaks and Poles , and he was the only member of the Slovak parliament , Mr Pa@@ š@@ ka , who voted and raised his voice against the anti @-@ Jewish laws in 19@@ 42 .
the European Union should therefore develop an appropriate strategy to support the process of regional integration .
with respect to market access , the agreement comprises the full range of traffic rights and investment opportunities : this means 100 % ownership and control .
finally , I would like to mention code @-@ sharing , which is being presented as a major achievement .
ladies and gentlemen , my work on this document is not yet complete .
yet how can we pursue an austerity policy in the European Union if the volume of European expenditure is only 2 % of the total public expenditure of all 27 Member States ?
the biggest bills come at the end of multi @-@ annual budgets and you know that , too , ahead of time .
the fact that we are well into the third year of negotiations indicates very clearly that it is difficult to find an agreement on this important issue .
the single procedure will also mean that the rights gap between EU citizens and third @-@ country citizens can also be reduced .
in writing . - ( LT ) I agreed with this report which increases Moldova &apos;s duty free tariff quotas for wine .
Parliament &apos;s consultation process with regard to the latest GSP was insufficient , and did not allow for wide @-@ ranging negotiation .
I believe that the Commission needs to look forward towards negotiating another stage of this Agreement covering issues including : further liberalisation of traffic rights ; additional foreign investment opportunities ; the effect of environmental measures and infrastructure constraints on the exercise of traffic rights ; and better coordination of passenger rights policies in order to ensure the highest possible level of protection for passengers .
until now , air transport between EU Member States and Canada has been regulated solely by bilateral agreements .
although the European Union and Canada have long @-@ standing economic and political ties , until today the only existing Agreement on aviation between the EU and Canada was borne out of a combination of bilateral agreements between countries .
the EEAS should pay more attention to this important region and new EU diplomatic missions should be opened in the GCC member states .
the GCC states have sub@@ tan@@ tial financial cl@@ out in the form of sovereign wealth funds , which amounted to more than USD 1 380 billion in 2009 , in other words over 35 % of the world total .
the European Banking Authority is the result of that .
we must therefore oppose any attempt to limit the budget allocations for achieving the high @-@ ranking objectives and flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy .
the directive must specify the conditions of entry into the EU and any concrete rights , but it must not create a barrier to a situation where all legal migrant workers can enjoy fair and equal treatment , but , on the contrary , should secure and guarantee such treatment .
now that this draft directive has been adopted , immigrant workers will have the same rights as national workers , at least in terms of remuneration and dis@@ mis@@ sal , health and safety in the workplace , working hours and holidays .
I agree with the rapporteur &apos;s opinion that the frag@@ mentary nature of existing legislation de@@ ters consumers and undertakings alike from participating in cross @-@ border trade .
the new consumer rights regulations include almost every type of sales , in sto@@ res , via telephone or online .
Europe &apos;s task is to protect the interests of citizens and consumers in Europe and today the House finally recognises the just protection of these rights .
in fact , extending its duration will , in my opinion , avoid the risk of a dangerous gap in the law .
the European executive must respond to this by asking for a series of cras@@ h tests to be carried out in an independent and transparent way on all of Europe &apos;s nuclear infrastructure .
like all my colleagues , in approving this motion for a resolution I express my deepest sympathy to the Japanese people who , with a great sense of civil responsibility , are reacting as best they can to the disaster .
in addition , I sympath@@ ise with R@@ on@@ an Ker@@ r &apos;s family and strongly condemn his killing .
I would like to know if this was justified , if it was just a precau@@ tion , and how vulnerable our system really is .
( NL ) Mr President , my party , the Dutch Party for Freedom ( PVV ) , has always been absolutely clear .
the role of Europe and the West should not be to act as a gi@@ ant reception home for the vulnerable populations of the world .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate my colleague for the exceptional work he has done on this report , which is so technical , but which entails real implications for the security of Europe &apos;s citizens .
that should not be the case .
it is therefore right that the report should take into account features such as short breaks or the use of the Internet to book trips .
therefore , the Commission must respond now .
safety is an important commodity , especially for the most vulnerable amongst us .
the common@@ est cause of injuries in women is domestic violence .
by per@@ mitting migration , the EU has imported problems from every country of the world , including honour killings , forced marriages and domestic violence in patri@@ arch@@ al family structures .
we have rapidly identified EUR 25 million which could be mobilised under the External Borders Fund and European Refugee Fund if and when specific requests are made by the Member States .
we should not be sca@@ red of migrants .
however , our four funds , the Refugee Fund , the Return Fund , the External Borders Fund and the Integration Fund , total almost EUR 3 billion within the scope of the financial perspectives .
how are we going to measure whether the influx is high , not high or high enough when it is all over ?
those duties will apply to so many people who are vulnerable and suffering today .
I am well aware of this and I know you will act .
by creating jobs and increasing investments in these countries , the Union would encourage their citizens to become involved in their own community .
a little comparison : if France - population 62 million - were faced with an equivalent banking crisis , the debt of French citizens would be EUR 1 trillion .
it is said that whoever wants something looks for reasons , and whoever does not want something looks for ways to avoid finding reasons .
I believe that we need to draw attention to the high level of poverty and isolation which affects women in the countryside , thereby emphasising the need for effective measures to guarantee equal opportunities for women in agriculture as a main objective of the common agricultural policy .
this case has also demonstrated that energy w@@ asta@@ ge must be reduced and the emphasis gradually placed on renewable energy .
I know you are working hard on this ; indeed , I met your rapporteurs and will be meeting your coordinators this afternoon .
I am confident that our determination over the coming weeks and months will be as strong as , if not stronger than , the determination we have shown until now in establishing the various components of our joint response to the crisis in a cohesive and coordinated way : the European semester , the Euro Plus Pact , the new strengthened economic governance framework and the steps we have taken in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility to maintain the euro area &apos;s financial stability .
nothing changes : those who caused the crisis continue to profit most from the crisis .
I have not read anything in the papers .
many Europeans may think that the choices are along the right lines , but are slow and not very ambitious .
the failure of the Irish economy would not only be a failure for Europe , but would be a failure of Europe .
this means that you are continuing to foster an imbalance in European society that weak@@ ens approval for this policy , rather than strengthening it .
that is the main task we need to deal with in order to fight poverty and create jobs , but also to secure prosperity .
it is primarily a conservative success . its implementation depends on unity .
my third point concerns EU @-@ NATO .
when the Slovak prime minister , Mrs Ra@@ di@@ č@@ ov@@ á , returned home from Brussels , she found that she la@@ cked sufficient support in the national parliament for the position she had taken in the Council negotiations .
well , the Council will work with the European Parliament to improve economic governance and , as in other cases , I am certain that compromises will be found .
I think that it is extremely important at the present time to reach common agreements involving the application of equal rules as well as common mechanisms for achieving the desired objectives .
the only refugee reception policy the Union could offer fell well short of requirements .
the Commission must produce a detailed analysis of the financial efficiency of the projects , because any future support must be conditional upon the countries being able to demonstrate that they have managed their current funds properly .
the EU is an area of solidarity and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) is part of that .
protecting human rights , increased financial resources , the development of democracies , the rule of law and bilateral agreements are instruments which , if used correctly , can certainly contribute to preventing mass migration .
these powers are now being called upon to manage the recent influx of refugees fleeing from the trou@@ bles in North Africa , especially Libya .
it is essential to facilitate women &apos;s access to farming and agricultural credit .
the lack of efficient healthcare and pre @-@ school education in rural areas is precisely what concerns women from Latvia , Estonia and Lithuania .
faced with the budgetary restrictions affecting all countries , Parliament will only agree to extend its assistance if EU funds have really served to improve the security of energy supply , modernise infrastructure and develop sustainable energy projects .
national authorities must finalise detailed decommissioning plans as a matter of urgency .
the main export control tool is Regulation ( CE ) No 4@@ 28 / 2009 , which introduced a number of significant changes to the scope of dual @-@ use export controls -@@ use items in the European Union .
but the most contentious and important issue was the question of whether it is sufficient to control , notify and register after the export has taken place or prior to the export .
free competition , the fight against protectionism and obstacles to the den@@ un@@ ci@@ ation of agricultural export subsidies are some of the many absur@@ di@@ ties endorsed by this text .
I am in favour of establishing a legal framework that gives immigrant women the right to hold their own passport and residence permit , and makes it possible to hold a person crimin@@ ally responsible for taking these documents away .
I therefore welcome the rapporteur &apos;s proposals , in particular the establishment of refu@@ ges for victims , an emergency number , and the institution of the European Year of Combating Vi@@ ol@@ ence against Women .
if you suspect , Mr Oettinger , that there are stress tests that will not produce the desired result because the systems to be tested may not survive the test , then why does the Commission not intervene straight away to close these plants ?
I do not think any other approach would be advisable at this time .
please raise a white card - or any other .
he said : &apos; I feel very strongly that there is no one apart from us to do this work and that we cannot go home until we have finished the job &apos; .
it also reaffirms the Commission &apos;s deep conviction that the European Union cannot tolerate any form of racism , xenophobia , discrimination or social exclusion of Roma .
when talking about Roma integration , we should not forget that we are talking about the most specific and , perhaps , the most complicated issue in Europe and the European Union .
there are many ways to save money for the European taxpayer .
it may well be that I will then be among them .
these problems are not solved by EUR 100 million for youth policy , but that does respond to Parliament &apos;s priorities .
in 2010 , more than EUR 2.4 billion of payments under the Regional and Social Funds were preven@@ tively interrupted .
why are problems encountered with access to databases if the Commission claims that it supports the work of OLAF and considers it just as important as we do ?
the report repeatedly highlights the un@@ usually low levels of fraud and irregul@@ arity reported by various countries in relation to agricultural expenditure , structural funds and pre @-@ accession funds .
compared to the status quo , current military operations have not affected the level of humanitarian access , because it was restricted from the beginning of the crisis by forces loyal to Gaddafi .
we need the support of the European Parliament , particularly after the Treaty of Lisbon and the increase in competen@@ cies awarded to the European Parliament , and I believe - and I say this as a former Member of the European Parliament - that this collaboration between the European Parliament and the Commission will lead us to achieve good results also in this sector , which is so crucial for growth and competitiveness in our European economy .
I appreciate that it is very difficult .
nearly all of the Member States have now set national R &amp; D intensity targets , to be finalised in their national reform programmes by the end of April 2011 .
all of those taken together improve substantially the situation for SMEs and obviously , under the common strategic framework , I have no doubt that we will get other very good ideas about what else we might be able to do to help them .
under the Waste Framework Directive , Member States are obliged to introduce by 2015 separate colle@@ ctions for paper , me@@ tal , plastic and glass .
we now need this , which has worked at national level , to work at European level .
it is particularly important for the formation of political parties &apos; internal management bodies to be based on transparent principles , in order to ensure the democratic election of all party bodies and democratic decision @-@ making processes .
the Commission ?
in that opinion , the view of the Committee on Legal Affairs was - and I am quot@@ ing directly from the text - that &apos; the purpose of the proposed decision is to require Greenland to transpose EU health rules as a condition for the application of the EU internal market rules as regards fisheries &apos; , as specified in Article 3 of the proposal itself , which guarantees that the agreement &apos;s rules will be adapted to the applicable rules established in the Union as regards animal health and food safety , as well as the common organisation of the market in fishery products .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I want to congratulate all the rapporteurs on the presentation of their reports and , due to the time constraints , I want to conf@@ ine my remarks to the G@@ reli@@ er report .
I appreciated the Commissioner &apos;s position , including her personal position relating to the participation of Members of the European Parliament , and I hope that this personal position of hers may influence the institutional position of the Commission , so that we achieve the objective that we are working towards .
I greatly value the Commission &apos;s work in this respect and , in particular , the excellent work done by Commissioner Barnier , whom I would like to congratulate once again for his determined commitment and his efforts to revive the internal market .
that is why this year , with my colleague , Mr De Gucht , we are planning to table legislation that will transpose our international obligations on public procurement contracts into EU law , and this will give us the lever for negotiation that we need .
today , we are discussing how we can bring some momentum to the internal market .
Mr President , I very much hope that it will be possible to rescue the 200 people who are in distress , because this is a very important matter .
the important thing is that this should be an opportunity and not an imposition , as some directives have often become in the past .
to encourage the creation of a market for Europeans , greater coordination of trading activity should be a priority in order to control goods from third countries .
these are a reality with real businesses demonstrating economic pluralism and the pluralism of business .
many sectors still remain closed , many practices in our Member States hinder the free flow of services , and the flagship idea of the Services Directive - the points of single contact - is not fully working .
the Single Market must be deepen@@ ed and geared again towards citizens and their interests .
they are entirely your responsibility .
I take note that the discussion in Parliament on the issue of asylum seekers did not have the inf@@ lam@@ matory tone frequently used in several EU Member States .
another waste of money : how many billions is this House of History going to cost , to sell propaganda and tell how the European Union &apos; saved the world &apos; ?
these are Poland , Slovakia , the Czech Republic , Hungary , Croatia and Romania .
we consider the mobilisation of this support to be important and necessary , and we therefore voted in favour of the report .
I voted for the adoption of the report , including the release of funds for the Czech Republic and for Croatia , which presents a similar case .
this is clearly not a sufficient reason for the EU to stop advancing towards the establishment of the free trade area it agreed to with those same de@@ spots .
for this reason , establishing general rules for trade and the importation of fishery products originating from Greenland cannot be left entirely to the Commission and the Council because this would contradict the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
in view of the terrible tragedies that have taken place , such as the recent sin@@ king of a Libyan boat off Lampedusa , this revision is vital , particularly considering that an applicant &apos;s chances of obtaining asylum may differ greatly according to the Member State .
it was in May 1999 , following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , that work on the creation of a common European asylum system ( C@@ EAS ) started , on the basis of the principles approved by the Tampere European Council .
it is a positive step to establish a regulation that will take account of tourism statistics from all Member States .
access to facilities , services for disabled people and costs for essential goods are key data that require an up @-@ to @-@ date database that users can consult .
environmental and health monitoring and surveillance could accordingly be carried out . this would help make the sector more sustainable .
unfortunately , the rapporteur and the majority in Parliament , following the Commission &apos;s position , have prevented that .
it requires an amendment to the Statute for Members .
this resolution concerned the authorisation and refusal of authorisation of certain health claims made on foods and referring to children &apos;s development and health .
further , even if generally accepted scientific evidence shows that DHA in breast milk contributes to the visual development of inf@@ ants , there is currently no scientific consensus on a possible ca@@ usal relationship between the in@@ take of formula supplemented with syn@@ th@@ es@@ ised DHA and better visual development of inf@@ ants .
for investment agreements to further benefit these countries , they should also be based on investor obligations in terms of compliance with human rights and anti @-@ corruption standards as part of a broader partnership between the EU and developing countries for the purpose of reducing poverty .
I agreed with this report , which calls for measures to be taken and resources to be provided to ensure that EU funds are not subject to corruption and also to ensure one @-@ stop transparency of the beneficiaries of EU funds .
this report on the fight against community fraud goes in the right direction , focusing on the need to demand greater clarity , and reite@@ rating the absolute necessity to never lower our guard .
I advocate , along with the rapporteur , that we need changes to the financial regulations governing the funding of European parties and political foundations , and that funding must be allocated in full at the start of the year .
in the last European elections , a mere 4@@ 0.@@ 3 % of Fin@@ ns who were entitled to vote actually went and voted .
however , I voted against this report in the final vote , in order to show my total disagreement with the rejection of Amendment 10 .
this dialogue takes on specific and diverse con@@ no@@ tations in relation to the life of all of us Europeans , but it becomes much more relevant when one considers the creation of a Single Market aimed at revita@@ lis@@ ing the entire European economy and improving communications between legislative bodies and the direct beneficiaries .
I am very pleased at the adoption of three resolutions on relaun@@ ching the Single Market which strengthen governance and the role of businesses and growth , as well as that of citizens , in this policy .
with Mr Cor@@ re@@ ia de Cam@@ po@@ s &apos;s report , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have fought for better regulation when it comes to strengthening the Single Market , and for this strengthening to serve the general interest of Europeans and not just that of businesses .
to this end , I agree with the need to encourage e @-@ commerce able to promote cross @-@ border trade , the coordination of fiscal policies and greater streamlining of cross @-@ border public contract procurement , points on which the European SMEs lag behind .
true to neoliberal ideology , it bla@@ mes administrative regulation and the protection of public services for impe@@ ding growth .
based on the latter report , the European Council will evaluate the preliminary results by the end of the year .
do you really believe that the national regulatory authorities will suddenly realise that they have been doing a bad job up until now and have been too tolerant ?
two older power stations in Germany , 180 km from Strasbourg , have been temporarily shut down and dis@@ connected from the grid .
do you still believe that nuclear power stations are safe or do you share my opinion that Z@@ w@@ en@@ ten@@ dor@@ f is the only safe nuclear power station in the world ?
safety limits have been greatly exceeded and we do not know what will happen in the near future .
thirdly , an independent body should carry out these tests .
however , there are countries which are in the process of building nuclear power stations , Finland , for example , and there are countries which currently have nuclear power and are planning new plants and others which do not have nuclear power and want to build their first power plant .
although , in Europe , there is a legal framework initiating constant improvements in the technology , there will be a need to invest extensively in research and training , in order to guarantee the highest possible level of safety and the protection of health and the environment , in line with the latest scientific and technical findings .
it is time to take action .
this little country lies in a strategic position in terms of the balance of the Gulf and energy supply distribution .
States make a sole@@ mn , but usually un@@ written , Covenant with their troops to send them into battle and risk their lives , but only when the vital interests of the nation or nationals are at stake .
it has made significant progress on official development assistance ( ODA ) as well as on policy coherence for development .
on 17 June 2010 , the European Council unanimously decided to grant Iceland candidate status .
a negative result in the forthcoming referendum in Iceland on this issue could prove a serious handi@@ cap with regard to support from the UK Government .
the divided banking sector and public debt amounting to 90 % of GDP are alarming .
we believe the country is ready to engage in a higher level of integration with Europe .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , the Committee on Foreign Affairs has delivered a good and balanced report on the progress of Macedonia , and we as Greens will gla@@ dly support it .
I consider it unacceptable , and even down@@ right scandalous , that there has not been any substantial progress in this regard in the past year either .
shortly afterwards , the Re@@ publi@@ can forces loyal to the democratically elected President A@@ las@@ sane Ouattara launched a ground offensive on Laurent Gbagbo &apos;s last stron@@ gh@@ old in A@@ bid@@ jan in order to force him to hand over power .
was that action justified ?
we have been talking here this week about refugees coming from North Africa to Europe , but we have also heard reports of nearly a million fleeing to neighbouring countries which are almost as poor , or even poorer , than Côte d &apos;Ivoire .
the resolution draws attention to the urgent need for more operational financial instruments with which we can support economic development , the modernisation of infrastructure and investment in areas , where they are effective ... where the effects may be somewhat less visible , but which will be felt in the long term , for example , in education , integration of research and academic institutions and the introduction of new technologies .
I agree with the new orientations , du@@ b@@ bed &apos; the three Ms &apos; : &apos; money , market access and mobility &apos; .
is the European Union itself a champion in all these fields , taking into account , for example , the situation of the media in Italy and Hungary , mass sta@@ tele@@ ss@@ ness in Latvia and Estonia and the suspicion of corruption in our Parliament ?
some Members from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party have become so enam@@ oured of Y@@ u@@ lia Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko that a Ukrainian government without her seems undemocratic , despite the fact that the government has managed to improve the economic and political situation of the country substantially over the past year .
Madam President , the forced so @-@ called vir@@ g@@ inity tests inflicted by the Egyptian army on women protest@@ ors in Tah@@ ri@@ r square and the multiple rape of a Libyan woman by soldiers are horrific crimes which have given rise to today &apos;s motion for a resolution .
as we are discussing today possible solutions for ex@@ iting the financial crisis , this brings us to the subject of transparency and tax havens .
I am happy to make the reports available , but I cannot answer the question in detail right now .
the infrastructure must be made into a well @-@ functioning whole .
we borrow in Asia and the United States , and with the resources thus collected , we can finance projects on favourable terms .
I hope that the Council will demonstrate sufficient flexibility so that this legislation can be adopted on time before the start of the season in which bluetongue can break out .
let us get on with this now , agree a fast track for urgent issues of this kind , and get on and get our livestock vacc@@ inated .
the next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on EU toma@@ to imports from Morocco ( petition 15@@ 65 / 2009 by José Maria Poz@@ an@@ co@@ s ( Spanish ) ) , by Er@@ min@@ ia Ma@@ zz@@ oni , on behalf of the Committee on Petitions - B7 @-@ 02@@ 11 / 2011 ) .
5 .
this resolution divided opinions right across Parliament .
we really need to present a concept and understanding of what human rights mean .
over recent years , advances have been made in the field of animal vaccination .
a resolution on this subject cannot be centred around the issue of nuclear safety without addressing the most important nuclear safeguard , which is an exit strategy from nuclear energy itself .
Fourthly , my country , as a result of the EU &apos;s mis@@ guided regulations to date , has been forced to halt essential investments in coal power stations , and now the same lobby is saying that we need to halt investments in nuclear technology .
no exit strategy has yet been guaranteed with a view towards actual changes to European energy policy , which needs to move towards the setting out of alternatives , and a phasing out will enable the nuclear industry in Europe to be progressively abandoned .
we cannot decide to get rid of nuclear energy without establishing what sustainable energy sources will be available which can meet the EU &apos;s energy demand in the years ahead , at prices which citizens can afford .
yet this is not making the opposition a fully democratic alternative .
consequently , the recent official request submitted by the poor countries for export restrictions to be lifted cannot be ignored .
we await future developments , specifically the referendum on 9 April 2011 , for a clearer position on the country &apos;s membership .
the current political situation , which includes the boycott of the national parliament by opposition parties , may adversely affect the country &apos;s priorities with regard to the EU .
indeed , you only support the results that suit you .
in the light of the recent events in the Mediterranean basin and of their direct and indirect consequences for European countries , we must carry out a swift and thorough review of European Neighbourhood Policy .
immediate steps must be taken as a matter of urgency to put a stop to this degrading treatment , and to ensure that all the security and army forces are clearly told that torture and other forms of ill @-@ treatment will be the subject of a thorough investigation .
however , we disagree with transforming the EIB into a mere tool for the EU to implement its policies , as well as addressing the problems of social and economic cohesion and social development , which should be considered in the EU budget and EU structural and cohesion funds .
today &apos;s news , which Mr Pre@@ da highlighted , is very significant because now , we see how dictators copy from each other and compare notes .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Mr President , the detention of the distinguished Chinese ar@@ tist , Ai Wei@@ w@@ ei , at Beijing Air@@ port on 3 April as he was attempting to travel to Hong K@@ ong , has rightly drawn international concern .
the pressure from China is something that we have to do everything we can to counter , and if we do not do it right now , when we are trying to launch this dialogue with the Chinese , I am afraid that we will never do it .
what these resolutions are about is ensuring that he and his colleagues from the M@@ DC have renewed motivation to continue their work .
what we hear from this country today is simply intolerable .
I must have mis@@ understood and I should therefore like some clarification on this matter .
it is in our interests to preserve this activity ; by doing so , we can develop our territory and coastal regions , ensure the European Union &apos;s food security and safeguard jobs in the sector .
what needs to be proposed is aid , and any Member States wishing to defend their sectors will also be able to defend them .
fuel prices have tre@@ bled , which has naturally raised the question whether EU legislation is adequate and suitable for the economic reality and meets European fishermen &apos;s needs .
so this would result in creating an uneven playing field in our sector , favouring the rich@@ est countries .
both public and private broadcasting are essential guaran@@ tors of media pluralism and diversity of opinion in Europe .
the qualities that these frequencies possess in terms of coverage and penetration of buildings are universally recognised : they are called gol@@ den frequencies .
as has been said , spectrum is a scarce resource , but it is also a public good , and we have the responsibility to use it as well and as efficiently as possible - a point that Ms Trautmann also made .
we know that any aid earmarked for Pakistan would not be used to help the people hit by the floods almost a year ago .
we believe that , exceptionally , trade preferences can be conce@@ ded , provided that they take into account the sensitivity of European industry and , in particular , of the textile industry , which is suffering badly from the consequences of the crisis in regions like the Community of Valencia in Spain .
in this regard , I am thinking of Christian minorities and women &apos;s rights .
we are fully aware of the views of the European Parliament in this respect and will take those into account .
we are bound by the principle of policy coherence for development , which is enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty , and it tells us that none of our policies must harm development .
Nic@@ col@@ ò Rin@@ al@@ di gave the example of trains , which is obviously one of the major sectors , given the difficult position of India with regard to infrastructure .
author . - Madam President , an EU @-@ Japan free trade agreement clearly has the potential to create significant numbers of European jobs and to benefit European companies , and the reason for that is that EU penetration of the Japanese market is currently extremely modest by comparison with EU exports elsewhere .
meanwhile , the compar@@ a@@ tively small , but dynamic , economy of Switzerland already has a trade treaty with Japan , and has had since 2009 .
another problem we have here is the fact that we cannot even use the reasoning of providing maximum protection for investments .
I think it would be a good thing if the other groups would reconsider this issue and recognise that the compromise on the table is actually a very good solution that tries to ca@@ ter to all needs .
the next item is the one @-@ minute speeches on matters of political importance .
I will give three examples in the 20 seconds I have left .
the role of forests in the European Union &apos;s energy strategy is another important point because their potential as a renewable energy source is currently unde@@ re@@ x@@ plo@@ ited .
thank you also for the guidelines that will help the Member States .
the European Court of Auditors has carried out an extremely thorough investigation of the financial management of the 8@@ th , 9@@ th and 10th European Development Funds , not only in its annual report but in a great many special reports , and made really good and really valuable comments .
we should , in fact , have administrative sanctions for minor offences rather than the criminal system that is currently employed in my own country .
obviously , it is good that we are going to have such a muse@@ um , but what distur@@ bs me greatly about this is that , in this plenary chamber , we have never really had a serious debate about this project .
( NL ) Madam President , rapporteur Chatzimarkakis and many other speakers have rightly highlighted the need for Member States to submit declarations of assurance .
yet on the other hand , we rely on them when problems arise almost overnight ; for example , if increased FRONTEX personnel are required in the Mediterranean or if diox@@ in is found in animal feed .
he spoke very clearly ; we may not like what he said , but at least he was clear in what he said and we are grateful for that .
2009 discharge : European Centre for the Development of vocational Training (
it should therefore read : &apos; the European Parliament notes that the option of drawing a reduced pension from the age of 50 and the option of receiving a lu@@ mp sum equivalent to 25 % of pension rights have been abolished &apos; .
another three months have passed , and there is still an entirely insufficient response by the EU and the WTO .
in writing . - ( PT ) In the last few years , there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of agencies , so the Interinstitutional Working Group on Agencies is crucial , as is the forthcoming special report by the Court of Auditors , with a study on these agencies &apos; performance and a comparative analysis of their costs .
the European Parliament welcomes the fact that the Centre will carry out a mid @-@ term review of its strategy for 2008 @-@ 2012 ; however , it invites the Centre to further develop the ap@@ pra@@ is@@ al of its own performance , by improving the synergies between its strategic activities and the activities foreseen in its work programme and by reviewing the indicators for monitoring its performance in order to comply with smart criteria .
clearly , every debate on discharge has its own specific context and today &apos;s discharge has taken place at a time of economic and financial crisis , which has created both financial and budgetary problems for some Member States .
in writing . - I voted to give the European Environment Agency discharge on its budget .
in writing . - I voted to grant discharge to the European Maritime Safety Agency for its 2009 budget but call on the Agency to further reduce the number of pos@@ teri@@ ori commitments ( i.e. legal commitments that were entered into before the corresponding budgetary commitments were made ) ; reminds the Agency that , since 2006 , the Court of Auditors has reported infringements of Article 62 ( 1 ) of the Financial Regulation ; welcomes , nevertheless , the Agency &apos;s efforts to improve this situation by providing ad hoc training to avoid pos@@ teri@@ ori commitments .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the report on discharge of the budget of the European Foundation for the improvement of Living and Working Conditions ( Euro@@ found ) for the financial year 2009 , since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions .
in writing . - ( DE ) I abstained from voting .
I think , however , that even though it is to some extent justifiable as it is still in the start @-@ up phase , the Undertaking should complete the implementation of its control systems and operate more carefully and transparently in the coming years .
Mr Gollnisch has requested that the European Parliament defend his parliamentary immunity in connection with measures which he claims restrict his freedom applied by the French authorities as part of the judicial investigation of an action and claim for compensation ( pla@@ in@@ te a@@ ve@@ c constitution de parti@@ e civi@@ le ) brought by the International League Against racism and Anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism on 26 January 2009 against an un@@ named person for incitement to racial hatred .
this agreement was approved at the 36@@ th session of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) Conference held in Rome in November 2009 , roun@@ ding off a debate process that had been preceded by a set of other agreements and codes of conduct adopted over the last two decades under the umbrella of the FAO .
at the moment , this activity is partially blocked due to the reluctance of creditors in one Member State to grant loans to deb@@ tors living in another Member State .
moreover , to guarantee effective enforcement the courts must be able to order the disclosure and freezing of the debtor &apos;s assets within the context of measures to provide interim legal protection .
I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge in respect of the general budget of the European Union because I take the view that the funds have been managed in a transparent and , overall , efficient way , including in the light of the particular circumstances that the European economy encountered in the period in question .
in writing . - ( DE ) I cannot vote for the discharge of the European Parliament budget on the basis that the wand@@ ering cir@@ cus between Brussels and Strasbourg alone is unsustainable for taxpayers .
the sums are allocated for specific purposes and the aim of the discharge procedure is to check in retro@@ spe@@ ct that these purposes have been adhered to .
one of the most serious results of these measures could be in Portugal , where the textile and clothing industry represents 11 % of exports and 160 000 jobs , and would be hit hard by subsidised competition from Pakistan .
furthermore , the Greens fea@@ red that the measures might pave the way for the inclusion of Pakistan in the GSP + scheme without the country having signed and implemented the corresponding labour and environmental conventions ( let alone the Geneva conventions ) .
as the new investment policy will be developed in view of the transitional validity of bilateral investment agreements concluded by Member States , it should acknowledge the rights of investors whose investments fall into the scope of those agreements and should ensure their legal certainty .
this country has had notable successes in fighting corruption , which is a significant problem in all post @-@ Soviet countries .
at the Council meeting on 12 May 2011 the Presidency plans to initiate discussions on the various ideas on the Schengen acquis which have been put forward by the Commission in its communication on migration of 4 May .
if courts in the European Union are now ruling that Dublin II is to be ineffective - in other words , that refugees are not to be depor@@ ted to their states of first arrival - then we must ask the Commission how committed it will be to taking action against those states that are obviously not currently implementing the existing law .
( applause )
however , what needs to be done above all is for the European Parliament to stake its claim to competence to decide on the issue alongside the Council .
any authorities that breached international maritime and humanitarian law must be brought to book .
Schengen is a European symbol and is the perfect combination of freedom to travel , open borders and security .
tens of millions of Europeans will travel this summer .
finally , the Council awa@@ its with interest the revised proposals of the Commission concerning the procedural directives and the reception Conditions Directive , which are expected , if I am not mistaken , in early June .
we Hungarians can really understand the importance of this , since hundreds of thousands of our com@@ patri@@ ots were taken in by many countries of the world after the 19@@ 56 u@@ prising .
they do not need to be added to this Register : but , if they have separate offices exclusively tas@@ ked with maintaining contact with European institutions , they must be included in their Register , though subject to a different legal regime to stakeholders .
you cannot stop this because it is perfectly normal - we live in a free and open society - however we need to make our voice heard within this structure and maintain our independence .
I close by saying the following .
( LT ) Mr President , the causes of the Chernobyl disaster include mistakes in project design and the failure to test the reactor in extreme conditions .
the responsible politicians need to distance themselves from over @-@ hasty solutions .
that is why I will present my position on behalf of the Commission tomorrow evening to all 27 nuclear watch@@ dog bodies , based on thorough ground@@ work , telling them that we need to take all risks into consideration , regardless of their origin .
and why do we do that ?
in view of the fact that we are running very late , however , I will limit myself to one consideration , if I may .
I do not hide the fact that the Council &apos;s vol@@ te @-@ face makes me confident for the future .
2013 is still a long way off , so I am pleased that the Commissioner wishes to bring forward the date for legislation that will provide full information for consumers .
adjusting legislation is one way of defending our competitiveness , but there are other industrial policy initiatives in the works as well .
then , we should be measuring , taking the temperature , constantly taking the pul@@ se .
the financial crisis should have taught us all to value transparency .
however the ti@@ tles held by the banks until final maturity are listed in the banking book .
Mr Z@@ em@@ ke asked a rather broad question about future threats and risks .
this ca@@ vali@@ er approach to disposal leads to environmental and health problems in these countries that can cause many fatalities in extreme cases .
the solution has to be bi @-@ direc@@ tional : the administrative burdens of enterprises that recy@@ cle and dis@@ pose of hazardous waste legally has to be reli@@ ev@@ ed , and of course in parallel , producers of hazardous waste should be encouraged to choose the legal course and made interested in restra@@ ining the hazardous waste mafia .
but , as honourable Members know from the letters I have received individually and collectively in this House and beyond , there is no simple solution here .
it is why it is good to see the Nig@@ erian elections going well and G@@ ood@@ luck J@@ ona@@ than now being appointed properly .
Syria is a huge disaster .
the first part of the report particularly concerns the relationship between Parliament and the other institutions , primarily the Council and the Commission , driven by the post @-@ Lisbon approach to European politics .
Mr Tannock , you talked about many things to do with the support of the 27 , your desire to see us get the proper resources and being short @-@ changed .
I would like to make this quite clear to Mr Tannock and his tory friends .
however , it is a test that we have to pass successfully and with dignity .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
for precisely this reason , we must do all we can in order to launch the service as soon as possible .
I know it is difficult for you to carry out your work , Mrs Ashton , because you are on your own and it was not you who decided this - this is how the EEAS was set up - but the impression is being given that in the autumn , we thought Belarus was the most important issue , while today - a little like children who have become interested in something else - we are looking at North Africa .
faced with these many crises and threats , we cannot just hand over the keys to our US friends and allies or to NATO .
aggressive wars in which European nations have no legitimate interest must be avoided at all costs .
on our delegations , I support trying to strengthen what we have in our delegations opening in B@@ eng@@ haz@@ i , and what we do in Iraq .
our common European values nevertheless allow us to build a European foreign policy that relies on sustainable development and human rights .
paragraph 36 , Par@@ t 2 , and paragraph 37 shall be put to the vote by roll call .
I would point out that last October , Parliament , by a large majority , voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation on the indication of the country of origin of certain products - including textile products - imported from third countries , and that to date , the Council has not opened negotiations or discussions with Parliament , even on an informal level .
Mr President , the government of Singapore and the authorities in Hong K@@ ong and Shan@@ g@@ hai are sc@@ ouring London and the other financial centres of Europe looking to recruit the people who have been driven abroad by the excessive regulatory burden being imposed by the European Union .
Mr President , I voted against the report on the EU &apos;s common foreign and security policy .
as they are amended , it becomes difficult to understand which provision is currently in force .
it provides more clarity , because various provisions regulating the same issue are often spread over different legal texts .
in writing . - I voted for this report for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the operating space , access to the driving position and the doors and win@@ dows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors ( codified text ) .
I support this report because this proposal involves no more than a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance .
this provision is very useful , in particular , for those consumers who have an aller@@ gy to lea@@ ther goods , and to consumers who , for ideological reasons , do not want to buy textiles containing elements of animal origin .
given that the interim agreements / stabilisation and association agreements ( SA@@ As ) grant trade concessions to Bosnia and Herzegovina on the products identified in the autonomous trade preferences , these concessions have to be withdrawn from Council Regulation ( EC ) No 12@@ 15 / 2009 .
I agree with the rapporteur &apos;s opinion that the need for one single internal market is crucial for Europe to take a leadership in the global economy , with a focus on the service sector and the knowledge economy .
wireless broadband is essential for ensuring that new and innovative services are available to all citizens .
this will bring new jobs , create new services and attract new investment to Europe .
Parliament and the Commission are setting a good example by establishing a common transparency register to provide accreditation for lobbyists and other interest groups .
they represent the general interest , and should therefore be distinguished from lobbyists , who defend individual interests .
the common register will be a step forward towards greater transparency in the European institutions , which hopefully will help give the European project greater legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens .
Representative democracy can function only when citizens communicate with their elected representatives and ask them to promote their interests .
the Commission regards the strengthening of corporate governance as central to its financial market reform and crisis prevention programme .
although the most extreme poverty has not disappeared , it is no less true that sur@@ ges and flows of prosperity have raised India to a more prominent international role , and have revealed that its economy and society are prosper@@ ing and innova@@ ting quickly and efficiently .
the EU and Japan are significant partners and investors in each other &apos;s economies with a combined volume of Foreign Direct Investment worth EUR 200 billion in 2009 .
I welcome the adoption of this report , which draws attention to the neglect the sector has suffered and calls for recognition and appreciation of the diversity of species existing in the EU , as well as of the need to implement a modern and active forestry policy that is able to take advantage of the area of biomass and of carbon credits , as well as of traditional activities .
consequently , those wild species that naturally colon@@ ise these special habitats that the forest provides merit particular attention from forest owners as they contribute to preserving biodiversity .
I cannot agree with this prospect : the Member States would no longer be able to establish their own foreign policies on the basis of what they de@@ em to be national priorities .
I am a supporter of the common European foreign and defence policy , where the word &apos; European &apos; is of the greatest importance .
the ongoing uphe@@ aval@@ s , which will increase after the death of O@@ sama B@@ in La@@ den , must be tackled in full compliance with the Treaty of Lisbon .
at present , the EU has a legal personality , which provides it with a higher global profile .
I voted in favour of this report because the EU &apos;s role in multilateralism will need to be further reinforced in the years to come .
that really would have been a step in the right direction .
you have listened to everything that we have to say on this subject .
we must be more self @-@ confident if we want to implement this in the face of opposition from third countries .
thus , consumers still have no way of knowing , whether , for example , the milk they are drinking comes from cloned animals .
these initiatives were created as the result of wide @-@ ranging consultations with associations of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises and the relevant authorities .
( RO ) Mr President , at the end of March 2011 , the European Union had an unemployment rate of 9.@@ 5 % , with a rate of 9.@@ 9 % in the euro area .
that is not actually an impossible task .
the global financial crisis has had a significant impact on both revenues and expenditure in all our countries , even if the extent and nature of that impact is not the same in all cases and the capacity of individual Member States to handle the consequences is also very different .
I trust we all have the wisdom and courage to take such decisions .
then they borrow , and they borrow , and - worse - they then print money , because politicians and their central banks have a machine which prints money .
I think that everyone realis@@ es that .
( el ) I understand that you are unable to present proposals to resolve the acute problems faced by the workers both in your country and in the other 26 Member States of the European Union .
a massive credit crunch .
the Commission is keen to ensure synergies between the two agencies , notably through exchanges of information , joint work programmes , the joint organisation of conferences and seminars , and joint projects .
I think that this is a very one @-@ sided approach .
through innovation , we hope to be able to link all these things together , give the economy a vigorous boost and , at the same time , move towards a sustainable society .
in addition to strengthening innovation , we need to look at how it can directly benefit the citizens of the European Union .
we have constantly said that the future of Europe will depend on whether we succeed in resolving the question of innovation .
how will you now conduct the dialogue ?
it was a very inclusive process .
for the time being , the Commission has no plans to amend the framework directive on occupational safety and health .
we must ensure in future that work which does not pay a living wage is out@@ la@@ wed by society and is no longer tolerated .
Anti@@ bio@@ tic resistance ( debate )
every year , 25 000 people die across Europe from causes associated with antimicrobi@@ al resistance .
if the EU adopts strict measures on the use of antibiotics with agricultural animals , we can also expect changes to legislation in third countries , particularly because of the financial losses that would be caused by a restriction on meat exports to Europe .
the right to cultural development and other fundamental rights is increasingly facilitated by these technologies .
education and care for young children , which are widely accessible , inclusive and of high quality , help first of all to reconcile family and working life .
we must definitely invest a lot more in the creation of a common European public space .
this will involve promoting forums where financial players and students with innovative ideas can intera@@ ct .
this is why my attitude to this report is simply one of ambi@@ valence .
this unemployment crisis can only be solved on the basis of massive state investment to create decent jobs .
on the contrary , they should aim to create new standards of social cohesion and colle@@ ctivity which the human@@ ities and a European system of university classification based on them can develop in the right direction .
the 2020 strategy aims to raise the level of tertiary education to 40 % and to reduce the share of early school lea@@ vers to 10 % .
after analysing the input that we have received on this topic from all the stakeholders , and following the public consultation with the stakeholders , we are about to put forward recommendations on how we should strengthen and support cultural and creative industries in order to develop and produce the results that we expect them to .
if the history and literature of minority communities were taught in majority schools , and if minority education efforts were to include majority culture , communities living together would get along with each other more harmoni@@ ously .
these priorities and objectives will not be fully realised and achieved if the EU does not ensure long @-@ term financial support in its budget .
greater mobility for young people , a greater capacity to develop opportunities for work , and a labour market that must take into consideration not only young people working in a given context , but all the sectors that provide opportunities for young people to grow .
the EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 increase of de minimis aid for companies for a period of only three years can help them in this complicated situation .
the exploitation does not just apply to those from outside the EU : we are also exploiting our own citizens .
the Youth on the Move initiative is part of the Europe 2020 strategy .
it is from this perspective that I support the idea , defended in the Z@@ ver report , that the funding of young people &apos;s education and mobility is an investment in Europe &apos;s future , not an additional burden on the budget , this despite the current difficult economic situation .
while we need to act in order to encourage the take @-@ up of higher education by the greatest number and actively fight against early school leaving - only 31 % of Europeans have a university degree , compared to 40 % in the United States and 50 % in Japan - we also need to make sure graduates are employ@@ able .
furthermore , these early years lay the foundations for children &apos;s lifelong learning .
there is also an economic rationale behind this , given the rise in the number of women on the labour market .
we should start here by developing mechanisms for evaluating provision and ensuring that quality standards are met .
equally important is its call for the Commission to go ahead with assessing the problems associated with extraordinary low bi@@ ds and to propose appropriate solutions .
temporary emergency measures are needed that will enable European fish@@ ers to overcome their difficult economic situation , but the Commission should also draw up a medium- and long @-@ term plan aimed at improving fuel efficiency in the fisheries sector , including aquaculture .
I voted in favour of this document because I believe that the incentives for small business set out in the Small Business Act are the way to increase the competitiveness of the European Union .
the concept of innovation is multi@@ dimensional : it includes not only scientific research and experi@@ mental and technological development , but also the development of new processes , method@@ ologies and organisational and behavi@@ ou@@ ral models .
in June , the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) , which is to have its annual conference , should adopt a convention on domestic workers requiring that they enjoy equal treatment with other workers , and that all the conditions for dignified work are met .
the European Parliament also advocated the ratification by the EU and its Member States of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All migrant Workers .
antibiotics are used frequently to ensure animal health .
I voted in favour of this resolution because cultural diplomacy is a cornerstone for building trust and long lasting relations with citizens in third countries .
the Greens insisted on the promotion of &apos; cultural cooperation &apos; instead .
I think we need to ensure multi @-@ disciplinary teaching programmes and insist on cooperation and partnership not only between educational institutions , students and professionals in the cultural and creative sector , but also between businesses of all sizes , between the public and the private sector , and between cra@@ f@@ ts@@ people and financial institutions .
it now has images that are known the world over , like the one of &apos; The Cel@@ list of Sarajevo &apos; who , d@@ res@@ sed in black and in the midst of the destruction of war , wand@@ ers the streets seeking to ease the suffering of a mar@@ ty@@ red people who cannot leave the city .
therefore , the Sri Lankan Government should immediately start investigations on the violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .
we have a report which ought to have a follow @-@ up , and I speak firmly in favour of the need for a genuine process of accountability which would bring truth , justice and reconciliation to Sri Lanka following what will be a painful investigation , but an investigation which must happen .
at least 30 people , who likewise prote@@ sted peacefully , have been sentenced to five to eight days of imprisonment without being able to contact their legal representatives in a clo@@ ak and da@@ g@@ ger operation that excludes the public .
the European Union must support all those who risk their lives and freedom in this country for the values which we share .
we should understand that a proper response would be a signal to Belarus@@ ians - to the Belarusian nation - that they are welcome in Europe , with , at the same time , pressure on the regime and some very princi@@ pled words about their violation of human rights .
today , it is our common duty to cher@@ ish the memory of the hundreds of thousands of victims of the Soviet terror in the Baltic States , and to condemn in the strongest terms the totalitarian system and the crimes against humanity committed by its leaders .
however , what the rapporteur , the shadow rapporteurs and my predecessor , Mrs Jol@@ y , have now presented is something that we are able to accept and also support .
( el ) Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to congratulate Jo Leinen on his excellent report .
we are also already planning the third bat@@ ch , so the work is ongoing and will be continued .
we must admit that , when Dominique Stra@@ us@@ s @-@ Kah@@ n was appointed as the Man@@ aging Director of the IMF , the situation was very different : there was talk of people taking it in turns to manage the organisation .
what explains your great im@@ patience and determination to see a European appointed if not your desire to take this step , which you tell us is not urgent and can keep for another day ?
as regards simplification , my colleague , Mrs Car@@ val@@ ho , is going to discuss in detail her excellent report and , Commissioner , we welcome the Commission decision of 24 January 2011 on the creation of the unique registration Facility , but we must go further .
we cannot agree with this model .
such pronoun@@ cements should not be made arbitrarily .
unfortunately , the beneficiaries of the research programmes use a number of national and EU sources of funding .
in this regard , what is required is greater focus on support for the programme , a stronger connection with business requirements and better coordination with the EU &apos;s other financial instruments and with the Structural Funds .
Fourthly , we cannot accept a deal that does not address the different standards and preferences from local SMEs and state monopolies in Canada .
that would be to lose our sense of perspective .
at the end of the day , this is about trade relations , and I believe that environmental and social issues clearly also need to be regulated in separate agreements .
firstly , the EU and Canada have different rules of origin systems .
Serbia , which is characterised by a Christian tradition , has proven its good intentions again and again .
guaranteeing independent impact assessments ( short presentation )
I am very glad that Parliament rejected this directive .
but we have said that there will be tough criteria for the next step .
we must reduce the drop @-@ out rate and ensure that there is a strong link between training and work , for example , by means of exchange systems like we have in Germany and Denmark .
EH@@ EC and antibiotics resistance are both major problems .
the problem is that the Commission has neither the resources nor the opportunity to check whether information given by a Member State is true or not .
however , the uniform , Europe @-@ wide crisis management right down to a common language regime has not been characterised by profession@@ alism .
if people maintain basic rules of hygiene , and if they maintain their personal hygiene as well as was@@ hing or heat @-@ treating their food , that will be enough to protect them from this infection .
this has resulted in losses running into millions , and Polish farmers have also been affected .
producers are turning away from growing vegetables , which involves changing production to something else , and this , in turn , means worker lay@@ off@@ s .
the directive will authorise Member States to charge tolls on lorries not only for infrastructure costs , as is the case now , but also for noise and air pollution .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur for doing such an immense and very important job .
the most dis@@ concer@@ ting fact , however , is probably that this Parliament sees this proposal as just a first step .
I hope that many EU Member States will adopt this system , including the Netherlands .
we cannot allow the interinstitutional agreements , or common understandings or anything else , to restrict the power of this Parliament that has been conferred on us by the Treaty , and therefore this text cannot be allowed to proceed .
on 6 July 2010 , the Central Dis@@ tri@@ ct Court of Bu@@ da sent a request to wa@@ ive the immunity of Á@@ g@@ nes Han@@ k@@ iss in connection with renewed criminal proceedings ordered by a judgment of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Hungary in 2009 .
Al@@ le@@ r@@ gy suff@@ e@@ rers in particular stand to gain from this proposal , as fur is potentially hazardous to their health and without proper labelling , they may buy a product containing these textiles without realising it .
the 2009 report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Ad@@ diction ( EMCDDA ) confirmed that the situation has deteriorated in relation to drugs such as co@@ ca@@ ine , hero@@ in and new syn@@ thetic drugs , and it has seen persis@@ ten@@ tly high levels of consumption and a sp@@ ir@@ alling up@@ ward trend in this regard .
the agreement was subsequently revised in December 2009 in light of the Treaty of Lisbon .
all these areas will be improved by the creation of this European service .
this project aims to provide signals guaranteed for civilian use and to ensure that European industry at all levels has an opportunity to compete in this growing strategic market .
comprehensive agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can provide substantial benefits by offering passengers and freight operators improved services - in terms of both variety and cost - while allowing airlines new opportunities and a competitive edge .
indeed , it cannot simply be involved at the end of the process , whereby its activity is reduced to merely agreeing or dis@@ agreeing with the final solution , without having a range of relevant indicators at its disposal in order to make a considered decision .
without trying to underestimate the environmental issue , this does not seem to me to be the time to burden European companies with another charge .
in the light of positive experiences in Switzerland since the introduction of the performance @-@ based H@@ G@@ V levy in 2001 , there are no objections to the new directive .
environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation , particularly by making available data concerning the environmental impact of economic activities .
we have had to see the images of these stranded and dead people on the news .
we all want an Internet that is open .
so would it not have been a good idea for corruption to be raised at the G8 summit ?
tensions that are turning into open conflict are threatening to over@@ shadow South Sudan &apos;s independence and plun@@ ge the region once again into chaos .
I believe that this department should be encouraged , today , to prepare a plan and to present it to the Committee on Foreign Affairs , explaining how it intends to act , to enable us to understand how valuable European Union foreign policy can be when we all work together towards the best result .
the w@@ ounded and violated are hardly even counted .
so that is why I would say that it is a great victory for us because we supported the process politically , both through our own actions and in financial terms .
the facts just do not back the idea up .
furthermore , and I quote : &apos; illegal immigration from Turkey will spread to the coasts of Bulgaria and the trafficking of drugs and humans by Turkish and Albanian criminal gan@@ gs will increase &apos; .
( HU ) - Mr President , the Coelho report determines that both Romania and Bulgaria have proven that they have prepared properly for the appropriate application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis .
Europe is definitely more different nowadays to the Europe of 20 years ago .
we must avoid a system based on double standards , which is very strict towards candidate countries and very soft on countries that are already members of the Schengen area .
we shall follow up on it at a later stage while taking today &apos;s extraordinary Agriculture Council into account .
( it ) Commissioner , before the end of next month , the European Commission will formulate the proposal for the new Multiannual Financial Framework for the period from 2014 to 2020 .
at the same time , we will work on the preventive measures which should help us to avoid infringement procedures .
no matter what eventual format we find , I think this question of management will be very important in influencing the final arrangements .
I am sure you have experience in this area .
it is clear that Europe today is no longer in any way comparable to the Europe of the founding fathers .
there is a saying : &apos; if you do not change direction , you finish up at the point you were heading for when you started out &apos; .
this concerns both the legislation and the budget .
the confidence in Europe is diminishing .
the result is a ca@@ ke that gives them bel@@ ly ac@@ he .
the future viability of the EU should not be measured in terms of deci@@ mal places .
we should have set priorities .
the Union budget is a tool for global and integrated development at a time when the Member States alone cannot ...
it dis@@ mis@@ ses utterly the idea of freezing the budget after 2013 and insists that even an increase of 5 % would allow only a limited contribution to the EU &apos;s objectives .
the draft proposal , which was supported by eight committees , starts out from challenges to which the new Multiannual Financial Framework has to respond as well .
the European Parliament &apos;s entire vision is firmly groun@@ ded in the Europe 2020 strategy .
the amount of financing that a project participan@@ t from one of the new Member States receives is half what it would be for a participan@@ t from the old Member States .
I completely reject that approach .
this appalling agreement was concluded on the sly and ratified one August back in the 1980s .
however , in my opinion , closing Schengen &apos;s gates to Romania and Bulgaria should not penalise honest citizens , who would suffer the most if they now lost the opportunity to travel freely throughout Europe .
in writing . - As a friend , albeit critical friend , of Bulgaria , I wish to do all I can to assist progress in that country , but not at the expense of my own country &apos;s well @-@ being .
furthermore , it touches on important issues , such as strengthening the role of the International Criminal Court and the international criminal justice system , promoting accountability , putting an end to impunity , and strengthening the crisis @-@ prevention structures and their effectiveness within the United Nations Development Programme , with a view to transforming this organisation into a global leader in crisis prevention and recovery .
for example , the report proposes increasing the programme &apos;s financing but , at the same time , it proposes identifying common research areas among those which appear most promising in terms of concrete applications , enabling the highest extent of sharing in an ethical context , so that tangible results are achieved when implementing this programme .
the Seventh Framework Programme - which is mainly oriented towards research and technological development - is currently the only instrument for achieving the objectives laid down in the Innovation Union initiative and for expe@@ dit@@ ing the transformation of Europe into a knowledge @-@ based society .
the global competition of major economic powers such as China , India and Brazil is forcing us to take special measures , aimed at gaining a technological advantage allowing us to implement the European Union &apos;s intended strategy effectively .
I welcomed the document because the EU and Canada have a close relationship as far as trade and foreign direct investment are concerned .
the recent financial crisis has highlighted three problems in the industry : a lack of competition , over @-@ reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings on the part of CR@@ As .
it would be a good thing if credit rating agencies were to be more accountable in future .
lastly , it is essential to look at the ways to make rating agencies subject to civil liability for their ratings .
in this regard , it is considered a sensitive and tr@@ usted partner .
these are hard , soft and financial instruments .
this is a legitimate objective ; however , I have certain reservations as to whether we shall be able to achieve this objective .
I am alar@@ med by the high youth unemployment rate .
it seems obvious to me that in an increasingly unified Europe in which mobility is a growing reality , the mutual recognition of qualifications is absolutely essential .
the Europe 2020 strategy lists the key factors for smart growth ( fostering knowledge , innovation and education , and promoting the digital society ) , sustainable growth ( more resource @-@ efficient production going hand in hand with enhanced competitiveness ) , and inclusive growth ( increasing the employment rate , training , and eradicating poverty ) .
in addition , in order to combat unemployment among low @-@ skilled people , as well as to promote the employment of senior citizens , it is imperative to encourage the recognition of national qualifications between the Member States , and to encourage certification by valida@@ ting skills acquired through informal apprentices@@ hip .
I voted in favour of this report because I agree that it is very important to continuously improve the quality of EU law making , and this report sets out concrete proposals for improving the law making process both within the European Parliament and the Commission .
in writing . - I voted for this report .
divergences in European contract law end up discoura@@ ging businesses from engaging in cross @-@ border trade and keep them from benefiting from opportunities and gains which the Internal Market offers .
on the one hand , they question the ca@@ usal link with the basis for future contract law , while also , more importantly , fe@@ aring a further compli@@ cation of the legal situation .
it is the most widely known and used measure of macro @-@ economic activity .
&apos;@@ GDP and beyond - measuring progress in a changing world &apos; is a report that aims to assess levels of progress in the European Union through gross domestic product , which has taken on the role of a comprehensive indicator for societal and economic development .
as we have said regarding the application of a global European satellite navigation system for transport , the use of this technology could represent an important contribution to the development , modernisation and diversification of public services , in the creation of opportunities for cooperation , and progress in science and its applications , and in the exchange and accessibility of information , with the guarantee of respect for the public &apos;s rights , freedoms and guarantees .
the Galileo programme , which , in conjunction with the European Ge@@ osta@@ tionary Navigation O@@ ver@@ lay Service ( EGNOS ) , aims to create a global navigation satellite system ( GNSS ) , is in line with a strategic choice on the part of the Union : it confirms its entry onto the global market , while its efforts assert itself in the global market , which is currently dominated by the United States , and is important to boosting the European economy itself .
if you have no budget , you have no project .
to be brief , notwithstanding the exceptional length of the text , Parliament calls for the European budget , in its total amount and distribution , to be adapted after 2013 to the competences and very large number of priorities of the European Union , as it defines them .
while believing that good value can be obtained when 27 Member States pool their resources , I could not vote for a 5 % increase in the EU budget beyond 2013 when we have not thoroughly examined existing expenditure with a view to eliminating waste and duplication .
I voted in favour of the report presented by Mr Garriga Polledo on behalf of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 .
trust in the EU will only return when our citizens are convinced that the Union serves their values and interests .
if a country choo@@ ses to use a fair election and a two @-@ thirds majority to create an auto@@ cracy , the rest of us are allowed to be shocked by that and to try and oppose it .
the European Council , Parliament and Commission cannot ignore these violations of European values , because this may set a negative precedent for other il@@ liberal regimes to follow .
when I consider how the Hungarians will react to this debate and to the accusations being ban@@ died about by some of my fellow Members without any support from direct quo@@ tations , then I can well imagine that some will find the way that the Hungarians and their country &apos;s development are being discussed here to be extremely arrog@@ ant .
what I do not understand about this debate is that up until now , we have been taught that laws that can be modified by a two @-@ thirds majority are there to provide a guarantee that they cannot be abused .
there was a question about whether the constitution contained that particular fourth @-@ fif@@ ths majority or not .
both that debate and this one are merely a pretext for attacking Hungary .
Madam President , Ms Si@@ p@@ pel described the European Arrest Warrant as a baby .
the person will always be able to fully exercise his defence rights in the issuing Member State where the trial on the merits of the case takes place .
the existence and operation of this instrument is therefore to be welcomed , but we should also welcome the fact that it is being monitored .
( PT ) Mr President , the European Union is an experi@@ ment made up of experi@@ ments : the euro area , this very Parliament in which we find ourselves , the Schengen area and a number of other instruments are all experi@@ ments .
training , which is very high on the agenda for the coming weeks , months and years , will be very important because we have to train judges , prosecutors and lawyers in the application of our European rules .
for us , for Parliament , this is a vital part of the partnership .
Mr President , the dialogue between the European Union and Russia must be expanded as much as possible in various areas , from the economy to human rights , because there are no alternatives to dialogue .
I recall the words of our colleague , Mr Swoboda , who yesterday asked for a full clearing up of Russian history , especially the atrocities of the Stalin era .
we cannot agree to this .
when we investigated locally , we concluded that the provisions concerning environmental impact assessments , as applicable in Austria , were complied with at the time - at least in essence .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner Oettinger , ladies and gentlemen , the purpose of the environmental impact assessment is , in accordance with the precautionary principle , to determine and assess the direct impact of projects on the environment , but also their indirect effects .
we will give you a written answer on this issue .
they may feel that within their own Member State they will be protected , but they are not sure what happens in another Member State .
many entities are deter@@ red from taking legal action by the cost .
the European teams will be made up of nuclear experts from the various Member States and Commission officials .
I now realise that we need to do more to introduce tougher safety standards for European nuclear power stations .
I then asked him which plants he was referring to .
will the Commission insist that all Member States conduct the stress tests properly , and do not do their own ligh@@ t@@ weight version ?
I would also like to under@@ score the profound need for additional investment , both in research into nuclear power and in other important research aimed at anticip@@ ating and combating accidents and their adverse effects in the future .
Mr Oettinger , you can rely on the support of this House in this respect .
this would provide a clear statement that this cannot be a national issue , but must be a European issue , the aim being to ensure the safety of European citizens .
I recall the part @-@ session in April , at which some Members seemed to lose all sense of proportion right after the accident .
it is extremely important for the EU to continue to provide aid and to direct this aid towards the building of the institutions that are necessary in a well @-@ functioning independent state .
we must make every effort to prevent this from happening .
furthermore , the South Sudan Government should begin to enact foreign investment policies that would attract foreign investment in natural resources and would thus contribute to the policy of poverty reduction .
however , concerns remain about Russia &apos;s respect for , and protection of , fundamental and human rights , the rule of law , independence of the judiciary , political control of the media , repressive measures taken against journalists and representatives of the opposition and the fairness of elections .
granting such rights should be a sovereign matter for each country .
the misleading business practices in question typically consist of lur@@ ing businesses , as well as professionals and non @-@ profit entities , into being listed in a business directory free of charge .
we condemn the illegal exploitation of the mineral resources as well as the pil@@ la@@ ging of precious wood , particularly ro@@ se@@ wood .
we attach great importance to overcoming the ongoing political crisis and the economic and social effects on the population of Madagascar which are increasing the burden placed on the people on a daily basis .
I regret that he is hur@@ ling what I consider to be insul@@ ts at me .
we , for our part , ask for univers@@ ality of human rights .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue @-@ card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
I have similar comments and I share the qu@@ and@@ ary of most of you who have spoken , today .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I apologise for intervening in this vote .
let me just remind you that the Hungarian Presidency was given a mandate by the European Council to reach political agreement with Parliament by the end of June .
as a last @-@ resort mechanism , and if the critical situation justifies it , these decisions could make provision for the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls , but always within a Community framework .
of course , they receive money for their proposals from stakeholders .
we are surely on the final pages of the bail @-@ out chapter .
on that point , Mr Barroso was actually right .
that is why it is right for us resolutely to promote and support the reduction of public debt in Greece .
it is very important for Croatia to join , but it is also important to remember that the P@@ ope warned the Croa@@ ts to be@@ ware of a bureaucratic , centr@@ alist structure .
migrant flows must be governed from Brussels in a way that rewards inclusion , solidarity and security .
not many of you touched upon the very important element of the conclusion of the European semester .
I am wondering what the outcome of this Council will be .
I also note that you have included a proposal for higher ceilings for direct payments .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I think the world @-@ ren@@ owned Scottish po@@ et Rab@@ bi@@ e Bur@@ ns might have described this report as a bit of a &apos; cow &apos;@@ rin , ti@@ m &apos;@@ rous be@@ as@@ tie &apos; in its original form .
I am sure that with Parliament &apos;s strengthened role under the Treaty of Lisbon we will be able to translate these goals , which for now are merely theoretical , into concrete actions .
we should not care whether a farm is large or small ; instead we should be concerned with whether it is run in an economically sound manner .
with 42 % of our European expenditure going on the CAP , it is vital that we provide complete accountability to our citizens .
( es ) Madam President , the most important message issued by this House today is that it wants a fair common agricultural policy , or in other words a CAP that guarantees a sufficient level of income for all producers , irrespective of their activity and of the place where it is conducted .
special payments must also be program@@ med for areas with natural handi@@ caps which have special needs .
that is the best way that we can respond to the serious , all @-@ encompassing challenges faced by agriculture in its present form in the 200@@ 0s .
the Council has worked in good faith to try and improve the directive where appropriate and improve transparency , but without stepping on the sensitive issues relating to individual national constitu@@ tions .
with regard to the macroeconomic element , I would firstly like to emphasise that , thanks to the work that we have done in Parliament , we have a proposal that we have agreed on with the Council and one that is sufficiently transparent and also contains a solution that is sufficiently automatic .
on the remaining one , there is a disagreement between Parliament and the Council .
I would like to mention four points which I consider controversial .
Europe &apos;s leaders have hesi@@ tated and created uncertainty .
the EU is now trying a new approach .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , Minister , ladies and gentlemen , many comments have already been made on the different reports that make up this governance package .
we cannot let this happen again , and at the same time we have to learn from the failures of the past .
this economic governance package today is better than the Commission &apos;s initial proposal , and it is better because of the many contributions made by the Members of this House .
Europe must focus on a common strategy , but it must not forget the specific features of each country .
for this reason , we in the Commission are prepared to adopt every possible restrictive solution , including export bans and export restrictions .
I also welcome the option of deep geological storage , including the principle of rever@@ sibility .
Madam President , less than a year ago I set up a cross @-@ party petition for a referendum in the UK in respect of membership of the European Union .
these are significant matters for hundreds of farmers in Wales who run high @-@ quality businesses that in many cases have been in families for generations .
it would be wrong for the EU to set new unilateral targets , in view of the fact there are no regulations at global level containing binding reduction targets .
as a result the 2012 draft budget is almost EUR 9 billion below the ceiling of the financial perspective set for 2012 .
I believe that investment in these sectors is the only way that Europe can be brought out of the crisis .
to cite technical and legal difficulties as an excuse for dismantling this food aid programme is disastrous not only for the people concerned but also for Europe &apos;s credibility and image .
in this difficult climate , the EU budget has to play a key role in helping the European economy .
for my part , I had the honour of working on the future of European territorial cooperation - Objective 3 of cohesion policy - and I should like to thank the shadow rapporteur and the European Commission for their fruitful collaboration .
when considering any move towards a greater focus on urban areas and cities , the creation of a potential new infrastructure fund , and the possible creation of a performance reserve , we need to ensure that all those things do not put at risk or damage the poorer regions in the EU .
it is also important for Germany that the European Union continues to develop in a harmonious way , because this brings benefits for Germany .
however , it emerged from the discussion that we need to take into consideration other regions , in particular those hit by the crisis .
there is some alarming information indicating that some of the decision @-@ makers in the Commission intend to cut the cohesion policy budget drastically from 2014 .
cohesion policy is targeted exclusively at investments .

rapporteur . - ( SL ) Madam President , it could be that I was not paying enough attention , but according to my voting sheet , we have not voted on part 2 of Amendment 62 .
on the other hand , experience to date shows that market mechanisms are incapable of reacting quickly and flexibly to negative developments , the result of which is that a financial crisis turns into a debt crisis .
- ( CS ) Madam President , I very much applaud the fact that Mr Schwab has reached a compromise with the Council strengthening the rights of consumers , and that the compromise will also include my proposals for online commerce .
written explanations of vote
Opel Antwerp was a modern and successful car assembly business .
the report and work of the Committee on Legal Affairs make it quite clear that there are no reasons to believe that the Romanian authorities are acting against Mr Severin with the intent of persecution ; notwithstanding that the position of the fake lobbying agency may generate doubts concerning the propri@@ ety of conduct on the part of information operators , the fact remains that the issue in question does not appear to fall into the category of cases in which immunity can legitimately be made to matter .
Con@@ tempor@@ ane@@ ously , it will promote political dialogue on necessary reforms which aim to strengthen the cooperation between the two parties , by supporting a partnership framework in which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and responsible exploitation of fishery resources in the Seychelles &apos; fishing zone .
from the perspective of concluding the Agreement on civil aviation safety , which supple@@ ments the Air Transport Agreement , Canada was properly regarded as a priority , because both Europe and Canada host manufacturers of aircraft , engines and avi@@ on@@ ics , occupying a leading position on the world market .
this is a target which all Member States have established as part of the European integration process .
I believe that the effective selection and implementation of projects in some areas is ham@@ pered by the lack of relevant preconditions such as simpler application procedures at national level , clear national priorities for certain areas of intervention , timely transposition of EU laws and consolidated institutional and administrative capacity , as well as by excessive red tape at national level .
the Commission should prepare a study compar@@ ing the practice to date of individual Member States regarding integrated strategic planning and , on the basis of the outcome of the study , draw up specific EU guidelines for integrated urban development planning practice that promote efficient , legally regulated partnerships , including cross @-@ border urban partnerships .
by implementing the Urban Agenda , we must focus more on serving the development and qualitative upgrading of the infrastructure and services in European cities .
EU Member States will continue to greatly benefit from enhanced medi@@ ums for cooperation with other Member States .
it should be borne in mind that a good result for most programmes and measures depends to a considerable extent on a successful combination of several factors , of which human resources development is the most important .
instead , new vehicles of bureaucracy such as the macro @-@ regional entities are proposed , and the nation @-@ state is once again undermined by a determined shift towards region@@ alism .
labour Euro M@@ Ps support the improvements secured to the Commission proposal on macroeconomic imbalances in the Ferreira report , which uphold workers &apos; rights and the importance of a comprehensive assessment of economic performance , including employment .
Parliament has sent a clear message to everyone , and particularly to the Council .
in writing . - The ECR has always worked constructively to ensure that the eurozone can formulate a lasting solution to its sovereign debt crisis .
this financial reform package will hit the poorest in Europe the hardest , while leaving the cause of the crisis - the financial sector - un@@ touched .
this report , like the other , similar reports included in the package , directly refers to the recent financial crisis in Greece and sets the objective of creating a regulatory framework to prevent the repetition of similar crises .
we must make every effort to ensure that we achieve macroeconomic stability and sustainability in public finance .
it enables not just greater coordination , but also greater accountability by governments at national and EU level .
I welcome this vote , which is a significant step forwards for the internal market and the fruit of complex and involved negotiations .
I voted for the Consumer Rights Directive today because I believe that it will simplify and improve the existing regulations in the area of consumer protection .
the directive , which spe@@ l@@ ls the end of a lengthy debate between Parliament and the Council , provides , among other things , for the period in which consumers can withdraw from a sale to be doubled from seven to four@@ teen days , and for enhanced protection in the event of a lack of conformity .
however , the proposal does not provide for a reduction as drastic as was initially envisaged on account of the delay in implementing new technological solutions and the decline of more than 20 % in turnover in 2009 and 2010 .
Member States are still responsible for the safe management of spent fuel and waste , but they can fulfil this obligation while working on joint initiatives to share the management of radioactive waste under duly defined and rigorous conditions .
we must continuously exchange good practice in this area throughout the EU .
while the cost of the project has increased expon@@ enti@@ ally since it was launched in 2006 , from EUR 6 to 16 billion , I think it must now continue with the available resources .
I consider this report on the mandate for the trialogue to be fairly satisfactory .
lastly , we must not forget that the agricultural challenge is directly linked to the food challenge , and it is therefore of the utmost importance when it comes to protecting the health of European citizens .
we must , however , recognise that the European Parliament still has important work ahead of it , for there are questions the solutions to which are sk@@ et@@ ched in general terms only in the D@@ ess report , as Members &apos; opinions on the solution to the relevant problem diff@@ ered or were even di@@ ame@@ tri@@ cally opposed .
given the fact that world populations are only set to increase , global agricultural production will also have to increase accordingly .
