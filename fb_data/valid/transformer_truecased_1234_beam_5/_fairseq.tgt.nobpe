finally , there is a desire to radically change the way in which negotiations are conducted on the Transnistria issue .
it is true that we have improved the rights of air passengers , but then we have little to say to them .
therefore , the governments of the Member States of the European Union must establish their own infrastructure in their own country , based on local conditions and under local competence .
firstly , and above all , we must express our solidarity with the Greek authorities , with the Greek people as a whole , and especially with the families of the victims , who do not always receive the support they deserve .
there are good reasons to say , yes , that could have been avoided .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the forest fires were unfortunately painfully affected by several countries of the European Union and even caused the loss of human lives .
let us hope they will make the right decision .
better regulation is an essential part of the Lisbon Strategy , as it can significantly promote productivity and employment .
do not lie in one thing : better regulation is not a campaign to improve image .
we tend to make a desperate effort for one or another for months , but we often make no effort to find out whether the legislation has had the desired effect .
as part of the ongoing work on better regulation , it is vital that the European Parliament is fully involved in the interinstitutional debate and , as co @-@ legislator , the adoption of legislation as a result of this process .
governance must not be allowed to grow unnecessarily , with the burdens involved .
what do I have to do if I intend to cross the border ?
to date , 8 000 employers and 184 000 jobseekers have registered on the portal .
( the sitting was closed at 9.45 a.m. )
the second point I would like to raise - and I was pleased to hear you emphasise this , Commissioner - is the global dimension .
( DE ) Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group , I would also like to thank Mr Toubon for his report , which we generally support , because it contains numerous positive aspects that are particularly important for our group members .
our policies must serve people and improve their quality of life .
the Commission has a duty under the interinstitutional agreements to respond to these proposals .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , it is fitting that we are discussing the issue of the Gdańsk shipyard .
I urge the European Parliament , on the 20th anniversary of the signature of August agreements , to think well about this case .
this is therefore a temporary but necessary and appropriate measure .
( SK ) For the regions , given that their role in the legislative process often means direct responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of EU law , efforts to improve law and legislation are essential .
in 2005 , 20 % of the population &apos;s income in the European Union with 25 Member States was five times the lowest 20 % income .
among these , I would like to draw attention to forms of planning of activities , some of which have been thoroughly examined by the Council and found that the overall quality of the process has improved significantly , and the Council hopes that such a budgetary approach will be developed further in the future .
they have managed budgetary discipline very well and have been meeting the requirements for budgetary discipline for many years .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , yes , the proposal for a directive on the inland transport of dangerous goods is important , because dangerous goods are transported annually in the EU by around 110 billion tonnes / km : 58 % by road , 25 % by rail and now 17 % by inland waterways .
this is a step towards simplifying the legislation in terms of administrative procedures for both freight dealers and cargo recipients , but also an important step in terms of training workers involved in the safety of dangerous goods .
we will only succeed if the Member States and the European Union act together .
freight transport must be cut , and what is really necessary must go as far as possible by rail or water .
( NL ) Mr President , Commissioner , logistics processes are primarily a problem for industry and the transport sector and , in my opinion , this should remain the case .
it is true , as Mr Savary says , that the completion of the Single European Sky is not progressing quickly enough , given the importance of the objective : competitiveness , sustainable development , the fight against climate change and the promotion of aviation safety .
that would be the only way to exert real pressure and to bring about the necessary changes .
we managed to prevent at least 3 000 or 4 000 young people from falling victim to trafficking in human beings in Germany during this period .
it is scheduled to start work by the end of 2007 .
normally , we pay an average of six to eight months after the event , and this is not , of course , the best solution for Member States and for the situation that needs to be resolved .
the Community contribution , EUR 308 million agreed for the next financial perspective , is intended to serve as a catalyst for private resources .
that is why the European Commission has launched infringement proceedings against 14 Member States .
the investigation of alcohol abuse produced an extremely depressing and worrying picture : the very high mortality rate among young people , particularly as a result of road accidents , mistreatment in the family , the increase in cases of foetal alcohol syndrome , the increasing spread of pay and alcohol addiction , including among young people in all Member States .
this equates to almost five million Europeans , while foetal alcohol syndrome is completely avoidable .
it is regarded as a necessary component of most social events , including many events in the European Parliament .
I would like to draw attention to the role alcohol plays in suicide cases , research which shows that more than 20 % of people who have committed suicide have used alcohol before death .
there is not much scope for reducing the harmful effects of hazardous and toxic consumption on children and pregnant women .
the Commission &apos;s proposal , which amends the regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products , offers a number of important technical adjustments , which will certainly lead to a improvement in the situation .
now , the state and the EU competition authorities must intervene strongly in the interests of farmers who continue to have sanctuals for their quality products due to de facto abuse , particularly by dominant trading chains .
finally , I agree with the rapporteur that it is too early to abandon the existing protection measures , even if they are not used at the moment , but this is also the subject of the health check .
this should also include funding for improving quality , which is why many farmers in the new Member States will no longer be able to sell their products after 2009 .
what role do we play ?
it is not clear - and I am finishing , Mr President - whether , over the last few years , European citizens have been put at greater risk by measures taken to combat terrorism or terrorism .
I have received a report from public and private experts , which I believe will prove to be a breakthrough and which includes some 50 valuable and concrete recommendations to improve the safety of explosives , precursors and detonators throughout Europe .
Liberals and Democrats have not been included in crime .
one of the problems that arises from this is the lack of democratic control over such operations .
Member States are not forced to provide evidence of individuals who are proposed to be included in the list , while it is even more dangerous that the Commission itself remains responsible for including and withdrawing the names of individuals and organisations .
why ?
( RO ) This debate is extremely important as it gives us the opportunity to examine the consistency and coherence of counter @-@ terrorism strategies .
I agree with many others that in any case we need to strengthen and make the most of Europol and Eurojust .
democratic control in this area , and in particular the role of the European Parliament and national parliaments , guarantees respect for fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaty on European Union .
the problem is terrorists and their actions at the heart of Europe .
just recently , on 31 August 2007 , I visited seven road traffic management headquarters , including the German longest tunnel , and I understood the need for harmonisation , particularly in terms of provisions on the transport of dangerous goods .
terrorism , as HMG has said , remains a serious and lasting threat .
logistics is an important element in the development of Europe and its competitiveness on the international stage .
approval of Minutes of previous sitting : see Minutes
of course , appropriate caution by other market players is also indispensable .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , I would like to direct my remarks to the gallery , which has a significant increase in the population than Members in the auditorium .
only this fact has triggered the shock caused by the revaluation of well @-@ known proportions .
there is a symmetry between the global financial services market and national regulation and the supervisory system .
nor can we be naïve and believe that Basel I , Basel II and Solvency II will solve the problems that have arisen .
water scarcity is only one aspect of this crisis .
it was mentioned in plenary , and I said this in my first speech , that greater involvement by civil society in implementing measures to combat desertification is of great importance .
every time Hamas has taken a small step , which can be understood as a movement towards us , we have closed the door in front of us .
subject : ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate of Constantinople
such an agreement exists already on border protection , but not on the police side .
effective diversification of energy resources and transport routes is highlighted as one of the ways to improve security of supply in the Community Action Plan adopted by the Council in March 2007 .
I believe that the European Parliament has a legitimate right to participate in dialogue , to carry out the democratic observation that has been made to Parliament by European citizens .
for example , the Council could send an assessment of the dialogue and consultation that took place every six months to Parliament and the relevant committees , together with an explanation that focuses on the trends of progress and not on individual results .
human rights are equal to all , regardless of whether there is currently some kind of international attention .
allocating funds without evaluating the results achieved is not right , as it is not right to hypocritically praise anyone for proposals that never materialise .
in August , two Christian activists were arrested from the Middle East Christian Association and accused of sending aggressive anti @-@ Islamic messages .
the Commission will continue its dialogue with the fisheries sector and start discussions on long @-@ term plans for the fisheries sector , with a view to the MSY perspective .
consequently , fisheries policy is not a Community agricultural policy .
we certainly do not want to impose conditions on the US .
finally , we must not forget enforcement either .
there will be no trade without consumer confidence and without trust .
we will not achieve a seamless internal market without satisfied and protected consumers .
I am also pleased that it has become possible to develop consumer and business definitions and that these definitions are thorough .
believe me , it is very difficult even for the largest country in the Union to persuade China to act .
it is important to support the development of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) , established in 2004 , and the EU system of early warning and response to public health threats , which should encourage Member States to apply international medical protection rules quickly and consistently .
fishing in the EU must become more environmentally friendly in order to protect both the marine environment and the viability of the fishing sector in the long term .
the justifications do indeed appear to be appalling , and for us privileged Europeans this should act as a wake @-@ up call .
human rights and the rule of law are not then dominating .
the amount to enable the most notorious criminals to continue legal proceedings is less than USD 90 million .
as you know , the first round of voting on the 2007 Sakharov Prize will take place shortly .
the Socialist Group has requested Mrs Bowles and Mrs van den burg to postpone the joint debate on Community statistics to the October part @-@ session in Strasbourg .
as a follow @-@ up , the European Commission found the issues of President Beneš Decrees resolved and completed .
not that the relationship with Russia is bad in itself , but the more dependent it becomes , the more balanced it tends to go .
furthermore , we need a general policy that supports and prides the supply of electricity produced from renewable energy sources , so that the conversion of biomass into gas can also be stimulated , paving the way for much greater rationalisation and efficiency .
on this extremely important issue , we must trust common sense and apply the precautionary principle .
let me briefly address the central issue that will emerge in the coming weeks when the Commission will present a draft directive .
I believe it is also important , in terms of security of supply , to focus on renewable energy sources .
we must assess their advantages and weaknesses alongside other energy sources .
I propose that the European Union monitor very closely whether the Member States are following what they are expected to do , because regional and local initiatives will not flourish if Member States do not set their own frameworks that are compatible with EU legislation .
finally , with regard to opening up and liberalising rail networks , I believe that if we really want to create a pan @-@ European rail culture , we must start by accepting that trains of other people are going to pass through our territory .
the result is a good one , and it will enable us to provide better service to train passengers in the future .
this was confirmed by a note which regretted that it had not been in order .
several months after that , my conclusion is that the agreement reached with the Council represents a constructive step forward towards the completion of the European rail transport market in a number of important respects .
( HU ) Mr President , thank you very much .
( the sitting was closed at 21.40 )
secondly , the amount of support must be reasonable and acceptable to all parties ( and not EUR 625 a year ago ) ;
our producers will disappear what we call &apos; restructuring &apos; in Europe .
Hungary has renounced 27 % of its quota because the European average is only 10.5 % .
the proposed revision is aimed at punishing those most competitive .
the Commission is also questioning whether China is still making sufficient efforts .
the herbs must not be in the hands of children , even in tiny quantities .
our joint resolution certainly contains interesting opportunities : revision of the existing directives , enhanced cooperation - this time with China - to allocate more resources to customs authorities and national supervisory authorities .
the standard requires that no child absorbs more than 8 milligrams on the basis of a toy .
( es ) Mr President , the withdrawal of dangerous toys in August and September created a public alarm .
in the case of China , we know that they are not responding to health and safety concerns , but respond to economic threats .
then most of what was rightly requested here today will be completed .
that is why I have decided to vote against this report .
in our view , it is of the utmost importance that the liberalisation trend revealed in successive reforms of the common agricultural policy be given a retrograde clause and measures taken to maintain sugar beet production at national level , thereby supporting the agricultural sector focused on food production and helping to secure the production and employment of two plants .
like all our fellow Members , we see this as a way of protecting the environment , but also of reducing our energy dependency .
as the previous speaker said , the European Parliament has already announced twice this year : this Parliament is leading the fight to ban the death penalty .
Poles have opposed the death penalty on several occasions .
the question is simply : how can we reasonably combine this strategic agreement with the regional agreement with Mercosur at the same time , which has started to cause many concerns ?
by building cooperation with only one country in the region , understanding of what has been achieved can be undermined and a factor that slows down work on the Mercosur Association Agreement .
it is representative democracy .
how can we exchange all the good ideas that form the basis of the urban community so that we can learn from them ?
the questions are deliberately open .
my colleague has already prepared some proposals for this .
Member of the Commission . - It seems to me that I have already heard this .
our proposal comes after extensive stakeholder consultations in 2004 , including web @-@ based consultations on cooperation , as well as input from industry stakeholders through European Technology platforms .
finally , I would like to mention another Eurobarometer survey on new technologies carried out in 2005 with 25 000 people &apos;s samples .
in its report , the coordinator analysed the progress of the priority project Paris @-@ Bratislava and concluded that most of the projects should be completed by 2015 .
innovation must be given particular attention , as it is precisely innovation that is the Achilles heel of Europe .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would of course like to congratulate my colleague Mr Paasilinna on his hard work .
the United States has a dollar , so we must have the euro ; the United States has a GPS system so that we have Galileo ; the United States has a currency , so we must have the EIT .
( FI ) Mr President , I would first like to thank Mr Paasilinna for his excellent report .
the idea behind it says that there are plenty of good ideas and scientific constructions in Europe , but they are not developed into concrete projects .
the geopolitical dimension of energy security has not been addressed so far , and it is high time to do so .
those countries that manage energy sources may be tempted to manage the whole world , or at least exert particular influence on certain regions .
I therefore strongly support the two main ideas of this report : the creation of a special EU official for the coordination of external energy policies and the inclusion of energy solidarity in future treaties .
the rapporteur &apos;s report in favour of a common energy policy is inclined towards Russia , but it is simply in line with the current situation .
however , there are times when ties are being weakened due to unexpected events that tend to have negative consequences for inter @-@ regional trade , which we are suffering in Spain at the moment , and which we saw only recently in Poland and in other Member States .
finally , our proposal on legislation will be as simple as possible and will not entail any new administrative burdens .
on the other hand , I am more cautious about the proposal to introduce a measure to eliminate taxes on animal feed .
in addition , we promised that we would provide information on European laws , employment opportunities and training courses in this centre .
( applause )
if the policies of the European Union were to follow the logic of his words , I would agree with him , but unfortunately that is not the case .
it says :
for others , there will be only a horrendous sea trip .
in recent years , almost three million of my countrymen have left Poland .
I would remind you that the return initiatives are often delegated to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in order to ensure maximum transparency in respect of human rights by us .
it fully respects national rules and practices and further develops the forward @-@ looking statement of extending cross @-@ border democracy .
in writing . - In principle , I support the idea of the European Institute of Technology .
the same was explained by Joosep in Bible .
however , this is not the time to create new institutions , and that is why I am opposed to the creation of a High Official for Foreign Energy Policy , which would also reduce the opportunities for the European Parliament to influence foreign policy energy pollution .
specifically , the report adopts the idea of &apos; the most highly qualified &apos; , &apos; seasonal &apos; and other categories of immigrants , and their management according to the labour needs of the various EU countries , particularly through the introduction of the Blue Card : an inhumane understanding of immigration and migrants .
the application of such repressive policies led to the prosecution of seven Tunisian shores being rescued by the authorities of the Member States at sea , despite the fact that it was compatible with international maritime law .
I believe that if the investigation were to take place with greater rigour and self @-@ government , their results would be much more effective .
what surprises us is that the Council and all governments are applying it to themselves .
if the EU insists on the closure of Guantánamo , which we have done in large measure , the Member States must not eat their words .
it must continue to be vigilant and ensure that no innocent person becomes a victim of the so @-@ called &apos; war on terror &apos; .
the debate is closed .
it is important to interpret these powers correctly on this site and to ensure that European troops provide proactive protection to civilians at risk , create a humanitarian area for international organisations and protect the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad ( MINURCAT ) .
the expenditure is also significant : I have heard that it will cost EUR 100 million to build appropriate landing courses and headquarters alone .
we also explicitly mentioned the possibility of increasing the existing sanctions , so the message was clear and direct .
it is clear that , after 30 years of substantial sanctions , the policy pursued must take a radical line , and that is why international policy must include the same countries in the same region : not only China and India , but also Japan and the current ASEAN Presidency , Singapore .
these revised powers provide political assistance to the EUSR and allow it to offer its services during the constitutional reform .
( PT ) I have not read and heard Mrs Riis @-@ Jørgensen &apos;s statements and therefore do not wish to comment directly on them .
unfortunately , the Rules of Procedure do not allow the Council to answer all three questions at once , as the Council has carried out its work differently .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs . - Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , who also seems to be losing a voice like any one .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( DA ) Mr President , we have adopted the Services Directive , which has given the European Court of Justice the right to decide what we decided .
we intend to facilitate access to existing information on accidents and injuries associated with the services offered to consumers , and one very important element that has been highlighted by several Member States , namely collective redress .
at the same time , we must make every effort .
it was a deeply moving experience to hear young people with various physical disabilities and learning difficulties talk about their school experience .
request for waiver of parliamentary immunity : see Minutes
( applause )
perhaps it is not a constitution , but despite all its legal jargon , the Reform of the Treaties may provide a document that can quietly carry out revolutionary change in Europe .
this is why I will not stop .
however , the process of the Intergovernmental Conference has been rushed too much .
social dialogue is no longer the EU &apos;s horizontal responsibility .
an open market without protectionism and monopolies .
I am sure that , in Lisbon , there is a tight need for an agreement that inspired us to win in other circles , and if we return here to the next plenary session , we will be able to give you a message of joy and good news .
increasing representation , based on demographic situations and not on nominal or symbolic legal relations , would increase the degressivity of representation between large and small countries , as well as the legitimacy based on representatives of citizens arising from the fact that the European Parliament is elected by European citizens .
Parliament is not - as the rapporteurs told us in our letter last night - a reflection of the socio @-@ economic capacity of the Member States .
in order to ensure diversity , it is therefore time to reserve the number of seats in the European Parliament for linguistic minorities .
I am talking about this because we really need to talk about a common home , a common Europe and listen to all the voices in each country .
to this end , the report prepared by the rapporteurs , Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin , is of a high quality , balanced and responsible nature .
I congratulate the rapporteurs who are going to work on harmonising electoral laws ; I hope they will be successful .
now it is October , and we have not gone much further .
our task is political : to put an end to military occupation and demand that there are two countries and peoples who are able to coexist peacefully .
of course , we call on him to do what is still in his power .
the suffering of innocent people makes the desire to apologise and the request to justify the situation in Gaza inappropriate .
I sincerely await the continuation of this dialogue .
it includes new measures to strengthen the competitiveness and profit of large maritime groups and signals the strength of the attack on workers .
I therefore welcome all the positive measures adopted here .
I have the feeling that this gentleman is sorry to have been born so late in the wrong age .
I would like to start by reminding Parliament what the common agricultural policy actually means for the vast majority of our almost 500 million citizens .
the most valuable provision is that it allows the publication of information as part of the common agricultural policy or rather makes it compulsory to publish information on who and in what context used these funds .
on the huge amounts .
perhaps we need to do this at a higher level , but let us be honest when dealing with this issue .
the renewed system will be fully operational by 1 July 2009 .
- ( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner , I agree and approve Mr Staes &apos;s report , which , above all , leads to the greatest possible restriction of smuggling .
this time , we have managed to make progress in the system to some extent - intervening before the Council expressed its opinion - but , in the long term , we need better rules for shaping the content .
they have a lot to talk about the difficulties they experience in obtaining a US visa and with which they are faced when they arrive , and how they are subject to checks and searches , as if they were potential terrorists .
a large number of Member States who may be too susceptible to listening to those who manage their airports are opposed to Community coordination and prefer to continue giving priority to local solutions implemented at each individual airport .
it will also be made aware that the number of accidents at work has risen .
however , there is still a risk of misunderstandings .
on the one hand , flying is part of our everyday lives and our way of life has become more accessible to people with low incomes - pensioners and students .
this is necessary because otherwise , the sentence will not be meaningless in English .
these are the reasons for voting against my report .
in writing . - British Conservatives oppose the EU Constitution and the draft EU Reform Treaty .
this situation is due to the unfavourable cultural causes of women and the socio @-@ economic situation , and is worse for indigenous women , who are , to a large extent , economically dependent .
it is primarily the government that is responsible for ensuring the material and technical conditions required in such care homes and for supporting children .
this resulted in a reform of the right of extraction in Romania , initiated by an amendment to Parliament to ban the use of cyanide in mining activities .
let me first of all thank all those who have worked on this debate and , in particular , the rapporteur , Mr Breyer .
let me make a very brief comment on the land @-@ based approach .
the decommissioning of pesticides that are harmful to allergens , mutagens and reproduction , as well as our nervous and endocrine systems , and which are detrimental to our immune system , is a fully health @-@ friendly objective .
we cannot ignore these factors when discussing plant protection legislation .
the plant Protection Agency says that banning pesticides means that production has 65 @-@ 200 % more land , which reduces productivity .
I only think that it is better to achieve this approach based on risk analysis and risk reduction .
we must remember that their lack of food causes price increases .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Madam President , this Parliament is like the Paabel torn , the Ligooria of the Habsbursts Empire , full of flags .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , let me say to Mr Davies that we should bear in mind clearly why we need to discuss setting strict binding limits for emissions .
I have been saying for a long time that we need to set targets with higher demands .
obviously , solutions need to be found for new engine technology in the short term .
I am pleased to note that your message on nuclear energy is fully in line with our conclusions in the communication on the model programme for nuclear energy , which is widely supported by the European Economic and Social Committee .
people who bow to the praises of nuclear energy will have no right to ignore such a shameful phenomenon in the future .
due to the political uncertainty caused by the London Government &apos;s failure to prioritise the project , the project will now continue in California .
in my country , Bulgaria , we were unnecessarily asked to close the 2 000 MW safe , clean nuclear power stations .
in any case , the Commission recognises that the amendments to the original proposals are indisputably important , have the support of the Council and Parliament and do not alter the content of our original proposals .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , I would like to return to the decision taken yesterday afternoon .
this document is one of the most important evidence showing that the debate on taxation policy can become European .
European unity is not threatened by differences in tax policies , but rather undermines the wrong tax policies for the competitiveness of the EU .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the debate has been very interesting and most of the contributions have been encouraged .
( loud applause )
many challenges await implementation : economic reform , growth and job creation , strengthening social cohesion , focusing on innovation , our proposals on energy and climate change , our programme for justice , freedom and security .
( applause )
yes , I did indeed find the main achievements of the constitution , which I worked on for more than ten years , and I could actually be happy about .
( PL ) Mr President , contrary to the gloomy predictions in Poland and the unfounded criticism of the debates in the last Parliament , particularly by the leader of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , the Lisbon Summit proved to be a diplomatic compromise .
that is our aim , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
if it remains necessary , then all institutional reforms will be worth nothing .
however , this is also a task for the European institutions .
those who vote in favour will vote in favour of postponing this vote to the next part @-@ session and those who vote against will vote in favour of not amending the agenda .
the legislative rules governing environmental protection are a compromise between the need to protect the environment and the demand of large companies to maximise their excessive profits , be it forthcoming .
ladies and gentlemen , because of common sense , I did not support most of your proposals in the package .
finally , in accordance with the spirit of the French national debate on the environment , I voted in favour of a pesticide tax to encourage our farmers to reduce the use of processing products .
in its draft budget , the Council cut commitment appropriations to EUR 128.4 billion and payment appropriations to EUR 1194 billion , thus reducing the already narrow financial framework by 10.3 billion .
reducing funding for research and transport in order to find the money for the Galileo programme , as proposed by the EU &apos;s finance ministers , would not make sense .
those Members who will decide tomorrow what sort of Paabel torn they give to are less than a dozen .
so far , it is fine - OK !
finally , Mr President , may I welcome the Members present today for the national holiday of my country .
one final point is that the report on screening showed that there are around 11 000 staff in the Commission in the field of administrative support and coordination in the field of governance .
Parliament gave a clear and concrete signal that it is now up to Frontex and the Member States to deliver on the commitments that have been made so far , to eliminate the inefficiency and delays we suffered last year .
( FI ) Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteurs , Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä .
in paragraph 24 of the resolution , the European Parliament stresses the need for the Commission to approve the national implementation plans for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the Structural Funds as soon as possible .
Member of the Commission . - I have already mentioned that the governments , particularly the Syrian Government , to which the honourable Member referred , have made it clear that they are not in favour of external humanitarian aid programmes implemented through international organisations and NGOs .
the first wave of contract agents is leaving and their pension contributions must be transferred to the second pension scheme , and salaries and pensions will increase by 3 % annually .
so the attitude of businesses has really changed in a positive direction .
Member of the Commission . - We are still a long way from considering what will happen if the negotiations , which have not yet started , are to fail .
all the so @-@ called reforms of the common agricultural policy have been based on restricting production in the European Union .
we need a fundamental redesign of the common agricultural policy , because a piecemeal intervention is only a correction of beauty errors .
thousands of people die every year in Europe as a result of smoking .
with regard to passive smoking and general smoking , a sensible liberal principle should be recalled that the personal freedom of one person stops where another starts - and what would show this principle even better than unwanted passive smoking ?
we must protect two groups in particular : children and adolescents and workers .
we do not want to weaken the protection of non @-@ smokers .
I will have a more in @-@ depth discussion with you in the near future - next year - where we will be dealing with the specific Commission proposal based on today &apos;s debate .
these are positive steps forward and we want to turn them into our capital now , but I would like to say , however , that not all the questions raised by Parliament or the justified parliamentary transfers received the answers expected from the other institutions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am convinced that this framework will not only facilitate cross @-@ border mobility , but will also act as a driver of intra @-@ EU mobility - if we think of students , workers , researchers and volunteers and all those who need to be able to move freely in Europe , without causing panic and unnecessary concern .
we have a result ahead of us , and the education institutions of the Member States must use this common framework as interpreter and reference .
agenda of the next sitting : see Minutes
what is more - my final point - if people do not recognise their past , there is no future .
as we know , relatively little took place in this area last year .
fellow Members , I believe that we need to think about this , because your dear democratic Turkey , this ground @-@ breaking human rights paradise , is knocking on Europe &apos;s door just now , when a frightening , unpredictable , tragic warmer on the Iraqi front is becoming a reality .
Turkey &apos;s policy of dividing Cyprus into two countries is not the solution .
they agree with discrimination against Central Europe and thus weaken the position of the European Union as a global partner .
without any constitutional amendment , it will continue to have power over all political , economic , financial , administrative , judicial and security issues .
with regard to the EU @-@ Russia partnership , some reasonable questions can be asked .
we really take them very seriously .
EC @-@ Serbia agreement on short @-@ stay visas ( vote )
( applause )
the Corbett report recommends that , in order to save EUR 10 million a year , the verbatim reports of parliamentary proceedings should no longer be translated into all official languages .
in writing . - ( SK ) In the EU , mobility between labour countries has become unavoidable : after enlargement , it is the everyday reality of the 27 EU countries .
if this is indeed the case - and there are reports and statistics on this - that nuclear power can have a huge impact in reducing our CO2 emissions , then we need to significantly increase the number of nuclear power stations .
it was not the first legislative act - which comes - but it is not by supporting the 2012 deadline , supported by the European Commission , I think that the ALDE Group and the PPE @-@ DE Group failed the first attempt at climate change in this Chamber and that people outside the outside are looking at what has happened here today and wondering whether we are still serious about the commitment made in March to reduce CO2 levels .
there is no common tax policy because of conflicts between imperialists .
personally , I have never smoked during my life .
Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten &apos;s motion for a resolution is a consensual and balanced document and has attempted to address all the issues relating to this particular problem .
I also welcome the fact that the government arrested and handed over two of the six most wanted war crimes - Tolimir and Djordjevic .
I would also like to highlight the positive aspects that have been undertaken by the local parliament in Vojvodina regarding the promotion of tolerance and cooperation with young people and have an important influence .
we must help Serbia , and not just talk about it .
Serbia still has much to do in this regard .
because we have a common destiny .
Mr President , thank you for allowing me to finish on this .
no , you have a responsibility here and , in my opinion , you have failed to do so on EPAs , at least in accordance with your statements to our committee .
our objective must be development , and trade is one of the ways to achieve this .
some activities can also be financed from the new Instrument for Stability , so we now have more resources to deal with this major challenge , and certainly the clear position expressed by Parliament that they must be used in full efficiency if necessary , because I fully agree with the objective you have set out .
I would like to ask three things .
( el ) I would like to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council &apos;s motto that he has ordered an inertia and delays for 18 months .
during this assessment , we also discussed what lessons we can learn from the recent turbulence in the financial markets .
I therefore hope that the clear official position taken by European governments and the Afghan Government to reduce opium production needs to be conveyed , this formal position we could send out a different message , and the European Parliament will perhaps be more free to make such a proposal than others .
1 . in Afghanistan , the necessary quantity of morphine is already produced on the basis of special licences under the supervision of the United Nations drugs agency and the Afghan Ministry of Drugs .
one final point : I welcome the fact that it has been a pragmatic debate , not a dispute between the liberalisation or the legalisation and banning of drugs .
however , I do not think Afghanistan may be of any use at this stage .
certainly , the Court must not listen to the debtor or inform him of the procedure before attachment to his bank account , otherwise the expected result may be the opposite .
the debate is closed .
if you look at why a criminal conviction in one country can be carried out in another country , what we are doing in principle is making the lives of the convicted person better : perhaps he can be closer to his family and his place of succession .
this means that the overall number of complaints has stabilised at around the level achieved since 53 % growth in 2004 .
of course , when taking action we should avoid delaying or failing to act , and that is why the Commission has recently adopted a communication on the implementation of Community law , and we have laid down more targeted preventive measures , improved information provisions and problem resolution .
however , I think it is interesting to point out that it would be much more useful if everyone in these countries had his or her own ombudsman , and particularly in Italy , instead of the only European Ombudsman .
it is positive that you are dealing with a certain number of cases and taking decisions , but we need to work a little more to educate people about what you do and how you are going to do to bring even more cases on your desks .
on the one hand , the Ombudsman &apos;s activities must be accompanied by an overview of the institution &apos;s profile and accessibility throughout Europe .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I think this is covered by my earlier statement .
( Parliament adopted the oral amendment )
this could aggravate the administrative burden , since payments will be made throughout the year for preparing these sessions , both in terms of workplaces and in terms of staff .
at the moment , I can only note with regret that they have been refused linguistic rights or these rights have been ignored when it comes to education or religious practices in the Romanian language .
this proposal should be ready by mid @-@ 2008 at the latest .
author . - ( ES ) Mr President , I believe there are three factors - at least three - that justify this haste .
this is , of course , why we emphasise the need for democracy and civil government to return to free and fair elections in January , which is the only way to meet the challenges of Pakistani society .
here too , the support of the European Union has proved to be very useful , although in the short term it may become apparent that it is insufficient .
Madam President , I strongly emphasise the killing of 10 African Union peacekeepers by unidentified troops in South Darfur on 30 September 2007 in Haskanita .
this is not only an expression of our humanitarian commitments , but also a salutary investment in sustainable development and security .
( PL ) Mr President , recently , Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing , former French President and the Constitutional Treaty , which were rejected in the French and Dutch referendum , were the main author that the Lisbon Treaty adopted in Lisbon was nothing more than a revised version of the Constitutional Treaty , the references to which were deliberately removed to the Constitution .
will these events be strongly promoted in this forum in order to make the European martyrs that are actually taking place in Russia ?
it is time to take decisions on the role of sport in education , with comments and proposals announced by Mr Schmitt .
( PL ) Mr President , I fully support the draft resolution , and I thank the rapporteur for producing this text very well .
it must have control over the conclusion of long @-@ term nuclear fuel agreements , and it must provide a framework for investment , etc .
these people have been frustrated and call on us to act .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , after the Romanian citizen brutally murdered Giovanna Reggiani , whose family we express our sincere condolences , many Italian political groups referred to Europe .
( NL ) Mr President , I think we are happy to agree that an effective approach to crime deserves our support and , of course , the murder is never justified , but I believe that we also agree that the right to live permanently in the Schengen area is a great value and a concrete example of European citizenship .
we must also remember that there is a direct relationship between climate change and the soil .
it is very difficult to have one general directive covering all these situations .
( SK ) Before we look at the wording of the proposed framework directive on soil protection , we should consider whether EU legislation is really needed in this area .
Mr President , this proposal for a directive on soil protection contains huge gaps in credibility .
I would like to give you one more thought .
the remaining allowances will be allocated free of charge according to benchmarks , by rewarding airlines with high efficiency .
the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is therefore proposing to raise the proportion of allowances for auctioning to 25 % .
I also believe that we need to show greater courage and ambition on this issue .
so the decision we will take tomorrow is a signal of where we should go in relation to the reform of the emissions trading system as a whole .
however , I have problems with the outrageous attitude of aviation , which is going through this debate , just as it would be the greatest environmental enemy , and the best thing would be if we were to stop flying at all .
NASA has announced the launch of the programme to find ways to improve the petrophum .
when IFRS 8 was reached , we had the impression that it was not the same path that the international organisation followed , and we wanted to warn the public against it .
the two @-@ level strategy proposed by the Commission in 2006 , which , by contributing to the interinstitutional agreement , focuses on concrete results for citizens , has already produced results .
it must also focus on achieving a social Europe .
Mr Swoboda said that there is no social dimension , and I have to admit that he is right on this issue .
public services are at the heart of our social model .
today &apos;s enfour advisers face a new challenge in aviation emissions , and I hope that this time we will put together a strong package .
we consider these measures necessary , at least to combat exploitation and to publicise the use of untaxed labour .
I will therefore conclude by saying that if someone here takes account of the citizens , then let us start by calling for a general referendum on the Lisbon Treaty .
it is therefore no surprise to you that I wish to congratulate the Commission on its emphasis on prosperity , solidarity , security , freedom and strengthening Europe &apos;s position in the world .
I believe that this leads to tacit tax harmonisation , and I am completely opposed to such a move .
whether this feeling is justified or not is not important .
I am absolutely convinced that Europe has an important role to play in setting moral standards for financial capitalism , and Europe cannot accept that some speculators jeopardise the principles of global competition , as we could see in the case of a crisis in the credit market with high levels of risk .
the reference to the language of Moldovans will remain invalid for these MEPs .
compulsory physical education is a matter for teachers and the school council , not for the EU .
I would like to express my concern at the consequences of the natural degradation of the soil and the degradation of the soil caused by human activities .
I agree that aviation must be included in any emissions trading system , but there must be a balance between environmental protection considerations and the aviation sector .
we are currently faced with an historic event : the biggest enlargement in the Schengen area , where borders between nine Member States are disappearing simultaneously : the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Poland , Lithuania , Slovenia , Slovakia and Malta .
Europol is doing excellent work to reduce international crime in Europe .
it is now necessary to act , and Commissioner Frattini rightly sends out balanced , positive signals in this regard , but we must not forget that Schengen needs to think about controlling the external borders of the European Union , and this needs to be done more effectively .
we should not see a repeat of the situation in which the Commission did not want to provide Parliament with the information needed to make a decision .
recently , we have not adopted legislation that is more important than that , and I am proud that I have been able to be part of this excellent process .
we must continue to look at opportunities for employing and training workers in the country of origin by setting up training centres and vocational training facilities , as is now the case with many of these countries .
Africa is a continent rich by talented people .
the latter assessed that the opt @-@ out of Article 109 ( 2 ) of Council Regulation No 1605 / 2002 can only be maintained in a separate regulation based on Article 279 of the EC Treaty and proposed that these exemptions be even extended to the Financial Regulation .
was the United Kingdom or France left today ?
this can only be a good news for the Council and the Portuguese Presidency , and I think it is necessary to thank the Commission and the European Parliament for the fact that we can move forward together on the basis of my proposal presented to you today .
I took this opportunity to point out that democracy still has its own advantages , because it allows people to express freely what they think , including things that are sometimes shocking .
is it or was it more general , because I do not feel that this was specifically addressed to me , given my competence as Commissioner for Development ?
( DE ) Commissioner , we all hope that the status issue will indeed be resolved on 10 December .
the 2005 communication stated that this is a very big administrative step which could be risky and costly to implement .
however , it is not about trying to create a picture of some of our Member States if , and I quote : &apos; unreliable airspace business partners and security risk of US military willingness &apos; or encouraging legislation in the US Congress to block the financing of upgrading US airports in order to provide support to A380 .
it is his duty and the citizens will assess it in the light of the result .
the third and final point I would like to mention concerns the future more .
it is a means by which citizens can tell us how laws we produce affect or do not affect them .
Member of the Commission . - ( EL ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission and I personally wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr Vakalis , for this extremely informative and valuable report .
however , earthquakes are just as many natural disasters as floods , forest fires and storms .
aid effectiveness could be greatly improved through good organisation , which includes coordination with other aid cultures , clear principles and unambiguous criteria .
I assume that you are confusing it with development aid .
this solution fully recognises the legitimate concerns of those whose lives are expected to change , however , it must not be forgotten that this phenomenon may have adverse consequences for some people and we must find a solution to this situation .
we must therefore make it clear what we will indeed achieve during today &apos;s debate , that the consequences of globalisation can be interpreted in a variety of ways and can be resolved by various competing methods .
when it comes to economic growth , we are still talking about quantity , and not quality , or what actually happens in our societies .
the right refuses to discuss economic coordination .
all Members of this House know that economic freedom , growing prosperity and social model are compatible .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I think we have listened today to speakers who oppose economic freedom to safeguard and protect social rights and to combat poverty .
the Financial Times wrote in July that Brussels is the world &apos;s legislative capital , which no one can ignore from Washington to Tokyo .
all of these activities must facilitate the growth of the European Union and the creation of new jobs .
I am pleased to see that I can agree with many of the views expressed today .
- Before the vote :
based on the above reasons , I voted against the directive , and I hope that the Council will now make the necessary changes .
in my opinion , the European soil protection directive is superfluous and unnecessary , and I voted against this proposal .
we must therefore create uniform rules at Community level , eliminate loopholes in the law and strike a balance between the need to introduce checks and requirements for the protection of the internal market , on the one hand , and the free movement of capital , on the other .
we understand that Pakistan is facing serious challenges that threaten its security , and we recognise the sacrifices made by its people and the efforts made to combat extremism and terrorism , yet the European Union is convinced that democratic regimes must not intervene in resolving these issues .
we should support Amnesty International &apos;s Day of Conduct tomorrow in order to remember political prisoners in Pakistan , and we must certainly review the issues concerning aid and its use .
it is just as important to obtain large developing countries , such as China and India , by restricting the growth of emissions .
in particular , it must take into account the fact that the biggest adjustment costs are now falling to the poorest regions in the world , which are the least involved in the problem and are most poorly equipped to deal with it .
Madam President , one of the most effective strategies that the EU could use at the Bali Conference is to set an example .
how to offset the impact ?
I applaud and applaud this contribution , work and effort .
I would also like to add a few comments on the situation in Georgia , which we have already discussed .
Ukraine &apos;s question and paving the way for full membership of the European Union must therefore be considered individually , given that Ukraine is a major partner for Europe in the Eastern European Neighbourhood .
in my opinion , this is an extremely difficult situation .
the two speeches with the two @-@ sided opposition , which cannot be excluded from the ongoing process , are inevitable .
( FR ) Mr President , I intend to speak in particular about the Mediterranean region , which is very important for European foreign policy , as the rapporteurs have reminded us and for which I thank them .
this resolution , which we are adopting , unifies Parliament &apos;s vision of a neighbourhood policy , improving the developments that we set out in January 2006 .
these include diplomatic action , civil and military missions and trade and development activities .
the approach you have proposed seems interesting , but we should not leave ourselves open to accusations that the Union thinks it is competent to solve all the global problems .
Ukraine has significant achievements in this area and it is worth taking advantage of them .
moreover , this is not possible , because the current income of the state is not sufficient to raise the promised payments .
undoubtedly , Ukraine has become a promising partner for the European Union .
in addition , the Commission will propose to the Member States concerned to withdraw their fishing capacity either through a temporary closure ban or the scrapping of vessels in order to ensure respect for quotas in 2008 and subsequent years .
some even say that this is irreversible .
rapporteur . - Mr President , representatives of the Council and the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to begin my speech by thanking those colleagues who have entrusted me with drawing up this report and the shadow rapporteur for his contribution .
in my opinion , employment is the most decisive link between social and economic changes in a united Europe .
national collecting societies will not disappear ; the authors belong to local organisations and the proceeds will be distributed through local collective representation organisations linked to new licensing platforms .
the EU must set strategic priorities for relations with these countries , with a general focus on people &apos;s security .
we need to draw up public health strategies that improve our quality of life , in particular to prevent and combat diseases effectively , taking into account demographic trends and increasing life expectancy .
I will give you just one example , and I hope it will test the contradictory results we receive when we look at the money and if we look at men or women .
anyone who wants to fight poverty - as Mr Fatuzzo has already said - really needs to focus more strongly on the older generation .
I have had the honour of seeing young people who are opposed to poverty and inclusion be accompanied by embassies travelling through Europe , by Mrs Lynne &apos;s report and by a city , from one European capital to another , with respect for the European Parliament , thanks to the work of our colleague .
( the oral amendment was not accepted )
we are therefore opposed to their gradual transition to EU supranational institutions in the process of justifying any new &apos; progress &apos; on the basis of the previous &apos; moving forward &apos; .
in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I strongly oppose these motions for resolutions and wish to express my strong opposition .
they do not represent an incentive for strengthening the rule of law and the principles of the economic market and for respecting citizens &apos; rights .
the report rightly emphasises the need to take into account ethnic and religious segregation in EU legislation in order to protect all people from violence and discrimination .
one possible consequence is that Christian minorities cannot maintain their position in the Middle East in the long term and are forced to flee to Europe .
it also depends on what we do , which is not always very consistent or reasonable at all .
on the other hand , the Union of Islamic courts is against them and wants to unify Somalia again , under traditional Islamic rules , without warlords .
I would be grateful to the Members of this House if they were to support such a move , because it would offer some opportunities for compromise negotiations .
it was agreed at the June 2007 European Council that the future new treaty would contain a cross @-@ referencing to the Charter , which was adapted and definitively approved in 2004 , so that it would have the same legal force as the Treaties , and this would be reflected in the new treaty .
the freedom of expression of national personalities is much better than the Strasbourg Court on the basis of the Luxembourg Court .
otherwise , all the work contained in this excellent report has been ineffectual .
I am of the opinion that the European Union has the greatest problems associated with the provision of skilled and adaptable workers , and this is an issue that should be at the heart of the European flexicurity strategy .
we want a Europe based on values .
we must use the next EU @-@ Africa Summit to address the legitimate and enforced demands of this suffering continent , which are so close to us and at the same time so far and cowardly knocking on our door .
( applause )
if so , it was based on the fact that the Prime Minister does not think it is necessary to ask the same question twice as the people .
social policy does not supply wealth .
I therefore believe that we are facing a debate on the consolidation of this social situation .
by voting in the referendum &apos; yes &apos; at the time for the Constitution , Spanish citizens made a major contribution to ensuring that the Charter is not simply placed on the shell .
an interim agreement with the East African Community ( Kenya , Uganda , Rwanda , Burundi and Tanzania ) has been launched in East Africa .
no country , if it fails to sign , must be put in a worse position than it is at the moment .
since no one can deny that a number of ACP countries face significant challenges , properly framed EPAs should be seen as an opportunity for ACP countries .
we give the Agency greater responsibility for establishing safety standards and interoperability criteria .
( es ) Mr President , Commissioner Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work on drawing up various reports , which is another step forward towards the integration of European railways .
it is very important that the legislation on interoperability be extended to the entire Community network .
implementation must be monitored very carefully and , in particular , Commissioner , action must be taken on one aspect that concerns me greatly .
do you not think that traffic rules apply to you ?
solutions had to be found to a number of difficult issues , and today &apos;s result is a reliable evaluation criterion .
the report contributes to this objective .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the basis for amending the directive was the UN Protocol and the question of how to effectively combat terrorism .
furthermore , together with all actors in the tourism sector , we must promote sustainable and high @-@ quality tourism , which is competitive , environmentally friendly , accountable and , above all , accessible to everyone .
on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , I note with satisfaction that the responsible committee has adopted a positive position on our proposal to amend the legal basis , although this would only be done in line with future proposals on macro @-@ financial assistance .
these are just a few examples of this excellent report .
we must decide how trade policy can contribute positively to tackling the problem of climate change .
the Court also announces an improvement in internal policies , such as research programmes and external action .
are these real errors ?
since this report is better than last year &apos;s report , we should also congratulate the Commission .
it wants to close this now , although it is currently the only existing tool , which we believe is effective in situations that are anything but transparent .
the Court of Auditors is wrong in saying that golf clubs receive direct payments .
I therefore hope that Parliament will confirm the agreement reached with the Council , enabling the Council to adopt Parliament &apos;s amendments at its meeting next week on 6 and 7 December 2007 .
situation in Georgia ( vote )
in order to qualify , not only the numerical but also ideological criteria must apply , and that means that the opposing parties have no chance whatsoever .
this is a very laudable objective , but unfortunately it is used as an excuse for establishing policies that discriminate against the people of our Member States , who become second @-@ class citizens in their own countries .
I believe that GMOs pose a significant risk to health and the environment in the European Union and that all decisions taken on such matters deserve full control .
in writing . - I welcome and voted in favour of the Leinen report on the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
on top of that , it gives the Commission a free hand to act without proper legal basis .
however , there are gloomy dangers associated with this report .
we must not forget that a country which uses domestic policy of power does not come back to the use of such a policy in international relations .
it supported living with its neighbours in peace and harmony , respecting full sovereignty .
if the fight against corruption remains a priority - and this should remain the case - the attachment of those who maintain democracy should be accompanied equally by criticism of excesses and violations of citizens &apos; fundamental rights .
although the European Parliament initially requested 2017 , the deadline for Member States is now 2020 , a realistic date , which has been presented by the Council , in agreement with representatives of the Member States .
the measures already taken by the EU in relation to carbon sequestration under the seabed need to be strengthened as they represent an innovative contribution to combating climate change .
local authorities are already doing a great deal in this area and they should continue to do so .
when we talk about implementing this ambitious legislative package , the ball is now in our court ; it is the Commission &apos;s job to monitor implementation .
however , we should not forget that the absence of subjective and comparable census data would have negative consequences .
moreover , I was struck by the fact that such data would only be collected from women .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , thank you very much for the briefing you have given to the development of discussions .
they were obviously intended to fill the gaps left in the withdrawal of toys .
after this debate with the Bulgarian Ministry of Economic Affairs , the number of inspections increased to four times .
I do not think it is a question of creating a single frame of reference , which is purely theoretical .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the Ottawa mine Ban Convention has been very effective in saving thousands of lives and preventing hundreds of serious injuries .
closure of sitting
the common organisation of the market in wine is part of this process .
in addition , it requires the Czech Republic to contribute its financial contribution to promoting excess wine in Europe in third countries .
Commissioner , there have been some changes since you presented this proposal for a new common organisation of the wine market .
we cannot cut the quality of our wine plantations and the image of our brands .
we should also impose the same conditions on those who export agricultural produce to Europe .
it is a limited study covering only five Member States , but it is very interesting and I send you a copy .
the Sudanese Government firmly states that it will never hand over them to the International Criminal Court .
the issue of the proliferation of institutions within the framework of the European Union remains open and does not concern only the institutional restructuring of the Seventh Framework Programme .
furthermore , I believe that we should also involve Russia in developing and implementing this framework .
this system has led to the closure of production activities in many small and medium @-@ sized farms and family farms , the abandonment of rural areas , the destruction of biodiversity and the reduction in food sovereignty in certain Member States , particularly in Portugal .
as regards the overall reserve of EUR 5 million in staff salaries , the Commission is determined to present the required study on the implementation of activity @-@ based management and the reports requested by Parliament on follow @-@ up or revision of staff needs and implementation of Article 44 of the interinstitutional agreement .
secondly , we know that at least 75 % of the EU &apos;s money is spent on completely useless and dangerous targets .
secondly , as regards informing EU citizens about the work and results of the European Parliament , we now have the means to better cooperate and communicate with citizens .
the European Union will continue to make full use of this Committee for tabling thematic and country @-@ specific resolutions .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( FR ) Ladies and gentlemen , &apos; a new human rights person has been born who has nothing in common with his predecessor of 1789 &apos; - such a defamatory description was used by the philosopher Marcel Gau1987 , declared here in the Treaty of Lisbon , and by Article 5 of the Treaty of Lisbon , which made the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding .
this goes against the obligations of the Indian Government under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
such an approach represents a difference that the EU is able to offer compared to other international actors .
some African leaders have clearly formulated the problems caused by our fiercely protected approaches .
as regards food security , the fight against diseases , human rights and migration , and particularly support for weaker countries , we have consistently asked the Commission to act more and more effectively in the interests of Africa and with them .
we should be absolutely clear on this .
it is true that , for the reasons I mentioned earlier , we have made very little progress in this regard .
Mr Rübig , as this issue does not belong to my portfolio , I would ask Commissioner Mandelson to give you a written reply immediately .
Member of the Commission . - First of all , I would like to thank the honourable Member for the help he has given me in moving forward with this policy .
the Commission will then propose to continue to comply with relevant UNECE regulation with revised limit values .
on the ground , there are concerns about the volume of the submitted projects , particularly with regard to possible health effects on people living near the vicinity of electricity lines .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Madam President , Mr Leichtfried , ladies and gentlemen , we are now reaching an agreement with the Council at second reading on an extremely important proposal .
I must ask that , whatever the Commission is still investigating , please give me and so many other pilots a fortress on this issue .
some of them have already been announced .
with regard to your idea of emphasising more promotion programmes in third countries , this idea is basically symptomatic to me , but it must be put in the right context .
I hope that we all agree with the fact that we have a budget to explain to consumers the high quality of European products , both in the European Union and in the overseas markets .
the current project is a contribution to achieving this objective .
Madam President , it is not acceptable to postpone further .
in the end , both ways are designed to achieve the same objectives .
in this respect , President Barroso is absolutely right because it is unfair that some - for example , in southern Europe - should be under pressure from intense migration , while others in other parts of Europe wash their hands of this problem .
in this case , we can say that the threat of Iran &apos;s nuclear bomb is apparently abhorrent if we can believe in the US poem .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights is also officially proclaimed today .
however , from our point of view , the new agreement also has some shortcomings : the appointment of the new High Representative and Vice @-@ President of the Commission should be consulted by the European Parliament , not only with regard to the first person to take office on 1 January 2009 , but also in the subsequent interim appointment , and obviously when the Commission is elected as a whole , including the Vice @-@ President for Foreign Affairs .
this is the political heritage that will be called upon to consolidate and develop this week &apos;s summit .
if we succeed in agreeing on the policy direction , we will be able to create a genuine political will to solve the real problems that some of you mentioned .
in the occupied territories , the humanitarian situation remains appalling for the Palestinians .
( loud applause )
finally , I would like to congratulate the President on his excellent management of the sittings , especially in the present , sometimes even hot atmosphere .
therefore , in addition to the 1 600 million improvements in the Multiannual Financial Framework , the implementation of the flexibility mechanism has also proposed an additional EUR 200 million in funding for the European Global Navigation Satellite System ( EGNOS @-@ Galileo ) .
we certainly need to give preference to the protection and security of vehicle users for all kinds of economic and political considerations .
I particularly supported four amendments which I consider to be of great importance , not only to protect the European wine industry , particularly in the Burgundy and Franche Comté regions , but also to make it more competitive .
however , it remains to be seen whether , once the Galileo project is completed ( meaning closed with public funds ) , it will not later be offered to private capital on the basis of a kind of public private partnership , for example , in which the public sector bears costs and private capital will profit .
we want China to focus more decisively on environmental issues , as the environment is an important global common asset .
the EU &apos;s action must be critical and rightly criticises China for what it has done wrong , where it should move forward , while we are engaged in a dialogue on global warming , with the negative consequences of globalisation , in Africa &apos;s development and in the fight against terrorism .
but I am one of those who believe that the EU should follow a results @-@ orientated approach in promoting human rights , not so easily based on principles and most importantly , we must accept that improvements are only carried out gradually .
we must understand , unprepared or unprepared , that there are people who are deprived of fundamental rights , who are suffering political pressure , oppressive by non @-@ democratic regimes or discriminated against by race , ethnic origin and religion throughout the world .
and this pseudo @-@ democratic distortion is dumped on the British people !
he indicated that I could repeat Dachaud .
we applaud the resolution .
I welcome the unanimous ratification by the Montenegrin Parliament of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement , which followed shortly .
it was recognised and valued in terms of both culture and politics .
this is the true direction of political development in the Balkans , which makes it possible to achieve the strategic objective of the majority of the people living in the region , namely closer cooperation with the European Union until it becomes a full member .
my group campaigned last month to reduce the levy on condoms by 5 % across the European Union , which was partly symbolic , but we also think is an important initiative .
the accident occurred in the Kerch Strait , which unites the Black Sea with the Adriatic , where Russian oil is mainly exported to Europe .
in recent accidents at sea , the vessels of certain categories , the so @-@ called sea / river oil tankers , were particularly involved , which have been allowed to move on the high seas only with certain restrictions .
of course , I know what the Commissioner says about this : &apos; even if you combine all deposit guarantee systems in Europe , it would still be sufficient in the sea , compared to the sums of money we need to find a solution to this crisis &apos; .
the report before us today calls for swift solutions to promote the introduction of cross @-@ border passport for non @-@ harmonised funds .
as a resident in the East European country , which is poor in terms of capital , I do not welcome the fact that everyone faces waiting anxieties , wishing to see what happens when hedge funds or private equity are expanded , because this does not affect our region at all and not affect at least a good recession for several years .
in view of all this , I fully support this proposal and approve the aforementioned agreement , which fulfils the purpose of both institutions .
I hope that with this regulation we will be able to deal with most situations much better .
individual identification cannot function properly without electronic identification .
so we warned you and you did not listen .
for this to happen , political will is needed to create a competitive framework for European textile industries .
we face trade and investment restrictions , unstoppable counterfeiting and regulatory barriers in practically all sectors .
so this agreement deserves action and , if things go right , I think it will be a win @-@ win situation for both sides .
I would like to thank the Commission , and Commissioner Mandelson in particular , for its constant support .
under heading 1a , commitment appropriations will be adapted to :
I would like to say that every man and every woman have every right to express their opinion in this House .
the suburbs of Paris are burned , but the problem is probably a minority of dissidents which has become a scourge of this noble institution .
due to the lack of a precise definition of political extremism and xenophobia in the resolution aimed at combating extremism , we will abstain from voting on this issue .
the free trade agreement between Korea and the European Union could serve as a basis for promoting high social and environmental standards and could serve as an example for other agreements currently in the negotiation phase .
however , this should not relieve us Europeans of our own responsibility .
this is , unfortunately , the rule rather than the exception .
these consequences were forced abortions , mutilation and extensive murders , and many suicide cases among these women .
therefore , if we celebrated this Presidency symbolically , it could be the presence of politicians in Portugal and other countries and the President of the Commission at the moment of lifting border controls , thus contributing to the realisation of Europe and to the desire to guarantee the freedom of movement and security represented by the Schengen area .
in the case of Bolkestein , a quick decision was also made before the summer holidays and paid us a bill for the ratification of the Constitution .
Mr Sócrates , there is no doubt that you are happy with both your Presidency and your ability to sign the Treaty last Thursday in this great Lisbon monastery .
we proposed a document defining achievable results - in accordance with Article 249 of the Treaty - and in exchange for Member States to choose the form and methods .
- ( MT ) I would like to thank you for your good wishes to my country , Malta , which joined the euro zone two weeks ago , increasing the number of countries that have introduced the euro to 15 .
we cannot allow Tibet or any other nation of the 21st century to be destroyed by dictatorships , tyranny or saBuddhist desire to impose political supremacy .
I hope that the intercultural dialogue between cultures in 2008 will contribute effectively to promoting peace , which is one of the fundamental values of the European Union .
I would be grateful if these issues were not forgotten in the forthcoming heated debate .
the results speak for themselves .
the Commission has proposed far @-@ reaching legislation that focuses on mandatory decarbonisation of the engines , improved technology for vehicles and the use of biofuels .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , I would like to start by thanking my fellow Members for this truly honest and open debate .
twenty seven different tax systems are an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the internal market and hinder business activities , particularly small businesses , as Commissioner Kovács said .
rapporteur . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I just wanted to say that we are wasting a lot more words than is needed here .
I would also have liked to have included smaller companies in the scope of the directive , as they often cause unfair competition at large airports , because they encourage low @-@ cost airlines en masse .
( PT ) Mr President , in this one @-@ minute speech , I would like to highlight the improvements we have tabled to ensure that this directive takes into account expressly restrictions that are detrimental to geographically and natural disadvantaged regions , such as the outermost regions , particularly under Article 299 ( 2 ) of the EC Treaty .
5.2 million passenger Newcastle airport in the UK , for example , has to compete with all other airports in Northern England to attract business .
for the last 30 years , the European Union &apos;s public health and environmental protection policy and legislation have made significant progress in reducing the risks posed by chemical substances , not only in the European Union but also globally .
it would also have been a very questionable interpretation of health and environmental legislation if we had continued to export in a situation where , on the one hand , we have introduced new guidelines with the latest pesticides in the field of safety , while , on the other , doing exactly the opposite with our exports .
such vulnerable groups include migrant workers , who are often exploited , as well as young people and older workers who need special attention , and disabled people .
the establishment of equal social protection for all workers regardless of the form of employment contract , the acceleration of bureaucratic procedures for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , and the provision of incentives , including financial incentives , for training are essential aspects .
it is a &apos; light industry &apos; , where most workers are women , and wages are also low because there are expected risks .
as the Commissioner said , it is true that this is a very old piece of legislation .
in some countries , there have been cases of criminal treatment of Polish workers where they are forced to slave labour .
I believe that the compromise we reached last week , which has now been approved by the Liberals , makes perfect sense and we have found a common solution that is workable and consumer @-@ friendly .
I therefore very much hope that Parliament will be able to adopt the text at second reading tomorrow .
given how much the construction of this wall costs , we could actually allow Christians , Jews and Muslims to go to school and live like brothers and sisters in peace schools .
if you do not want to make the changes that I have proposed , then Mr Heaton @-@ Harris - and only in this case - would you be right , and we would work on the agenda agreed earlier .
it was absolutely clear to me that it would require an endless list of my wishes , because human rights are so important : they are so important , and it is precisely for that reason that the institutions were set up , so that we never get back to the conditions that led to the Second World War and its appalling assets that swept across many nations and minorities .
when a commissioned study showed that antisocial violence in Europe was largely carried out in favour of youth poverty limits , the director of the Centre sent it to the top rubbish .
the most difficult problem in committee was adoption .
we cannot unilaterally impose an increase in the birth rate while , at the same time , paying little attention to ensuring the living conditions , equal opportunities and mental and physical development of born children .
( PL ) Mr President , first of all , I would like to express my full agreement with Mrs Foltyn @-@ Kubicka &apos;s statement .
as far as child pornography is concerned , I am very much in favour of the European Commission &apos;s initiative to try , in cooperation with some banking authorities and credit card companies , to remove pages selling child pornography from Internet payment systems .
the proposal in the report , such as the creation of a single EU classification and labelling system for the sale and marketing of audiovisual content and video games for minors , is a worthwhile idea .
politicians , all politicians have finally realised that more needs to be done , whether as a member of the government or as a member of the opposition , whether at local , regional or national level , no political party has been able to come up with firm , decisive and understandable responses .
the organisation of CONAI , manufacturers and users of packaging , which is responsible for the reuse of material , except wet waste , comes out of price increases in the south and payments in the north , where the latter , as always , benefits the South from the diversion of privatised funds .
my question to you is this : do you personally have a personal plan to achieve this 30 % reduction in your own area of responsibility ?
what evidence is you showing that they have been completely removed from the market ?
directing financial services providers requires some fundamental and some practical initiatives .
it asked Ireland to take the necessary steps within two months to subject the VHI to the rules on supervision and prudential rules of Community law , which it had previously been exempted from .
in this context , efforts to reconcile work , family life and life @-@ long learning have also been given great importance .
in future , those people who have not left learning will certainly have the advantage of adapting to the rapid changes that we face every day .
the debate is closed .
the methods of monitoring the distance allow for monitoring , among other applications , cultivation and forecasting yields .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , today &apos;s debate raises the issue of unequal treatment of Polish MEPs and members of the Seimas as regards electoral criteria as well as the abolition of the mandate .
Mr Liberadzki has produced an excellent report .
in writing . - ( DE ) Unscrupulous traders are trying to evade the special requirements applicable to the transport of chemicals and other dangerous goods , requirements such as special training for lorry drivers , labelling and so on .
I wonder where the rapporteur took his proposal , which is worse from an environmental and technical point of view than from the influence of the car lobby .
in writing . - Mr President , it is a pleasure for me to congratulate our rapporteur on his balanced report , which takes into account an important strategy , as the EU has contributed to raising standards on health and safety at work throughout the EU and to the Community strategy for 2012 .
investing in people is a more solid way of ensuring that citizens are reassured that they retain their jobs despite changing their jobs .
he expects 2008 to be a year of progress .
if you say something to the Member States , you should remind them of a common legal obligation to legislate as close as possible to citizens .
this gives us the impression that you are proposing postponement of controversial or complex issues .
much remains to be done to persuade Member States to reform their economies , and I hope that the Presidency will promote further liberalisation , labour market reforms and ensure that European businesses win from globalisation .
does the Slovenian Presidency wish to raise these issues ?
- ( PL ) Mr President , Prime Minister , the Slovenian Presidency faces a number of ambitious tasks .
President of the Commission . - Mr President , thank you very much for this interesting debate , in which I think there was a great deal of agreement on support for the priorities set out by Slovenia .
oral explanations of vote
the same applies not only to consumer protection , but also to justice and home affairs , foreign affairs , defence and other areas .
I did not do so because I am against children &apos;s rights , far from it .
for example , in border regions between Germany , the Czech Republic and Austria , prostitution involving women and an increasing number of children increased considerably after the opening of borders .
today , therefore , I would like to congratulate Parliament on reaching an agreement on these regulations .
we in Europe are obliged to abide by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child .
I therefore voted in favour of the report .
for too long , we have praised this country as a model of democracy , while forgetting social inequality and corruption , which have spread widely throughout the country : since independence , it has received USD 16 billion in development aid and has had four Presidents .
the tax ruling was delayed because we expected the results and recommendations of the third review of the IMF programme .
Europol &apos;s pragmatic legal framework - the international convention - is even more impeding the modernisation and modification of powers , and will do so for years .
Madam President , in this debate , we have heard about the integration of traditional cooperation and integration .
furthermore , all political parties must accept the decision of the Election Commission that the elections of 18 February must be conducted with dignity and restraint .
another important democratic institution is the judicial system .
your protest has been heard , Mr Van Orden .
this is part of the answer to the question .
of course , it is most appropriate for peacekeeping and peacemaking operations to be linked to cooperation under the auspices of the United Nations .
therefore , it is precisely for this reason that we always report to the Commission what we think is particularly important .
it was agreed that this issue would be discussed again in 2008 , but not necessarily in the first half of the year .
however , we would like to see these issues addressed as a matter of priority .
I am very pleased that two of Hungary &apos;s Roma MEPs , Mrs Járóka and Mrs Mohács , raised this issue , among other things , as we rightly condemned the events in November in Italy .
now , in January 2008 , as rapporteur for Black Sea cooperation , I have the privilege of opening this plenary session to discuss Parliament &apos;s recommendations on the proposal for the development of Black Sea synergy , presented by the European Commission in April .
at the same time , we must recognise that other international actors also have an interest in the region and we understand that the European Union cannot move forward with its priorities without cooperating with other global players .
the European Parliament is sending out the wrong and clear message with this report : the message that the EU should be strongly involved in the situation in the South Caucasus , the message that the EU can play a decisive role and signal in the region that the EU should increase its financial and technical assistance to help Georgia , Armenia and Azerbaijan to reform their government institutions and develop democratic institutions , encourage civil society to act in a coordinated manner and strengthen their obligations in relation to European values such as respect for human rights , fundamental freedoms and the rule of law .
this is not the case at the moment .
I should emphasise once again that the countries of the South Caucasus - Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia are very different in terms of culture , customs , religion and geopolitics .
in other words , the Black Sea Synergy should simply be manifested in the definition and birth of multilateral undertakings , identifying them with the best interests of both the Black Sea region and united Europe as a whole .
I fully agree that a separate policy , perhaps even a strategy , should be developed for the Black Sea region , and I would like to emphasise its importance once again .
I do not agree that new technologies create obstacles or lead to underrepresentation of women , because women are vegetating , intelligent and have skills more than they think .
despite positive measures - misleading wording because , in fact , this means mandatory quotas - it is difficult to change gender prejudices , based on mandatory policies .
all of us , including employers and industrialists , must regard maternity leave and paternity leave as a fundamental value for society .
women have the greatest potential in accelerating the development of high @-@ tech industries .
Madam President , today I would like to shed light on one particular aspect .
I voted against this proposal because , although it is called the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , it does not provide citizens with freedoms , it does not provide justice and it does interfere in internal affairs .
this is a pointless proposal and completely useless proposal .
however , social rights , including workers &apos; rights , have not been treated as a priority , even at a time when fundamental social rights have been called into question in policies promoted by the EU .
the rapporteur is asking for assistance , particularly for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , to ensure that the greatest possible number of women are preserved in their jobs , particularly those in disadvantaged employment situations .
the hope that the IOC decision will help to improve the situation in the country of Denmark has been an illusion .
yesterday , the EU troika urged the Chinese authorities to firmly release him immediately .
the trauma of rape is aggravated by the fact that many victims then suffer from social discrimination and the contempt of the family and society .
I call on the European Commission to consider effective measures to put pressure on the Egyptian authorities to stop this process .
the document is a final review .
this , Mr Barroso , is why we need transparent and comprehensive international agreements and why we need them as soon as possible .
we must remain firm and ensure that the legal frameworks guarantee accountability and fairness in everything and everyone , but especially in relation to the environment .
however , I would rather have liked to have seen a social dimension , given the more central role of energy prices , food prices and local inclusion , but these are only some of the areas in which we in Parliament continue to work .
I would like to thank you for that .
it is our responsibility to ensure that all options are investigated without others being excluded in one name .
you have only received confirmation of this a few days ago .
despite the information obtained from various sources , including national intelligence assessments ( National intellectual intelligence Estiters ) , we cannot be sure today that Iran is not concerned about these weapons .
there is currently a debate with Dr El Barades and the people responsible for the nuclear dossier to see if a solution could be found to these &apos; outstanding issues &apos; .
we hope that the negotiations will continue in order to find a solution .
why is Iran rushing with uranium enrichment if it does not have operational nuclear power stations or even plans to build them ?
now the question is , and I fully agree with Javier Solana here : what can we do to really change things again ?
I am sorry , Mr Davies , Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit : if Hamas stops rockets , Israel will lift the blockade - so easy that .
Parliament is fortunately able to talk about this .
the Czech Government does not communicate with the public ; the Czech Government does not inform the members of the Czech Parliament ; the Czech Government is acting behind the backs of the Czech people .
discussions on this subject were a great deal of attention for the German Presidency , and particularly for Portugal , in 2007 .
they offered cheaper services , but selectively , by selecting the most operational places for the delivery service and offering poorer working and employment conditions .
at the same time , before 2012 , I would recommend that an analysis of the functioning of the postal services market in countries that have already adopted the new rules with a view to identifying and preventing inaccuracies in the rest of the countries .
this directive is only one of many EU laws that has damaged my country and are damaging in the future .
it is necessary to clarify the requirement for the cost @-@ benefit of universal postal services , since this concept has been dealt with differently in the Member States .
we all know that it will be difficult to convince some of our partners .
Commissioner , you can count on our support for your approach .
President @-@ in @-@ Office . - ( SL ) Let me briefly respond to some of the views expressed here in this very interesting debate .
secondly , there is no evidence that people are the main cause of climate change .
according to data from 2005 , however , the US has increased its greenhouse gas emissions by 16.4 % , while the EU is approaching the Kyoto target and 2005 issued a total of 7.9 % less than in the 1990s .
this multinational company employed more than 6 000 workers in its factories in Ovari and Serzedo , for which it received millions of euros in Community aid .
furthermore , I propose that the document to be drafted includes the cost of text messages and roaming data services .
thanks to this pressure , the Commissioner has stepped up his team in the field of energy efficiency and , as I understand it , set up a special unit for monitoring the Energy Efficiency Action Plan , highlighting the priority that the Commission will finally give to energy efficiency in order to contribute to reducing our CO2 emissions and to help solve major climate change challenges .
Mrs Hübner has now announced in the debate last week with the Committee on Regional Policy that the regulation should be revised and given a greater priority to these issues in the 2007 @-@ 2013 programmes .
the proposal that the energy production industry should buy all its CO2 emission certificates from 2013 gives rise to a major increase in energy prices , which is particularly painful in the domestic economy .
having said this , I would like to warn Mr Schlyter that he is acting cautiously , because , following criticism of fishermen and fishing and the tradition of many years , I am not sure what we are doing here if Mr Schlyter , the members of the Committee on Fisheries and the fishermen are left out of business .
national rules must define the procedure for prior examination , including the appointment of a competent authority to which a regional or local authority would propose participation in the EGGC .
( NL ) Mr President , as has already been said several times , the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation is a very useful instrument , particularly for border regions .
the second element , Mr President , is even more significant from our point of view .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , we are looking at the progress that the European Union has made towards becoming a free , secure and fair region .
of course , as we well know , terrorists use the Internet , but it is also used by millions of innocent citizens when communicating .
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Portuguese Presidency for extending the Schengen area and , at the same time , to propose a regular evaluation of the functioning of this system .
I have presented examples to show how , in this spirit , Mr Deprez &apos;s proposal , which I think should be welcomed , is that it is necessary to sum up and define specifically what could be done immediately , because it is ready - and there are many things that we can complete during the Slovenian Presidency - and which we could discuss from now , for example , until June 2009 .
a compromise has already been reached on this issue and I agree to withdraw the amendment .
I understand the amendments to this report in relation to cooperation between the various special units , but we must not forget that it is actually a revision of the Prüm Treaty .
therefore , I do not like the fact that this resolution , which is a written document , but only of a general nature , provides only one specific example : this in the form of the Czech Republic , and specifically the Lrosommont concentration camp .
this is demonstrated by the first available data on the priority of projects involving new Member States .
I therefore voted in favour of Amendment 10 , which rejects the Council &apos;s common position .
in writing . - ( PT ) In general , this resolution barely deals with general ideas and is inadequate in many areas .
I welcome the action taken by some retailers to stop selling such heat in response to pressure from consumers and I would not buy any of them myself .
the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has already launched its action plan , the first stage of which was to draw up a resolution with the honourable experts of other parties .
it is true , of course , that it would be easier to read the consolidated agreement , which would show how the treaties are going to look when this Treaty has been ratified - I say &apos; if &apos; it has been ratified , because I am sure it will be ratified anyway - and on which citizens would think it is much easier to read .
their illegal smuggling in India is the cause of future cannabis .
what we need is solidarity with these children and their countries , and not a size @-@ fits @-@ all that humiliates their dignity .
it will be independent if its authorities have full powers .
this is urgent and necessary , and we demand that it be done .
( PL ) Mr President , clarity and transparency are fundamental principles in society &apos;s life .
finally , despite the slight improvement in the reimbursement of subsidies , repayment remains a problem that causes enormous damage to the Community budget .
Mr President , the Commissioner said the same : the report does indeed coincide with the discharge procedure .
that is why we are now engaged in this debate as part of the discharge procedure .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , in my opinion , the Community Customs Code proposed by the Commission and discussed by the European Parliament and the Council has carried out exemplary procedures .
over the last three years , we have devoted time and resources to better understanding of this phenomenon , its trends , its manifestations and dynamism .
the European Union and Commissioner Frattini have made the fight against terrorism their top priority .
the fact that the perpetrators of these horrific acts of violence , which we have witnessed in recent years , were born or grew up in Europe , is a cross @-@ cutting alarm bell , forcing us to look at our own society with a more acute eye .
the next item is the report by Mr Guardans Cambó , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on an EU strategy for market access for European companies .
if we are able to give European industry better access to international markets , we will encourage companies to grow , invest in know @-@ how and technology and create more jobs .
the quality of trade should be improved and market access should be given priority .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( SV ) Thank you , Mr Mandelson .
you have one of the most difficult portfolios to deal with .
I would therefore like to ask you : was the Commission &apos;s intention not to launch new cases in Portugal , but in other countries , not to launch any anti @-@ dumping or anti @-@ subsidy investigations , to wait for the decisions of this review process or was it intent to put the cases that it had already begun to investigate ?
this decision has therefore asked the Commission to carry out an investigation into market performance mechanisms and a comprehensive overall assessment of consumer safety labelling .
I would also like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen for their tireless support and advice in shaping the final agreement between the European Parliament and the Council .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . - ( DE ) Madam President , if I may , I would add my previous congratulations to the rapporteurs .
the second condition we have made good progress towards is that , after all , we should have a pan @-@ European safety mark that is at least equal , if not superior , to these national marks .
the level of trade experience in this Parliament is pathetic .
the various measures proposed aim to encourage people to buy and buy products in Europe .
I think this is particularly important now that we also need to revise the toy Safety Directive , bearing in mind the problems in the toy market , which has recently been the focus of attention .
I welcome the substantial cooperation that everyone has worked with us to resolve what some find difficult tasks , relatively effectively and quickly .
your apologies have been accepted and taken into account .
in writing . - I welcome the report on the exposure of workers to risks arising from physical agents .
it is also necessary to assess the extent to which the excessive complexity and inadequacy of the rules and delays in the allocation of funds contribute to the offences identified .
in writing . - ( PT ) This own @-@ initiative report by the European Parliament is even sliding from objectives and initiatives to liberalise world trade - be it goods , services or capital - headed by the EU and the European Commission , a almost all @-@ powerful body in the common commercial policy , under the new draft treaty , which grants this area exclusive competence of the EU .
we must dispel the myth that economic growth is an enemy of the environment .
international terrorism is one of the greatest global threats in our open societies .
in the Middle East , Europe must offer political and financial support to the difficult peace negotiations process between Israelis and Palestinians .
although the Internet and the inability to introduce regulations from the very beginning mean that the level of freedom in our society has increased positively , they have done everything that is vulnerable to uncontrolled terrorist threats , which also threaten more and more democracy and freedom for all .
( SV ) Prime Minister , the fact that Sweden won a new government in the autumn of 2006 failed to notice when it comes to its commitment to the European Union .
despite the wishes of many Eurosceptics , Europe has even reached an agreement on the new Reform Treaty .
how is it possible that Sweden is moving in completely the opposite direction ?
I believe that many of us here have represented their voters well , and I am also prepared to do so on a number of occasions .
the Commission did a good job in preparing the Lisbon package published in December .
in making this proposal , the Commission &apos;s dogmatism or stubbornness did not exhort .
while some high overheads open their golden layers , workers and the public are paying for this mess .
this will only be possible if all those who can contribute do so , and if we work to ensure a good living environment .
we say that workers must be flexible .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the desire for a knowledge @-@ based economy is good , but not sufficient .
growth is currently slowing down and inflation is rising .
you say this because , compared to the situation in the American economy , our economy is , in essence , much stronger .
but I call on the Commission and the Council to go beyond the details of this document and to look at it as a whole .
it was constantly stated that knowledge is not an area to which the Member States should transfer responsibility , that is their own Holy territory .
if we decide together to try and change these priorities , that would be a very good thing .
subject : EASA Airworthiness assessment activities
Member of the Commission . - ( RO ) The Commission communication adopted in 2005 entitled &apos; European Language competence indicator &apos; proposed a comprehensive strategic approach to the exercise of the European Day of Languages investigation as a means of preparing a European indicator in this field through the collection of the necessary data and improving knowledge of foreign languages .
does the Commission believe this unfair discrimination in small but lucrative projects ?
the problem is not falling , but rising , so I think that these programmes should continue .
however , it is highly unlikely that this region will be able to achieve these objectives and it is clear that one of the major problems facing the countries in this region will continue to be poverty , except for those countries that have oil .
it is clear that there is still a great deal to be done before Uzbekistan can be regarded as the right democracy .
the EU must recognise its commitment to ensuring energy supply .
eradicating poverty is very important , and this is one of the most important aspects that we focus on in our national strategies .
what are these fundamental elements , then ?
this is particularly important if we bear in mind the lessons learned from the European Constitution .
I know that the United Kingdom is a ridiculously closed place , and it is true that even the country &apos;s government is too afraid to oppose nationalism and xenophobia , and has called for self @-@ defeating the main areas of European unity , sometimes leading Britain to the last limit .
this opportunity , and this paragraph , opens up new opportunities for Europe to implement the rhetoric usually associated with these issues .
I do not believe that what we have before us today would help us greatly in the face of this great challenge .
this is a real , excellent difference compared to what has been happening so far in the history of Europe , and all this has been achieved only on the basis of equality between states and groups of people .
( PL ) Mr President , after two years of debate on a very controversial agreement , which was rejected by France and the Netherlands , we have managed to reach a compromise and agree to a text that should save the peoples of Europe .
by enshrining the Union &apos;s legal personality and abolishing the pillars , the Treaty of Lisbon gives Europe a strong political dimension .
then there is a expectation that it will give the European Union a better position to deal successfully with its task in the world , a position that the Union will be able to cope with the consequences of globalisation and so on and so forth .
( NL ) Mr President , apart from social and economic cohesion , this Treaty sets out the third objective , territorial cohesion , namely for the Union as a whole .
rapporteur . - Mr President , this debate has shown that in this Parliament , the Treaty is approved by a very large majority by elected representatives of the peoples of the 27 countries .
the same applies to Amendment 13 by the PSE Group , and I would ask the groups to vote to avoid duplication of the text , as I have already said .
this will ensure even greater simplicity than is currently the case , and this is probably the last thing we need .
in the final vote on the Corbett and Méndez de Vigo report on the Treaty of Lisbon , I abstained .
moreover , we have voted on a document that we are not yet familiar with , since there is still no consolidated , printed text in the languages of the Member States .
pressure is now also being exerted to strengthen the external component of the Lisbon Strategy , namely , to impose economic and political conditions on third countries , many of which are less developed , in the interests of a multi @-@ ethnic Europe , demanding the opening up of these markets .
we have chosen to vote against this report because it deals with areas where political responsibility lies with the Member States .
finally , Central Asia will not benefit from effective integration into the global economic system until all five countries in the region have joined the WTO ( the Kyrgyz Republic is a member since 1998 ) .
having followed a number of infringement proceedings by the Commission , I can assure the Commission that , if it intervenes , citizens and even authorities will feel more confident about the Commission &apos;s activities in this area .
Mr Smith mentioned that the law must be straightforward and applicable , in particular environmental legislation .
of course , it is also necessary for the Kosovan authorities to implement the Ahtisaari proposals to actually invest in a multi @-@ ethnic state and to establish adequate guarantees for the Serbs living in Kosovo .
thirdly , Mr President , the European Union either makes it clear once and for all that the Union is our weakness and our fragmentation , or that we must give up our international leadership in a globalised world and limit ourselves , as the magazine The Economist described us : the most prosperous third world region in the 21st century .
I am glad that Kosovo is now independent , because , having been the victim of genocide for decades , which was only suspended thanks to international aid , the Kosovars are , after decades of oppression , at last , their free democratic state .
the EU has a vital role to play in building a society in which all citizens are equal and where minority communities have extensive rights to preserve and develop their identity , as is the right to state administration : that is , extensive autonomy for the Serbian community .
regional tensions are now threatening to grow , unemployment and corruption are frustrating the population and criminality are obstructive .
at the same time , respect for human rights obligations is an important step towards greater responsibility for the candidate countries and , as I have said before , this is an important step .
the monks and civilians who fled Burma in September gave CSW immediate descriptions to the authorities of brutal behaviour towards the pro @-@ democratic movement .
these are two factors in women &apos;s independence .
however , guaranteeing children &apos;s rights is the starting point for future generations to feel responsible for a world outside the family .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , this is a report on preparing for demographic change .
it symbolises a living death .
the majority represents projects that do not really provide much benefit .
as we know , new and impressive challenges are emerging , and cohesion policy must make a major valuable contribution to their consideration in order to allow us to move towards the Europe we want to see : an effective , solidarity @-@ conscious Europe .
territorial cohesion still lacks even a clear definition .
as this is probably not the case , a different approach would be better where the Member States have a greater role to play .
so these subsidies - because they are - are still taken away from the countries of Western Europe that receive subsidies and from the increasingly declining boy , while we are still faced with heated economic winds from the United States .
I welcome the complex approach advocated by the rapporteur , as well as the challenges of rural development .
I repeat that the European Parliament reaffirms its very clear position on the importance and role of cohesion policy , which brings Europe closer to its citizens .
I can assure you that the Commission will continue to seek appropriate indicators , both in terms of GDP and employment , and will present a new aggregate indicator of cohesion in the fifth report .
4. calls on Israel to end its military action , which lives or puts at risk civilians , as well as killings with an extra @-@ judicial target ;
however , it is precisely the citizens whose reports are unstoppable sources of information and subdivision us into violations or non @-@ application of Community law , rather than lobbyists acting in their own interests .
what is happening in Gaza is a humanitarian crisis .
women are expected to be willing to bring more children to the surface , while complying with labour obligations , and in the long term .
the support is already available , but it must be increased .
real negotiations between the Belarusian authorities and the European Union should therefore be opened quickly .
no , all parties , including government soldiers , have systematically committed crimes against humanity .
the PPE @-@ DE Group proposed that the second item on Afghanistan be replaced by a new item entitled &apos; the arrest of demonstrators following the Russian presidential elections &apos; .
at the donors &apos; conference in Paris last December , where the European Parliament was also present , the European Union pledged EUR 540 million for 2008 to support the peace process launched in Annapolis .
we should not be accused ; we can all talk about the events that took place in Gaza over the last few months , in which the cynical involvement of the Israeli authorities was cut off water , electricity and food supplies , trying to starve people in a sense of the word .
Poland , Ireland , Lithuania , the Republic of Tsehh and the USA have come to the plant .
finally , I would like to say that we will continue the negotiations with the United States .
why , however , are we discussing this issue today in this House ?
( SV ) Mr President , the consumer is unprotected on the Internet .
ladies and gentlemen , this has been a long process .
( PL ) Madam President , air transport needs clearly defined legal rules , but they must be as flexible as possible and , at the same time , sufficiently harmonised , particularly as regards aviation security .
rapporteur . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the report on a sustainable European transport policy is at the stage of the plenary debate .
however , it is incompatible with a package that argues for sustainable transport and opposes the most environmentally damaging modes of transport .
our carriers must not be punished for the fact that infrastructure is less developed and therefore more congested .
it is possible that global warming will result in more extreme phenomena than flooding .
in Romania , there have been major floods in recent years , the latest of which took place quite recently .
I declare the session of the European Parliament for 2007 @-@ 2008 closed .
for us as Social Democrats , however , the social element is central .
how can we use financial instruments to turn Europe into soft power , which cannot be ignored , which is a democratic model and not just a monetary one ?
( applause )
we must invest in quality education and basic research in the future , but innovation , as we all know , is a weak place for Europe .
once again , thank you very much .
( sustained applause )
on the contrary , the rise in authoritarian capitalism as an alternative to a democratic market economy is probably the latest ideological , intellectual and moral demand that we are witnessing .
( FI ) Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Paasilinna , for his excellent work .
in writing . - ( PL ) I agree with the proposal to replace certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with Community agreements .
in addition to scientists at European level and groups of scientists from Member States , this is also interesting for practical people , mainly business actors .
the drafting of the article &apos; extraordinary crisis &apos; must also be applauded : we can never be too well prepared for such undesirable events .
finally , intermodal systems with trailers and eufooria of privatisation should not be allowed to reduce public transport by unpleasant layers .
in our opinion , the application of Article 69 is insufficient , as it is not clearly defined for practical measures , particularly in the sector that has already been mentioned .
we are talking here about a soft landing , which , for me , means that milk producers are being snatched down .
let me say quickly that &apos; I will not win her hands with the heart of my house &apos; , and I believe that here we need to be much bolder .
the monitoring and adaptation of market support instruments to the current situation must not , under any circumstances , leave aside the specific situation of farming in mountain areas .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) Mr President , I , too , would like to welcome the President of the Council and the Commissioner .
( the President cut off the speaker )
we also need a course , a clear strategic direction that we most need at the moment .
( PL ) Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague Mr Goepel on producing an excellent report and thanking him for the tremendous work he has done on this .
at the end of this week , this problem will be addressed by the European Council , and I hope that the Council will accept the progress made .
I think it is natural that there are two different roles on comitology at Level 3 .
Fifthly , I would also like to remind the Member and Parliament that in October 2006 , we adopted an EU strategy for external economic activity , a European global programme , which provides for a new European trade policy to enhance its external competitiveness , along with strategies relating to market access , the protection of intellectual property rights , open public procurement abroad , trade defence instruments - not only multilateral agreements within the framework of the World Trade Organisation , but also the new generation of bilateral trade agreements , which will complement efforts aimed at moving forward in the multilateral round of negotiations in Doha .
it must also comply with Community international obligations , including WTO rules .
in short , the results of last year &apos;s projects are not yet available .
they may apply to EU products originating from different Member States , not only those which have adopted national safeguard measures against GMOs .
that concludes Question Time .
these are the reasons why infrastructure and communication tools , as well as education , health care and a number of other services , are not sufficiently advanced and do not arise before the economy starts to develop .
I will finish my speech by saying that investment would succeed in converting rural areas into jobs @-@ creating industrial fleets .
the constantly deteriorating situation creates social tensions , because the social welfare system is the most inadequate in the most disadvantaged places , and there is also the most lacking in infrastructure .
I would like to take this opportunity to put a few questions to Commissioner Fischer Boel , who is here this evening : does the Commission have a strategy to reduce the growing amount of waste in the EU ?
to paraphrase former President Clinton : it is sun , rumaluke !
some active substances and bacteria contained in agricultural and municipal waste can pose a threat to public health and to the natural environment if they are spread .
it is rather astounding to note how poor quality national statistics - and consequently European statistics - are , in particular , in relation to the energy consumption of buildings and household and office equipment , as well as transport .
we all know how different sectors influence energy prices .
it is reasonable that we first collect statistical data only on biocides .
Madam President , I just wanted to emphasise one point on this and also on the previous report .
our negotiations today and our discussions with the President of the European Parliament at the European Council are undoubtedly two important factors for achieving this objective .
( applause )
economic growth is slowing down , as is the negative impact of crises in the banking sector in Sweden , Finland , Hungary or Spain , Argentina or Japan on GDP .
my website can be consulted on our proposal .
the Court of Justice does not leave any doubt about this .
( NL ) I am truly surprised that the situation in Turkey has not been put at the forefront of this week &apos;s action plan .
my last question relates to the stability of the financial market .
( DE ) Mr President , when you look at the draft Council decision , everyone can see the handling of an extremely weak internal energy market .
we have now before us the 10 Commission &apos;s objectives , which have been mentioned here in passing , but in fact we should focus on priorities .
( PT ) I would like to start by wishing the Slovenian Presidency well and saying that I am convinced that the next European Council should focus on economic and development issues .
it is a fact that it would be useful , because energy efficiency is and will remain an important part of the climate and energy package being discussed in the Council .
( applause from the right )
the next item is voting time .
Mr President , I voted in favour of the Goepel report , not because I support the common agricultural policy , but because I support its reform : in particular , its focus on farmers in mountainous countries .
exposure to pesticides can also increase the risk of a higher level of disease for children .
so far , these experiences have not been entirely positive .
in writing . - On behalf of British Labour MEPs , I wish to explain the reasons for our voting choice on this important report .
in writing . - As Mr Tabajdi &apos;s report on sustainable agriculture and biogas points out , biogas has an untapped potential which the EU has not yet exploited .
today , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary , Slovenia , Bulgaria , Romania and the reunification of Germany are the achievements we could only dream of , but it has become a reality in our lifetime .
however , the institutions are not an end in themselves .
five years after the fall of Saddam Hussein , we have the opportunity to embark on a new phase of a gradual process .
last October - and also in January with Mrs Gomes - I had the opportunity to address the Iraqi Parliament at the plenary session .
the European Union must actively support Iraq &apos;s institutional development , which is based on the country &apos;s current situation and respects the historical , religious , cultural and identity traditions of Iraqis and all ethnic and religious communities living on Iraqi territory .
at the same time , we have restored almost 200 hotspots and 10 hospitals .
however , we cannot be sure at this stage of our desire for improvement .
the debate is closed .
I wish to pay tribute to him on behalf of his co @-@ combatants in the presence of the highest national and European powers , particularly Javier Solana and my colleague Karl von Wogau , acting as High Representative .
however , we must also deal with the immediate situation at the moment , which is aimed at sending 3700 troops to protect refugees in the EU .
there is not the slightest link between the two questions .
it is based on a cross @-@ sectoral approach and on increasing the role of young people .
personally , I am happy to talk about a silver economy : if you look into the programme more closely , you see the problem of quality of life there , so what are the choices of Europe ?
new assistive technologies can help to solve the problems of vision , hearing , mobility and also other issues , enabling parents to continue to feel beneficial to society , and indeed to be so .
Mr Krasts asked me whether I would welcome the participation of other countries in the initiative .
( NL ) Mr President , I speak in plenary for the first time .
there is one proverb saying that &apos; let us give &apos; hungry fish , but &apos; blessing &apos; .
( PL ) Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner and the rapporteur for their excellent report , which I fully support .
women &apos;s detention conditions should be included in the annual report of the European Commission on human rights in the EU .
finally - and the European Parliament has carried out a study on this - we call , as a matter of urgency , for the protection of persons belonging to special risk groups to be improved , particularly the protection of women who are victims of sexual violence .
I hope , as the Commissioner said , that the new Lisbon Treaty will give us more opportunities to act .
I am therefore very pleased to welcome Mrs Budreikaitė &apos;s report , the first report in the history of the European Parliament , which seeks to analyse the contribution of the new Member States to EU development policy and the challenge that it poses for them .
I agree that everything relating to values , human rights , respect for human rights and the fight against corruption is undoubtedly important , but in some cases , linking development aid - and making it dependent - can undoubtedly be so difficult and even counterproductive to strictly respect such precious values for us .
secondly , we are financing specific measures to promote equality between men and women .
budget support and other EU programmes do not compensate for the damage caused by a predatory economy .
although this is known from experience and numerous reports , it is forgotten time and again , including when deciding on the use of EU development cooperation funds .
HIV is on the increase among women , as are sexual violence against women .
high oil prices on national markets and the harmonisation of excise duties in all 27 EU countries will put a brake on economic growth in countries with lower GNI .
&apos;former Eastern European countries &apos; undoubtedly had a long tradition of &apos; cooperation &apos; with Africa and it is possible that relations had been maintained , albeit in completely different ways .
our own country &apos;s experience and ties with the Iraqi people warned us of the humanitarian , military and moral disaster that entails intervention .
given that the punishment of offenders is not a competence of the EU , we have chosen to vote against the report .
we have a duty today , in all our contacts with the parties involved in the Armenian conflict , to raise awareness of this fear .
the demonstrations following the introduction of the mother @-@ Petrosian house arrest and their brutal repression on 1 March ended in the death of eight people , many other injuries and state of emergency .
in Južno @-@ Sahhalinskis , the artist Yužno @-@ Sahhalinski , attacked the journalist &apos; Tvoja Gazeta &apos; .
in spite of this , the 23 @-@ year @-@ old journalist Perwiz Kambakhsh has been sentenced to death and is being denied its legal benefits .
- Before the vote :
Seventeen years later , when the European Council calls for the adoption of a political agreement in June this year , we are approaching the target .
the third area on which we are putting forward proposals quickly is the Union for the Mediterranean .
green taxes , such as reduced VAT rates , can have the same effect through the stimulation of low @-@ energy vehicles and household appliances .
unfortunately , we do not have , and this is disadvantageous to our competitiveness .
we welcome this .
the European Environment Agency has recently calculated that it would be possible to reduce emissions if waste management had been more closely linked to policies to reduce the effects of climate change .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President of Parliament , I agree with Mr Karas on one point , namely that it is not about how often the word &apos; social &apos; is mentioned , but about the spirit of the text .
that is why the directive we are proposing should provide full legal certainty for energy @-@ intensive industrial companies , because they already know that they are subject either to this directive or to an equal international agreement .
over the last six years , the Romanian capital has started the insulation of two such houses .
the Presidency considers that boycotting the Olympic Games or other sporting events during the Year of Intercultural Dialogue would not be an appropriate response to the outstanding policy issues .
the Olympic fire in Athens - just as a year ago in his speech in the square of Taecopen - did not make any reference again to this situation .
the sportspeople can and must decide for themselves .
I could see how preparations for the Olympic Games are developing , how they become part of the life of every Chinese citizen .
despite all the difficulties , this initiative has received broad support and is currently the only way to find a solution .
let me conclude on an optimistic note .
the European Union must abide by this obligation , and we clearly set it out in the report .
as regards the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , I largely support the evaluation of the reform process in Mr Meijer &apos;s report .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( EL ) Mr President , the follow @-@ up to the NATO Summit in Bucharest has reached this Parliament .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate Hannes Swoboda and Mr Meijer on their 2007 progress reports , according to Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
we call on Members of the European Parliament not to adopt wordings that prevent the ongoing process of negotiation entering the most crucial phase .
I now want to encourage the country to implement its plans and thus pave the way for a positive Commission recommendation in the coming autumn .
the impetus is also needed in the public sector reform process at local and regional level .
we are all familiar with the demonstration in Ljubljana .
trade defence instruments must be more accessible , more efficient and more transparent .
this very successful summit , where I had the honour of addressing the audience , was the first occasion in which our Health Commissioner took part .
the highest percentages of people dying of lung , obese and breast cancer have been recorded in the new Member States , i.e. in the poorest countries .
I assure you that the Commission will examine these conclusions very carefully when it analyses the areas in which there are shortcomings in politics and uses these conclusions to set new priorities for the coming years .
in other words , we share the same view of the necessary future actions , but , as Mrs Hassi said here , regardless of whether the instruments proposed are appropriate to guide the European Union on the path to sustainable development , we certainly need to have frank discussions together .
I think that , mainly thanks to Mr Rübig , Parliament has managed to find a compromise acceptable to both the Commission and the Council , which should result in the adoption of this proposal at first reading .
from now on , small and medium @-@ sized enterprises ( SMEs ) will be able to benefit from European financial support and operate alongside other SMEs within the framework of the European Network .
( RO ) As we start with the European Union &apos;s closest political priorities , I would like to highlight some of the budgetary aspects of this report .
for the first time , the European Union was able to explicitly recognise the conclusions of last year &apos;s summit in a study that we presented some time ago , and also now in the European Union &apos;s cultural agenda in the era of globalisation .
culture is a significant part of the development of our civilisation .
for many people , work is not just a passion , but a livelihood .
firstly , the regulation should not apply to overseas territories of EU Member States .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) I would like to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on her hard work in order to achieve the maximum possible consensus on this report .
the new powers of the European Parliament , such as the impact of the agriculture budget or legislative policies , mean adapting some priorities to deal with new commitments .
Parliament , which was elected by EU citizens in direct universal suffrage , must be able to do more and control the targeted use of Community funds , in this case by the authorities .
however , the environment has reached a dangerous situation , as can be seen from natural disasters , and the credit crunch has arrived .
the mandate of the Committee on Climate Change is extremely clear : it must analyse the current situation , draw up a list of options for combating climate change and formulate concrete proposals concerning the European Union &apos;s policy in this field , at all levels of decision making .
I also support the request for the Council to reduce the absorption thresholds for the EU Solidarity Fund and for the Commission to carry out a study into the economic characteristics of adaptation and to develop scenarios establishing a balance of adjustment costs and revenue .
we are convinced , not only that a rapid and courageous transition to more modern and more efficient technologies will bring benefits to our climate and provide a basis for a global solution , but will also be favourable for the economy , as it makes us much less dependent on fossil fuels imports .
therefore , in order to achieve greater energy efficiency , we will review the Structural Funds Regulation once again .
I would like to speak for longer because this is a very important issue and many questions have been asked , but I would like to thank you once again for your contributions .
13 .
Mr President , as you can see , I have another five seconds to wish to &apos; buy on appetito &apos; ( &apos; good content &apos; ) to all my colleagues who have been so kind and have stayed here to listen to my statement .
in writing . - I voted in favour of Obeliý &apos;s report in order to ensure that decisions on the movement of pet animals are taken only after full account of scientific assessments .
furthermore , on 9 October 2007 Portugal submitted a request for mobilisation of 1 546 redundancies in the automotive sector , in particular for workers made redundant in Opel Aambuja , Alcoa Fujikura Sexalis and Johnson controls in Portalegres .
the Commission proposal clarifies the responsibilities of the Commission and the Member States and clarifies reporting requirements for fishing activities .
the issue is , of course , important in itself , but it falls outside the remit of the European Parliament .
it will also promote the development of information and communication technologies .
this could further jeopardise Europe &apos;s biodiversity and may disturb social progress by requiring a genuine cross @-@ sectoral approach and the inclusion of social , economic and environmental aspects in a broader sense .
I would like to point out three major results of the summit : Croatia and Albania have received an invitation to join NATO ; NATO is installing an additional missile shield alongside America - it protects those countries that are not protected by America ; NATO leaders committed to increasing the number of troops in Afghanistan to combat winter ; sharing the difficulties of military operations and reducing restrictions on the use of their troops .
Thirty @-@ two countries apply the death penalty , sometimes also non @-@ violent crimes such as adultery , tax avoidance , prostitution or homosexuality .
in 2006 , he criticised scientists who are engaged in research into stem cells .
we have heard nothing about these issues .
in writing . - ( FR ) The Treaty of Lisbon , which will enter into force on 1 January next year , will unduly enhance the prerogatives of Parliament .
I think the debate was striking .
I doubt that the EU will ever have a common approach to history .
we were consulted only at the last moment , in a hurry and non @-@ binding way , when the document started to enter the Community into the acquis .
I would ask you , Commissioner , to help us explain to the Council that this situation is unacceptable , especially if we consider that most measures to combat terrorism and to promote police cooperation have included the collection and exchange of personal data .
the Commissioner pointed out that this is , to some extent , the case .
( PL ) Mr President , young people in Belarus , with unsuitable views for the authorities , are often punished by denial of the right to education .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , Commissioner , organ transplants really save lives every day in Europe .
I know that the subject of this debate is not a health programme 2008 @-@ 2013 , but I must stress the following aspect : in relation to the projects , I was surprised by the mathematical difference between approved projects and completed projects : in 2004 72 projects were approved and nine completed ; 61 projects were approved in 2005 and 7 completed ; 87 projects were approved in 2006 and not completed ; and six projects were approved in 2007 and none completed .
these two aspects underline the central role played by doctors and surgery .
we need to mobilise , coordinate them and raise awareness among people around us and set a good example : we need to do ourselves organ donors .
Member States will also be able to support volunteering by creating sustainable voluntary activities infrastructure to address issues such as basic funding , insurance protection and , if necessary , VAT exemption .
at European level , volunteering is a practical expression of European values such as solidarity , cohesion and social integration .
let me also assure you that I share your conclusions with my colleagues in the Commission .
for that to be the case , the EU needs its citizens to be regularised and , as Europe has expanded , it is becoming increasingly difficult .
I therefore congratulate Mrs Jäättmäki on the establishment of a suitable balance between the two requirements and on offering balanced solutions that strengthen the effectiveness of the Ombudsman &apos;s role as moral authority and improve the transparency of the Community institutions , the right of every European citizen to sound governance and good administration .
( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am taking the floor in this debate because the situation of the New Flame , which has carried out the wreck in Algeciras Bay and Gibraltar , still has to be resolved .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , I did not wish to take a stand on this issue .
it is clear that this situation is totally unacceptable .
with regard to development policy , we have repeatedly pointed out that there is no point in having two fully parallel systems , one EDF and the other for development aid .
I would like to say that it seems clear to me that the main conclusion of the Internal Audit Report is that there are serious shortcomings in the remuneration system for parliamentary assistants .
the BBC is confronted , at first sight , with violations of its Royal Charter , particularly due to non @-@ balanced and unobjective transmission of daily events .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to mention an important aspect relating to the discharge , namely the evaluation of operations through the samples .
we did not vote on it or said something wrong .
the Dührkop Dührkop report on strengthening cooperation between prosecution authorities in the fight against terrorism and cross @-@ border crime is a highly valued initiative which strengthens the measures taken for greater security of US citizens and was set up in 2005 under the Prüm Treaty .
I hope that Parliament &apos;s services will seek maximum transparency and publish as much of them as possible when it comes to the reports that are being prepared for Parliament .
I welcome these areas of action , namely increasing quality and security , improving organ availability and making transplant systems more efficient and accessible , as well as mechanisms for strengthening cooperation between Member States , as well as the adoption of Community legislation establishing quality and security requirements for organ donation , organ donation , testing , preservation , transport and transfer within the EU and the means necessary to meet these requirements .
I voted in favour of Mrs Harkin &apos;s own @-@ initiative report on the role of volunteering in supporting economic and social cohesion .
reducing tax revenues and subsidies for renders , pensioners , farmers and people working at all are aimed at financing monopolies .
we should be pleased with the personal assurances made by the EESC Secretary General on the effectiveness and regularity of ex @-@ post checks .
it is also necessary to improve the internal audit procedures of the agencies and I welcome the possibility of having a common disciplinary board for agencies .
finally , it is necessary to examine why the increase in prices is so high that agricultural raw materials form a very small part of the total price of processed foods .
he is right .
food becomes more expensive , we have less and less domestic food , and imported goods are rising and their safety is dwindling .
it should also be borne in mind that the Commission is still attempting to impose so @-@ called &apos; economic partnership agreements &apos; on the poorest countries in the world , agreements that these countries do not want , because they are clear that the foundations of future crises lie behind these agreements .
( FI ) Mr President , I do not believe that the poor people of developing countries would do better if we allowed market forces to operate more freely on food markets , as has been proposed here .
that is more or less what I wanted to say on this subject .
the rapid adoption of the proposed text would be the first stage in the reform of the management of programmes .
let us conclude by reiterating once again : the public @-@ private partnership has not completely exhausted itself .
please say something about this .
Mr Jensen , thank you for being such an enthusiastic supporter of Galileo in the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
( DE ) Mr President , whether this is the right path or not , it is good that they were thrown out .
another very important issue , international adoption , is a very sensitive issue : under no circumstances can we accept the idea that international adoption is wrong in itself , because it gives many children a suitable family and a suitable home .
however , the Commission understands the need to achieve a balance between non @-@ discrimination and the principle of preferential treatment ; in certain circumstances , preferential treatment may be justified .
the Irish scheme foresees that the support can be given until 1 October 2009 .
perhaps my question is a little unfair , as it has a historical perspective .
however , it is also important that nothing here suggests that there are no obstacles to various trade union activities in the various Member States .
as Mr Monk said at the Laval case meeting , we need a protective protocol in the Treaty of Lisbon or we will face social dumping in the future .
if workers &apos; solidarity is destroyed , the European Union will also destroy the cohesion of our societies .
there can be no talk of dumping in a situation where posted workers - Poles in Germany or Latvians in Sweden - receive wages that are higher than they would receive in their own country .
in writing . - The way in which existing contracts are used to undermine workers &apos; rights is simply scandalous .
what is fundamentally different and confusing is the fact that the Chinese are reacting , the process of paying out these payments is much faster than ours , with all our bureaucracy , which has been the pound of almost four years for me .
the exclusion of countries that recognise Taiwan from support cooperation is another recognition that a strategy for parenthood is preferable to development policy .
we are doing it , but the Chinese are pulling us out .
we cannot stand aside as impartial observers if this new Chinese supremacy continues to develop .
of course Zimbabwe was on the agenda .
I will mention just two more before I finish .
EUR 23 billion for a five @-@ year period for 78 countries is not a sum that would be enough , so , according to the Paris Declaration in 2005 , bilateral agreements , plans and strategies must always be implemented , and I stress &apos; bilateral agreements &apos; .
we stress that poverty is very closely linked to these issues .
in my opinion , no one has any doubts about the importance of improving relations between the two most popular regions in the world , which are wrestling with a high level of development , between Europe and Latin America .
a large part of EU funds goes to projects that promote social cohesion and combat poverty .
unfortunately , several Member States have not been able to resist the temptation to make faster progress , forgetting that the common visa policy is undoubtedly a Community competence and that they are obliged to respect the principle of solidarity enshrined in the Treaty .
I believe that the Commissioner &apos;s explanations and statements are unsatisfactory : he was unable to answer the question of what would happen if , in the agreements that have already been signed by those countries , there are points that contradict the European position .
the PNR system will not be changed , it will remain unchanged , as it was adopted and approved , and it will not include fingerprinting by travel agents or elsewhere .
- Before the vote :
the Union must also find new methods of cooperation with the UN Security Council .
it is now up to us to decide where to base the Galileo Supervisory Authority &apos;s headquarters .
this case clearly shows the need to think quickly about European resources that can be used for public investment if the private sector appears to be favourable .
at various levels - workplaces , schools , streets , detention facilities - a number of different measures are needed .
I was therefore disappointed that the report , which otherwise would be good and important , calls into question something that , for me , is a fundamental issue - that something is done in exchange for aid - and that the possibility of carrying out peacekeeping operations within the framework of the European Investment Fund .
I therefore hope that the EU will draw up a coherent strategy to ensure that China respects principles such as good governance , the fight against corruption , the protection of human rights , employment and the environment , and to ensure clear , transparent agreements between the two countries .
it is a complete farce and it confirms even more the junta &apos;s iron regime in Burma .
in saying this , I do not want to underestimate the problems posed by illegal immigration throughout the European Union &apos;s external borders .
the lobby organisations believe that more and more people are dying since the establishment of Frontex , as they now need to travel further .
what is at stake , however , is the lives of many people , which are at risk in the seas and in the mountains , and the security of all of us .
if it is adopted at first reading , which the Slovenian Presidency hopes for and requested by the European Parliament , we will have a new instrument to deal with illegal immigration more effectively .
we should emphasise the importance of implementing programmes relating to forest biodiversity , reducing deforestation and the degradation of forest ecosystems .
more than 30 000 species are currently threatened with extinction .
Parliament has repeatedly voiced its concern about the loss of biodiversity , for example , through the resolution of 22 May 2007 , but one of the main obstacles to halting the loss of biodiversity is , unfortunately , the absence of effective action by both the Commission and the Council , both of which give the impression that they have serious concerns about this matter only in theory , but in reality they lack the will and determination to determine that the relevant directives are respected and that both international and EU obligations are met .
I have already said in my introduction that our main objective is to be present in Bonn and to seek action , to move towards reality and to continue the work that has been done , moving words from action .
then the bus started to travel to the place that we thought had to be passport checks or baggage checks .
I would like to stress that this action is of a completely preliminary nature .
my question is : do you think it would be possible to create new forums with China , such as education or research ?
( SL ) The answer to the first part of Mr Aylward &apos;s question is certainly yes .
the Falconer proposal to reduce customs duties is therefore unacceptable for European agriculture and would have unforeseeable consequences for the extraction of the poorest countries .
some of the most important issues were mentioned by Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson , namely access to the market , origin marking , national licensing , investment protection measures and the criteria for ensuring them in the Cooperation Council .
zero tolerance regime for genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and its economic consequences ( debate )
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and today &apos;s plenary for following my initiative to discuss this subject here today .
I would therefore like to emphasise that we are facing a complex problem of the shortage of animal feed and that the European Commission is responsible for resolving the situation .
the proposal for a zero @-@ tolerance regime is wrong and ineffective , which is the result of seeking a compromise solution for the interests of international economic operators .
however , otherwise , we are in favour and once again congratulations to Mrs Ferreira .
taxes and charges will help to accelerate the necessary reductions in emissions and the expected solutions to the full climate challenge .
we are pleased that the debate on taxation is not over and at this stage of the discussions I would just like to mention three points .
we should contribute to the European Financial reporting Advisory Group and I am ready to deal with it urgently , including exploring the possibility of using the Community budget to finance such a structure .
I think it would be better to leave it voluntary in order to ensure flexibility rather than to totally prevent it from being applied .
the idea is good in itself .
9 .
in the resolution , the European Parliament noted the consequences of the latest judgments of the European Court of Justice in Viking line , Laval and Rüffert cases and the need for further discussions in the European Parliament .
these standards have been developed by a private organisation ( International accounting Standards Committee Foundation ( IASCF ) and the International accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) financed by private sources ( mainly by companies working in the same sector ) and are not subject to public scrutiny .
I would like to address two people : the police chief , Augustine Chiyer , and the head of army , Constantine Chiwen .
however , it cannot be denied that some of the Iranian population approve of the killing of homosexuals , discrimination against women and the suppression of ethnic minorities .
if the human rights situation in Iran is not systematically improving , our relations with Iran cannot develop properly .
it is impossible to say how we should treat our African partners when they treat Chad in this way , but one thing is quite clear : we must persuade them in human rights .
that is what I would like to ask .
we draw attention to this because it clearly demonstrates what is involved in liberal market conditions .
it is also vital that the criteria are set according to universal standards .
I would like to stress that the European Union is very concerned about the recent events that have led to an increase in tensions between Georgia and the Russian Federation .
in the conflict in Abkhazia and Ossetia , the rights of the Russian minority are not a matter .
the recognition of Kosovo has opened a pandora boat and has given Russia moral justification .
everything is being done to unblock the situation .
as you can see , we are dealing with a very wide spectrum .
Commissioner Verheugen , I believe you have dealt with the most important points , but there is one thing you did not mention , and that is how difficult the negotiations were this time .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , the transatlantic dialogue will take place in a situation characterised by a three @-@ fold crisis : the global banking and financial crisis , the end of which is still unseen , the food price crisis and , last but not least , the current oil price crisis .
in writing . - In the light of today &apos;s debate , the major global challenges are warning .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , eight years ago , the Commission published a report that was provided for in the 1994 directive on European Works Councils , which recognised that its application now appears to be - and I quote - &apos; only a very low level of international consultation and information &apos; .
however , they are not prepared to carry out a nine @-@ month negotiating show so that employers simply walk away .
my opening remarks also take a little more time than the prescribed five minutes .
he did not do so .
this repression affects millions of people , but nothing has been done .
in my opinion , the election campaign has been going on there for a long time , and we still do not know who the Democrat presidential candidate is .
I also believe , for example , that the electoral process , including the pre @-@ election and post @-@ election phases , should be involved in political dialogue with the relevant third countries .
today , it is not only a question of not being able to stand up for his rights in court or back his mandate , but also of his life at risk .
the only sin of canzurov is that he has fought for more than a year with completely legitimate means for his right and for the right of his numerous countrymen to call himself a Bulgarian .
the interests of each country should have been equally important .
it will logically resurface six or twelve months after the inauguration of President Clinton , McCaini or Obama , when the US has finally appointed a new trade representative in order to continue the dialogue .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Mr President , let me begin by congratulating my colleague Mr Ford , on behalf of the rapporteur for this report .
the first is counterfeiting , particularly the counterfeiting of medicines , which is a real threat , a real threat to progress first and foremost , to a peaceful climate in economic and commercial relations with the countries of south @-@ eastern Asia , but also , in particular , to consumers , whether simply in terms of safety or product quality .
what will be achieved with national envelopes ?
therefore , in the case of Greece , we went from EUR 5370 000 hectares to EUR 594 per hectare of over EUR 750 per hectare , but if we were to practise more land than EUR 270 000 hectares , with a target of 370 000 hectares , which we are absolutely right , no one should or tell us , as before , that there is a limit or a fine .
it is also FAO doctrine , which , in preparing guidelines for the protection of vulnerable ecosystems , neglected to be used as a criterion for deep use , specifically because it considered it arbitrary , scientifically substantiated and arbitrary when anything else , because , as I said , it does not protect coral or water mountains in lower waters , and it would immediately rule out manual @-@ based fishing , which has been operating without problems for some time , such as artisanal fishing in the Azores or in the area regulated by the Northwest of NAFO .
paragraph 21 also talks about the requirement for disclosure of financial interests , which would be a completely new element .
Mr President , first of all , we congratulate Alexander Stubb on becoming Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs .
my view is that the creation of a common interinstitutional system for the compulsory registration of EU lobbyists , financial disclosure and the &apos; legislative footprint &apos; will contribute to the transparency of the rules of lobbying .
however , this register will also encourage greater transparency in relations with the public , as it will be fully accessible and inclusive of all organisations with full characteristics , including data on its staff , as well as relevant financial information .
I therefore welcome the amendments tabled by the various parliamentary groups on the same question and I hope that this morning , Parliament will be able to adopt them by voting in favour of them .
we also welcome the European Commission &apos;s willingness to support the training of young players .
the competence of purely sports arbitration courts is not in question , but it is unacceptable that certain sporting organisations restrict such rights .
we have heard a lot here today , but I would like to draw your attention to some specific aspects .
- Before the vote on paragraph 10 :
fortunately , I did not do so through my first mandate , in which case I would never have been able to lunch in Strasbourg .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report by my Italian colleague Monica Frassoni on the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the implementing procedure of the Council Decision establishing the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission and amended by Decision 2006 / 512 / EC of 17 July 2006 .
however , it must take place through the UN and its various bodies , which , contrary to the EU , are legitimate and have broad support in most countries .
as a result , we would say that it covers zero and self @-@ defeated attitudes , one example of which is the EU &apos;s self @-@ assessment as the &apos; leading figure &apos; in the field of international election observations .
these include Małopolska ( small @-@ Polish ) representation , which is my constituency in the Union .
using the transparency rules as a pretext , the report seeks direct intervention by foreign monopolies .
there is something else in this report that adds value .
transfers of appropriations : see Minutes
( el ) Mr President , I would like to say something about the very critical and deeply worrying situation in Lebanon .
we would have preferred the system approved by the Commission and the Committee on the Environment , which perfectly made it clear that , in addition to these infringements , a whole series of new offences are automatically punishable under criminal law .
to make myself very clear , I hope that the Bureau will take decisions both on the decisions of plenary and on the Bureau and on the previous discussions between us this week , whether today or Wednesday , really will adopt essential decisions on the assistants &apos; regime , status and other important issues .
he says here that this is an important issue and it must be resolved once and for all as a result of the report .
I am also pleased about the outcome of the consultation in committee , but I fear that the rapporteur has completely lost his vision of the interests of European industry in his initial draft , despite all the good comments he made on developing countries .
therefore , I will immediately continue to speak on behalf of the political groups .
Madam President , I am pleased that the Commissioner is here today , because I think she is a very honest person .
a total of EUR 18 million has been earmarked for this , but this amount is sufficient in the sea compared to the subsidies that the European Union pays annually to tobacco growers .
I am finishing here .
perhaps the best thing can be said is that the conflict has ended and PEACE funding has played a role in achieving this very positive result .
if this integrated approach is not developed , we cannot be effective in the outermost regions and do not make the best use of their assets .
on the last question , let me just assure you that the Commission will continue to promote a coordinated and integrated approach and seek synergy between the various Community policies affecting the outermost regions .
children , the elderly and the disabled should be taken into account .
however , we are concerned about the hasty approach to collective redress .
economic and employment growth is impressive .
six million young people leave school in the EU before it is completed , and 16 % of the total EU population are poor or threatened with poverty .
the report constantly adapts the current words &apos; flexicurity &apos; .
this is because they have been successful and because it has been shown that it would be better not to extend these guidelines to ensure good governance and a better balance at European and national level ( and this has been expressed by the majority of Member States ) .
there are lively political debates on the need for further legislation on non @-@ discrimination at EU level .
as one UK organisation said very aptly last week , discrimination will not be solved through yet another piece of legislation .
here we must and will fulfil our obligations .
it sets out the introduction of a gender dimension in drawing up European , national and local budgets as a vital instrument for reducing structural gaps and implementing the principle of equal pay for equal work .
one example of Finland concerned a woman who had no right to an unemployed helpless after she stopped taking care of his inner son .
the Baltic Sea environment must be cleaned and we would also like to see extensive economic development in the region in the direction of replacing coastal transport with road transport .
many speakers mentioned that we have not gone far enough with our proposals and that we could and should be even more ambitious .
trade in raw materials and raw materials (
such manipulative political rhetoric and demagogy have nothing to do with reality and I protest against them .
cultural values and works of art are part of the heritage of citizens of Member States and are perfectly entitled to visit and admiration these values .
this is what this report is , and I welcome it .
he is constantly a member and he is looking for work , he is a high elephant , or even death , and he is going to leave behind the unconscious fortune in which the plutocracy representatives can sow .
above all , we must definitely ensure that these regions do not lose their agricultural self @-@ sufficiency capacity , which is also generally valid for the European Union as a whole .
it is commendable to increase the rights of disabled people and , in particular , to address restrictions on goods and services .
if that is the case , then we have not received any explanation exactly what it contains .
Mr President , I would like to repeat my colleagues as a reflection .
the proposed package will certainly contribute to this harmonisation as regards control of access to the occupation , but it would not ensure sufficient harmonisation in itself .
we must take into account not only the licensing , but also the repeal of this licence .
however , it is still too early to adopt a system throughout Europe that is currently operating reasonably between Holland , Belgium and Luxembourg .
( PL ) Mr President , in such a short speech , only the fundamental issues of the documents under discussion can be addressed .
since opinions differ here , I believe that we need an interim phase or a transitional period before the complete liberalisation of the cabotage sector .
( it ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , if I am not mistaken , there will be repeated accusations by the Spanish socialists against the sole right to decide on Italy and its internal security from those who are keeping a watchful eye on their coastline , those for whom the Ceuta and Melilla case are still fresh , those engaged in the separatism of Catalonia and the Basque Country , placing political controversy and terrorism on an equal footing .
the violence caused by the war on debt is not typical of our people , not to mention the people of Campania or Naples .
each Member State must stick to this and make appropriate efforts to comply with this obligation .
its aim is to promote the use of biofuels produced sustainably , while at the same time relieving fuels with poor performance .
we will therefore continue our efforts to ensure that all the necessary resources are available for this ; I therefore consider your question to be completely justified , which I think is a very serious issue .
the recorded price increases at consumer level reflect recent changes in the value of products , spending and the benefits of the entire food chain .
subject : progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( FYROM ) towards accession to the European Union
my thanks also go to the excellent colleague , Mrs Niebler , who has been the chairman of the committee responsible - the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy - for excellent work .
this is directly linked to the target agreed by Member States in 2005 : women have to fill 25 % of the highest positions in public research organisations .
the fact that the scientific community is predominantly made up of men today is , in itself , the result rather than the reason for this , of giving the scientific idea a mastery .
despite women &apos;s commitment to science , they should not give up the natural task of creating a family and motherhood .
Mr President , let me begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups .
instead , I can be glad that voluntary measures by industry are now enshrined in the legislation so that they are actually implemented and that the ban on exports extends to all compounds , such as cinema , oxide and fish .
this damages the nervous system and immune system and has a particularly adverse impact on young children and children .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I am pleased that the Commission is tabling proposals and that the EU is finally dealing with this issue , as we have been aware of it for a long time .
I am pleased that the Commissioner is thinking in the same direction .
we must take advantage of the EU &apos;s first initiative and remember the Copenhagen conference , which will take place in December 2009 .
if we also have the same willingness in the Council , and if all three European institutions work together , we can achieve what Mr Daul said before the European elections : namely to give the public a signal that the Heads of State or Government will agree on general political principles and that the European Parliament will do a detailed job .
I believe that this should also be addressed from a broader perspective ; to some extent , an example of creating an intelligent relationship , if I may be so bold , science @-@ based awareness and political decision @-@ making , in order to deal with the exceptional complexity of the problems facing the world .
many thanks to the rapporteur for an excellent report , and I expect that our cooperation will continue in the same way next year .
technological support and prospects are needed , technology transfer must be funded and the administrative capacity of these countries improved so that these reductions are measurable , registered and verifiable .
since the 2007 summit , when it was decided to set the target of a 20 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the deployment of renewable energy sources by 2020 , global warming has become a priority for every country in the world .
last but not least , it is important that it is properly implemented in order to guarantee everyone &apos;s freedom of expression in Turkey .
we wrote all these questions last year .
however , the question is how honest the European Union is before itself on these issues .
it is precisely because we are in favour of accession that we must not be at any shadow of events concerning our common democratic values .
in this process , the country is facing difficult choices , which include values such as secularism , democracy and human rights .
so I ask the Legal Service of Parliament to look into this issue .
Mr Březina , the reply to me - and I received an e @-@ mail specifically on this amendment - was the same as with all these specific amendments .
we do not create new Community legislation to apply sanctions .
Member States must take a firm stance in the area of environmental protection and ensure that this directive is applied rigorously .
it even removes the minimum proposed restrictions and requires full liberalisation of the international and national haulage market .
in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , higher education has become more accessible , and an increasing number of women are receiving degrees of research .
women &apos;s career prospects are particularly affected by motherhood , which paradoxically penalises them by reducing the possibility of reaching top posts , of carrying out themselves and receiving fair remuneration , and does not provide them with adequate compensation for the social investment made by the birth and upbringing of children responsible for the future .
they confirm that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is guided by politics rather than science .
it condemns the violence perpetrated by the Kurdistan Labour Party and other terrorist groups , but only recommends that the Turkish army refrain from carrying out disproportionate military operations .
many people in temporary camps , as they call them , do not want to return to their home area for various reasons , while others want to return , but need special seeds , because the whole soil has been salt and they need stronger plants and also fertilisers .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FR ) Madam President , it seems to me that we should be a little more precise when we talk about this issue ; take the concept of neutrality , for example .
the humanitarian aid workers and organisations they are working for are required to provide the expertise needed to carry out large @-@ scale humanitarian operations which could bring aid to a large number of people in the short term .
the military junta is responsible , firstly , for not warning the population of the cyclone on time and , secondly , for refusing to allow humanitarian aid .
it is in contact with local authorities to bring European aid more quickly to those in need .
the second approach lies in the constant awareness that , in normal times , we must help the Chinese .
as the Union is apparently unable to compensate for the damage done in the past , it should at least send out a decisive , strong signal for the future , banning this type of weapon production , storage and placing on the market in the Member States of the Union .
however , please note that this question should be submitted to a particular Member State and not to the Council , which does not represent a Member State on this matter .
this year , following intensive consultations with all interested groups , the Commission will also publish a White Paper on adaptation , which will form the basis for further discussions on EU policy in this field .
the issue of high food prices is certainly a major problem , and that is why this high @-@ level forum has also organised a debate on this subject .
they also have a strong impact on industry , without which it is impossible to develop a low @-@ carbon society .
unfortunately , at European Union level , despite the Community research programmes and the funds allocated to them , there has been too little investment in applied research , and this is true particularly of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
here I stress , for example , regulation and sustainable development .
the next item is the oral question to the Commission by Guido Sacconi , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the draft REACH test methods Regulation ( B6 @-@ 0158 / 2008 ) .
I would be grateful to the Commissioner for his opinion on this problem , but otherwise we fully support this report and the efforts of the Commissioner .
this relates to transport and it is particularly relevant because we have to vote on Mrs De Lange &apos;s amendment tomorrow .
I am grateful to the European Parliament for its positive adoption of the Commission &apos;s proposal .
this has led to further proposals for the setting up of the management board of the fund until the proposal is chosen by one representative for each Member State , which is impracticable .
aid must be aid .
therefore , aid effectiveness is essential , as more effective aid also means more aid .
( PT ) I congratulate Mr Van Hecke on an important report .
this is a major problem .
although the report does not criticise the fact that development aid is often used as a means of mitigating the situation , as a fake party and as a condition for disturbling the market , or as a means of intervening with well known negative objectives and effects , such as the European Consensus on Development , European Partnership Agreements , which the EU intends to impose or financial speculation surrounding foods , which call into question the declared development aid targets - it is no surprise that the report highlights the inadequate results of &apos; development aid &apos; and its significant reduction in the EU : 0.38 % in 2007 compared with 0.41 % in 2006 , which is well below the UN &apos;s recommended GDP .
( applause from the PPE @-@ DE Group )
the increase in prices has been significant and demand for food is rising faster than supply .
in writing . - ( PT ) I supported the joint motion for a resolution on Burma because it is necessary to establish democracy and respect for human rights without delay in order to resolve the tragic situation in the country .
animal health is closely linked to human health as it involves the risk of direct or indirect transmission of certain diseases .
nor does peace apply to Darfur in the west , because Arab nomades and farmers have driven most of the black population out of neighbouring Chad .
this message is not only directed at the Sudanese Government ; it must also be understood by the various armed resistance @-@ movement organisations whose political foundation , whatever it may be , does not justify committing crimes .
the list is already in place , but the fact that Alexander Lukashenko cannot come to the European Union is not very convincing .
they also include the parliamentary elections scheduled for September , which must be in line with democratic principles .
those who have just spoken must condemn and renounce violence , but at the same time the Burundian Government must put an end to the practice of concealing criminals involved in security forces who torture people and take them illegally into prison , and also punish them accordingly .
the Barcelona Process has enabled us to address numerous regional strategic issues and , of course , political issues .
( FR ) Madam President , we welcome the relaunch of the process of multilateral relations between the European Union and the countries bordering the Mediterranean 13 years later .
therefore , Madam President , I believe that , in the current financial perspective and if we do not use these instruments , we will not be able to implement the ambitions that we , as the European Union , are trying to achieve .
the rules do not apply to domestic food products for private consumption , nor to producers producing small quantities of unprocessed products for local retailers , such as farming , hunting and fish .
in short , our group is not convinced that there is a need to make radical changes right now , without carrying out a thorough assessment .
certainly not .
we have not yet voted , but I hope you are right .
this example should be followed and we need a framework directive to achieve this .
this jeopardises the sustainability of resources and marine biodiversity and causes serious consequences for legitimate fishermen .
the damage caused by infringements of intellectual property rights amounted to EUR 62 million in Romania in 2007 , according to an analysis by the International intellectual property Union .
the Slovak Republic &apos;s nutrition Code refers to HACCP as an appropriate production activity .
the June List expresses its full support for parts of the resolution on the treatment and transportation of American prisoners through European countries .
farmers play a key role in ensuring rural sustainability and development , but they are not the only ones involved , so I cannot support Amendment 35 .
legislation is not always the answer ; each case must be investigated and treated carefully and the competitiveness and sustainability of each sector must be monitored thoroughly .
in Italy , our fellow EU citizens live in prisons for refugees , they are , of course , also of Roma origin .
I believe that this is a measure that at least puts us on this road in a better state of mind than what we have shown in the past in our wasted economy , wasted on society and wasteful policies .
as regards waste prevention , the main objective of the legislation , I am missing from the stabilisation targets for waste , but we adopted them at first reading .
the first relates to animal by @-@ products .
I believe that recycling of household waste by 50 % and 70 % of construction and demolition waste by 2020 is a very good objective that paves the way for environmentally friendly and climate @-@ friendly waste management throughout Europe .
it has already emerged that the current system of reviewing substances on the list and adding new substances is , at best , too slow .
as a whole , we support the compromise drawn up by the rapporteur , Mrs Laperrouze .
unfortunately , the Greek Government last year ( when the most devastating fires took place ) admitted to the Commission in a report that there was a lack of coordination between the agencies involved and no prevention plans .
this underlines the responsibility of customs authorities located in Member States at the EU &apos;s external borders .
more effective coordination depends on the rigorous implementation of the new and modern legislation , which is ( or was ) our gift for the anniversary of the Customs Union .
this group includes adolescents who cannot and fall out of school , as well as older people who , despite working decades , receive a small pension , which only covers essential expenditure .
therefore , opportunities for people who are socially excluded to obtain education and participate in lifelong learning remain an unattainable dream .
strengthening social integration , reducing poverty and combating social exclusion is a serious challenge for the EU , particularly in the context of demographic changes such as an ageing population and the influx of migrants .
as you know , Eurostat does not compile data , but manages the data sent by national statistical systems .
while one might think that vulnerability is a problem for the lower levels of society , for example , in poorer regions it affects the entire region and affects all the social groups living there .
consequently , we are also talking about deforestation .
if we really want to change the world , as has been said , we will have to take other measures .
if we do nothing about illegal immigration , we will make the lives of people who are at risk of unscrupulous exploitation by employers more difficult , and we will also make it more difficult to integrate legal immigrants .
three years of debate have shown that there is no room for manoeuvre any longer and it is clear that no further improvements will be made at second reading .
the question is what is laid down in this directive .
( el ) Mr President , I am very concerned that the Council of Ministers has been blocking progress for three years in the trade in provisions .
I believe in the mobilisation of Europe , and I call on those citizens who reject such legislation to do so .
do they have to witness a debate which shows that Europe is unable to reach an agreement on this issue ?
Member States have realised that this problem needs to be addressed at EU level .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , tomorrow we will have to vote on a text called compromise between Member States and the most conservative among us .
Mr Radwan is absolutely right .
ten years of single currency progress and achievements are also a reason for celebration .
measures to prevent euro counterfeiting (
as I believe that this issue is entirely a matter for the Slovak Government .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Díaz de Mera &apos;s report .
the basic principle was also the approach that I took in my amendment , and I thank Mrs Jackson for her support in various aspects throughout the process .
the Commission &apos;s proposal to repeal Regulation ( EEC ) No 2377 / 90 aims to solve the problems encountered in the application of the current legislation .
in writing . - I voted in favour of Mr Casa &apos;s report on the adoption of the euro in Slovakia .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
the Council reached broad agreement on all the important elements of the package at the Energy Council on 6 June .
this is what our group is asking for , no more and no less : that the existing rights be consolidated and communicated to consumers as a readable document .
that is what Parliament wants .
electricity cannot be stored ; the frequency and intensity of the network must be maintained according to market demands .
contrary to Mrs De Gucht , however , I do not believe that we need completely new laws - certainly not at European level .
I also welcome the steps we are taking to ensure ownership unbundling as a necessary measure to complete liberalisation of the energy market .
in recent years , we have seen a very rapid rise in energy prices and European citizens expect the European institutions to respond to citizens &apos; concerns .
this is how we need a structural change , and I think the proposals we have made will correspond to that .
the newly formed leaders &apos; Party is entering the political arena in my country extremely aggressively , reminding us of the movement of rights and freedoms in the meantime in terms of fear and brutality .
although the demand for agricultural products is influenced by the market for biofuels , all the analyses carried out by the Commission indicate that the causes of the overall increase in food prices are various .
is the European Commission considering measures to promote , strengthen and support organic farming , and , if so , could you explain to us what these measures could be and how we can support this very important area that we want to promote ?
we have set up regional advisory councils .
the work plan of the Frontex agency for 2008 includes a number of pilot projects and exercises in operational cooperation and research .
why should we import a method which has not yet been tested or verified ?
I think that asking this question already is the answer in itself .
since then , a large part of the legislation adopted under pressure from the European Parliament has been adopted with a view to reducing the risk posed to road users by motor vehicles &apos; transmission systems .
it is our duty , both Member States and the Union , to try to reduce these statistics and protect our citizens from such tragedies .
better protection for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users has not lost prestige in the last decade .
in order to make it easier for Parliament and the Council to review these loopholes , we decided on proposals to be grouped through a so @-@ called &apos; comprehensive &apos; approach .
tariff quotas must be seen as complementary to other measures taken under Article 299 ( 2 ) of the EC Treaty , in the sense of support for the economy of the Canary Islands , in particular a plan for compensating for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products originating in outermost regions , implemented by Council Regulation ( EC ) No 791 / 2007 of 21 May 2007 .
we must also look at biofuels policies and find ways to ensure their sustainability , both within the EU and in other countries .
in a context where demand for oil and gas continues to exceed supply , the objectives agreed last year offer a ready way to reduce Europe &apos;s vulnerability and alleviate the suffering of the economy in the context of future sudden price increases .
deregulation of the internal market until breaking the point is what Mr McCreevy wants to do , whatever it costs , without any accompanying social measures at EU level or in the Member States : this is what the citizens of Europe feel .
this is not the time for mutual accusations and pointing the finger .
to conclude , Mr Schulz said in his very powerful and generous speech that there is a crisis of confidence .
however , this time we must listen to the people of Ireland ; we must listen to the people .
it should respect the law and rules and declare immediately that the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has now died , is a completely worthless exercise .
I want to see a Europe of equal union with 27 countries , and that is why I support the Treaty of Lisbon .
they are much more concerned about petrol prices in tankers and other problems that arise on a daily basis .
it has now been rejected three times : once in France , in the Netherlands and now in Ireland , the rejection of the version of the slightly amended Treaty .
instead of standing up with reality , I fear that we are once again faced with the conspiracy of Brussels to bypass people .
it must prove to its citizens that it is a joint project of solidarity .
Ireland decided to ratify by referendum and Ireland &apos;s citizens rejected the Treaty .
this leads me to the second question : why is intercultural dialogue important ?
1 .
the left and the extreme left have raised their ugly silence against the directive .
in the region I represent , the Daventry electoral district , we have many unwelcome wind proposals .
with this report , the EU is taking a major step towards establishing a European migration policy that is very strict with regard to illegal immigrants .
this is the first time that the Union has managed to draw up common rules for returning illegally staying third @-@ country nationals .
the mass activation of workers and the resounding &apos; no &apos; votes in referendums show the growing dissatisfaction of the people with this policy and opens the way for it to be withdrawn .
the strategy is always the same .
the report supports the elimination of common customs duties on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands for the period 2007 @-@ 2013 .
the Commission plays an important role in helping Member States respond to this challenge .
if this crisis caused by speculation in food and oil prices should lead to something of it , it will be the end of the limited neoliberalism .
costs are rising , the local environment is damaged and people are not satisfied with many projects .
as a result , the margins of many segments are paperless , making this sector more vulnerable than others to the growth of high costs , as we have seen in the case of oil prices .
on the contrary , it has deteriorated .
Mr President , I welcome most of the Commissioner &apos;s package , but for me the key issue is the monitoring of results .
Joe Borg , European Commissioner for Fisheries , regards rapid aid as one of the options , but it also says that in the long term , the solution to the crisis in the sector lies in fleet restructuring , making it smaller and more energy efficient .
Mr Schröder first concluded an agreement with Russia on the construction of the North Stream gas pipeline and only then took the place on company boards .
however , there is a democratic deficit in Brussels .
I welcome the fact that President Medvedev has recently stressed the importance of human rights and the rule of law .
I could not agree more with that .
subject : common immigration policy and illegal employment
the political consequences of high food prices will also be addressed at the European Council meeting starting tomorrow .
Minister Janez Lenarčič has appeared before us for the last time as President of the Council .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , dangerous goods must be transported in the European Union just as much as normal goods , whether we like it or not .
Mr Markov and his colleagues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism have worked hard on this proposal to improve this outcome .
I am grateful for this and I believe that , in future , this House will continue its work on this matter .
this would allow them to make the right decision and to persuade all Members to support it .
for this reason , thorough analyses are required , the construction projects that have been properly designed and implemented , but also effective auditing , particularly in the case of regional and local road networks , and for this reason I believe that the Member States should transpose all the health principles and implement them responsibly , not only where they are legally obliged to do so , but where it is necessary .
secondly , other factors have contributed to the decline in this sector .
I hope that this report will go somewhat better .
towards a safer , cleaner and more efficient Europe @-@ wide mobility : first Intelligent car Report ( debate )
people are travelling with French , Italian or German cars , cars made in Spain or in Great Britain and elsewhere , of course we need supranational legislation to support the highest possible standards .
it is true that these systems are mainly aimed at motorways and TEN @-@ T traffic .
I support the rapporteur &apos;s vision that at present , the spread of intelligent car systems and equipment is very low compared to their potential .
1 .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this report because , like other sectors , I am concerned about the falling production of sheep meat from the EU , while imports are on the increase .
hence our vote against .
we are also fresh in our minds about the repeated suspension of gas supplies to our eastern neighbours .
the EU did not close its eyes to this .
the participants in the protests have disappeared unabhorrent .
successive years quickly turned the support of the rest of the world to the transitional government into insoluble armed internal conflict intervention .
we can finally release the hands of the Iranian democratic opposition , the National Council of resistance , in order to get rid of this inhumane dictatorship once and for all .
it was an interesting meeting , full of challenges and , in any case , the opportunity to take stock of the progress we have achieved together over the last six months .
they will not come back .
it is up to us , Parliament , the Council and not , Mr President , the Commission , to start searching for these reasons .
and then the Commission , which is increasingly the servant of every lobby group and not of the citizens , as the fresh Commissioner Kallon &apos;s communication on lobbying shows .
I would therefore like to address this message in particular to the incoming Council Presidency , France .
in particular , the claims that we have too little democracy prevent us from achieving more democracy because most of those who have been involved in the false campaign do not want Europe at all and put forward these dubious arguments to hide this fact .
as a new Member State , they have done an excellent job .
so what we have today , seventeen years later , is a great success for us .
let us be honest : if the European institutions themselves put into question the legislation they themselves have adopted , we really have to deal with the problem of support for citizens .
&quot; Europe &apos;s money brings it to Ireland .
( Parliament rejected the proposal in the roll @-@ call vote )
in view of this situation , the European Parliament must present a reminder explaining the basic standards currently in force in our continent , one of which is the Republic of Belarus .
( HU ) Let me break with the words of András Léderer , leader of the Hungarian liberal Party .
is it nice that the laws state that the 30 @-@ day limit should not be exceeded , but how will SMEs implement them ?
the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development also requires the development of measures to establish a restructuring fund for the dairy sector .
my fellow Member , Jutta Haug , faced an enormous challenge if she wanted to meet our expectations by half .
this is yet another case where those who consider themselves to be fighting for free trade give in to protectionist national temptations on account of their own interests .
finally , one question : will this new situation affect the decision that may be taken during a dispute settlement ?
these measures include &apos; identification and authorisation of persons , including minors , in nomadic camps &apos; .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is no doubt : it is obvious that , in fact , this Parliament is now being led by the extreme left of Italy .
tackling these problems is a challenge for the whole of Europe , and until now , no country has done its own .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , this morning I led to Cannes , where there was an informal JHA Council .
they also contribute to certain production processes .
it is a pity that we were unable to regulate directly GM labelling either .
the Commission also needs nine months to make a risk management decision .
2.5 % of our members can form a group .
all rules and normal procedures may have been breached , but this does not appear to be a matter of concern to Mr Corbett , who is supported by the Chairman of the Commission .
I remember Mr Leinen since he was still a worthy Democrat .
I would like to draw the attention of the eurosceptic Members to the fact that they should read a recommendation before such a statement .
given that we are in France , I think it was a French writer who said that all too much has no value .
the cross @-@ border nature of the project means that the Espoo Convention must be adhered to , while the Member States concerned must adhere strictly to the provisions of the EIA Directive prior to authorisation .
what could happen in relation to all these mines on the seabed ?
- ( DE ) Mr President , of course this is in the interests of the people of the EU , particularly the peoples around the Baltic Sea , so that there is no threat to the environment .
we must be honest enough to recognise this .
the European Union should address the environmental and geopolitical challenges of energy security through coordinated efforts by all Member States , not through bilateral agreements between some Member States and Russia .
corruption is widespread in government circles and is spreading from this source .
finally , will it be possible to support the Afghan institutions while paying attention to these serious constraints .
following protracted negotiations in the Commission , I support the final version of our motion for a resolution , which contains a number of key issues , including the systematic training of Afghan security forces , greater focus on civil society building and better coordination between international organisations .
we also took account of airlines in the new Member States , where the mobility rate is low but is increasing rapidly .
I am thinking , for example , of the Dubai Emirates .
nevertheless , I regret the Commission &apos;s insensitivity to the situation in our regions and I have to say that , even though we have achieved a positive compromise that actually takes at least a few steps in the right direction , we feel that this issue has by no means been exhausted .
I do not know whether this was also the speaker in the group , but in any case , everything was completely public and honest for us , even on a group level .
you will understand that I do not see it , because I am sitting with a wall .
- ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I oppose , for all sorts of reasons , the general position that aviation should be included in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading .
lobbyists , construction companies and Russian politicians .
shipyards are the best .
in writing . - It is natural to correctly label food additives and waive some use to protect health , particularly children &apos;s health .
the compromise before us is far from ideal , but it is a success , so we Greens can also support the agreement we have reached .
I cannot accept the amendment that puts the demand for gas first and abandon EU environmental legislation and citizens &apos; concerns .
of course , support must be given to the farming population , but the cultivation of opium cannot be a long @-@ term alternative to the economic rise in Afghanistan , democracy and political stability .
we agree that the volume of European research must be increased and strengthened and given greater freedom to act more dynamically and internationally .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . - ( DE ) Mr President , I am going to present the decisions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , to some extent a crazy undertaking , just as crazy as the way in which some of our debates on such results were organised .
we have tabled an amendment for the re @-@ introduction of the liberalisation programme , and this really needs to be done .
the news is that , with regard to the use of nuclear energy , my country , Germany , was completely isolated .
assuming that it is already a serious challenge for Europe to secure a critical mass of well @-@ trained labour forces , it will be even more difficult to secure experts in the future because of liberalisation .
the plan is closely linked to energy consumption within the Union , to reducing CO2 emissions , to Europe &apos;s energy dependency .
in October 2007 , the G8 Finance Ministers asked the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) to look into these issues .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) The main feature of European integration is openness to trade and investment .
( HU ) I would like to briefly mention some of the problems .
we know that Parliament is well aware of these issues , and we believe that we will reach an agreement on rules that will allow us to benefit from biofuels , while at the same time reducing any indirect harmful effects .
we will do all we can to achieve this ; if we reach an early agreement at second reading , we will do it .
based on this new reality , my group will seek the best possible solution for the future .
this is an excellent report for consumers , airlines &apos; staff and aviation for the whole of Europe .
they themselves must help ensure that we really achieve a healthy environment through the transport system .
European cities are still isolated , they have not been given assistance .
what is it longing ?
the current legislation - Regulation ( EEC ) No 3922 / 1991 , which requires the use of child security systems - leaves Member States free to decide .
in order to carry out their crisis management tasks effectively , central banks may need supervisory information .
we do not want to know the names , but we want to know whether the decision was taken by a narrow or clear majority and whether the debates were difficult or whether there was not much debate .
the introduction of the euro has undoubtedly brought some advantages : some of the things mentioned by Mr Schmidt are indisputable , but there is no mention whatsoever of the tangible negative impact on any citizen of the euro area who has suffered from real inflation , which is much higher than official figures in terms of widespread speculation , which was accompanied by the introduction of this currency , and which was clearly understretched by the ECB and the institutions .
in my opinion , we need closer cooperation between central banks and the European Central Bank , financial markets and regulatory authorities .
as many Members have said very eloquently , we certainly have a demand @-@ driven phenomenon ; the big emerging economies are creating a new aspect - a strong demand - at global level , and this must be fully acknowledged .
in writing . - As far as economic trends are concerned , the fundamentals of the euro area economy remain firmly rooted in investment growth and improved employment rates and labour participation .
consequently , we still need to make it clear that the reimbursement rate for planned treatment abroad should correspond to the cost of at least similar treatment in the country where the patient is insured .
this regulation was needed because the old one no longer responded to the reality and the coordination procedures could be simplified .
he could not be asked any more because the Council and the Commission have not yet completed their work and have not yet submitted the final content of the annexes .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to make a few brief comments on this report , one aspect of which , as you know , is to contribute to deregulation and cutting red tape .
I hope that the regulation will not result in the elimination of all small sports companies .
work on improving energy efficiency and saving has also become much more important .
in writing . - I voted to exclude railways of historic value from the scope of the directive .
when they pollute soil or water quantities , it is often impossible to predict the consequences .
consequently , after considering Mr Corbett &apos;s report , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs did not recommend any changes to the thresholds laid down in Article 29 .
rather than want to believe in this resolution , it is good .
what is the European Union doing ?
it is difficult , it is perhaps difficult work , but it is something that Parliament must continue unrelentlessly .
the situation in Tibet has never been so tense .
it is those who find errors in the Treaty of Lisbon , supporting enlargement , who must understand that they are pursuing a politically consistent line .
thirdly and most importantly , this report goes beyond the current enlargement plan to countries that are not on the list of potential applicants .
the message is very clear : the enlargement process will not be interrupted , but we must all do more to prepare ourselves .
this is the only way to promote stability , peace , respect for human rights and economic reforms in our neighbourhood .
finally , we should not prevent those countries that want to develop further to be allowed to interfere with euro @-@ sceptic , more national or more repressive countries .
from the Union for the Mediterranean , which is an important step forward if the Community as a whole supports it instead of being a priority for certain regions of certain countries , continuing with the proposal of Poland and Sweden , and ending with the proposal of the Black Sea Union .
thanks to learning and life experience , they have become active members of non @-@ governmental organisations , they have been involved in information , voluntary work or have used their knowledge in European integration structures .
the situation of children affected by this conflict must be given greater consideration .
yes , there are minors in prisons , most teenagers , who are manipulated and trafficked by Hamas and illegally killed by flags filled with explosives .
it is also important that Africa expresses its concern at this crisis at regional level , and the efforts of the African Union and SADC should be supported .
the travel ban for Mugabe and all the leading players in his regime must be made more watertight and extended further .
we are working on continuing our mediation activities according to Mr Michel &apos;s recommendations , which are always reasonable and based on experience .
as mentioned in the communication , although the demand for agricultural products is also influenced by the market for biofuels , the Commission &apos;s analyses indicate that European biofuel production is currently having little impact on current global food prices .
so far , the Council has not adopted the proposal .
and that is why , earlier this year , the Commission set up a European e @-@ Business Support Network .
they arise as a result of mismanagement structures , but also when the equipment required for a specific operation is not available .
the current EU Treaty makes it quite clear that the EU budget cannot be used for military purposes .
on the issue of denationalisation of the protocol and the renegotiation of new negotiations , namely that it was being underused once again , I would like to echo what Mrs Isler Béguin said , that such agreements concern not only fisheries but also development aid .
finally , Commissioner , I would like to say that I approve of the work you have done on these negotiations , because the European Parliament wants to make its voice heard and now it seems that the Council is not even listening to our fundamental arguments .
this was because of the thorough analysis involving the proposal in order to ensure that it is a truly effective instrument for dealing with the serious problems faced by the sector .
we should all accept this .
the problem is that until now , industry and the Member States have not sufficiently promoted them .
1 .
( the oral amendment was accepted )
however , my request to Members and politicians across Europe is : let us ensure that these are not just warm words to silence our conscience .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted against this European Parliament resolution calling for Italy to withdraw the census based on ethnic origin of the Roma , as it seems premature and I regret that Parliament did not vote in favour of the proposal to postpone it until September 2008 , as proposed by my group , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
we believe that the Copenhagen criteria are the only requirements to be met by candidate countries who are negotiating to join the EU .
Mr von Wogau - Chairman of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence - has done Parliament and Europe a favour with this report , which we should follow in the future .
let me add - and I say this to Mr Schulz - that I am in favour of bringing in the Balkan countries that our Croatian friends , like our Serbian friends , are undoubtedly Europeans .
how can Europeans continue to do this if they do not have military and human resources to implement the decisions that we have taken together ?
I believe that this is a Presidency full of momentum and determination and rich in the concrete results that we all work towards today .
as I said , we certainly need political commitment .
the European customs is not &apos; divide and rule &apos; .
a moment ago you criticised the lack of Community preference , and you are right .
I would have had to speak more about European energy policy .
I just want to try to integrate everyone into a different Europe based on democracy , peace and growth .
( the speaker continued his speech in Basque )
President Sarkozy , we are confident that you will finish your presidency half a year after good results .
you therefore have the support to move forward and integrate the social model .
it is not so easy , but I will try hands in any case .
I am pleased to invite you to take the path of social harmonisation , but I would like to say to my French socialist friends that social harmonisation does not include support for ideas in France that no one else in Europe supports , because it would be exceptional and our country would suffer as a result .
I hope that the French Presidency will never accept such a ridicule of the Kyoto Protocol and oppose discrimination against the new Member States , including my own .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Onesta asked me how I would interpret Rule 149 ( 4 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
we also call on the European Commission to provide financial and technical assistance to the Indian Government for this purpose through stability instruments and , possibly , to continue to act to resolve the conflict in Kashmir .
today , it is mainly used to target those who are victims of political persecution .
the representatives of these groups will approve them if they agree with their content , then they will be discussed and put to the vote .
that is not the case .
on the basis of the first research , the ripplate &apos;s partial collapse in construction materials that combine hardware with real laesstructure was caused .
the fact that a country with significant reduced potential can trample on the Union indicates that we are treated as a weak partner unable to take serious political decisions .
( HU ) Mr President , with regard to the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , the President of Romania , Traian Băsescu , has violently attacked the collective rights of minorities in his speeches , as he believes minorities are the cause of the collapse of some countries .
Eurojust is not sufficiently well informed on terrorism issues .
the facts have rejected it ; the usefulness of a proven authority has been proven , and it needs to be strengthened further .
serious crimes must also be one aspect of our desired judicial cooperation .
( NL ) Mr President , the regulation states that all visa holders must be systematically confronted with requests in the Visa Information System ( VIS ) in order to carry out biometric checks .
the second point concerned the withdrawal of troops .
( applause )
if Russia is ready to switch to cooperation policy and respect its neighbours , it will also be invited to participate .
this is a classic example of political orthodoxy , which assumes that Russia is only pursuing imperialist objectives .
they had established themselves in Georgian villages near the capital of Ossetia .
that is what we are trying to do .
now we have a war between Russia and Georgia .
this decision has certainly led to serious consequences for the countries of the Caucasus and for Europe , and may in the future also have consequences for Russia itself .
in this context , how can the North Stream and South Stream projects be evaluated , given the support received from certain Member States of the Union ?
on the basis of his broad understanding of facts , he said that European governments are hugely corrupt , as it is well known that Russia is using a new gamble against the West , namely a global bribery tax .
I think that is a very important point .
it has the support of the American neo @-@ conservative lobby for Georgia , led by Randy Scheunemann , President @-@ designate John McCaini , on foreign policy issues .
we welcome the fact that all the relevant Directorates @-@ General are involved in this selection process .
I have received a motion for a resolution under Rule 108 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
Member States have introduced different systems and national regulators have , in particular , been established to ensure the highest possible level of consumer protection in their national markets .
secondly , the proposed pilot projects for combating carousel fraud are a good idea and we will take them into account , but we would like to emphasise that this must not lead to a breach of the framework conditions for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank Members of this House for the comments and views they expressed during the debate .
the report included in the social agenda states that the EUR 500 million allocated each year was only EUR 4 % in 2007 .
equally , appropriate welfare facilities must be offered to help people reconcile work and family life .
this would increase the legal uncertainty already in place and further reduce the scope of national creative activities .
if we want to eliminate this type of inequality through regulation , we arrogantly reject cultural diversity and interfere with the natural development of society and , worse still , we put equality above freedom .
that is the point of the European social model , and that is exactly what I support .
if a doctor is in hospital custody , for example , and a patient in a life @-@ threatening condition can arrive at any time , then that time cannot be counted for rest periods that would be possible according to the Council &apos;s compromise .
many other alarming issues have been raised .
the social package is an insurance policy for the future of the Union and is essential for the Union &apos;s long @-@ term development .
( DE ) Mr President , with regard to the enforcement of judgments rendered in absentia , we in the European Union do not benefit from excellent police cooperation , on the one hand , but , on the other , the system of prosecuting is not working as well as it could .
however , we have previously voted against EU labelling of organic products , as we believe that market forces armed with well @-@ informed European consumers are capable of coping with this task alone .
I welcome this view , and I would also like to emphasise that it could form the basis for a greater focus on the sector , and I call on the Commission to implement meaningful policies in this area .
we must respect the right of asylum seekers to flee to any country they consider most appropriate and ensure that Member States act in accordance with the Geneva Convention of 1951 .
in writing . - ( SV ) The fight against tax fraud deserves full support , of course .
concerning the CFSP , the Council agreed to as a preventive measure the commitment and payment appropriations set out in the preliminary draft budget , which correspond to the amounts contained in the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 .
Reparing heading 1 , there are indeed cuts , but , in addition to cuts , an increase of EUR 50 million has been taken into account for countries and regions at the convergence stage ; I wanted to mention this .
the Commission proposal did not address or only briefly new networks , at a time when Europe is already participating in this technological revolution .
consequently , it would be dangerous if we were to try to protect old structures and muscles .
I believe that it is important for Parliament to reaffirm the importance of protecting intellectual property and privacy even by reaffirming the right of people to privacy , a right that is currently violated violently by the major telecom companies .
I am opposed to a decision banning the sharing of files at national level , and I intend to oppose it on the same issue at EU level .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - ( FR ) Madam President , thank you for giving me the floor .
I would therefore ask Mr Harbour to withdraw these amendments in order to restore the balance between copyright and internet users &apos; rights .
thank you very much .
if we are to carry out a general review , we must therefore strive not only to look at quantitative common agricultural policy objectives , but also to consider more qualitative aspects , so as to ensure that all our fellow citizens , wherever they live , are able to access high @-@ quality foodstuffs .
as far as the Council is concerned , these negotiations are based on the proposals put forward by the Commission based on screening reports , which are a perfectly normal basis .
I believe that this should end in March next year .
we must continue our efforts and strengthen the legal basis .
( RO ) Ladies and gentlemen , there are issues that people talk a great deal about , but which little is being done about .
I stress the issue of maternity leave and parental leave .
to begin with , the Council and the European Parliament have agreed to extend the Regulation on the activities of the body until 2012 .
they then come here and find it surprising that women are not only interested in cleaning and waiting for a day and waiting for spouses to work at home , but they are independent and intelligent , and they earn money , and consequently consumers , and that there are also different family models in the countryside that are not present in advertising , such as single @-@ parent families and gay couples with children , and migrant families , such as wheelchair or voice @-@ raising .
we know , for example , that only a few clones will survive .
banning the cloning of animals for food supply may not solve this problem if it is a scenario of production .
now I come to my role as shadow rapporteur for the ALDE Group , and I will set out some principles guiding our approach .
they keep our food fresh , our bodies clean , they help our plants grow , they feed our cars .
I am not entirely happy with this compromise , but we cannot delay the introduction of the GHS in our own legislation .
( SV ) I would just like to respond to what my colleague , Graham Booth , said here about the fact that environmental mobility wants to protect people , but not animals .
it also includes a new system for detecting vehicles in order to make it easier for the rescue services to recognise them .
this should accelerate , in particular , the practical deployment of hydrogen cells , but hydrogen should not be widely used in &apos; traditional systems &apos; , in other words in combustion engines , because I do not think that makes sense .
President of the Republic of Costa Rica . - ( ES ) Mr President , I welcome you on behalf of a small American Republic , a little over 4.5 million people who dare to live and dream every day ; where an ideal society has been possible without the army and where we will soon celebrate the 110 anniversary of democracy .
not in national terms , because then countries governed by dictatorship and violence could also be proud of themselves , but be proud of their own country , Costa Rica , because you defend the right values : democracy , freedom and peace .
it rightly calls into question the reliability and integrity of our work .
as a fuel , hydrogen gives us a clean , renewable energy source .
Parliament did not consider it appropriate to adopt a similar resolution on Kosovo , based on the same principles of respect for international law and national borders , on which it is now based on the denationalisation of the recognition given by Moscow to the independence of Ossetia and Abkhazia .
legislation in this area falls within the competence of each Member State and therefore Parliament must respect the principle of subsidiarity .
nevertheless , we would like to emphasise that we did so because we consider many of the values and requirements that it contains to be essential , but our opinions differ on the measures proposed to achieve them .
the Seventh Framework Programme for Research already finances such projects as cloning human beings .
( NL ) Mr President , let me begin with some criticism .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur and assure him that we support his report .
I see double standards in the European Union in three cases .
furthermore , I call on the EU to apply human rights policy equally and to impose sanctions on each country , where mass human rights violations are confirmed .
as we all know , most of these women live in sub @-@ Saharan Africa , where one person dies in one minute .
it is imperative that this issue is dealt with seriously and it is not necessary to pretend that it can deal with it in any other way .
however , it is important that abortion is legal and safe , as well as exceptional , because this is the only way to combat illegal abortion .
the main reason why world mortality is rising is the lack of qualified staff to help during pregnancy and childbirth .
part two
therefore , the Member State concerned will be able to deal with the problem if it so wishes , but at the time the directive was adopted , the majority of Member States were not in favour of taking action at EU level .
I think that the mission , like all election observation missions , proved to be a very positive contribution to the conduct of the elections to the Cambodian authorities .
this was a relative success .
however , richer countries seek to further deregulate and liberalise financial markets in WTO services negotiations , and the report does indeed support this proposal .
they must be able to decide on this for themselves .
one relates to auditing conditions .
today we know what this means , and today we also know what important problems we are rightly discussing .
the Commission will adopt amendments 1 , 2 , 3 , 18 , 25 and 47 in the recast .
at that time , measures to promote greater transparency , fairer competition , less dangerous work , better qualifications for workers and greater safety were chosen , and it was stressed that the unregulated liberalisation of the European port system would be counterproductive .
there has been massive investment recently and the successful parking fleet of the Carlingford Lough Palace de Warrenpoint was built .
accuracy , regularity , reliability , high quality , adequate capacity , interoperability and cross @-@ border coordination of international corridors are the keywords for services that count on consumers .
I have heard that there are major design errors here .
with this in mind , the Commission will play an active role in preparing the fifth ministerial conference on the environment and health that is due to take place in July 2009 .
our climate change is changing , and it brings new challenges in both health and the environment .
a high level of contamination can lead to asthma disease , allergies and even cancer .
the position after first reading was adopted by the European Parliament on 14 November 2007 .
this means that soil protection must not be subject to competition .
it is therefore necessary to give appropriate encouragement and assistance to these countries in the removal of such material .
appropriate debate should be allowed , but also proper consultation with our legal services .
the report deals with sanctions , an instrument that we , the European Community , cannot do .
if these two aspects are allocated , it will be rather difficult to find a credible position and a lasting solution .
I am saddened by the fact that in sub @-@ Saharan Africa , one in the sixteenth women die of childbirth .
opening up the market and improving competitiveness are undoubtedly necessary .
we therefore call on the new Mauritanian &apos; strong men &apos; to give back to the Mauritanian people the power they have stolen .
the oral condemnation of the coup d &apos;état in Mauritania is insufficient if the European Union does not simultaneously apply specific sanctions to isolate the junta .
author . - ( DE ) Mr President , once again we need to talk about human rights violations in Iran , and the last debate on human rights has not taken time at all .
Iran has signed agreements of this nature .
albinos and body parts are traded in that country .
as a member of the Alliance of Governors , the Commission will continue to coordinate aid to solve the problem , including with regard to the Alliance of Albinos .
I would ask you now to rise to a minute &apos;s silence .
the workers were used as &apos; limbles &apos; .
services which should prevent crime are used only for political and economic blackmail and for settling invoices with opposition .
over the next few weeks , I will propose to the Commission two different regulatory measures to deal with these and other issues : firstly , revising the Capital Requirements Directive and secondly , a regulation on credit rating agencies .
it is just as good to hear that there is a hurricane or a tsunami coming , but we should think about the positive aspects of water and wind .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if European banks are relatively well opposed to the current crisis , it is only thanks to banking supervision in Europe , which is far from ideal but at least serious .
I hope that together we will have the strength to take these new routes so that , together with us , not only those who have won , but also those who have lost .
the problematic areas relating to transparency can be summarised as follows : the introduction of harmonised information standards , which must be made public by companies that place their shares on stock exchanges , and the right of companies and corporate governance with regard to the issue of collective responsibility for information in company activity reports , the strengthening of the role of independent board members , standards in the area of committees to be set up by the Council , disclosure of information on the remuneration of members of the board , and also better protection of investors .
over the years , I have heard various figures as to whether there are more lobbyists than Capitol hill in Washington , but there is no big difference between them in any case .
important cases brought to the attention of the Committee on Petitions have been such that there has been a constant violation of Community law over many years , so they have come to the right place - the Petitions Committee .
the European Year of Creativity and Innovation must be a year if the promises are honoured .
with the second report , Parliament actually invited the Commission to submit new proposals to adapt an additional limited number of laws .
churches have long been using &apos; bottle &apos; and &apos; red &apos; morals for people .
this was a rather negative signal .
rapporteur . - ( ES ) Commissioner , I believe that we can agree that the adoption of the report on this fundamental issue , which is the quality of teacher education , is good news , given that the objective of teacher education is really simply to improve the education of students and to share knowledge that adds to them mental maturity and criticism , while also giving them the skills needed to engage in an increasingly competitive and demanding society .
if we , with the help of the Commission , make progress on achieving these objectives , we can all be satisfied .
looking at the situation in my country , Bulgaria , I would say that the majority of the rural population &apos;s thoughts have occupied mostly human basic needs .
it should be remembered that the fight against terrorism can actually only be effective and proportionate if we guarantee the promotion of the fundamental rights of every citizen .
even if it is known to the legal system or government of a Member State that this is a Supreme injustice , it cannot prevent it .
I would like to designate Mr Borghezio as a call for action and , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , I would like to make a formal request to the President of the European Parliament that Mr Borghezio be given a formal warning .
it would therefore be more appropriate for us to focus on modern technological instruments used to recruit , finance , implement and praise the attacks , and to reach an agreement on how to combat them all over Europe , as well as complementing the relevant national legislation with the measures agreed at European level .
therefore , I would be sorry if the European Parliament were to make the wrong choice here and change these definitions - already because , according to the Council of Europe decision , the term &apos; public provocation &apos; should be used .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate the entire European Parliament on this high @-@ level debate .
4 .
I am pleased that Mr Rasmussen agreed to a large part of our position when negotiating with us .
however , it is no longer right to expect us to work effectively in terms of human resources and expenditure and to continue these palphions to Strasbourg so that , while voting as I have voted , I support those who say that there should be one seat for plenary sittings ; but please , let us have a rational debate on this issue rather than a polarised political debate .
therefore , indifferent attitudes in this area may have disastrous consequences , not only cultural but also economic .
there is still much to be done in this regard .
in writing . - ( LT ) I have always been in favour of market liberalisation because I believe that this is a basic prerequisite for competition between market players , which is always beneficial to consumers , because it allows them to choose and buy goods at the lowest possible price .
Europe must urgently assess its open borders policy and its devastating impact on immigration , crime and Islamic extremism .
of course , it is good that European citizens are able to petition the authorities , including even the European bodies , but I find it regrettable that this report is a federalist undertone .
Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system - investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector - liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of accidents - Port State control ( recast ) - ship inspection and survey organisations ( recast ) - ship inspection and survey organisations ( recast ) ( debate )
on this basis , I would ask the Council not to miss the opportunity to conclude this issue in the conciliation procedure , which some of us will be able to conclude once we have almost done our homework , because the informal trialogues held so far and the full consensus among all the shadow rapporteurs have produced very satisfactory results , and this could be a good basis for reaching a final agreement .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , we recognise that , together with your colleagues , you have already made good progress in the six @-@ pack discussions .
the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance welcomes all seven legislative proposals from the Commission and therefore supports the rapporteur &apos;s recommendations on five common positions , including split and separate votes on the recommendations contained in the Costa report on inland waterway transport .
one of the main points relating to the independent investigation of accidents is , at least , the opinion of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats that this investigation must be completely independent .
I hope that together we will be able to create a comprehensive and uniform system that guarantees the responsibility of each person in it .
without compromising safety , the European Union must make sure that ships in its Member States &apos; registers are not transferred to other countries , particularly those that allow ships to fly under the so @-@ called flags of convenience .
what can we do with pirates ?
however , we are talking about the deployment of very tangible military positions .
furthermore , as the Vice @-@ President of the Commission said again today , we hope that the Pact will help us define a common asylum policy and define Europe as a asylum .
Mr President , Mr Aylward is absolutely right .
I would like to thank Mr Mitchell himself for his comments .
the report by Carlos Coelho , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on migration to the second generation Schengen Information System ( decision ) ( 12059 / 1 / 2008 - C6 @-@ 0188 / 2008 - , and
the introduction of SIS II is well behind schedule .
of course , if necessary , we can use the penalties provided by the treaties , as my predecessor did , imposing a fine of over EUR 1 million on one subcontractor .
it calls for the consent of the European Parliament , not just consultation .
at the same time , we import a sixth of all the timber consumed .
another really good idea is to implement wood certification for the European market .
it is true that institutions that regulate complex and broad areas such as the European Parliament cannot often avoid being tempted to encroach their democratic power on bureaucracy .
we are discussing this issue tonight in the evening in relation to the energy shortage , another issue that we have raised several times and which has not been answered by the Commission , although it should already produce real initiatives on this issue .
the first pillar is the promotion of sustainable growth and employment .
we therefore ask the Commission to make additional efforts to move forward with the proposed budget review as soon as possible .
Commissioner , as you rightly said , we all know that social policy issues in the first pillar must be a priority for communication policy and indeed a core for the EU , which not just respects its citizens , but wants to establish its fundamental principles , structures and procedures in the international context of the globalisation crisis .
firstly , the European Commission should encourage the employment of young people .
the next item is the Council and Commission statements on preparations for the EU @-@ India Summit in Marseille on 29 September 2008 .
it will be the longest railway tunnel in the world , it is currently 95 % completed , there will be 3 900 people there , and I am sure there will be a number of thousands more jobs in the future .
we consider this to be a mistake for the European Parliament , because we expect this House to have the courage to criticise Europe &apos;s silence during the negotiations of the group of nuclear powers .
however , as Mrs Gill said , we must offer constructive criticism and make sure that we praise the courageous conduct of the Indian Prime Minister , which several speakers have referred to , how she described these events as a national disgrace and quickly sent 3 000 police officers to Opel .
- Before the vote on Amendment 132 :
however , in the midst of this cycle , which seems impossible to interrupt , the importance of the &apos; European project &apos; cannot be underestimated .
amendments 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 20 , 21 , 32 , 38 , 41 ( on the recitals )
( SK ) First of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur for the many years he has spent his work and for his consistent approach to the existing legislative package in the field of electronic communications .
the intentions are good , let us hope they will not be thrown out because of the great financial interests at stake .
on the one hand , because it is technically complex , overlapping legislative initiatives ; on the other , because the balance between confidentiality and security requires careful consideration in nature .
then everyone can blame others .
this mechanism fears the survival of Indian farmers living in agriculture .
we all have to deal with the consequences and react to this situation .
( applause )
for this reason , if we want to avoid further and more painful disasters , we must have the courage to put an end to this .
I call on Members to consider a completely different response to the current economic difficulties .
it is a shame that the ultra @-@ liberal dogmatism and the economy based on financial speculation , the so @-@ called fate of the economy , has gained an advantage over social problems and the economy based on entrepreneurship and action , which is the only economy capable of creating wealth and citizens .
however , outside the borders of the EU , the Financial Stability Forum must continue to work very actively ; it is a very important institution at the moment - the Lamfalussy Third Level Committee .
in my opinion , the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and the European Investment Bank programmes and so on should be used in a united way to try to achieve seriously the objectives that you , Mr Piebalgs , set out several times three years ago .
on the aspects of energy security and foreign policy , I would like to return to the idea that Europe can and must improve the strengths of a rapidly changing global energy economy .
instead of energy production , the result was rather an international arbitration dispute , the results of which have nonetheless been ignored by Hungary .
and I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he has presented to the Council , for example , a taboo on the cost of oil and gas from Russia compared with LNG , nuclear power and all the other resources , because it seems to me that our governments do not actually produce energy at the prices consumers actually want .
under what circumstances , if anything , could euro area countries be allowed to exceed the 3 % deficit ?
as regards the implementation of Community rules on reporting incidents , the Commission is convinced that all Member States have introduced a mandatory reporting system and collect information in national databases .
without good national production grounds for first @-@ generation biofuels , we have difficulty in marketing innovative and efficient products .
in foreign countries , the charge may amount to up to EUR 16 per megabyte , so you can imagine what bills may be made if you do not know what the person is .
under the Commission Regulation of 15 April 1958 , Article 1 of Regulation ( EC ) No 920 / 2005 of 13 June 2005 , Ireland became the official working language of the institutions of the European Union on 1 January 2007 .
in July , the High Level Group met representatives of the European Platform for Action on diet , physical activity and Health in order to discuss the possibility of synergies and partnerships , focusing in particular on reducing salt - the agreed initial priority for joint action with Member States .
the White Paper on nutrition is a useful document for curbing obesity , particularly among children .
more than 50 % of Europeans are overweight , and about 6 % of healthcare outputs take obesity , as has already been mentioned here today .
we should not forget campaigns aimed at parents who play a very important role and children .
so I would like to thank all those who have spoken in the debate and also the shadow rapporteurs .
the Commission &apos;s proposal focuses on three major issues .
tomorrow , the Commission intends to continue to approach this &apos; soft law &apos; by adopting the following recommendation , this time on the subject of online creative content , which also addresses the issue of multi @-@ territorial licensing .
the Commission has ruled out the possibility of any collective action by collecting societies , such as the proposal to create a transparent copyright system in Europe .
I would like to say that I do not think that the involvement of the IMF and the World Bank in the monitoring body would increase it too much .
Fourthly , with regard to the scope of the draft directive , I have been in contact with several Members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , when they were last in Paris in May , and I know that many of you regret the decision to confine themselves to patient mobility only in this text and not to address the mobility of health professionals .
there is a question of compensation .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , four out of a century of European citizens go abroad to receive treatment ; in my opinion , health tourism is still a symptom of state deficits and lack of services .
therefore , Commissioner , I am very grateful for your initiative , which undoubtedly has many positive aspects in terms of ensuring quality and safety , patient information , closer cooperation at European level , e @-@ health , support networks , etc .
this is our first task .
we must ensure that health standards are raised throughout Europe , in both large and small countries .
( applause )
I would ask you to comment on this matter .
could you make sure that this technical problem is resolved ?
this is the main problem of controlling food prices , which must be given much more special attention .
better but not good .
since the European Union &apos;s economy is still heavily dependent on energy imports , it is necessary to establish a common energy policy based on the principle of solidarity , security and diversification of energy sources and external supply routes .
important labour market issues of this kind must under no circumstances be regulated by means of a readable leaflet of the institutions of the European Union .
I have also received complaints from assistants who have to make their children school on a third category if they want to go to school in Europe ; in a word , they have to pay fees .
unfortunately , there are still official languages of the European Union which are not spoken at any European school .
we are now in place to move forward with the European Baccalaureate .
thank you .
I am not sure that we can feel defenceless to defend ourselves against our own abilities .
now is the time for action .
we must ensure that our fellow citizens are left with confidence in the banking system and do not become a panic , which would only speed up the downward spiral .
Europe was too slow to notice such concerns .
in fact , it would be even more unpopular than the Treaty of Lisbon , which you hate .
colleagues in this House may remember that during the appointment of Peter Mandelson , we all supported him , regardless of party or delegation affiliation .
the elections were not democratic .
the euro is an example of what Europe can achieve if it genuinely shares its sovereignty .
on the other hand , it is the responsibility of the Community institutions , the European Commission and the European Parliament to ensure that the Single Market remains open and legislation is in place .
on 14 October , foreign ministers will meet Bernard Kouchner and , on 15 October , there will be a meeting of senior officials and leaders to find appropriate solutions for the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia , the recognition of which I must say to Mrs Isler Béguin , although she knows already , has remained extremely isolated , which is a good thing , because this unacceptable act was strongly condemned by the European Union and the Presidency .
it is incredible that we have now reached something so unthinkable , namely the collapse of the banking system .
we must continue to help Member States to pursue common goals and objectives .
the rapporteurs have recommended a rather complex and formal application process with the President , the President @-@ in @-@ Office and the new bureaucracy .
finally , may I point out that we must bear in mind the structure of Europe .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Madam President , if the President @-@ in @-@ Office win all seats in his Parliament , we can probably assume that something is wrong .
again this morning , I was pleased to exchange views with Mr Milinkevich and Mr Kozullin .
I have now realised that the bilateral agreement between Ireland and Belarus will not be ready before May or June .
now that they recognise this equivalence , they are unscathly and arbitrarily asserting that the new Parliament has a dubious democratic legitimacy .
to do this , we have a strengthened framework for interinstitutional cooperation , which I think works very well .
Mr President , I would like to take up the idea of the inadequacy that Mr Cashman rightly raised .
people in the European Union are becoming increasingly older and face new threats : pandemics , physical and biological disasters , bioterrorism , and we must find a solution to all of this .
we are now saying to the banking sector that this is their BSE moment and they are once again coming up from the dark , but their activities must be better regulated .
the successful conclusion of this round of negotiations requires a comprehensive , ambitious and balanced agreement .
his proposals would have reduced the EU livestock sector by a decade , not in favour of developing countries , but rather in favour of low @-@ cost emerging economies , with their extended ransom and ransol rots .
if we focus on finances , then even the worst of our enemy would not want to recommend that the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank take the lead .
the first provision provides for public treatment for private individuals and businesses in the Community offering international maritime transport services when they provide international maritime transport services on their inland waterways in Ukraine .
in writing . - The services sector is of crucial importance to both the EU and Ukraine &apos;s economy .
thank you .
we need to multiply the resources available , but this has only been mentioned in the amendments proposed by Parliament .
there is also a need for more research into water recycling plants and water recycling technologies in order to become a cheaper and more efficient system .
there is no more time to delay .
I will not go into detail on illegal immigration and propose sanctions for those who employ illegal immigrants from third countries .
consequently , it would be premature for the Commission to adopt a position already on matters relating to self @-@ employed drivers in relation to aspects that raise the question of whether or not to include them in the scope of the Working Time Directive .
in itself , however , this is not a guarantee of social integration or the eradication of poverty .
this means that we could all move forward together .
and now the European Parliament wants to take the next step .
( es ) Mr President , I would like to ask the following question to those who have said that symbols and anthems belong to the country .
we will report next year on this subject .
it would be useful to set up information and advisory centres to raise patient awareness in order to help patients , healthcare professionals and the health sector as a whole .
however , some kind of solidarity and compensation fund would be needed to mitigate the consequences of the loss of specialists .
so we exceeded not only the threshold , which is considered to be a critical border , but even double that percentage .
12 .
particular attention should be given to children who are grown by single parents and to children who grow up in large families or immigrant families .
the new approach includes water saving in rural areas through new dams , new legislation on rivers , prevention of disasters , new agricultural strategies based on new concepts and , of course , water reorientation , if this proves necessary .
there is no doubt that there may still be people like the abominable paedophile Fourniret who intimidated people in France and then in Belgium , because his punitive record was not transmitted from one country to another .
the enlargements of the European Union in 2004 and 2007 have far @-@ reaching effects .
there are numerous examples of this , including the Belgian State , which was set up with the unification of Flanders and Wallonia nearly 180 years ago .
for example , recently , at a time when Georgia started the conflict with Russia , the whole world could see pictures of the President of Georgia , whose cabinet was not only the flag of Georgia , but also the flag of the European Union .
in writing . - I voted in favour of Amendment 6 by the Socialist Group calling for the transformation of the Arctic Ocean into an arms and nuclear @-@ free zone .
furthermore , I would like to call on the Irish Government to provide all the data on the bank deposit guarantee system and to state that it has now been extended to banks other than Irish banks complying with EU antitrust rules .
in writing . - ( RO ) I voted in favour of this report because I am convinced that the implementation of the recommendations it contains will increase life expectancy in the European Union and help us achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy relating to economic growth .
( BG ) Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , one of Bulgaria &apos;s most difficult tasks is the transparent use of European funds .
there is too much smoke in this case , and the fire is not at all , and we all know that we face close competition .
in my constituency , I was recently brought to my attention a typical example of unjustified delay .
this applies to working time , working hours , working hours , rest periods , working hours , paid leave , the protection of workers &apos; health , the right to non @-@ discrimination and the protection of pregnant women .
in Estonia , it says &apos; better late than never &apos; and it is positive that we are finally adopting the temporary agency directive .
I am also thinking of the European Works Council Directive , which needs to be reviewed .
similarly , the Commission supports the European Parliament &apos;s proposals aimed at raising public awareness of national and European legislation on matrimonial and divorce agreements .
there is simply one and the same marriage , and Dutch marriage is divided by the European Union , not by the Netherlands itself .
once again , I would like to make it clear that we have improved the provisions already included in Rome III , which are absolutely clear , for example , in Amendment 25 : &apos; if &#91; ... &#93; the law does not recognise separation or divorce , or in a manner that discriminates against a single spouse , the law of the state of the court shall apply &apos; .
its aim is to provide legal protection to air carriers and reservation systems in the European Union in respect of the transfer of PNR data to Australian customs authorities , while maintaining compliance with EU data protection legislation .
if we address this issue in a proportionate way and reduce the possibility of misuse , PNR data may be an important tool for protecting innocent passengers and scoring the intentions of a possible terrorist .
in my opinion , this support is well demonstrated if an agreement is reached at first reading .
the geographical representation of all countries should , of course , be as broad as possible , so that the project is even more successful .
in addition , we are organising targeted information campaigns for specific target groups .
we had a truly pleasant debate in the Committee on Culture on this serious issue , which was attended by very expert speakers .
it is common practice for us to say that children are our property .
in my opinion , international cooperation in this area must be constantly increased because , as other Members have said , this area knows no borders .
according to a recent report , two thirds of young people on the Internet have been approached unwittingly , and one quarter has been absorbed with intangible materials .
since I was elected in 1999 , we have had a new cod recovery plan every year .
since fishing is a socially and economically important sector , it increasingly gives rise to demonstrations and protests by Polish fishermen among other countries .
this is undoubtedly a difficult task .
finally , as regards interinstitutional cooperation in the area of better regulation , we must recognise that the interinstitutional agreement on better regulation , which has been in force since 2003 , has not been easy to implement .
before I finish , let me also say that the Commission has left open the form that will be given to the end result of the interinstitutional dialogue in order not to influence the debates .
freedom of movement is also linked to principles , and any deviations would be detrimental to Europe in particular - no matter how this directive is interpreted .
often , protectionism is actually behind the pursuit of labour standards and equal working conditions , and clear restrictions on free and fair competition .
the position of the European Parliament is quite clear .
finally , I would like to say once again that it is now up to the Commission to act .
however , it is important that they are started .
moreover , if we have abolished the visa requirement between ourselves , it is still reasonable that countries whose citizens do not need a visa to travel from one country to another should prefer the same way of supporting European immigration policy .
but that is not enough .
I am not afraid that both this and you , let us be honest , Mr Barroso &apos;s resolve - not his committee - has also impressed us .
we are therefore going to give money to Mercedes , BMW and Audi , so that they can put it in tax havens .
you mentioned the situation in Georgia and your efforts , but how do you not understand that the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia paved the way for unilateral recognition of Kosovo ?
I would like to add that , together with Bernard Kouchner , I took care democratically that the European Council confirmed the decisions we took .
the reform of the global financial system , which we all expect and ask , can only be possible if - I am absolutely convinced of this - Europe is in a position to show it its existence ; and to do so we must find new instruments .
this must not happen .
the Federal reserve bank in time was a monetary policy that was extremely low in maintaining interest rates - it made the money available to all those who wanted credit .
we are ready to work constructively with the European Parliament and the Council to find good solutions for Europe , and perhaps also for the whole world .
this means sustainability , not just increasing the risks with the aim of increasing income .
( el ) Madam President , what we need here and today is a new economic and social agreement , a &apos; new deal &apos; .
we need a more effective climate policy .
( FR ) Madam President , on the basis of the debate , it can be concluded that there is still time to find a solution on this issue .
however , this agreement does not provide for institutional coordination of cooperation and does not contain specific rules on the handling and protection of intellectual property rights .
the experience gained by the French Government in making applications , and the understandable attitude of the Commission , the European Parliament and the Council confirm to us Europe &apos;s ability to show solidarity with the populations of overseas departments facing a serious crisis .
the application of parliamentary control over the structure and activities of the regulatory agencies should comply with the classic principle of democracy , which requires the political accountability of all executive agencies to be strengthened .
the transition of the entire European university system to the Bologna model has made it difficult for students with a Master &apos;s degree to find doctoral degree .
in Finland , we abandoned the investigation of inviolability and other similar issues in divorce cases some 20 years ago .
that is why I voted in favour of the Guerreiro report .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , I wish to begin my speech with President Sarkozy &apos;s words in the debate this morning .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Minister , it is time , Mr Jouyet , to regret this sin - which seems to be today &apos;s general mood - or at least to give up the dogmas and animal @-@ religious reactions to date ; I am grateful to the French President , who has shown us this morning the example that seemed sincere .
Mr President , the Kremlin has got everything it wanted from the deal with President Sarkozy .
therefore , instead of burying out , we should sit down in the Kremlin as partners at the negotiating table .
the EU &apos;s influence on Russia is limited .
he recalled that he thought there was no point in going to Moscow , yet it stopped Russian troops .
let us condemn the disproportionate reaction in Georgia and any other similar behaviour .
this , too , is a clear limit that we must draw .
as the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council also said , the current draft agreement does indeed contain an extremely important human rights urgent clause , provides for a regular dialogue between the EU and Vietnam on human rights , giving it legal status , and provides for assistance in the drafting of the Vietnamese National Human Rights Action Plan .
the next item is Question Time ( B6 @-@ 0475 / 2008 ) .
in response to Mr Ryan - as you know , the Cotonou Agreement established a new partnership between the European Union and 78 African , Caribbean and Pacific States on 23 June 2000 .
this must be done .
do you consider this to be right and useful , Minister ?
therefore , the aid from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is very welcome , but it must be used in such a way that it reaches those in need , so that we can rescue the plants and thus maintain the competitive shipbuilding industry in Poland .
hundreds of thousands of people are losing their jobs and coming out to the streets .
Mrs Schroedter , the transitional period for Polish shipyards has lasted longer than in East Germany , and this has been the time for economic growth .
on the contrary , we have produced a document that is easy to implement and to introduce .
Ideally , we would have liked to have seen all institutions use a common methodology for environmental impact when awarding contracts , because then it would have been clear that the polluter pays would have been .
our debate must take place on a fundamental level , so the Commission must also understand that , this time , it will have to listen more to the European Parliament and MEPs .
in fact , it has been drafted so that even the smallest authority , city or region can deal with these issues in a rather easy way .
the second point is that images will not be stored but erased immediately ; that is , there must be a technical mechanism that prevents the recording of the image of the person who decides to go through the body scanner .
it should also be clear that , since decision @-@ making is transferred from Member States to the European Union , the European Parliament should also have more power to take and control decisions in this area .
I can only report and ensure that Parliament is involved every time an important issue is discussed , and I can also say whether or not the debate should take place on one matter .
it can cost many lives , and the European Commission has decided to intervene .
it cannot be denied that the competitiveness of our businesses is suffering from excessive regulations and bureaucratic conditions accumulated in the area of production over recent decades , and its impact is even more onerous and unsustainable for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , which are the foundation of the national production system in many Member States .
all medicinal products must have bar codes and packages must be designed in such a way that every simple person realises , according to the pack , whether they are safe or fake medicines if they are bought from a place other than from a pharmacy .
I am talking about products such as holiday clubs that offer lower prices , where customers often have to pay as advance payments of up to EUR 6 000 to EUR 20 000 a member of clubs , which only grants the right to discount on future holidays .
I believe that many people are doubtful about buying such services from other Member States precisely because they cannot feel safe and rely on consumer protection .
after all , it is not enough to develop intercultural dialogue successfully by means of high @-@ level individual measures such as symposites , joint declarations or symbolic gestures .
we are confronted with the polarisation that has emerged in the context of the increasing tensions caused by many political problems and by the strengthening of cultural stereotypes .
it was a political decision , not a market @-@ related one , and the air blowing into the air is now starting to run out .
they must both monitor and raise awareness , especially among the youngest members of society , as they are the most vulnerable and vulnerable .
this resolution is heading in this direction .
the draft directive on the conditions of temporary workers seeks to provide temporary workers with a minimum level of protection while supporting temporary employment .
this will bring benefits to all parties : patients , public authorities and pharmaceutical companies .
secondly , the EU &apos;s main internal market law ( Article 49 ) takes precedence over the provisions of the Posting of Workers Directive .
it was created and exists to serve the interests of monopolistic business groups and to protect the exploitation of the working class .
as regards payments , the European Parliament intends to approve the increase in the level of appropriations to the maximum .
we see a budget for small payments where there is a huge gap between commitments and payments and which is not in line with the real political priorities of the European Union .
therefore , the draft budget proposes to introduce an initial draft and remove the cuts made by the European Council .
if we want to achieve our target of reducing emissions by 30 % over 12 years , we need resources .
this is extremely important .
we in this Parliament also support this step and we expect politicians to take advantage of this opportunity .
that is not the case .
we have someone who will hopefully not waste time and effort and who will invest a lot of time and effort in this area .
given that obtaining an EU visa is still a problem for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina , I call on the Commission to continue the dialogue and to do everything possible to implement action plans with a view to establishing a visa @-@ free regime with Bosnia and Herzegovina as soon as possible .
of course , facts are constantly being checked , but they are WTO rules and we have always benefited from openness .
it could also lead to a significant number of investigations where initial suspicions ultimately prove unfounded .
since 2005 , it has become increasingly concrete and more constructive , and China has taken action .
sometimes Europe simply has to take the initiative .
only if this objective is achieved has so many innocent victims not been in vain .
firstly , because this resolution links this disaster and crime to people of Ukrainian origin , and only to those of Ukraine .
this means that the words used are empty .
this is the only way to achieve the objective of these debates : to ensure that this monumental , destructive disregard for human life and dignity never happens again in any part of Europe .
I will read it out as if it were some kind of secular request , remember the millions of victims associated with the memory of so many other innocent victims whose sacrifice , I say it again , must not be in vain for Europe .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , I welcome the report by my colleague Ulrich Stockmann and thank him for his hard work on this complex proposal .
( es ) Madam President , first of all , I must thank my colleague Mr Stockmann for his excellent report and , above all , for his patience and perseverance in its development .
this directive on airport charges represents a real step forward : making relations between airports and airlines more transparent will enable the directive to improve non @-@ transparent and conflict relations .
the Commission welcomes this , as we are the institution with most of these complaints .
it is also necessary to cooperate between the European Ombudsman and ombudsmen of similar organisations at national , regional and local level in the Member States .
- ( PL ) Madam President , despite the overall increase in the number of admissible complaints submitted to the Ombudsman in 2007 , it treated 17 % more complaints than in the previous year .
recently , a summary of the cooperation that took place over the years was presented in the publication &apos; improving lives &apos; , which you all inherited .
7 .
Madam President , I voted in favour of the resolution on the Holodomor , the great famine in Ukraine .
at the same time , we must bear in mind the whole picture , and good news is that there is an increasing awareness that significantly higher resources must be invested in real joint items of expenditure - in this case , in the climate .
its aim is to ensure that Bosnia and Herzegovina has correctly implemented and guaranteed free competition within the internal market for six years , as well as in other trade @-@ related areas .
as this objective is not attainable , the EU does not provide for its own commitment to the country within an indefinite period .
for example , I refer to military coup , intolerance , the stewarmongering of society or racial differences .
among these demands , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament places particular emphasis on a number of points : firstly , strengthening the UN mission in cooperation with European personnel capable of communicating with the population ; secondly , we call on the senior political and military authorities in Congo to do their utmost to ensure that the Congolese army soldiers cease their atrocities once and for all .
as regards our support for conflict @-@ affected areas , the Commission will continue to provide support through both humanitarian and development cooperation .
in a country where more than 2 000 political prisoners have been arrested , the authorities have obstructed access to free media , and in industry there is widespread slavery , the people of that country need great help .
the event was excellent and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to meet you .
when the demonstration was closed , this group attacked around twelve brutal slogans who wash them and took slogans with the permission of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament .
Mrs Berès - I am finishing now - said in her speech that the Commissioner and the Commission should once again draw the finance ministers &apos; attention to the conclusions of this report .
the debate on the coordination of economic policies in the euro area is indisputably more relevant and topical at the moment .
the real indicator of the success of the currency is the level of market confidence and , in this case , it is measured by the exchange of euro area bonds .
however , we must also remember that this progress could not have been made without the Maastricht criteria , without the Stability and Growth Pact and without the European Central Bank , nor without political will and without the desire to take responsibility at European level .
the authors of the report approve of the fall in unemployment , which has been admittedly somewhat more than 1.5 % over the last nine years , but is now forecast to increase unemployment in the euro area by next year .
Mr President , the fact that common interest rates and exchange rates must apply to economic environments with varying growth rates has always been an economic absurdity .
Mr President , I cannot agree with your opinion on the contradictions between Member States either .
we are well aware that France and Scandinavia have taken good action .
despite the already burdened employment laws , which have generally been drawn up by people with low or no entrepreneurial experience , the pay gap persists for one simple reason : employment is about demand and supply , that is , lifestyle choice ; often it is based on its own preferences , to go to property , to retire in certain public or urban areas , under pressure from hotels , sports or descendants .
in my country , Bulgaria , the pay gap between men and women stands at 25 % and 30 % , and although the overall picture in the European Union shows less difference , the fact is that women are paid less than men .
this is mostly due to economic segregation and , in such cases , the application of legislation is limited .
I therefore believe that the solution we have reached ( defining quantitative limits ) is fair and balanced and does not unduly favour any individual country .
Mr President , I welcome the report on the general arrangements for excise duty .
despite the joint efforts made by successive Presidencies since 2005 , the Council has so far been unable to reach agreement on this proposal .
with this in mind , and in view of the fact that the European Parliament has adopted the Commission &apos;s proposal , I cannot understand the reasons and factors that have led to the delay in approving the regulation .
the focus was already on the obvious problems and the alarm bell .
I agree with the opinion of the rapporteur , Mrs Hedh , that the tables should be properly presented in the media and should be placed on the websites concerned .
I also believe that the Commission has not taken due account of certain sectors that are particularly vulnerable to the current crisis in the markets and are threatened by exclusion , given the planned timetable and production unbundling up to 2013 .
in recent months , market disturbances have had a particular impact on smaller farms .
can we reform European agriculture fairly if we neglect 95 % of all farms ?
( es ) Mr President , Commissioner , we agree with the &apos; Health Check &apos; targets , but we disagree with all the measures proposed .
I regret the fact that , in the time available until 2013 , the broader picture is dispersed into the background .
the task of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) has always been to guarantee food security for all .
however , if and when the Treaty of Lisbon is adopted , Parliament will have a central role and thus have a greater role in an open , transparent debate on matters relating to the common agricultural policy , which will result in greater legitimacy for the agricultural community .
I am sure that we will be able to find a consensual solution that responds to the concerns of European farmers and agriculture , which are attentive to us .
prevention is therefore cheaper than cure .
as far as the fruit market is concerned , I understand that it creates a great many opportunities for scams , such as mandatory rules that all fruit must come from the EU .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - ( FR ) Mr President , I would like to say a few words to express my feelings regarding the final conclusions of this extremely lively and consensual debate .
I also know that , in order to be truly effective , education must focus sharply on the specific requirements of the various groups of citizens .
as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , I join in supporting the report with the above mentioned .
competition between lenders would also increase , and hence the overall efficiency of the market , because consumers with better knowledge will differentiate between different funding proposals and will be able to choose what is most suited to their needs .
our aim should be to make 600 grams of everyday consumption among people aged 11 and older .
the question is why the EU must take care of this rather than the municipalities that organise education .
in times of financial difficulties , it provides a new framework for discussions on the economy .
the average pay gap between women and men is 8.5 % , and even higher in the private sector , in favour of the latter .
the Presidency welcomed the European Central Bank &apos;s unwavering decision at the beginning of November to reduce interest rates to 50 base points and we have , on several occasions , applauded the ECB &apos;s action in response to the financial crisis and its active participation in the Eurogroup and European Council debates .
today , not only is the great economic power , but also the new economic powers to change the open world and promote European values : the value of freedom and the value of solidarity .
ladies and gentlemen , the current crisis was not caused by capitalism , but by the greed of irresponsible banks who did not want to take the risk of their actions .
secondly , we must not forget the crisis that embodies the Treaties that underpin our Union , which were reflected in the fate of the Treaty of Lisbon .
regulation and transparency are expected to prevent another financial crisis .
for several months now , European industrial organisations have been mobilising a European climate and energy strategy .
on the American continent , Madam President , it is important to support the Commission &apos;s efforts - in particular , Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner - to terminate association agreements with Central America , as well as to adopt a new direction in negotiations with the Andean Community .
in the Netherlands , for example , construction industry is facing a 20 % decline , so I think we should apply low VAT there to ensure that the European property market becomes a positive stimulus .
I have seen no evidence , Commissioner , of respect , and I speak for the great pro @-@ Commission , that it is in the legislative programme .
you see my colleague , who is also largely responsible for the response , as well as Mr McCrevy here , and they know better than anyone else that we have had to work on this from the first moment .
despite the commendable nature of the law governing these foundations , however , it is still necessary to overcome the numerous difficulties which religious communities and minorities are partly experiencing in terms of their legal status and , I must stress , continue to live through .
with regard to your situation , Mr Sonik , I have noted , and it is obvious that on behalf of all the Members of the European Parliament , we must show the greatest vigilance and support you in your actions .
( FR ) Madam President , in reply to the honourable Member , I do not bear in mind the exact figure .
in response to Mrs Doyle , this is , in my opinion , a real difficulty .
such a temporary transitional period is necessary for Member States to still be able to use such paper registration .
I have no problems with this .
against this background , we are now expected to increase the facility from EUR 12 billion to EUR 25 billion .
Commissioner , please take into account that I do not want a neighbouring country , Hungary , to be pushed into social conflict because of corrective measures - such as a measure based on objections .
it is currently working on strengthening its actions in North Kivu and encouraging it to continue its efforts in this direction .
as Parliament &apos;s rapporteur for humanitarian aid , I went to Kinshasa at the beginning of November to meet the new Minister for Social Affairs and Humanitarian Action , Botswal Lengomo .
it goes without saying that Europe must demand a stronger and better mandate and additional troops for MONUC .
the situation is clear .
without state intervention , Adam Smith will have such an invisible hand in the short term and will destroy structures that are important for shaping our common future .
as you said , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , we need a unified response from Europe and the Member States , particularly those directly affected by the crisis .
this is particularly important for suppliers , as their work is cross @-@ border .
dialogue is the only way to win the worst English of our nature .
unfortunately , many solutions have been developed in a way that does not take into account the situation of agriculture in the new Member States or the agricultural model .
it is obvious that we need Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work , in order to support strategies aimed at developing high quality , workable and accessible medical assistance for all .
in the current demographic situation , Europeans need to be reminded of the important contribution of immigration to the economic prosperity and development of the European Union .
when preparing the Blue Card , we feared , on the one hand , its abuse by third @-@ country nationals and , on the other , we hoped that new arrivals would meet the needs of our labour markets and contribute to the development of our economy .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , Member States should still decide on the right of entry of migrants on their territory , and as long as there are unemployed in the Member States , I doubt the need to promote legal immigration .
Europe must prove itself to be in favour of openness , all the more so since , according to the report , only 5.5 % of migrants come to the European Union , while 50 % of highly qualified workers are destined to the United States or Canada .
everyone recognises the need for the European Union to take advantage of the skilled workers of third countries for a longer time in order to improve its competitiveness and boost economic growth .
the European Blue Card must also be seen as a reduction in illegal immigration , part of the Pact on Immigration and Asylum , as well as part of the solution to the shortage of workers in the European Union in the coming decades .
it is therefore high time to put the stars back on ice .
this is not only an economic issue , but also a political one , because it allows us to ensure that European space activities are not regarded merely as a privilege of a few large European countries , but as one in which all 27 countries participate and benefit .
author . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on 3 December 2008 , we in Oslo will finally have the opportunity to sign the Convention banning cluster munitions .
we must deal with the issue of cluster munitions with the same intensity and commitment to make the world better and more humane , so as not to see innocent victims suffering after the armed conflict .
activation policies , for example , may prove very useful in labour markets .
will there be a new budget line to provide budgetary resources for information ?
we have supported this work on the communication package , which contains various materials , such as factual information , presentations and key messages .
moreover , many researchers will continue to be trained in ways that do not teach them the skills needed in today &apos;s knowledge @-@ based world .
thanks to this , a Europe @-@ wide debate was launched , which was the first opportunity to hold introductory discussions with academia and civil society on ethical , legal and other societal aspects of the cloning of agricultural animals .
I am very annoyed about this .
however , it also poses us with a number of problems .
we in the European Parliament are dealing with new demands for infrastructure , public services and entrepreneurship , education and social security systems .
on the other hand , if infant mortality has decreased on average across the Community to 4.7 per thousand inhabitants , there are still some Member States where this figure is 12 000 per capita .
a year ago , participants in the framework of the conference &quot; HIV in Europe 2007 &quot; developed a comprehensive call for action on how to effectively tackle HIV / AIDS in Europe .
in just one year , they spent EUR 80 @-@ 90 million , and this amount will , of course , double because we are contributing to the other .
can one sector be changed without us understanding ?
as far as ecological pollen zones are concerned , despite the fact that it seems difficult to set zones as such , I would like to remind you that financial assistance has already been given to make bee bees more effective .
beekeeping has been an important part of the economy since the previous historic times , that is , before the written word begins .
as we know , this is the first discharge to be approved for the financial perspective 2007 @-@ 2013 .
there is more in the South to distribute and control than in the North .
I cannot understand some figures , such as your findings in two new Member States , Romania and Bulgaria , which were identified in 2007 by the European Anti @-@ Fraud Office ( OLAF ) .
I thought that the excellent French Presidency would also improve the state of responsibility for the consequences , because it is here that they would have to face the consequences .
however , we must do everything to enable European Union citizens to reap the fruits of membership benefits .
this would be opposed to a previously ingrained practice whereby the same institutions closely isolated themselves against all control measures .
although European countries are among the so @-@ called &apos; cleanest &apos; countries in the 2008 corruption perceive index , these wealthy countries prefer to use illegal means , for example , to buy away from maritime companies .
that is what we are waiting for , but when we wait , we need to find other solutions .
these conditions have been very successful .
4 .
I am sorry that we lost this battle , but the war continues and we will fight ahead .
in a strategic sense , it is self @-@ deceiving , as immigrants finally take over the behaviour of Europeans ; I am thinking here of the unfortunate tendency in a society that has almost lost sight of children .
furthermore , migrants will be able to integrate periods of stay in Europe and obtain the status of a long @-@ term resident .
it has become clear in the debate that , in future , although we have only one document instead of 21 , this one document will be just as extensive as 21 individual documents .
while the British army always tries to minimise the damage to the civilian population and to limit the damage involved , we should never lose sight of the fact that we are fighting terrorist and rebel elements , who have no embarrassment whatsoever with the methods they use to indiscriminately destroy innocent lives .
we support the text of the joint motion for a resolution and hope that it marks the beginning of the European Union &apos;s serious concern about this kind of humanitarian issue , as well as its condemnation of the misuse of religious concepts on behalf of God .
where are the United States , China , Russia and the European Union , which claim to be civilised countries ?
indeed , some steps have been taken to launch a debate in the country on the usefulness of capital punishment as a means of preventing brutal crimes .
it is absolutely appalling that we are currently considering developing relations with Israel even if there are so many violations of international law , evictions of families , construction of settlements .
- Before the vote on recital D
this disease is most severely affecting Africa , which already has 33 million HIV infections .
your rapporteurs are well aware of this .
if it is given the means to carry out this task more effectively and more democratically is not distracted .
Europe wants to change everything , but not its cars .
it is absolutely clear that we need to further improve the European Union &apos;s capacity for preventive analysis and crisis management tools .
we do not only have a crisis or a lot of challenges - we also have an opportunity .
firstly , I think we are making progress .
all too often , we can see that the urgency of the situation is being acted upon and national solutions are consigned up to , then , to a European solution .
it also takes into account that Member States have different room for manoeuvre .
the plan underestimates the importance of the coordinated development of energy infrastructure as a whole and not only of green energy , as well as the coordinated development of road and rail infrastructure , which is a prerequisite for the efficient distribution of investments , and underestimates the need to address the issue of financing the agricultural sector .
I would ask the Commission and the Council to tell me what they think is a reasonable timetable for dealing with such matters .
as Mr Jouyet said earlier , the Council approved on the Commission &apos;s initiative only yesterday , if I remember correctly , at least four Commission proposals on regulating the various aspects of financial markets or services .
it is imperative that urgent measures are taken to accept the Roma socially and exploit their economic capacity in the interests of European development .
these problems should primarily be addressed by the European Union through an appropriate common policy , which requires clear legal bases .
such reform must respect the specific culture and traditions of the Roma , while linking the education system to the values of European culture and civilisation .
do you really think that the current situation contributes to peace ?
Israel , which is proud of its democratic system of government , has proved so many times to be a violation of international law by the Palestinians that the suffering of most people is in an effort to break .
they have a deeper political basis .
Mrs Fontaine gave a good overview of the urgent recommendations it contains .
the Action Plan for reducing administrative burdens targets of 25 % by 2012 .
in this regard , the question is whether the Council will formally support the European Charter for Small Enterprises and whether Member States will commit themselves to binding implementation .
if this fails , it will have to be made public by those involved who are blocking it .
notable examples of this are the Peugeot / Citroën manufacturing centre in Portugal , Mangualdes and the Renault ult ult Industrial unit in Aveiros Cacias .
I would also like to thank the secretariat of the Committee on Development , in particular Mr Van Hecken and Ms McLauchlani , and my staff Eoin Ó Seanáini and Mr O &apos;Callaghan , who were all very helpful .
if so , will there be some compensation ?
if this were to happen , it would obviously be a nonsense , and we should certainly continue our efforts .
I believe that the European Union must also make a stronger contribution to the achievement of the UN Millennium Development goal of halving hunger in the world by 2015 .
the proposed proposals also respond to the concerns and recommendations expressed in Mr Staes &apos;s report .
I am grateful to Louis Michel and I would ask him to convey my thanks to the responsible Commissioner for accepting a few amendments , but I am seriously concerned about what we have discussed here .
I assume that , despite the difficulties that have arisen , all companies managed to pre @-@ register their substances , and the first implementation phase of REACH was thus successfully completed .
I have seen a lot of them , and they do not mean that something is actually happening .
the adoption of this package of measures on climate change and energy is necessary if the European Union is to maintain its international credibility .
you , the chairs of the political groups , the rapporteurs and the chairs of the committees , wanted to meet with us and Jean @-@ Pierre Jouyet , and we all felt that the best possible condition was to try to reach an agreement by the end of the year .
therefore , the title of the legislative procedure that reached this initial agreement should not be the name of Sarkozy but the name of Sacconi .
as such , we allowed the rest of the world in Bali to find an ambitious solution to the climate change package and we should not disappoint the world .
if we cannot change that , Mr Langen , the future will be bleak .
without reducing emissions from these countries , Europe cannot solve this problem alone .
they also do not seem to be very good for the climate .
there were no 11 000 steel workers &apos; demonstrations in Brussels in order to maintain these jobs .
this is a fundamental condition for the efficient functioning of the economy and for ensuring peace of mind for our citizens .
secondly , we are about to stop oil .
it is a great honour for me to address you here today and I would like to thank you for your invitation .
that was their position .
as far as the overall incinerator is concerned , it is important that a new efficiency standard has been adopted for emissions , which must be implemented in each power plant by 2015 at the latest .
· Investing in education and research for sustainable development - without them , there could be no talk of an effective fight against climate change because they ensure adequate individual and organisational preparation ;
I remember our continent &apos;s debt to the United States for our freedom and NATO membership .
the renewed version of the Regulation on jurisdiction , applicable law , recognition and enforcement of judgments and cooperation in matters of maintenance obligations clearly sets out the criteria and situations in which the law provides for such obligations .
in writing . - ( SV ) We Swedish Social Democrats believe that these reports are a major step forward towards a more successful prevention of tax evasion .
these small businesses are the economic wagon in West Ireland .
over the last two decades , the countries have made major changes with a clear aim of becoming a member of the European Union .
this case is one of many cases aimed at restricting freedom of expression in that country .
we are pleased that the problem has been solved , but we need to know how it has happened so that we can avoid it in the future .
the next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003 / 88 / EC on certain aspects of the organisation of working time ( rapporteur : Alejandro Cercas ) ( 10597 / 2 / 2008 - C6 @-@ 0324 / 2008 - .
let me also congratulate the Presidency of the Council because it is well aware that the previous seven presidencies have avoided this issue , and great skill needs to be gained so far .
after all , ministers agree on a maximum weekly working week of 48 hours in the EU .
the second objective is on @-@ call time , which cannot be regarded as inactive working hours , but must be considered as working time in full , just as it is right to protect the right of medical staff to a compensatory rest period .
we , as European Social Democrats , will continue to protect workers in any case , because , more than ever , Europe needs a social model that responds to the needs of the most vulnerable citizens , particularly those most affected by the economic and financial crisis .
let us get to work .
the social dialogue and the European Parliament must make a clear distinction .
this concerns , in particular , rules aimed at preventing stranglehold because of small parts , which pose a serious threat to children and which will now be more effectively avoided .
therefore , Commissioner , I very much expect the Commission to make very clear statements on these three issues and we in Parliament will keep an eye on this .
if only the same would be possible for other products .
we must do everything at all costs to prevent accidents which are avoidable and which , no matter what , we must hear from time to time .
if countries are given greater freedom , they will be able to take advantage of these opportunities .
finally , I would like to mention the issue raised by Mr Beaupuy , which is that the Member States can do an enormous amount , for example by making a statement on financial management or taking political responsibility for the use of the funds .
afterwards , they received a letter and realised that they had themselves failed to conclude an agreement that obliges them to pay them around EUR 1 000 over three years .
the Commission considers that work on this issue should continue to be based solely on technical criteria and therefore believes that procedural rules should , in any case , continue to ensure a high level of safety and efficiency .
you are familiar with the story , having chaired a working group that was quite rightly felt that the assistants &apos; Statute is an important issue .
the opening up of markets and efforts to bring private and foreign capital to the Indian aviation market are considered part of the measures necessary for the development and modernisation of the Indian aviation sector in order to meet growing demand and consumer expectations .
as a result , we should ensure a holistic and common approach in the various related policy areas ( including cohesion , the environment , maritime affairs , social affairs ) .
furthermore , before the appointment , the Directorate will be asked to make a statement before the competent ( s ) committee of the European Parliament and to answer questions raised by its members ( Article 10 ) .
the introduction of technical requirements for intra @-@ Community vehicles , lorries and buses offers effective means of combating pollution .
this report raises awareness that fewer companies would be victims of fraud by encouraging EU countries to tighten their national laws and ensuring that existing EU law on misleading advertising and unfair commercial practices is properly enforced .
I think we never give up the schedule or three times the 20 targets , but everyone here must understand that countries such as the new Member States of the East , where heavy industry has been a victim of the transition from the Communist system to the market economy , were agreed to maintain equality as a basis for 2005 , even if they had reason to demand the introduction of another reference year , for example in the 1990s .
we have always supported this Treaty in the European Commission and we have reason to think that , by taking time to listen to the concerns of our Irish friends , we would jointly be able to find the elements of a solution .
Mr President , last week , the German weekly newspaper der Spiegel published your portfolio entitled &apos; All President &apos; .
secondly , Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , Mr Watson , I myself , Mr Pöttering and Mr Crowley participated in the Prague Castle .
you are a decent , tolerant and nice person in private life ; when you meet another person or , for example , in the lunch , you understand his arguments .
it is clear from the results of the G20 summit that global efforts are also needed to relaunch the global economy .
however , part of the package is unsatisfactory and it is not as strong as it should be .
he certainly cannot be criticised for this .
Mr Nassauer , thank you for your support , both as an experienced MEP and as a German MEP .
President Sarkozy has been a very self @-@ confident leader .
( FR ) Mr President , governance also means thinking about the future .
I would just like to point out here that , if these dictates are so important , it is worth summarising the courage , learning my lesson and bringing it to the end .
the last word is linked to the deepening of political relations with Israel , which is being discussed in the Council hastily .
I am also absolutely convinced of this .
in Europe , however , this mixture of social regression and fear has always opened the door to fascism . &quot;
I still remember the debate on renewable energy , heating and cooling , and all the problems we discussed .
finally , we also secured industry , which creates new jobs for two million Europeans and research in green technologies , so I am still particularly proud today .
however , these cultures represent only 2 % of Europe &apos;s current agricultural production .
thank you , Mr President .
this gives us a good incentive to experiment with this transitional technology .
the main objective of climate policy is to achieve a synchronous , universal agreement .
however , I feel that most of the problems faced by Member States in relation to the Emissions Trading Directive were properly resolved and the end result is fair and that the European Union can commit itself to a genuine mission in the fight against climate change .
overall , this directive fills an important gap and , despite all its shortcomings , it is still an extremely important directive .
it is in these countries that pastures are fed in very sustainable terms , namely herring .
finally , on an issue which , according to the rapporteur , is not perfect or ideal for ever , but which , according to the eight leading academics in science , is probably inevitable , we have a consensus on 300 million tonnes , or at least on its financial equivalent , which should enable us to create dozens of demonstration projects , as Commissioner Dimas or indeed the entire Commission wanted .
we are disappointed that many other good points included by the Commission have gone missing during the negotiations , including stronger accountability and monitoring , transport and the exclusion of improved oil production .
as I said just now , this is where this legislation has been greatly improved .
firstly , and most sincerely , I must thank all those who worked on this report , including , among others , the French Presidency &apos;s delegation .
he swept down decades of pressure .
( RO ) I would like to congratulate Guido Sacconi on his report , which is extremely important from an economic and social point of view , a fact that is also confirmed by the European Economic Recovery Plan .
I say this personally , because I was in Poznań three days ago .
the Commission confirms that the 2 % reductions referred to in Article 7a ( 2 ) ( b ) and ( c ) are not binding and that their non @-@ binding approach will be addressed during the review .
I hope that this will not last until the hours of the morning .
finally , I would like to warmly thank the shadow rapporteurs , particularly Brigitte Fouréd , who worked with me in the sense that we set up a good team to improve this text , as well as my other fellow Members in the Commission , Luigi Coclovot , Eva Lichtenberger and other colleagues .
of course , but this is also due , on the one hand , to the policy of prevention and , on the other , to repression by Member States and , in fact , to the European Union , which has so far been unable to ensure that there is a common road safety policy .
I therefore support Amendment 38 tabled by Mrs Lichtenberger , which strengthens the Commission text in certain aspects .
thank you for your good cooperation and I wish you all the best .
once again , I would like to thank everyone who agreed to waive parliamentary rights in this procedure .
its adoption at first reading shows the green light for reform on two urgent issues : increasing the coverage level and speeding up the reimbursement of savings .
the first is the fight against climate change ; the Council &apos;s conclusions are modest , but at least some conclusions have been drawn ; investments must be made this year and increased in 2010 .
here .
secondly , the whole history of budgets shows that the statutory ceilings , the Gramm @-@ Rudman @-@ Holsi law in the United States , are one percent rule - that is all stupid .
political changes are therefore needed to transform our economic model , to halt the collapse of production structures and to counteract the deterioration of the negative social and climatic effects currently occurring .
given the current situation , this budget does not correspond to the wishes of many Members and does not reflect , for example , the need to combat an increasing economic crisis or to fund new technologies that are used to improve the environment and combat climate change .
rapporteur . - Mr President , as rapporteur , I wanted to speak before voting on my report , but I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak now , because it is in all our interests that the Minutes should be marked by a few things .
as far as his health is concerned , he sees a little better .
this is the same basis for our future , and I must be honest , regardless of our potential friendly feelings and proximity to all the people here , and to say that the positions of the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Parliament and of the Council of Europe have not always been based on human rights principles , and the Sakharov Prize and the comments made here are a kind of repeated guide , but also require other , practical decisions .
as a result of this decision , most of the money will go out of the European Union in the form of clean development mechanisms , while our own legislation contains too many exceptions and flexibility mechanisms , but too little coercion .
working in the European Parliament has shown me how difficult it is to reach a compromise , which is why I regret that the European Parliament has rejected the Council &apos;s common position .
it can be said at the moment that we have been lucky that the EU has decided not to transfer its entire economy directly to Asia .
our efforts to combat climate change must be accompanied by the objective of producing clear legislation to ensure economic planning .
it covers important areas , including construction and transport .
it is essential to maintain jobs and create preconditions for economic development , particularly in the current economic and financial crisis .
the implementation of the 48 @-@ hour opt @-@ out clause and the non @-@ respect of working time on @-@ call time risk creating a two @-@ speed mobile Europe where some workers have social protection in their Member States , but others have nothing but to agree to lower social rights .
countries that do not meet such requirements will not be accepted among the members .
it is absurd for citizens outside their home country to take a patronising approach to the traffic rule on speeding , drink driving , failing to wear a seat belt or failing to comply with the red lights , without imposing the appropriate penalty .
today , we awarded the Sakharov Prize to Hu Jia , who is fighting for human rights and the environment in China .
since you mentioned this , I would like to focus in particular on the important role that the European Union is taking action on the ground .
I would like to say a special word of thanks to Mr Jouyet , whose cordience , professionalism and skills have been unanimously valued here in Parliament .
I am particularly vigilant about respect for fundamental rights and , above all , respect for children &apos;s rights when Member States , as I said , implement the returns Directive .
accession to their feet is a sacred duty . &quot;
they come from countries where everyone is in a dangerous situation , so this part of the report makes little sense .
law @-@ abiding European citizens deserve to be aware that their own rights are protected against people who wish to attack them .
the instigation of fundamental rights , human rights and privacy is not the way to combat terrorism effectively .
the volume of VAT fraud in the European Union stands at around EUR 200 billion and 250 billion .
thanks to this , I have the opportunity to say publicly that the mother tongue of European immigrants is a property that must be kept .
it must be carried out with the flexibility offered by the Pact , while maintaining and complying with the procedures it establishes at the same time , and this is a serious challenge .
if you are not present , the question will be sidelined and it will remain unanswered . &quot;
vocational education at all levels is the future of Europe , the future of each Member State ; it is the forefront of creativity and productivity , and these are , in turn , leading to progress and innovation .
let us not leave future generations out of this money .
we , the guardians of European political responsibility , must respond jointly to this situation , respecting the dignity and fundamental rights of migrants .
as such , it should not only respect the EU &apos;s fundamental values but also promote them in its work , particularly in the area of migration and freedom of movement .
currently 80 % of these illegal border crossings are actually carried out by smugglers and ruthless fraudsters .
consumers are all too often aware of the scale and impact of the problem .
what is more , we would be pleased if you were to stick to this noble ambition , because it is still a major and indeed growing problem .
there is no doubt that this is extremely important for businesses .
otherwise , it is true that the Commission proposed criminal law in 2006 and we have the support of the European Parliament , but the Council has not yet taken up the adoption of these laws .
this is something that is not a recession in the European Union .
the e @-@ Justice environment is here in Parliament , and certainly also in the Committee on Legal Affairs , in line with an issue that has been close to our heart for a long time , that is , access to justice and how we give cross @-@ border access to justice .
however , this freedom of movement has only been partially realised at the moment and , as you know , we have , of course , set out new measures alongside the existing instruments , and I am currently working on them .
in the same way , additional efforts are also required from Member States to make effective use of the funds currently available .
as Chair of the Committee on Petitions , I have noted how often citizens of the European Union are not aware of their rights and , on the contrary , how they sometimes believe that they can intervene in matters where they do not have the right to intervene .
this is because , even beyond the steps we have taken as appropriate , for example , with regard to security , criminal law and the fight against terrorism , we are now appealing to those who need rules and dispute resolution that apply throughout Europe , because they live by definition in their own country , but also elsewhere , because they work and have relations with people throughout Europe .
however , a knowledge @-@ based economy needs an increasingly skilled workforce .
there is no doubt that we need a qualified majority in the final vote if we want to call on the Commission to act legally , but I do not understand why we should have a qualified majority for the amendments as well .
however , I must say that the report is balanced because it deals with a number of painful areas , including lack of cooperation , or I should say sabotage in third countries such as Libya and Turkey .
in fact , regions where farming conditions are difficult and infrastructure leaves a lot to be desired are becoming increasingly depopulated .
in the area of university education , I support the need to modernise studies so that they meet current and future socio @-@ economic requirements .
vocational education and training have a large part of Europe &apos;s efforts to address the social challenges of ageing societies and to reorganise the current position in the global economy and to tackle the economic crisis .
the content of the document covers financial transactions , as well as public registers and other official documents such as this .
President Mugabe &apos;s radical radical attitude a few years ago , when he had never been able to renew agricultural land ownership and allowed the Gulf of rich and poor to continue to exist , was mainly intended to find new supporters among the young generation and avoid further expropriation of old turrants .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , I am grateful to all the Members of the European Parliament who made an urgent request for assistance for Zimbabwe , as Zimbabwe is facing an unprecedented crisis and the situation is getting worse and worse - no sector has access .
this letter also announced the interruption of payments from the budget aid programmes from 1 January 2009 , as well as the opening of the consultation period with the Nicaraguan authorities concerning the current situation and methods for restructuring cooperation between Europe and that country .
human rights and freedom are the most important foundations of the European Union and must also support our dialogue with Russia .
the debate is closed .
four and a half years have passed and the citizens of the new Member States are still feeling second @-@ class citizens .
I , too , am an example of the fact that , today , there are no aggression against Germany in the Czech Republic , because I , as a German citizen , have been elected to represent the European Parliament in the Czech Republic .
we see again and again how some politicians and non @-@ governmental organisations take quite an exaggerated position on gender equality .
this is not only an environmental and consumer protection milestone in Europe , but I think it is also an extraordinary moment for Europe .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen , and I particularly congratulate our two rapporteurs , Mrs Klaß and Mrs Breyer , who were excellent negotiators for finding a compromise with the Council .
children of users and , in particular , of farmers , are also affected .
many horticultural specialists feared that these crops would be endangered as a result of these regulations , but fortunately this fear has proved to be in vain .
Madam President , I have heard a lot of talk in this debate about science , but what kind of science is it , which does not use a proper impact assessment ?
I would like to make a few more points to you on this .
we must have more facts and not a fiction , and we must certainly be based on these facts .
in my opinion , we have before us a balanced text that prohibits the use of certain harmful pesticides , but does not harm European agriculture .
and it is precisely that we are concerned about the tendency that constitutes an institutional shift and that the European Commission has decided no longer to contribute to the so @-@ called Community map , but strictly to the intergovernmental map , that confirms our desire to negotiate the Action Plan , to present it to you and to ensure that the next Transport Commissioner explicitly commit herself to follow up on this road map .
author . - ( NL ) Madam President , Commissioner , it is very regrettable that Mrs Kroes cannot be here this evening because of the accident .
investments of this kind would ideally be made and developed together , which is why private and public broadcasters will be able to provide content jointly on the platform , and competition should arise at the level of content , so that the customer can derive maximum benefit from this .
( DE ) Mr President , public service broadcasters are more than an economic factor .
1 .
indeed , although global food production must increase , the share of development aid devoted to agriculture has been steadily declining since the 1980s .
written statements ( Rule 142 )
agriculture , education , health and transport - the most important areas for Europe &apos;s economic development and the quality of life of European citizens - must benefit from specific public policies .
meanwhile , I would like to thank the European Parliament for having expressed its support for our approach through this report .
such a result is very welcome for EU fund markets , which have recently experienced a number of difficult problems .
security is improving .
at the time , the single currency was criticised by many politicians and scientists , not to mention a considerable number of central bankers who felt that the Economic and Monetary Union cannot and must not be formed and , if it were to happen , the single currency is weak and unfuture .
we expect new members to join .
as Jacques Delors said , the euro could be a shield for the whole of Europe , but so far it has not sufficiently stimulated the European economy .
4 .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to say that this report is excellent .
however , the fifth and most important point is that Latvia &apos;s voice is heard in Europe and the voice of Europe in the world .
this will enable the Baltic States to gradually integrate the single European energy market .
in my opinion , this is a very reasonable package , which is why I am happy to support and congratulate the rapporteur .
however , the achievement of this objective - more specifically , the recognition of cooperation and each other &apos;s certification findings in the areas of airworthiness and maintenance - is in addition to the normal contracts , where such measures are normally concluded separately by non @-@ binding agreements at the level of the Civil Aviation Authority .
in writing . - The sustainable provision of food supplies is one of our biggest problems .
we also agree with the report &apos;s call to make the Council more open , so that civil society can participate meaningfully in the dialogue .
furthermore , I am not in favour of spending EU money on promoting the Lisbon Treaty through civil society dialogue or other instruments .
I agree with the rapporteur and congratulate him on his final report .
I am also convinced that it is right to minimise animal testing and only to do so if indispensable ; and that the use of alternative methods should be promoted so as not to cause unnecessary suffering for animals .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
if we want a more efficient border control system , then it is high time that biometric data becomes a functional part of this system .
in the case of border countries such as Bulgaria , which are subject to strong pressure from migration flows and international organised crime , it is essential to introduce new standards quickly and successfully in order to protect the European Union &apos;s external borders .
quite honestly , I have to say that it varies from one country to another .
it will also be possible to see whether they are participating in committees ; there are protocols for all of them that all citizens have access to .
the negotiations will lead to the most acceptable decision for all parties involved .
only if we achieve the right level of transparency will our actions become more understandable and therefore closer to citizens .
you will vote on the proposal for a directive on public procurement of defence and security equipment , which was presented by the Commission in December 2007 as part of the so @-@ called &apos; defence package &apos; .
it is a free market , as is the case for many things , now for defence @-@ related products , in other words weapons ; weapons are for slaughter and war .
over the last ten years , the Eurogroup has been very successful and other countries have expressed an interest in joining it , especially in the recent crisis .
the Commission considers that the biggest obstacle to the development of financial systems for the most disadvantaged people is not a lack of money , but institutional and technical failure .
we know what we need to do .
given the bomb attacks in Madrid and London in 2004 and 2005 , it is clear that in the European Union , we are threatened with similar assaults .
( DE ) Do you believe that knowledge of local circumstances and regional rules should be one of the preconditions for such professions to operate ?
but , as I said , a balance must be struck and people should be aware of what this balance should be .
medicines are subject to strict supervision and therefore cannot bring something that is obsolete onto the market .
they should obtain properly verified scientific information on their medicines from a secure source .
there have also been accidents with ordinary consumers , even though they have fewer accidents .
I hope that all my colleagues will inform their national parliament and the government so that this convention can be ratified as soon as possible .
the first tasks are to revise the Directive on capital adequacy for investment firms and credit institutions , to finalise the negotiations on the Insurance Directive , to the regulation on the activities of rating agencies and to the directive on e @-@ money institutions .
together , in these six months , we can show Europeans why the European Union is so vital now .
this parliamentary term began with the Dutch Presidency headed by Mr Balkenende , and no one will remember what he said here and what we answered .
we have a particular request to you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office ; we ask you to put your colleagues at the heart of the Spring European Council the target of binding commitments to reduce energy consumption by 20 % by 2020 , that was the Tuhkatriinu energy package last year , and to review your priorities by assessing less superficial decisions on renewable energy adopted in December .
this is a multi @-@ layered problem , and I certainly do not want to judge who is currently a short @-@ term culprit , because in our view , in the opinion of the European Union and the countries of Europe , both are now guilty , both of Russia and of Ukraine .
an increasing number of us , the peoples of Europe , are now becoming dissidents in Brussels .
apart from the occasional comments made by the Eurosceptics - which we are familiar with from your own country - you have our support .
( applause )
it is not only wrong ; it is a source of hostile disapproval , and it is a breach of trust .
I would like to start by recalling the meeting of the Polish @-@ Czech underground opposition , organised 21 years ago by Giant Mounke mountains on the Polish @-@ Czech border .
I apologise to those honourable Members who do not answer the specific questions that have been asked ; I will try to generalise this debate a little and rather shed light on the general approach to resolve these particular problems .
( sustained applause )
the Czech Presidency &apos;s plan signals the continued intensification of anti @-@ grassroots attacks by the EU in order to shift the effects of the capitalist crisis on the working classes and poor grassroots classes , the growing aggression of the EU against the people and its capacity for military intervention worldwide .
Mr President , I was pleased to add my strong support to the Coelho report on the biometrics of passports in the EU because , if nothing else , this is a first step in the fight against the very high @-@ level abuse and falsification of passports .
moreover , there is another fundamental right that is missing from this report , namely the right of people , such as the right of some nationalities to feel at home and safely in their own country , to defend their hard @-@ won welfare , to preserve their own language , their culture , their traditions and their laws .
let us now proceed with the explanations of vote on the Cappato report , having already listened to Mr Mitchell .
in writing . - The European defence procurement market is highly fragmented , having an adverse impact on the economy .
it notes that the recommendations made by this Parliament in the report on extradition procedures for the CIA in the EU ( February 2007 ) have not yet been implemented by Member States and EU institutions .
this report therefore receives my full support because respect for all people and their fundamental rights is a fundamental part of the Green policy , regardless of gender , age , nationality or socio @-@ economic background .
anyone who is familiar with the secret hysteria of the European Commission , the European Parliament and the European Council has no doubt that the search for access to information by the institutions of the European Union is a loophole full of routes for ordinary citizens .
this gives cause for great concern .
examples show that there is a Quartet and one of the European Union &apos;s potential tasks would be to mediate such a dialogue .
after all , a ceasefire or a temporary ceasefire for Hamas and comrades are only a fervent evil in a holy war against Israel .
there is only one political solution to this conflict .
we are here today to demand a ceasefire and an end to the massacre of civilians .
perhaps it was the case that the people of Gaza , full of chlords and well equipped , could have devoted all their attention to complaining of emotions in order to smuggle increasingly lethal weapons to be used against Israeli civilians .
I hope that the resolution accompanying this debate will receive strong votes tomorrow in plenary , and I hope that it will give the Commission and the Council the strength to put pressure on both Israel and Hamas to stop killing .
I believe that the Israeli response has been disproportionate in recognition of the fact that Hamas launched rocket attacks against Israel .
I would at least like to give you the last information , which I have received and which is in news , which says that the sources close to negotiations in Egypt indicate that Hamas is acting according to the latest proposals made by Egypt .
I know that in some countries that do not face such a tense problem , the situation is perhaps different , at least in terms of pr .
we can sincerely give a full answer to where gas goes : no cubic metre goes in the other direction so that we do not notice it .
unfortunately , the passive attitude of Europe has helped Putin to achieve its objective .
Ukraine is currently obliged to pay USD 500 million a year to one interchange company .
alternative energy sources and new technologies reduce our dependence on imports of raw materials and energy .
I am here for the first time , and perhaps I spent too long on the introduction , which I contributed to the delay .
in writing . - ( PL ) There has been much talk in today &apos;s debate about gas supplies and links , connections and the dependency of European economies .
in writing . - Russia blocked gas supplies to European consumers at an extremely inappropriate time and it is imperative that supplies of gas are restored without additional interference .
you can therefore be sure that our Presidency is interested in continuing to be fully committed to a balanced , ambitious and comprehensive agreement on the Doha Development Round of the WTO negotiations .
it also increases food insecurity in general , which encourages conflict and migration .
on 29 August , Birtukan Midekssa , leader of a political party with a seat in parliament , was arrested again and sentenced to life imprisonment for refusing to state publicly that he had demanded the pardon he and many other opposition political leaders who were detained since the 2005 elections to be released in 2007 .
Somaliland was taken into account in 1960 after its thoughtless withdrawal from a short period of independence , but it again created a Gulf after Siad Barre &apos;s death in 1991 .
finally , we are ready to fully develop the European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) and the Eastern Partnership for Belarus .
the forthcoming gas negotiations with Russia could give additional horror to this simulation .
- ( SK ) Although positive progress has been made in Belarus , we must maintain a very close relationship with representatives of the Belarusian opposition and our new friend Alexander Milinkevich .
this is a great shame , and we deeply regret this fact .
it is therefore totally unacceptable that the guilty parties and those accused of this crime are still in freedom .
when Srebrenica happened , because there was not enough European spirit there , we should do everything in our power to help that country on the right track .
however , we should go further .
how can we prove these developments ?
given the very poor level of implementation of the current rules and the stress associated with long journeys , even if proper rest stops are considered , particularly in the case of horses , does the Commission intend to impose a definitive limitation on absolute travel time on the basis of the necessary and scientific evidence ?
( RO ) The new Member States - and I refer in particular to my country of origin , Romania - need support , as has already been expressed here , in strengthening the powers of the authorities responsible for ensuring that the regulation on the transport of animals discussed today is applied .
concerning the specific question asked by a Member of the European Parliament about the request to place the Mediterranean diet on UNESCO World Heritage Label , Commissioner &apos;s predecessor , Markos Kyprianou , raised this issue at the Council &apos;s Agriculture Council meeting in July 2007 .
( PL ) Mr President , it is better to eat healthily and to avoid diseases than to carry out even the most effective modern treatment .
the crux of the matter is not really linked to gender equality , it relates to the fairness of the Member States , who think they have signed one Treaty and then discover that in the courts , it is interpreted by judges who give meaning to it , which was certainly not intended .
our presence does not stop , but extends the friendship and the suffering that it entails .
in particular , the rapporteur stresses that many Member States had incorrectly transposed the concept of discrimination into their legal systems .
Europe must face up to its responsibilities and demand a clear end to Israel &apos;s aggression and make efforts to find a viable and long @-@ term solution .
we should not have any illusions about Belarus and we should not hesitate to stop dialogue if the situation deteriorates .
she defended the rights of Iranian women and children by fighting to change secession and heritage laws .
something must change in Iran .
when the powers of the National Assembly ended two years ago , parliamentary elections were not declared .
I call on the Kenyan authorities to stop their plans for censorship in order to reach a consensus in order to strengthen freedom of the press and the public sector .
more specifically , I would like to ask whether the Battisti question could be placed on the agenda as a matter of urgency .
( el ) Mr President , we have recently heard and read , and have also seen how civilians are bombed and children killed .
Mr President , two and a half years ago , I learned that the European Commission was instituting a procedure against Denmark at the European Court of Justice , as Denmark set a 2 % limit for hydrogened fats in food .
the storm has broken down some 30 to 40 million crhumetres of trees .
( PL ) I would like to say that , listening to the last Doha debate in Kataris , I had the impression that developing countries think that we , the developed countries , have tried them .
once again , I would like to congratulate you on the measures that you proposed for access , free trade , financial resources and the environment .
in this case , it is not about promoting barriers to trade .
we also met cases where there was insufficient transparency , and we certainly need a stronger coordination mechanism to deal with the crisis .
of course , we started research .
Mrs Laperrouze subsequently recommended diversification of energy sources and routes for supply .
I call on the Commission and the Member States to invest in modernising Europe &apos;s energy network , in supporting energy efficiency and in producing energy from renewable sources .
I therefore call on everyone to express their support for this proposal in the vote in a few days &apos; time .
secondly , as far as lighting is concerned , I believe that we can move forward and withdraw the most inefficient lights from the market , and this should also be the case with office and street lights .
I hope that Member States will be able to reconsider the issue of closed reactors on the basis of objective criteria .
Madam President , I would like to draw attention to the words that are often used in this debate , &apos; intelligent &apos; and &apos; smart &apos; , because these solutions , which should reduce energy consumption in our homes , obviously do not work and are not intelligent or intelligent .
the stricter winter , the more secure the Russian Federation is to halt gas supplies to European countries .
this is a rather horrific expression , and there is no doubt that very few people in Germany are interested in this issue , despite the fact that it is one of the most important issues in the coming years .
let us now come back to the issue of wilderness : Europe is densely populated and only 1 @-@ 2 % of the territory has remained untouched by human activity .
this sector is also very diverse .
we are dealing with this subject and I very much hope to work closely with Members of the European Parliament as well .
to sum up , I would like to say that this is a solution that benefits everyone : society , citizens , public authorities , businesses , innovators and the European economy .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Mr President , the 2006 Europol report on organised crime claims that the benefits offered by the Internet in terms of information and communication technologies are very useful for organised crime .
above all , we must be vigilant about the constant challenge posed to us by the use of new online technologies - online cameras , mobile phones and , in particular , the Internet itself - in this regard .
we must promote public awareness and Internet security , particularly among children , but also among parents , so that they know exactly what is happening on the Internet and what can be done there .
given that access to pornographic material and dissemination do not depend on time or place , I welcome the timely proposal to set up a special unit for dealing with child pornography and child prostitution at European level and propose that Member States and the Commission support information and awareness raising campaigns .
we must therefore remember paedophiles and Internet forums and their attraction as criminal offences .
thank you .
( DE ) Madam President , the hope of receiving a paid job arouses a strong interest worldwide .
it is vile and it is not helpful .
it is therefore important to establish mechanisms to help exploited workers to lodge complaints against employers personally or through a third party .
this measure is therefore timely .
Member States should work more closely to combat illegal immigration by strengthening action against illegal employment at Member State level in the European Union .
however , they were rejected .
we must therefore recognise every step towards cooperation between the EU and Russia at different levels and in different forms .
that is why it is a humiliation that needs support and sensible regulations .
full exploitation is impossible due to the border issue of Malta and its neighbours in North Africa .
I hope that solidarity mechanisms do not allow the market to be distorted or overly burdensome .
this commitment must be taken into account more specifically in national social protection and pension policies .
these proposals , based on their common sense , aim to protect the most vulnerable members of our society .
this also applies to media stations , which should be customary and based on moral values and not attack the right of a young person to blame .
it is appalling because our behaviour is worse than that of others , such as Barack Obama , who publicly state that , despite all the risks they take , despite opposition from the army , there is symbolic power , despite opposition from the United States , because there are also people who say that &apos; leave them to Guantánamo , they do not bring them here , &apos; who say so despite opposition , there is a greater risk &apos; , there is a symbolic power , resulting from the fact that the new President will return to respect for human rights and fundamental rights , including those who have not shown any respect for fundamental rights and human rights themselves .
our fears are justified , as according to the Pentagon figures , 61 former detainees who were denied all charges are allegedly involved in terrorist activities .
we must also ask the Member States and the European institutions what they have done to implement the recommendations that this Parliament adopted in February 2007 and , as appropriate , to explain why they have not implemented them .
in addition , internal investigations have also not been supported by the charges .
they must confirm the status of each prisoner before making a formal request to transport the prisoners to an EU Member State .
I hope for Mrs Ferrero @-@ Waldner &apos;s efforts to achieve a rapid result in the negotiations under way .
it is shocking that the reception situation in Lampedusa needs to be rediscussed in this way .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Europe must decide whether it wants regulated immigration or invasion and the criminal exploitation of illegal immigrants ?
in its opinion of 28 October 2008 , the Council &apos;s Legal Service confirmed that restrictive procurement measures aimed at promoting domestic industry are incompatible with the general principles of the EC Treaty .
the next threat identified is cyber attacks and various attempts to attack and block the Internet .
could you describe the current state of play with regard to this level of cooperation , and are you particularly pleased that this level of cooperation is good and strong enough ?
despite the efforts of some Andean Community countries to overcome this impasse , the Commission could only state that there was no longer any consensus on the way forward with the negotiations .
given that family carers are , and will be , an integral and indispensable part of our social welfare and health care in the future , could the Commission present what specifically has been done in developing policies aimed at responding to such problems , particularly in terms of greater support for family carers ?
the adoption of the Framework Decision against racism and xenophobia on 28 November is another example .
only today , as part of this process , the government approved an amendment to the Education Law , ensuring that geographical names are printed in workshops in minority schools in Hungarian or Ukrainian .
I would like to launch a slogan : &apos; there is no use and no benefit in doing it &apos; .
it is unfair , but I would say to Mr Pīīīle that it is also self @-@ defeating , it must be welcomed by all people in his country to overcome difficulties and fears .
as international negotiations become more intense , the Commission adopted a communication last week setting out the Commission &apos;s views on the most important elements of the negotiations .
banks and donors must take risks to support start @-@ ups implementing green technologies .
we can talk about this because the European Parliament showed itself to be one of the fastest @-@ reacting institutions by setting up a targeted instrument - a temporary committee tasked with collecting data and ideas on a subject that affects us all and with the impact that we must face both now and in the future .
in order to survive and develop , mankind needs new powerful energy sources , and Europe needs balance and independence in terms of its energy supply .
the bilateral negotiations between the two countries - Poland and Denmark , the COP 14 and COP 15 - are not sufficient .
these initiatives must be implemented effectively , because we will be able to successfully regulate industry and consumption once we have fulfilled our own duties .
another hopeful fact is the change in the United States this year , as many of you have mentioned .
they help solve the climate crisis and , at the same time , boost the economy by creating new jobs .
there was a separate paragraph in it that Dawit Isaak should be released .
I would ask you and other organisations to support your efforts in all areas .
Kaamera was not with me , but with General Morillon and then with Mr Grosch .
Madam President , I abstained on this important issue in the European Parliament .
however , this ambiguity shows that we should , for example , take the first steps to block carbon leakage into the atmosphere .
according to the Commission , between 4.5 and 8 million third @-@ country nationals residing illegally in the European Union , who are good targets for unscrupulous employers who profit from illegal labour .
we need to build an appropriate transmission infrastructure , create support mechanisms for countries that do not have raw materials supplies and diversify their energy sources .
honourable Members , thank you for your attention and I look forward to your questions .
I am pleased that security forces were recently established in Kosovo and that members of the Serbian community belong to the Kosovo police .
Mr President , international rushing to recognise Kosovo was , in my opinion , difficult to understand .
in turn , the Commission is committed to providing a rapid response in cases where it is asked to react .
however , both manufacturers and suppliers need additional credit to finance their business activities and consumers need it if they have to finance the purchase of cars .
it is therefore a very good news and hope that the Czech Presidency will announce here today a new initiative ahead of the forthcoming Spring Summit , namely the proposal to implement a measure across Europe that will provide a very powerful incentive to buy clean cars .
American cars do not really play a role in the European market , with European cars playing a major role in the US market .
the 1995 decision is a decision between Member States which reflects the fact that consular assistance and protection are the sole responsibility of the state and that consular relations are primarily regulated by the Vienna Convention on consular Relations .
so I fully understand what you are considering carefully and to which you are so critical .
therefore , despite the fact that no conclusions could be drawn at the end of 2008 , the Council is fully committed to the multilateral trade system , as well as to achieving an ambitious , balanced and comprehensive outcome of the WTO Doha Round .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - In conclusion to this rather unusual evening debate , my mother also smoked during pregnancy , and here I am now , Deputy Prime Minister of the Czech Republic , and my brothers and sisters are also very well @-@ placed .
how much do we have to pay insurance bills before we realise that environmental and climate protection is not a burden , but an investment in the future ?
since we have been talking about mostly influential and helpful funds , I would also like to ask the Commission about specific projects that would actually be able to implement preventive mechanisms for such incidents , so at least in the future we will no longer have to lose lives .
thirdly , what kind of risk analysis and self @-@ control scheme called for by the Food hygiene Regulation , based on HACCP ?
it seems to me that we need to encourage the bottom up that such action will not happen again in the future .
firstly , in order to adapt Annex 3 to scientific and technical progress , the Commission and its services will provide for the revision of this annex to be adapted to feed materials and compound fodder .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the Commissioner and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on their excellent work and on the good cooperation we have had .
our food is characterised by recognised reputation and quality .
this policy responds to the real need for Member States to promote the image of their agricultural products , particularly in terms of quality , nutritional value and the benefits of food safety standards , both for European consumers and for consumers in other countries .
( RO ) First of all , I would like to congratulate my colleague on all the efforts he has made as rapporteur to simplify EU legislation in order to reduce administrative costs , which we very much need to do .
we should take this opportunity to discuss communication here in Parliament in order to create a link - how to improve the opportunities to make it visible and understandable .
we are now in a global economic situation with a global economic downturn , with the first blessing of protectionism from the developing world , particularly the United States and , I hope , not the European Union .
we are already accustomed to the fact that a majority in Parliament affirms resolutions without legislative consequences , content which goes against the legislative resolutions that it has approved .
it also means taking a firm stance in the negotiations on trade facilitation procedures in order to reduce customs formalities which may represent up to 15 % of the value of traded goods , as well as the costs of registering goods and modernised customs administrations .
although Article 36 ( 1 ) of the Cotonou Agreement maintains the conclusion of &apos; compatible trade agreements with the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , which progressively remove barriers to trade between them and enhance cooperation in all areas relevant to trade &apos; , what the EU intends to do now is go beyond what has not yet been achieved in the WTO , while at the same time reducing public development assistance .
as regards the social and environmental impact , there is clearly a lack of preparation on the part of Chinese industry and it requires a greater European stimulus .
since the Sri Lankan Government is in a position to make ends in the situation and the internationally recognised authority in the country , our call must necessarily and logically go primarily to them .
such atrocities as the bombing of the PTK hospital make the situation much worse and more dangerous .
in short , we are dealing with an unacceptable situation , which , above all , does not have grounds for reality .
Brazilian refusal to extradite Cesare Battisti ( vote )
Mr President , my group - the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance - has tabled a resolution that is supported by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and by a large part of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament .
there is also now a new US Administration which is currently defining its foreign policy priorities .
this question must therefore be taken seriously .
this aggression is part of a strategy to overcome the legitimate opposition of the Palestinian people to the occupation and to undermine the conditions necessary for the reconstruction of the Palestinian State .
however , without military capability and credibility , we are like cogs that grade worse than toothless .
we have given a total of EUR 311 million to Chad under the 10th European Development Fund .
I believe that this is a fundamental issue and I believe that this is a concrete message from the European Union , not only to its immediate neighbours , but also to the countries on the eastern neighbourhood , Belarus , Ukraine and Georgia .
in fact , future conflicts in the cyberworld , where each country has to react to the attack itself and defend itself - sometimes in less than a second .
in these regions , the great powers of America and Russia are active , but not Europe .
we experience every day that they cannot be used for new challenges , opportunities and threats in the current world .
this is why I believe that the European Union must be demonstrably active within the Union and proactive in every area of the world .
Mr President , as you know , the summit establishing the Union for the Mediterranean set out three objectives : to boost political relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean region , to change institutional governance of these relations , through joint management of the initiative , and to mobilise multilateral cooperation between the European Union and its Mediterranean partners on structural projects that promote the integration of sub @-@ regions and help to reduce disparities in development between the two sides of the Mediterranean .
finally , I refer to the serious cases of Palestinian and Western Sahara , where women and children are the main victims of military action and exploitation , in the same way as all discrimination affecting the local population and , above all , women and children .
in view of the evolution of the crisis , I believe that the recovery plan should be updated so that it corresponds to the real economic situation .
recently , die Welt , a German edition , wrote that Majdanek was a concentration camp in Poland .
on 8 February , more than 3 000 people took part in the public assembly in Sfântu Gheorghes / Sepinland zentgyörgys , Romania , who expressed their views against the political games of Romanian political parties and called for respect for the rights of Hungarian communities .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Mr President , I too wish to congratulate Mr Szymański on his comprehensive report , which has the support of our group in tomorrow &apos;s vote .
however , by differentiating our activities for increasingly smaller geographical regions , there is a risk of losing sight of the overall direction , visibility and transparency of the European Neighbourhood Policy recommended by the European Union .
let us show that we can be influential in the eastern countries , and let us not allow Russia to implement its neo @-@ imperialist plan .
therefore , I completely disagree with the restrictive legal basis proposed here .
this was made possible thanks to the good work and cooperation of shadow rapporteurs , contributing significantly to the preparation of the necessary report on the important issue of European research infrastructure .
you are putting me in a difficult situation .
over the next 25 years , it is expected that the number of land used in agriculture will be reduced by almost 25 % as a result of urbanisation .
particular attention must be given to the most vulnerable girls and boys in society , including disabled children , migrant children and children belonging to minorities .
social businesses are an integral part of the Commission &apos;s entrepreneurial policy .
relatively new research is not widely recognised as a priority in the area of mental health , but recent technological developments have allowed us to look more closely at human resources and have shown us new ground @-@ breaking ways of treating people .
under the Energy Services Directive , national action plans for energy efficiency have only a limited role to play .
as can be seen , there is a Latin saying in Parliament &apos; which is allowed to God , you are not allowed a gentleman &apos; , in other words , what is legal for Mrs Lulling , is not legal for the ordinary Member .
in other words , you are targeting mobile products : local services and construction .
our response to the single tax system is a caste &apos; no &apos; .
I support a significant reduction in VAT rates , particularly in residential buildings , but also in heat insulation and renovation projects , in particular , but not only with the aim of protecting jobs and ensuring social cohesion .
they relate more to the ambitions of professional politicians and people involved in them , and less to the interests of the ordinary citizens of the Member States .
and the door is open .
statistical data show that this is an impact economic sector which creates new jobs in the EU and provides 11 million jobs , representing almost 7 % of the labour force .
this mandate expires on 15 March 2009 .
however , in less developed countries - and this is what I mean for Romania - the complexity of the resources and technical and organisational aspects is a major obstacle to the creation of a European research infrastructure .
however , we believe that this must not undermine the quality of public services , particularly in areas where the social economy plays an important role .
this report codifies the fundamental principles , values and objectives of mental health that are necessary to promote better understanding across Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mrs Miguélez Ramos &apos;s report on the implementation of the common fisheries policy .
measures such as forcing employers to control the residence permits of third @-@ country workers and the financial and criminal penalties imposed on employers highlight the efforts of the Community and Member States to coordinate their immigration and illegal employment policies .
at the same time , standard rules must not become a bureaucratic burden at European level , but must ensure that there is a simple and effective exchange of information between Member States .
I have therefore voted against this motion for a resolution .
Mr President , I supported Mr von Wogau &apos;s report .
in the final vote , British Labour MEPs joined the Socialist Group in voting against this report , particularly because of the finalisation of the paragraph devoted to the establishment of a permanent EU military operational headquarters as a whole .
I would also like to draw your attention to the significant progress that has been made in establishing a Euro @-@ Mediterranean free trade zone , which will be established once and for all in 2010 .
( applause )
however , I would ask that we allow the responsible special committee to prepare a resolution .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in Italy , the independent Commonwealth Communications Authority published 43rd resolutions aimed at a state television that violated the rights of Italian citizens to be informed of radical initiatives .
( SL ) I welcome today &apos;s decision by the Croatian Government to respond in principle positively to the European Commission &apos;s mediation initiative between Slovenia and Croatia .
we demand guarantees that they will achieve their objective .
we must , of course , do our utmost to ensure that the procedure is as open and structured as possible , and I am pleased to hear , Commissioner , that you are going to stand up for it .
if we do not diversify our raw materials sources of energy production , particularly natural gas reserves , the crisis in January will repeat similar crises .
in writing .
this means that the private companies will be able to choose between the creditor @-@ based system for the preservation of capital and the creditor regime .
we have proposed to make the &apos; think Small First &apos; principle a compulsory and integral part of all future legislation .
it is important that we describe and treat SMEs as cross @-@ cutting , rethink support measures , give priority to small businesses in public procurement ( &apos; think small first &apos; ) and avoid distortion of competition by public authorities .
SMEs should increase their participation in the internal market and public procurement .
firstly , I would like to apologise on behalf of my colleague Charlie McCreevy , who will have to meet the obligations of the Council of Finance Ministers early tomorrow .
I support the amendments to the reception Conditions Directive , the Asylum Procedures Directive and the qualification Directive , which specify the criteria allowing asylum seekers to receive international protection .
does the Commission intend to draw up a programme for the redistribution of migrants between countries and how does it intend to build on and apply this clause ?
that concludes this item .
the Commission services increasingly apply uniform standards to control methods , ensuring better coordination and dissemination of results .
however , consumers ( as we all know ) show an ever @-@ increasing interest not only in food safety , but also in the origin and production methods of food .
a handbook on the application of the regulation was drawn up in 2006 , distributed in 2007 to all European courts .
in this regard , the possibility of publishing information every week on commercial stocks is currently being examined .
if we look at how environmentally friendly measures can be achieved in relation to cars , it is sometimes surprising how much time is spent investigating other measures .
210 million Europeans are currently exposed to traffic noise , which is a direct threat to health , according to the World Health Organisation .
the ESP system must become accessible to all and no longer be an optional additional option .
finally , in addition to improving the application of the directive , the main objective of the reform is to simplify legislation and reduce administrative costs for both industry and the competent authorities , in line - as always - with the principles of the Union &apos;s better regulation programme .
in Germany , we call for this peasood &apos; to read herbs &apos; .
at the same time , we must point out that , despite the dynamic development of technology , the old targets relating to our directive have not been met at all .
some Members have raised doubts as to whether all amendments to my report fall within the scope of the legal basis of the regulation - Article 255 of the EC Treaty .
Mr President , we fully support Mr Cashman &apos;s objective and commitment to increasing transparency , but we must not forget that the recast of the regulation is currently being dealt with .
we know that if everything were made public , there would no longer be modern discussion models , because everyone would know that he is putting his head on the table as soon as he tries to achieve and put forward political compromises .
another subject of heated debate is Article 5 ( 2 ) , which concerns access to documents of Member States .
Mr President , as we have chosen to vote , you might say why so many amendments were found to be unacceptable .
the next item is voting time .
the inclusion of soil protection is not a duty of the European Parliament and cannot be applied across the European Union .
they continue to take advantage of their power and producers are exploited wherever possible , even to the blue , so that they themselves have to pay for their own advertising .
it is also important to assess existing systems in order to consider whether new instruments really need to be created , and to take into account their persistence , reliability , interoperability and cost , and whether the fundamental rights of individuals are given due consideration .
unfortunately , Member States do not currently apply this law in a uniform manner : the recognition of this status may vary between 0 % and 90 % between Member States .
we also recognise that fathers need to contact the public in order to be recognised .
this task should be assigned to the Community authority as a whole , not to local or national authorities .
in writing . - ( SV ) At a time when cuts are made in healthcare , schools and social care in the public sector , savings should also be made in the EU institutions .
unfortunately , however , the report takes on protectionist elements in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and , in particular , those who want to justify the huge market distorting CAP payments and who want to make it harder for third @-@ country production to be imported into the EU .
the European Commission must be praised for the initiatives that have been taken so far and for the ongoing work aimed at cutting red tape for small businesses .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
failure to investigate the Prestige accident or identify the specific causes of the accident demonstrated the need to harmonise investigative methods .
another set of measures will apply to coastal states : effective monitoring of ships in short and long distances , which is a necessary preventive instrument .
if one small mistake , such as the small fallout of oil tanker , remains unnoticed and closed , it could end up being a major environmental disaster if there is no safe place for the necessary measures to be taken in the sea or in connection with the transportation of goods to another ship .
I would like to ask your comments , Commissioner .
they have contributed to the progress we have made and I would like to thank them for that .
however , I have some reservations about the specific amendment concerning sensitive mountain areas .
partly because of this , freight transport has become increasingly cheaper over the years .
the 20 @-@ 20 @-@ 20 target will otherwise become more and more distant .
it should remain a matter of national and local determination alone .
I would say that I am very pleased , on behalf of my country , because this text will enable the infrastructure of a transit country such as France to be made a contribution from heavy hauliers who are currently going through the country to a drop in petrol or a single cent .
( RO ) I would like to start by saying that this directive was poorly or insufficiently implemented , which is why I would like to ask the Commission whether it is considering reducing VAT on products in the future as well .
this separate legal approach advocates a set of measures by the Commission to make safer use of the Internet .
I would also like to draw attention to the framework decision on combating certain forms of racism and xenophobia aimed at criminalising deliberate acts such as incitement to violence or hatred against a group of people or against a person belonging to that group .
however , by introducing export refunds , we should see a situation where we can increase the prospects for milk producers in the European Union to be present on the world market .
it appears that it is precisely those Member States with the highest birth rate that have introduced the most advanced policies on work @-@ life balance and which register the highest levels of female employment .
otherwise , life is not the case , and mothers often work outside the home .
the Barcelona criteria are certainly not the strategy of the last century , it is a strategy that creates lively debate both now and in the future .
1 .
keeping Qimonda in operation in Germany and Portugal is of such strategic importance to Europe that the support of the European Union is justified .
two of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries , Mrs Fraga Estévez and Mr Romeva i Rueda were present in Marrakesh and speak about it during the debate .
the failure to guarantee this new recovery plan will have serious consequences which will lead to the destruction of stocks of this species .
this is a clear lesson that the crisis has given us , and prevention is just as important .
these reports and resolutions , which the European Parliament will be voting on this week , particularly those from the coordination group on the Lisbon Strategy , will , in my opinion , make an important contribution to the work of the European Council .
other countries , such as the Nordic countries , where I come from , do very little , even though their economic situation is good .
and then the Council comes up with dozens of small decisions , such as the decision on budgetary stimulus of 1.5 % of GDP , either this year or next .
we cannot sign a blank cheque to help the countries of Eastern Europe .
now is the time to show solidarity and to build on innovation .
the main problems facing Member States are the banking sector , the reduction in production capacity , the lack of new money and the withdrawal of the labour market .
I am therefore convinced that we are now a very far from a solution comparable , for example , to the plan implemented by the Obama Administration in the United States .
today we are discussing Amendment 25 to the resolution on the Lisbon Strategy , which includes precisely this issue .
without a common compass to guide us through the crisis , we would , unfortunately , all be wrong with what provoked the crisis .
here too , it would not be very much worth reducing the deficit ceiling .
we can ensure that future gas and energy crises in certain regions of the European Union are no longer repeated only if we implement sensible policies in this area .
150 000 people are trapped and have no access .
a few minutes ago , the situation seemed to be quite different .
Regretfully .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this report because I was pleasantly surprised that our proposals on combating tax havens were adopted in the European Parliament .
I have already expressed my support for Mr Böge &apos;s report on the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund in this case , and I would now like to confirm my support for this measure , but it must focus on the rapid and effective restoration of normal living conditions in the areas affected by natural disasters , as set out in the 2006 interinstitutional agreement , and not on compensation for the damage suffered by private individuals .
the experts do not agree on how best to respond to this crisis and what is the best way to stimulate the economy in order to control unemployment figures .
although I support the Commission &apos;s initiatives aimed at preventing the rise in oil prices over the next few years , I do not think that the situation as a whole has been properly analysed .
furthermore , the Recovery Plan must aim at a fair international agreement that allows large investments to be financed , helping poorer countries to escape poverty , and does not boost global warming .
we also call on the Commission to review and consolidate all legislation aimed at making the Member States concerned stable , including stabilising exchange rates , so that security provisions can be implemented and packages of measures for rapid and effective response .
at the informal meeting in Prague on 15 January 2009 , the Commission informed ministers of Justice and Home Affairs that the results of the tests were unsatisfactory .
that is why the public is rightly asking why we do not have any expertise at EU level that is competent enough to deal with technical issues that may arise during the implementation of particularly large and comprehensive databases .
we are following developments in this area very closely and we call on the Croatian authorities to ensure that cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia continues .
freedom of the press must be respected , as this is a fundamental basis for the continued democratic transformation of every open society and therefore of Turkey .
a year ago , the European Parliament supported my proposal to open negotiations as soon as possible .
in this regard , I share the Commissioner &apos;s optimism , which is due to the Kurdish television channel and the associations established between Turkey and Armenia .
in the case of Croatia and Slovenia , we expect that , without ambiguity and vetoes , everything will go well and that border disputes may be excluded , and we hope that negotiations with Macedonia will start as soon as possible .
Turkey must implement much @-@ awaited reforms .
nevertheless , Hungary did not prevent Romania from joining , as it considered European solidarity and tolerance to be more important .
the Socialist Group has tabled two amendments to plenary .
I would like you to comment on this because , according to my understanding , it is this principle that we must bear in mind if we are to provide care to those in need in a way that respects human dignity .
this proposal focuses on rules and measures necessary to make safe and high quality healthcare available to patients moving across Europe on an equal footing .
work in this sector is laborious and often underpaid .
water scarcity has also become a problem outside the normal areas of sademy .
I believe that the conclusions of the Charter , and also of the Water Forum , should be reflected in the pan @-@ European debate and in the material that we present in the international world inquiry when we represent the European Union .
author . - ( NL ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Africa is the only continent in which no significant progress has been made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals , particularly in the fight against maternal mortality and infant mortality and HIV / AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria .
end of quote .
since the adoption of this report , the transition to SEPA has taken place very slowly , too slowly .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I very much welcome this debate , which is also attended by the Commissioner , and I thank him very much for his serious , strong and thorough statement .
this government is probably now living in the illusion that it was able to make great progress , although it is , in fact , even more difficult to achieve peaceful and harmonious coexistence between the two peoples as equal partners in the future .
however , we do not want to have an impact , not through violence , threats and coercion , but by providing support specifically for these countries in seeking their stability and democratic change .
I welcome the fact that the PPE @-@ DE delegation was in Minsk a day after Mr Solana , and we emphasised in particular the human rights situation and press freedom requirements .
it supports both political and economic reforms .
the establishment of a strategic relationship between the European Union and Brazil is mutually beneficial , firstly because of Brazil &apos;s changing position at global level , with which it is becoming a leading force among developing countries , and secondly because Brazil has a vital role to play in linking different positions on matters of global importance .
we stress the need for our respective executive authorities to strengthen cooperation in the areas of politics , economy and cooperation , particularly in view of the possible new challenges arising from the financial and economic crisis that rogue our continents .
let us pool our nations , our resources , our wisdom , our old and young people on both sides and create an area of free movement right away for students , researchers , intellectuals and intelligence .
our priority should be to strengthen bilateral cooperation in trade and cooperation in order to protect Brazilian forests , which are , after all , the Copts in the world .
this memorandum has been published and contains their demands .
these efforts have been effective only if countries and international organisations have been consistent in their actions and demands .
( PL ) Madam President , at the beginning of the 1930s , the Chinese Government forced Tibetan representatives to sign an agreement that guaranteed far @-@ reaching autonomy for Tibet .
I would then also withdraw my Amendment 3 , and I am counting on the other side on fair treatment .
that is his values , and we believe that they do not suit Europe .
- ( SK ) I , too , voted in favour of the resolution on the situation in Tibet on the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising because the Chinese authorities have recently strengthened security measures in Tibet and banned journalists and foreigners from entering the region .
children should not be able to buy video games that are not intended for their age group .
as the ancient Indian proverb says : we do not get land inherited from our parents , we borrow it from our children .
the Greek Communist Party supports the anti @-@ imperialist fight and opposition of the Balkan peoples to US , NATO and EU policy .
in writing . - The EPLP wants to see SEPA a success .
we condemn attempts to resolve conflicts through a coup d &apos;état ; we call for the two @-@ month presidential elections in Guinea @-@ Bissau ; and we call for these elections to be restored to meet democratic standards and constitutional procedures .
the economic development of the Philippines and membership of the Association of South East Asian Nations are positive signs .
one of the most serious humanitarian crises in the world has had a very negative impact on the population .
it is no accident that the greatest human rights violations occur in countries with rich natural resources and , above all , in China , where this oppression is channelled to natural resources .
these are the memories of many of the citizens of the European Union today .
the Commission should work with Parliament and the Member States and not prescribe them .
Monumenti has been damaged and depuded until sixteen times , with a little more than two weeks since the last regime .
we must combat the financial , economic and energy crisis , climate change and terrorism , which threaten everything that has been created so far .
it affects foodstuffs as much as industrial products and ultimately creates a vicious circle .
I was late here and arrived at the last moment .
regional integration will undoubtedly be strengthened as soon as all regions sign comprehensive agreements tailored to their specific needs .
the text of the resolution on the SADC EPA is a good compromise .
Mr President , we all know that EPAs have been criticised a great deal .
the second point about the debate that I would like to answer concerns the issue of the development dimension of economic partnership agreements .
the short promises to be flexible in adopting these agreements are not a substitute for specific guarantees .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , this parliamentary term is coming to an end and some of us are beginning to prepare for elections .
if the use of ethanol in cosmetic products had been banned , it would probably have caused problems and , at the same time , seemed a little strange , because we are drinking it in relatively large quantities .
I would like to mention that the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety form part of the agreement with the Commission and the Council , as they are also included in the final draft that will be voted on in Parliament tomorrow .
it is very important - at least in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals on overcoming poverty and on agricultural and educational development - that they be included alongside all the issues that have been raised , from desertification to climate change and energy .
I would remind you that last year we spent the contribution of the Commission and the Member States , knowing that everyone contributed EUR 46 billion .
in this context , it is true that budget support , which is then directly covered by financial assistance to beneficiaries &apos; national budgets , could successfully lead to better predictable aid geared to priority sectors and thus more effective .
the joint alternative resolution by the PPE @-@ DE , ALDE and UEN Groups has now been tabled , as it was felt that the Commission &apos;s initial decision was the result of a rather unrepresentative vote which did not touch on a number of protectionist points in the report .
in its communication on food prices adopted in December , the Commission also proposed a number of solutions in the form of the Action Plan to improve the performance of the food supply chain in Europe .
the fact that Euronews broadcasts in Arabic or Russian , but not in Hungarian or other Member States , is relatively absurd .
as we know , it always pays close attention to human rights issues and tragedies in Africa .
I welcome the general support that Parliament has given to our approach to multilingualism .
this report also offers advice and encouragement on adapting the Structural Funds rules to make them more relevant to the needs of European cities and metropolitan policies .
I share your opinion on the possibility of European public good offices in all regions .
furthermore , with regard to the inclusion of the term &apos; territorial &apos; , we must be aware of the need to take into account the specific characteristics of certain regions , such as their geographical handicaps , remote locations or depopulation in certain regions .
implementation of these priorities in the operational programmes should enable regions to combat the challenges of globalisation , structural , demographic and climate change , and promote harmonious and long @-@ term sustainable development in the regions .
we must emphasise these benefits during the forthcoming elections , as they are of clear interest to citizens who have seen their quality of life tripled in some cases , and to regions which , after being indebted , are now making real progress .
( BG ) What are the main objectives of the micro @-@ credit initiative ?
this sector has been successful in many developing countries , including some European countries , both as a measure for generating economic activity and as a means of promoting social inclusion and creating jobs .
we had a debate on this at the beginning of the 1990s in the time of ray MacSharry , and we will not return to it .
I welcome the fact that the Commission pointed out the need to reduce disparities in development levels and the importance of synergies in the implementation of EU policies .
during the financial crisis , simple financial instruments that can finance business activities , especially in underdeveloped regions or in the social groups mentioned above , have particular value .
11 .
this is important , and that is why we should debate it instead of having only one section dedicated to it .
may I ask those who say that the EU is such an incomparable machinery that should ask themselves this question ?
I agree with the rapporteur that the tax tariffs imposed on aircraft in the European Union for the carriage of passengers and goods by Nepaal must comply with Community law .
after all , the Treaty of Lisbon has been legally non @-@ existent after the Irish referendum .
there are those who profit from opening borders to all people , goods , capital and so on , and then there is a large majority of the people who suffer the consequences : unemployment , job insecurity , reduced purchasing power , insecurity , loss of identity , and no one knows who is to blame for it .
lack of opportunities for exchanging experience ; and
we therefore support this report , but new tests should not be carried out on finished products if the information on their ingredients complies with the legislation .
in Ireland , female genital mutilation is viewed as an expression of gender @-@ based violence .
this is evidence of linguistic diversity , not the other way round .
I supported this resolution , I congratulate the rapporteur and am proud to be the first Slovak Member to enter into a debate on multilingualism in institutional books through written evidence .
this report , which deals with the subject of micro @-@ credits , is aimed at disadvantaged groups of society , such as minorities , the Roma community and the rural population , who represent untapped potential and wish to deal with small businesses , but this is not possible because they do not receive loans from the bank .
( applause )
at this juncture , this means that we need to cushion and mitigate the effects of unemployment and the recession in the European Union .
how can we reform its decision @-@ making structure so that it responds more to the demands of democratic control and emerging economies ?
please let the people of Europe decide their own future .
when EU guarantees on the European Investment Bank were renewed and their coverage extended to more countries , the European Parliament proposed that these decisions should form part of the joint decision @-@ making procedure and , furthermore , that the competence of the European Parliament should remain in addition to that of the Council .
one further remark to Mrs Stauner , who has just referred to monitoring procedures .
I believe that it is in this context that we will be able to find a division of labour and implement combined expertise and the necessary cooperation mechanisms , including the common standards that you are proposing .
with regard to financing priorities , I am pleased to note that the current version of the report also includes my proposal to include the necessary specification of projects in the energy sector in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus , specifically that they must &apos; comply with Community policy objectives to diversify energy sources and ensure stable and safe resources for consumers &apos; .
by referring to the Treaty of Lisbon , it means that , if they really get more rights , there will be no checks on either Parliament or the public over 8 billion .
there are Commission initiatives aimed at facilitating access to funding .
this requires us to follow the paradigm shift and move towards the introduction of new technologies .
today , Mr Brown and Mr Barroso have confirmed that they refuse to defend Europe , our industry and our jobs for the sake of a free market and globalisation .
we must therefore give more support to the development of new technologies , innovation and , most importantly , sustainable transport systems , which we have also done in the past .
following the discussions with the Council , the compromise reflects the need to accelerate the creation of functional airspace blocks .
opposition was not as successful as initially hoped , and therefore I can even vote in favour of this report .
as far as public access is concerned , this description does not even cover airports in aviation clubs or airports that deal with flying for pleasure .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , today we are discussing a topic of particular interest to consumers , and that is the standard connection between mobile phone chargers .
you know that my group is strongly opposed to the large @-@ scale introduction of biometrics .
however , I am not happy with the fact that we cannot take fingerprints of children from children as from the age of six .
however , this regulation must contain foods , because otherwise ...
however , I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Parliament has already adopted a resolution in which we make it clear that we do not want meat from cloned animals as food products on the market .
due to the amount of methane released into the atmosphere , methane should also be included in further work .
apart from the fact that the US &apos;s own path of choice has proven its lack of credibility in history , social security levels and caring for the social needs of ordinary people - as I said before - are woefully different and much lower in the US .
another important decision was to double the maximum amount for Member States to support their balance of payments , which represents a huge contribution of EUR 50 billion .
in any case , you were overtaken by two votes by the civil Democratic Party and the Greens .
he won because he even had the support of US citizens who lost a large part of their economic income in the economic crisis of the 1930s .
I promise myself a little humour today .
we are on your side and we support you in achieving this objective .
we have an ideal historic opportunity to work with our US partners on all the challenges of today &apos;s globalised world , from the economy and the environment to conflict resolution in the Middle East , Afghanistan and so on .
European citizens will certainly be extremely disappointed with the results of the last summit .
the answer is simple : the Irish Government is betraying the heart of health services , education , childcare and training .
however , in order to do this , we urgently need to agree on the development of a global carbon market , financial compensation for developing countries , technological support and capacity building , and we must finally clarify the principles of burden @-@ sharing between Member States .
as far as the car industry is concerned , we have given too little importance to the development of completely new types of cars - cars that use hydrogen , batteries or fuel cells .
the Commission &apos;s recent decisions on permanent cost cuts have painful consequences for public health and welfare , and for workers &apos; insurance rights and pensions , which , combined with demands to increase the tax burden , drastically reduce the quality of life of the ordinary people .
the proposals for the two EPAs &#91; that is , the reports by David Martin and Erika Mann &#93; were officially announced and submitted to your committee &#91; that is , to the Committee on International Trade &#93; only at its meeting on 19 February 2009 .
the problem that has arisen is , in fact , what we have caused ourselves .
but we also need better regulations and principles for future EU legislation on motor vehicles .
as we discussed in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , genetically modified organisms must be removed and novel foods must not pose any risk to health or mislead consumers .
nevertheless , our abandonment is dissuasive : we intend to decide on the Commission &apos;s actions on the basis of real evidence , and we do not want to present a blank cheque in the future .
the second reason is that the European Union is now stronger and able to act more effectively in its external action than in 1995 , when the new transatlantic agenda was agreed ; in addition , the European Union will soon be able to support foreign policy and defence instruments provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I fully agree that institutional ties between the European Union and the United States should reflect the importance of these relations .
secondly , we need to set higher targets in the transatlantic dialogue on issues referred to both by the rapporteur and by the Commissioner , in other words , on Iran , Iraq , the Middle East , Afghanistan , etc .
as the previous speakers have pointed out , there is a certain new tone , but I also feel that the Americans are looking at what Europe can do to be a partner in the global system , and we need to think about what we can do to make a contribution to this process .
in principle , we unequivocally support stronger ties between the European Union and US legislators .
the European Parliament must have the right to submit a request to the Council and the Commission accordingly .
a positive feature is the launch of new structured dialogues , such as human rights , as we have heard .
however , in my opinion , they are by no means sufficient for us to approve this agreement now .
so we must help Turkmenistan to help itself .
the Schengen visa , which costs EUR 60 , is too expensive for many Belarusians .
this is an opportunity not only to remember the fall of the iron Curtain , but also to learn lessons from past totalitarianism throughout Europe .
it is simply outrageous that people cannot collect information about their past .
we do not intend to regret that imperialists can rejoice .
it was announced this week that there is a consensus centre in Latvia ( the community of which the newly elected representatives join the Socialist Group in the European Parliament ) on the candidate list of MEPs , Mr Alfrēds Rubida , former leader of the Latvian branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , sentenced to court for crimes committed by the regime in Latvia .
I see the expansion of the EU more widely , and that is why I can differentiate between the different forms of totalitarianism that have been mentioned - the different forms in the various countries .
piracy is promoted by three factors : technological tools and low costs of copying , bad economic conditions and widespread Internet penetration .
I sincerely hope that we will achieve this in cooperation with the sector .
secondly , I mention the protection of intellectual property in relation to animals which can easily be transmitted via the Internet .
finally , good progress has also been made in establishing structures for the European Union &apos;s social dialogue in sport .
of course , UEFA and its partners must be directly responsible for this , but we can help them .
your first question was about ending the use of the vessel method ; the method of floating ships is being demolished directly on the ground .
this position should not be understood as a rejection of the legal basis of Community law , which is the principle of Community competence , but as an addition to the requirements of the normal procedure in this area , which will help to achieve the higher values mentioned in the Treaty .
I do not understand that .
I very much hope , as the Commissioner said , that today a large majority will vote in favour of this report so that we can send a clear signal to the Council .
currently , around 20 % of Lithuanian people are believed to live in poverty .
it is estimated that 43 million EU citizens are threatened with malnutrition - a shocking figure .
the Commission has examined the problem faced by consumers in obtaining collective claims for compensation .
we have already seen - and this may become increasingly common in the future - that collective claims for many NGOs and consumer protection associations are becoming advertising .
during yesterday &apos;s debate , it became clear that a majority in the European Parliament could agree to an interim agreement , even if it is difficult for them .
this can only be done through a European legislation regulating the responsibility of the main contractor .
&quot; as &#91; he &#93; has nothing more to give you here ,
otherwise , the EU would fall into the trap of protectionism and of massive subsidies for the various groups operating in agriculture .
what I am doing now does not mean flattering up the EU and its incomprehensible , inflexible and unaccountable structure .
this is particularly relevant for political action .
this is a classic indirect impact that can best be seen from the impact of the excellent European Capital of Culture programme .
at the same time , we must encourage programmes that promote cross @-@ border mobility of people working in the cultural sector and the presence of transnational cultural and artistic events .
calendar of part @-@ sessions 2010 : see Minutes
as far as these are concerned , Russia and the EU have made the same commitments , as Mr Vondra said , in the UN , in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) and in the Council of Europe .
however , the text does not appear to be recommendations for diplomatic negotiations .
to sign a new agreement , Russia must fulfil its obligations with regard to Georgia &apos;s territorial integrity .
so the question is what Russia sees power as .
I agree that there is a need for greater trust and understanding between the EU and Russia .
last year , EU @-@ Russia relations were severely affected .
coastal states should avoid discriminatory moves in the area of navigation rules .
the EU should try to persuade five Arctic coastal states - the United States , Canada , Russia , Norway and Thailand - in the wisdom of such an approach .
I also welcome the excellent report by Mrs Buitenweg , approved by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , as well as the significant contribution made by Mrs Lynne and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
there is no reasonable explanation for the fact that anti @-@ discrimination legislation provides protection for a black sex outside the workplace on the basis of colour colours , but not on grounds of sexual orientation .
anyone who values the freedom of choice of parents will not allow it to be curtailed .
if that were the case , the Council of Ministers would improve it .
if that is the case , then it is the case ; so anyone who has any religion is a person , and the fact that he is a person is more important than the fact that he is religious .
relations must be made clear so that no one &apos;s rights are violated , including those belonging to churches allowed by law .
the directive offers victims the right to compensation .
or should I say what will change if we adopt it tomorrow ?
in particular , it recommends adopting measures in the priority areas of the Lisbon Strategy in order to achieve economic growth and employment .
this is urgently needed in any case .
this is particularly important for the Czech Republic , as up to 26 % of Czech citizens live in ageing corps .
if you rightly make optimistic assumptions , the new regulations could enter into force in the coming weeks and therefore have a rapid impact on the operational programmes .
in order to reach this situation in Romania , the population must be informed of the economic benefits that can be achieved through energy efficiency management practices , which may provide consultations for all those who are interested in using ERDF funds for the latest methods of saving energy .
in this regard , it is necessary to realistically assess the opportunities offered by Romania to investors who are interested in investing in the agricultural sector , where demand seems to be greatest during the current crisis .
this is the real cause of the deaths on the Libyan coast a few days ago .
since I have been a human rights activist in the past , I would particularly like to thank Mr Lax for this provision .
I believe that one of the most important aspects that the Commission needs to bear in mind is the value of harmonising national provisions drawn up under Article 19 of Regulation No 22 / 2006 on the transposition of Directive No 22 / 2006 .
this will , of course , start with home and older people , but school and society must also support the raising of the child , enabling students to develop their identity more comprehensively .
I believe that we now have a full overview of the transposition and application of the directive in the Member States , and I think the time for action has come .
a great deal has been done both to facilitate integration and to help new arrivals to enjoy the same rights as citizens of the host country .
it is a very ambitious target .
in the case of SMEs mentioned , it is obvious that we should eliminate the bureaucratic complexity of authorisation .
the costs of this system led to considerable debate and I believe that we have found a reasonable compromise on the minimum cost , which still covers the transaction costs of introducing these marks .
as regards monitoring the progress made by EMAS , this leads to the introduction of the system and the creation of conditions for positive development in this area .
I also think that people will soon be able to distribute products and foodstuffs into categories that gave rise to so many exchanges in the debate and , in my opinion , this will enable EU citizens to contribute actively to protecting the environment through their consumer choices .
for various reasons , he refers to all Member States , and also to the subject you have asked yourself , to delete the sub @-@ statement concerning the issues that exist in other parts of the resolution .
it would be much better to send it back to committee and to have a full and well thought @-@ out report in the new mandate .
this will contribute better to cultural exchanges and cooperation between the EU and third countries .
( PL ) Mr President , I voted against the report on equal treatment of persons , despite it and perhaps because I oppose discrimination .
Mr President , thank you very much for inviting me and I apologise for not being present when I was invited .
once again , we would point out that , in the current EU , the Member States have sole legal responsibility for teaching .
for this reason , I believe that the Member States must take all necessary measures to effectively transpose the rules intended to harmonise the rights of European citizens .
once again , the EU has proven that it is the enemy of people , immigrants and refugees by handing hostages to the brutal exploitation of capital .
in writing . - This Parliament has played a key role in promoting equal treatment of people throughout the Union on the basis of gender , race , religion , belief , disability , age and sexual orientation .
this resolution has no effect on the legislative process .
European integration represented a direct response to the war and terrorist attacks caused by totalitarian regimes on the continent of Europe .
in a letter sent to Commissioner Kyprianou in 2008 , I had not asked for the original recommendation to be revised as it had been delayed for four years , but so far there has been no innovation .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
I believe that , on such an important issue as this , it would be useful to understand what the Commission wants to do : go ahead , do a paperwork , withdraw or put forward a legislative proposal .
I would just like to say that the great intrusion and concern that has been expressed by the media over the cost of my parliamentary staff for nine or twelve months has been a devastating experience .
therefore , I think we can say that , in these five years , we have learnt a great deal .
furthermore , I am pleased that the negotiations carried out have resulted in a better balance being struck between the European Network of transmission System operators , the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators and the rights of the European Commission with a view to ensuring a smooth , efficient and competitive market .
when we visited the Hannoverr , we saw that industry has taken a major step towards energy efficiency , not only in the areas that we have regulated up to now , but also in other industrial sectors , such as the various equipment used for end consumption and for the production of resources for the various industries .
unfortunately , the measures taken so far in this area have not been transparent and convincing , which could have adverse consequences for citizens and for the economy over the next 15 years .
these are legislation that has been adopted through debate and compromises .
another important change is that the new regulation makes it more difficult for third countries to attempt to buy energy .
however , when it comes to setting a cap on prices , I have a few concerns .
at the moment , that figure is 155 .
in the area of cohesion policy , around 27 % of payments were made to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
however , I also note that progress still needs to be made in strengthening supervisory and control systems , as there are significant errors in certain transactions .
I know that many of you consider the content of this point to be very controversial , but I think it is good that it is at least there .
if regulators were both independent in all other countries and the French regulator , we would have made very good progress .
if the representative of the Council were here today , I would have liked to have asked him for guarantees that they would do everything in their power to reach a common position before the summer , because the situation requires urgent action .
last week , bluefin tuna started fishing season .
amendments 104 , 108 , 109 and 110 are also problematic because they restrict the competence of Community inspectors , the ability to carry out independent inspections and independent inspections .
( SV ) Mr President , as a Eurosceptic , I often regret the fact that some EU institutions come up with such a proposal as Rule 47 .
every European sea is different and it is important to understand the knowledge and know @-@ how that local stakeholders can provide and not to succumb to the temptation of micro @-@ management at EU level .
to do this , we must start working actively with the countries from which illegal immigrants come from .
I think it is quite telling .
important amendments relate to the simplification of mergers and divisions , as no longer require approval at the general meeting .
but let us now turn to some of the points in the package : the amendments to Article 27 state that the supervisory authorities must have appropriate knowledge and capabilities .
the Commission has even considered this solution .
let us recognise this , then , and let us be ambitious and courageous .
I find this regrettable .
( DE ) Madam President , in my eyes , three brief points are important .
the system of supporting Member States &apos; balance of payments is , in my view , intended to be exceptional situations , and has been used only a few times in the past .
I would like to congratulate the Commission on its rapid response and also to thank our rapporteur , Mrs Berès .
11 .
36 .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to say that Mr Belet &apos;s report is excellent .
the European Union is expected to need another 60 million immigrants coming from outside Europe by 2050 , despite its millions of unemployed and poor citizens , from its massive redundancies and from closing their businesses .
in writing . - ( EL ) The Commission &apos;s proposal , which is based on which the report is drafted , forms an information and warning network between Member States for their national and private infrastructures , the nature of which can be said to be &apos; vital &apos; .
this scheme contributes to effective and efficient cross @-@ border and cross @-@ sectoral electronic comparisons between European public administrations , thus enabling them to provide electronic public services that can help them carry out their activities and implement Community policies for citizens and businesses .
as a result , this report on the mobile market is vitally important .
in 2009 , 225 are already reported to be withdrawn .
at the same time , it proposes that measures be taken for the next stage at the expense of migrants and in an even more reactionary direction .
I would also like to thank all voluntary organisations and individual citizens who have made a personal contribution or donated money to express their solidarity and provide assistance , who are truly outstanding , for example , in terms of operational and human life .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , the decision we are about to take is very important .
congratulations to this Commission , which adopted the report by the overwhelming majority of Mr Søndergaard - 27 : 2 - .
however , I will make sure that the Presidency realises Parliament &apos;s concerns , as expressed in the last debate on the discharge .
in addition , in order to avoid so @-@ called &apos; fictitious companies &apos; , additional guarantees must be provided for registered offices of companies .
I am listening on behalf of all those who were involved in this matter in our group .
I would therefore like to thank Mr Teychenné and Mr Albertini for the important contribution they make to protecting the rights of citizens as passengers in all transport sectors , because the need to intervene in the field of bus and coach transport and maritime transport represents an attempt to fill the gap that , as you have all pointed out , exists in European law .
with regard to the Teychenné report , I would like to point out that it provides a coherent framework for protecting consumers / passengers , which also respects small transport companies and protects their business and competitiveness in the event of accidents caused by non @-@ dependent circumstances , or in cases where sea transport is affected by a bad weather .
as far as such a complex regulation can be expected , you have considered the work carried out to be reasonable .
in order to further support the real economy , the Commission , the EIB , EBRD and EBRD Council have jointly developed an infrastructure initiative offering technical assistance and co @-@ financing for priority infrastructure investments in the transport , energy , environmental and social sectors .
does the Commission consider it necessary to continue to apply these outdated rules to the detriment of healthy competition in terms of pricing and consumer choice only to the financial benefit of some large groups , which are in a comfortable situation , where the lion &apos;s share of its revenue comes from products that are subject to exclusive legal rights ?
in a country where the honourable Member comes from , there is a marked focus on communication and information technology , but relatively weak participation , for example , in health care , socio @-@ economic research and space .
we also support their dissemination in the Member States through national , regional and broadcasting organisations .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur and all the Members who worked on this issue .
I think that the adoption of this report in this House - and I hope that the Council will align itself with the Commission and Parliament - will serve to ensure that the Commission continues along these lines during the next parliamentary term , makes proposals to Parliament and that we are making progress within the framework of intellectual property protection , which is vital for the development of the European Union as a powerful institution based on shared culture .
in this way , the political framework should be designed for other future interventions in areas where action at Community level is useful or even essential .
it would pay a lot and produce a large amount of paper that would simply be archived in Brussels .
at the same time , it is equally important for the European car industry that we be able to keep moving forward .
however , I regret that Mr Stockmann believes that our Amendment 24 is undesirable .
in fact , transporting goods by train can never compete very firmly with road freight .
so I cannot tell you at this point whether the Czech Presidency of the Council , that is , the EPSCO Council , will finally reach a political agreement in June .
they can move around as is self @-@ evident for all workers , students , goods , services and so on .
being a citizen , however , means being a person and we are all citizens , just as we are all people .
in fact , it can also lead to the creation of thousands of jobs in the hospitality and catering sectors .
( PL ) Mr President , it is not good for the European Court of Justice to decide on citizens &apos; rights , but it is very bad if this situation repeats itself and if the Court of Justice does so continually , instead of Parliament and the Council .
we are hesitant because many in this Parliament - including the Swedish Social Democrats - want to make things more difficult for patients and limit their access to healthcare abroad .
I would personally like to thank in particular - and I apologise for not mentioning this earlier - the rapporteurs from six committees who have given such valuable opinions for their comments and views this morning .
this will allow further assessment of the effectiveness of measures and interventions aimed at exchanging experience and information between Member States .
the Czech Presidency believes that if the Council adopts a draft proposal on European action in the field of rare diseases , there will be major developments and improvements in the diagnosis of rare diseases , which are currently problematic due to the nature of rare diseases .
we must strongly oppose genetic discrimination .
( for the results and other details on the vote : see Minutes )
I therefore recommend that we vote not only on Amendment 37 , but also on 80 if Members like it - which is a separate matter - as Amendment 81 seems to us to be .
31 .
these are some steps in the right direction for citizens throughout the European Union to take a decision on where to use healthcare services .
furthermore , from an environmental point of view , we cannot accept restrictions such as the requirement that goods carried out during the course of a revenue international transport should be fully delivered before cabotage can be carried out .
why not make a clear exception to the normal urban , suburban and regional transport services covered by public service contracts ?
as a result , patients &apos; rights in cross @-@ border healthcare are not protected by the exclusive competence of Member States in deciding how to organise and finance their healthcare systems .
in writing . - This resolution contains many issues that I support .
the countries of the European Union must pay due attention to this future reform , as it could result in many EU Member States , both large and small , losing the possibility that their national representatives will be able to participate directly and indirectly in the IMF decision @-@ making process , and also lose direct access to information .
next time it will be 5 % if the unemployment rate rises to 27 million unemployed .
not only has it undermined the climate and security of energy supply significantly , but it has also allowed thousands of new jobs to be wasted if possible .
as Mr Daul said , we need more than less trade .
the country has consistently shown interest in deepening its relations with the European Union .
we all know that we are still living with the consequences of the tragic events in the 1990s , as Mrs Ibrisagic has already mentioned .
this must change if Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to continue its progress towards convergence with the European Union and avoid the backwardness of its neighbours .
for this reason , it is necessary to introduce effective reforms to join the European Union , which have already been repeated several times here .
sending a message of this kind is particularly important at a time when the economic crisis is threatening to cause more and more people and politicians in Europe to close the door after themselves and no one else to live , work or trade .
this includes three closely linked pillars of the NPT , i.e. strengthening peaceful cooperation on disarmament , non @-@ proliferation and nuclear technology .
despite some positive aspects , this proposal for a recommendation by the European Parliament does not meet the fundamental requirements of nuclear disarmament , as it focuses solely on non @-@ proliferation .
firstly , by becoming the eighth confirmation , the European Union is telling Member States that they , too , should ratify and apply the Convention and its optional Protocol .
Minister , I am sure that in your country , like Ireland , voters will be anticipating and worried about the current EU approach to orwellian affairs .
we need to strengthen market access for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , particularly through more intensive monitoring of the market and individual sectors , in order to identify and remove barriers to the internal market .
I hope that you will approve this compromise agreement as a future and continue to press for optimising the full potential for improving the environment and stimulating the design of more environmentally friendly products .
according to the reports that we have all seen , improving the energy efficiency of buildings is one of the most economical ways of climate protection .
national marks do not indicate that the added value of the product has been tested and does not indicate anything about the quality of the construction product .
in other words , companies should not bear responsibility for the shortcomings in administrative cooperation between Member States .
withholding taxes is not only more effective , but also offers greater transparency at the time of its collection .
ethnic origin and race profiling in the fight against terrorism , law enforcement , immigration and customs and border control ( debate )
these results should provide the Commission with elements that would provide a food of thought and guide it in resolving problems that may be caused by profiling in the area of justice , freedom and security .
- The report by Mr Purvis , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment and operation of electronic money institutions and prudential supervision and amending Directives 2005 / 60 / EC and 2006 / 48 / EC and repealing Directive 2000 / 46 / EC - C6 @-@ 0350 / 2008 - .
the value is that the cost of the exchange of money , as well as other transaction costs , are reduced .
however , I would now like to mention another thing that is important for the protection of small businesses linked to biodiversity and natural tourism in my country .
in Afghanistan , women are increasingly being pushed back to the status they had during the Taliban regime .
therefore , on 12 April , the European Union put forward a front to the Afghan Government .
the Iraqi people cannot think Iran is unfit .
two thousand such people have registered with the High Commissioner for Refugees in the hope that they will be sent to other countries that are ready to accept them , and the Iraqi Government has been working closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for several years now and asking other countries to adopt them .
I therefore suggest that the postponement of the Council &apos;s discharge procedure in autumn should be accepted only if the Council puts this report on the agenda as well .
the principles of the Convention are dignity , autonomy , freedom of choice , independence , non @-@ discrimination , social inclusion , respect for differences , equal opportunities , access and equality between men and women .
the review respects the principles applicable to the use , processing , elimination , traceability and distribution of animal by @-@ products intended for human consumption in the EU , ensuring good protection of human and animal health .
the stagnation period will remain in place so far .
it is time not just to renew the agreement , but to stop it .
thank you very much , Mr Pannella .
it is difficult to do something with such a Council .
the debate is closed .
most of these amendments specify the Commission &apos;s proposal and are therefore aimed at achieving greater legal certainty .
( SL ) My house is told that children are our greatest asset , because they are our future .
as I said , this contradicts the interests of workers .
the first is the interesting and unexpected development taking place in the new Member States .
let us return to this issue in ten years &apos; time , when the situation in the Member States may be very different .
I therefore call on my fellow Members to reject Amendment 54 so that the dialogue continues and we can help workers who are exploited and claim to be false self @-@ employed .
citizens can now be sure that seal products will no longer be available on the market .
there are appropriate legislation in the countries of the European Union and Canada , and there are also appropriate services whose role is to ensure compliance with these laws .
the question is whether they are slaughtered humanically or not .
in addition , many research institutions contributed significantly to this process .
setting a definitive deadline for banning animal testing would be premature and would perhaps jeopardise even human health ; in this regard , I agree with the rapporteur .
the legal vacuum created by the Court of Justice following the annulment of Framework Decision 2005 / 667 , which established the nature , type and rate of criminal sanctions for the illegal discharges of pollutants .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , thank you very much to Mrs McCarthy for her speech , as much has indeed been done on this directive .
this will help these organisations to remain independent .
they are important for consumers because they offer better services at fairer prices .
we need high @-@ speed internet connections throughout Europe , not only in cities but also in rural areas .
any policy of network management is justified only to maintain a minimum level of service quality and should not lead to discrimination between services and applications , all controlled by national regulators .
what is technical may , in fact , affect the principles of cohesion and access for all .
the problem has already been highlighted by a number of Members , including my fellow Member from France : governments have attempted , through the back door , to introduce &apos; three strikes &apos; elements that actually have nothing to do with the directive .
I am proud to be able to make it clear tomorrow that civil liberties and rights on the Internet , especially with regard to the possibility of denying access without trial , are something that the European Parliament supports .
the procedure used so far was also reasonable and worked well .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission takes note of Parliament &apos;s decision to postpone the legislative resolution accompanying Mr Cashman &apos;s report until the next parliamentary term .
I do not know .
in writing . - ( EL ) I voted in favour of Amendment 54 because it is an important political message for the Commission and the Council .
however , protecting animals , as well as protecting public health , means combating monopolies , a capital power that protects medicines with patents , in order to make greater profits from the commercialisation of health .
if this Presidency comes to an end and the Swedish Presidency takes over , Europeans will show their views on the European elections , and I hope that their choices will help us to face up to the important commitments we face together .
what is urgently needed is that economic and social cohesion is not just a clear expression of content : we must give up the &apos; save yourself if you can &apos; principle .
all that still needs to be done now is the Vice @-@ President of the Grand President in Prague Castle to decide to sign the Treaty , but in any case we have made progress .
there are problems there , but we must extend our hand of help and help them solve these problems .
the implementation of the scheme at national and European level already plays an important role in preserving existing jobs and creating new ones .
it is also necessary to strengthen the open method of coordination , which is an essential part of European Union legislation .
Mr President , as shadow rapporteur for the report on the active inclusion of persons excluded from the labour market , I will focus mainly on this report .
secondly , we must avoid focusing on protecting those who are still working at the expense of those who are looking for employment and at the expense of employers who are trying to provide employment .
this approach is also decisive now , when we are facing one of the biggest economic crises in recent decades , and this approach is also part of the weekly summit .
written statements ( Rule 142 )
the Covenant of Mayors was also set up to coordinate and promote .
after two years of negotiations , we now have a comprehensive agreement with the EU &apos;s fourth largest trading partner outside Europe .
the Commission therefore wants to respond to citizens &apos; expectations in practice .
other Members have said the same thing : there is more and more food counterfeiting .
we also adopted the addition of sugar to wine .
if , for countless years , wine producers in the European Union have made major efforts and investments to produce high @-@ quality rosé wine , the Commission &apos;s decision makes these enormous efforts unavailable , which have nevertheless had a very positive impact on the economy and regional development of our regions .
Turkey is an important neighbour and an important , important partner of NATO .
the rights of communities not listed in the Treaties are constantly being trampled underfoot ; the European Commission turns a blind eye and , like Parliament , it continues to support this country &apos;s accession to the European Union .
in this regard , we can , in principle , recognise the changes that are part of the recast , which reflect the approach of existing legislation , which maintains the right to religious freedom , while allowing Member States to adopt or maintain stricter rules .
now I make quite contradictory statements .
personally , I have serious doubts as to whether this is still a good idea , but it came from the reform working group , which you participated in .
they also see that the original Commission does not respond to requests from the Committee on Petitions , which cannot be troubled at all by statements , actions or response from the Committee on Petitions .
I would like to thank the European Parliament for supporting our proposal , as well as for its flexibility and willingness to compromise in interinstitutional negotiations .
whether it was always pleasant is another question , but you were ready to engage in dialogue every time , and I hope you can say the same about us .
a EUR 100 million compensation mechanism will now be set up .
I think that , in three to four months &apos; time at the latest , we will have it .
the importance of projects varies .
the programme must be created as flexible and must be adequately financed to cover the needs of at least third level committees , including the European Securities and Markets Authority , the Committee on Insurance and occupational pensions and the Committee of the European Banking Authority .
lastly , you should have decided to introduce bank deposit guarantees .
our group supports the proposals elaborated in the trialogue , in particular the proposals for a new Capital Requirements Directive for banks .
what has been said here played a part in the agreement that was presented - in some cases , not a very important part , but one .
8 .
the European Parliament will now also participate in the debates on institutions and state law during the summits .
( applause )
instead , I would say that the President of the European Parliament must embody the whole Parliament , including representatives of minority opinion , and if you treat us differently , then the door to despotism .
paragraphs 13 and 36 &apos; minimum income &apos; have been translated into Swedish , &apos; minimilön &apos; , which means a minimum wage .
they have neither the right to vote nor the right to stand for the positions of the European Parliament .
our priority , which leads us all to say and do , is to make jobs secure and combat unemployment , while also promoting sensible ecological development .
since there was no common understanding , the European Union &apos;s common position was not developed before the conference .
we are launching a pilot programme covering 10 countries on different continents .
countries whose friendship we wish to maintain , because they are large and economically powerful , or countries that are important trading partners and in which we see our allies can afford more than small , weak countries .
in the case of the death penalty , it is clear that the abolition of the death penalty must become the achievement of our generation .
my proposal specifies the second basis for detention ( Article 8 ( 2 ) ( b ) ) , linking it to its initial interlocutor according to the detention guidelines established by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees .
obviously , the European Parliament is primarily concerned about solidarity , and this is also a very important issue for me .
finally , I would like to say that if the aim of the Dublin Regulation is not to ensure a fair distribution of obligations relating to the review of applications for international protection , I believe it is essential to develop other instruments to strengthen solidarity - as you said , Commissioner Barrot - with Member States situated at the Union &apos;s external borders .
that is why I , too , believe that it is in this area that we must find some way to implement the principle of European solidarity .
the proposed legislation provides for special arrangements .
the two proposals covered by Mr Zwiefka and Mr Deprez &apos;s reports are aimed at laying down procedures allowing Member States to negotiate and conclude agreements with third countries on judicial cooperation in civil matters , which is the exclusive competence of the Community .
in its Opinion 1 / 03 of February 2006 , the Court found that the Community has had exclusive competence to conclude international agreements on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters with third countries .
as I have already asked one of your colleagues before , can you assure me that we have the Czech Government &apos;s active support for an adequate and fair international agreement on global carbon emission reductions , now that we are approaching the 15th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen in December this year ?
finally , the Council is currently also analysing a number of draft conclusions presented by the Czech Presidency on equal opportunities for women and men aged over 50 .
I am very pleased that the European Parliament has adopted four outstanding interesting and important reports , no , five reports , as Mrs Guy @-@ Quint has also presented a report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon .
such behaviour is neither credible nor prescriptive .
we support the view that this service should be set to the Commission in administrative terms .
the peoples of Europe know that the only legitimacy is the legitimacy of human rights , and that power belongs only to those who respect human rights .
I think we should be more combative .
taking minority opinion into account , too , is an insult to the majority decision , both in terms of the majority and in general democratic principles that we claim to hold dear .
never before have so few deceived so much in human politics .
certain possibilities have also disappeared .
I think that the debate has been interesting , regardless of attitudes towards the European project and the Treaty of Lisbon .
in principle , I support the timetable for the appointment of the Commission , but I think that certain stages could probably be shortened so that the work of the European institutions is not paralysed every time there are elections to the European Parliament for months .
in fact , we decided that we did not want yet another single market measure .
in fact , we are talking about taking money from taxpayers &apos; pockets and giving it to national or international bureaucrats to spend it on our behalf .
thank you very much .
it is also apparent that the audiovisual sector is , first and foremost , an area of activity for the younger generation , which uses its main source of information , along with other Internet technologies , as well as television and equipment that work via the Internet and multi @-@ channel digital television .
distribution has also been promoted , for example , by the European producer club ( European producer ers Club ) , which organised workshops for joint production in China and India .
the European Parliament is doing its little to compensate for the failings of others .
I would like to warn you of producing more similar results for the next five years .
when I was a Member of the European Parliament , I was highly sceptical about the liquids affair , and I am also sceptical now , and I am working to achieve that objective now .
this House of Citizens , re @-@ elected by the European Union , can fulfil the promise we have made to achieve a better European Union with more democratic control and greater transparency .
there is nothing unusual about airlines piling airport slots .
I hope that , if the voters in Ireland vote again this year , they will reject the Lisbon Treaty again .
although I pointed out , for example , Portugal , I think that it is just as important for all EU citizens to discuss this regulation as soon as possible .
I can agree that Member States need cooperation on transnational issues relating to criminal law , but I do not agree with the development of EU criminal law .
in writing . - ( SV ) The Treaty of Lisbon , which is 96 % identical to the draft Constitutional Treaty , was rejected in the referendum in Ireland .
shame on them and shame on the atrocities .
this country is in a difficult situation .
this is the worst thing that one politician can do , and we politicians in this House must be aware of this .
just under half of 736 MEPs have been elected for the first time .
thus , Jerzy Buzek has received an absolute majority .
European Parliament totalitarianism has always been a forum where various opinions can be expressed .
others were unexpected and some are even surprised , such as the Gaza conflict and the Russian gas supply crisis in the first few hours of the Czech Presidency .
Mr President , during the Czech Presidency , very important progress was also made on the Lisbon Treaty .
the Czech Presidency opposed extending maternity leave to 20 weeks , as well as paternity leave , which is essential for ensuring the sharing of family responsibilities between men and women and thus promoting gender equality .
in cooperation with the Czech Government , we are consulting the Canadian authorities to obtain more information on the circumstances behind their decision , and we will do everything we can to restore visa liberalisation .
moreover , measures to combat climate change are very beneficial by side - they justify measures in themselves .
the Stockholm Programme strengthens the means to ensure the security of the European Union and to combat organised crime and terrorism .
these are the key priorities - and rightly so .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Our second hope is that , together with the Commission , you will be able to present a new economic recovery plan , because 27 different plans will not deliver the necessary results in the coming years .
Turkey may be a good neighbour , but it does not belong to the European family .
I wish to broaden this prospect by a further step .
I can tell you that our expectations for you are great , because you have been fighting for European integration and European values right from the very beginning .
most importantly , however , it also means that the European Parliament will be able to monitor the legislative initiatives that the Swedish Presidency is implementing under the Stockholm Programme .
Europe &apos;s biggest internal player can and must be saved .
the debates on agriculture and reform of the fisheries policy must listen to the voices of areas that depend heavily on agriculture , such as Northern Ireland .
these interests require our continued attention and cooperation , and we hope that Iran shares this view .
it was organised by the largest opposition party Fidesz , which has a large presence in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , and which , in essence , won the elections this year in Hungary .
( el ) Mr President , I would like to express my deep regret at the tragic accident that took place today in the province of Qazvin in Iran .
only then will we be able to hope that we will be able to resolve not only the immediate questions but also the other issues that need to be addressed .
there , too , society is not as harmonious as the Chinese Communist Party claims .
we want journalists to be able to move freely so that the situation can be reported as it is .
however , it is wrong to blame China for cultural genocide .
I therefore welcome the decision of the Organisation of American States to suspend the participation of Honduras in this organisation and to recognise President Óscar Arias as an intermediary to help find a solution .
request for waiver of parliamentary immunity : see Minutes
Article 214 ( 2 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community , which , interestingly , is mentioned as the legal basis for the resolution , concerns the appointment of the commissioner in the event of resignation , but the vote on the approval of the entire College of the Commission .
rational mutual dialogue on a permanent basis helps to keep extremists in the wool in both camps and thus stifle or significantly limit the potentially dangerous activities they may undertake in the future .
thousands of Polish shipyard workers are still suffering the painful consequences of the antisocial policy of the Commission on their communities .
Mr President , I would just like to say briefly that this evening a British colleague said something wrong and somewhat humiliating about the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland .
it is very good and it is stimulating our debates , which may sometimes be very right .
State aid can and must , in my opinion , be linked to the legal inclusion of workers , with increased codecision powers .
where would we have been today if we had not taken steps to introduce a model solution ?
I would ask the Commissioner to do everything in his power to secure both production in this factory and related jobs .
we need policies to prevent fires , but also to coordinate their fight .
it is therefore very important for us to go much further than the pilot project you mentioned , Commissioner .
I believe it is too early to discuss disaster prevention as a European competence .
one of them is that we tend to talk in this House about issues that directly affect our own country and , given that we have discussions in Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty , where we talk about solidarity in the European Union , I think we should give up this practice .
this will boost the export of agricultural products , including pork , wine , butter and milk products .
Switzerland is also no less important trading partner : 80 % of Swiss exports go to the European Union and are the EU &apos;s fourth largest trading partner .
however , I want to solve this problem , and I think that the mechanisms that we have put in place in this agreement will do that .
I am a staunch supporter of economic cooperation agreements - contrary to some of the others I know - provided , of course , that a specific situation is taken into account and that a transitional period is implemented and , above all , provided that Member States fulfil their obligation to provide this infamous sum of EUR 1 billion a year to support trade .
it is precisely for this reason that we proposed a 5 % reserve for translations in the budgets of the various institutions .
that is all about asylum .
the European Union was born because it refused to accept the degrading of the dignity of others , and that is what the European Union must remain committed to .
a sensible European immigration policy would include some common framework conditions for migration arising from economic reasons and within which Member States hosting such immigrants can act in such a way that they make decisions themselves on how many migrants they accept .
since May , the Italian authorities have found over a thousand immigrants from the sea and handed them over to Libya during informal and indiscriminate returns without having identified or given them the opportunity to request or use asylum procedures , with the risk of being treated in Libya in an inhumane and degrading manner .
in writing . - In January 2009 , the south @-@ west of France was hit by a storm which caused major damage and it is therefore possible for France to apply for funds from the European Union Solidarity Fund .
the report on Draft amending budget No 8 / 2009 of the European Union for the financial year 2009 contains some controversial points .
it is regrettable that we do not see real changes among the staff of the European Commission , as it is increasingly certain that the main driver of outdated thinking , José Manuel Barroso , will also guide the Commission in the next parliamentary term .
on that day , a large number of police officers attacked peaceful demonstrators , pedestrians and even many tourists who were quietly drinking in restaurant .
it is very important that we maintain a balance .
during this morning &apos;s debate , the representative of the fascist party , Krisztina Morvai , insulted in a totally unacceptable manner by my colleague , Kinga Göncz , who is a member of the European Parliament of my political group and the former Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs .
I agree that this is necessary ; the first attempt to assess social impact should be made to amend the Working Time Directive .
unfortunately , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe rejected the support of its chairman ; otherwise it would have been possible .
what you said , I understand that you are not paying much attention to it .
you have a obsession with me .
why Mr Barroso ?
( PT ) Mr President , Minister Malmström , President Barroso , let me first of all congratulate you .
Europe needs an industrial base , and the problems in the world - hunger , poverty and disease - can only be remedied if Europe , as an economic power , has this base .
that is my question .
( SK ) I would like to address an issue which is of concern to many people in the European Union , including me .
I would also like to draw your attention to the fragile political situation and the difficult economic situation in the Republic of Moldova .
in my opinion , we need to act on new energy in this area .
the common agricultural policy actually divides Europe into two , old and new Europe .
I would add that it is precisely for this reason that we started the interconnection programme in the Baltic States , and that is why the Commission resolved the impasse on Nabucco - let us be honest , the project had reached a complete impasse .
we are the world leader in the financial services market .
the next item is Question Time ( B7 @-@ 0203 / 2009 ) .
( DE ) What investment incentives should be implemented to accelerate the transition to use renewable energy sources in private households , and not only in industrial and commercial companies ?
we have proposed that civil society organisations monitor the implementation of labour law .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing ( see Annex ) .
over the last year , it has been accompanied by intensive regulatory work .
financial regulation does not have the advantage of the first actor .
our local politicians speak of one thing , but here in the EU we seem to be doing something different .
this shows that results are more effective if things are properly coordinated .
neither the US nor the EU have the right to use the system for investigating other crimes or other purposes .
we should also ban discards of cod and it should enter into force immediately .
it can only be successful - it can only happen , and not just remain fine words and rhetoric - if all Member States really accept it and really feel responsible for realising the project .
this vote strengthens the democratic nature of our institution .
the political guidelines outlined by President Barroso for the next Commission are a modern , ambitious vision for a Europe that focuses on fighting climate change and the knowledge triangle .
we need to create a European response force capable of acting quickly in the event of natural disasters .
it is a country that shares almost 1 500 km of border with Afghanistan and is close to Pakistani Swat Valley .
this has undeniable consequences for the great criticism of the credibility that still needs to be made later .
for example , I would be pleased if we were to devote equal attention to monitoring the implementation of this agreement , and we will soon have the opportunity to do so .
we must not give these countries a free hand .
the main obstacle to Bosnia &apos;s progress is the way of thinking , the feeling of powerlessness , which paralyses the people and institutions there .
national tensions existed before the war , but they have also survived after war .
( SL ) I would like to express my satisfaction at the progress made over the last 18 months in the visa liberalisation process .
I am sure that the abolition of the visa system in these three countries is only the beginning of the process and that the measure will be extended later on to Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina .
uniformity between national laws and treaties is not a matter for the Council , nor is it a matter for the Fundamental Rights Agency .
we are talking about the draft Lithuanian law , which creates a problem , such as the fact that President Grybauskaitė has been involved .
the Swedish Presidency &apos;s objective is to hold a debate on animal welfare and good animal husbandry .
in this regard , the European Union should support the global agriculture and food partnership in line with the European Union &apos;s Action Plan on the Millennium Goals .
the Council has called on the Russian authorities on several occasions to do everything in their power to protect the people of Russia in accordance with the UN Declaration on Human Rights , which is universally recognised .
perhaps the United States seems to be more similar to others in the European Union than the French and British ideas that Gordon Brown announced yesterday .
in order to properly address all these medium and long @-@ term ideas , I would like to set up a working group of experts from Member States and the Commission so that they can deal with these issues in depth .
Mr President , if the Matias start protesting , then it is certain that this is a serious matter .
the Commission &apos;s intervention measures have also been successful , avoiding the fall in milk prices even lower , and the market seems to be recovering .
have we not seen what happened in the dairy industry since the Commission decided to phase out these quotas in the spring ?
Commissioner , we will assess your new proposals very carefully and it is my job to ask the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to give an opinion on these new ideas immediately , without delay .
secondly , we need to work with partners , because it is very clear that we cannot simply say that we are taking your territory , installing solar panels and transporting electricity to the European Union .
firstly , there must be a global switch to more renewable energy sources , greater energy efficiency and energy saving .
if Afghanistan means an exorbitant leap towards NATO , energy security is surely a test of resilience and maturity for the European Union .
at the same time , it must be clear what the major infrastructure projects we need require in terms of both environmental impact and national independence .
now in March , the European Council declared that , in order to achieve its energy security objectives , the European Union as a whole , but also every Member State , must be ready to combine solidarity with responsibility .
I would also like to make two further points quickly .
in writing . - We are trying hard to promote a coherent energy policy , but such a policy is already in place and has been fully implemented .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the last few days , there have been legitimate protests by milk producers throughout Europe on prices , insufficient intervention by the European Union and not just the authorisation of labelling that takes place immediately in the future , particularly in the case of artificial dairy products .
in writing . - ( RO ) In the European Union today , one of the most serious known dairy sector crises is caused by the increase in production and a significant drop in global demand .
most importantly , it is important to ensure that the price paid to farmers for these products is fair and adequate .
however , the European Parliament rejected all these measures .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in addition to my condolences and support for the people of Taiwan , I would like to emphasise the timely humanitarian aid of the European Union following the disaster .
with the support of Parliament , we launched a pilot project and preparatory action in 2008 on the EU rapid response capability .
this unacceptable practice is becoming the norm in Russia , particularly in the case of Chechnya &apos;s criminal activities , where impunity is rampant .
the sense of fear and impunity can only be dispersed if there is an effective and rapid prosecution of these killings .
with a view to signing the association agreement , we Greens and the EFA recommend signing an association agreement before confirming the road map , which would formulate our objectives with regard to the amendments to be introduced in the field of human rights .
decisions concerning certain documents : see Minutes
are there any questions about this ?
it was a good decision for Ireland ; it is a good decision for Europe .
for Europe , the time has come to leave institutional issues aside and to commit to what will really happen to 500 million Europeans : a social market economy , energy , climate and security .
he did not use the word &apos; only &apos; , but he could have done so freely .
I hope that all Member States will soon have ratified the Lisbon Treaty and institutional , democratic and social reforms can be implemented without further delay .
the driving around one of the CEO of one of the largest transport companies has been hopelessly compromised .
Europe is lagging behind in an international context .
that is not possible .
however , I would like to highlight one issue that has not been raised so far in my opinion : there were many reasons why the people of Ireland rejected the Lisbon Treaty at the start , but one of them was the fear of some voters that the European legal system in Ireland could violently violate certain values relating to the right to life and the concept of family .
( HU ) Ladies and gentlemen , when , in the spring of 2003 , almost 84 % of Hungarian citizens voted in favour of the accession of our country to the European Union , they felt that they would return to where they belong - the united family of the peoples of Europe , which had been wiped out by the Communist dictatorship for more than 40 years .
Europe faces serious challenges in areas such as the financial crisis , climate change , immigration problems and the creation of new jobs in Europe .
I would like to thank Parliament for its decision to grant these Members observer status until we wait for the formalities for adoption of the agreement .
the most significant progress in this regard will be the increase in the number of areas in which decisions are taken by qualified majority of the EU Council ( not least unanimously ) , as well as the increase in the number of areas in which the European Parliament has a co @-@ legislator role alongside the Council of the EU .
he has humiliated them because he has allowed killings to take place and has allowed rape to take place .
I think he should be supported by our diplomatic efforts .
I would like to recommend a new advertising text for the Slovak hospitality sector : we like foreign tourists to go to Slovakia , provided they have learnt the Slovak language , before putting their feet on our soil .
however , the mining area does not extend to the area in which fishermen fish , and that is why we call on the crews not to withdraw from the security area and urge the European Union and its Member States not to extend the scope of Atalanta to the South , and to provide more funding to ensure that 20 000 vessels are free movement over the ocean , three times greater than the Mediterranean .
examples include the accreditation of judicial medical abortion , the harmonisation of interpreter policies and the transposition of criminal records .
this is a complex problem , which means that we must carefully assess the measures we are taking .
it may happen that the recent nightmare of Bratislava is repeated in another European airport .
if we really want to win public confidence and achieve the same positive results as has been achieved in Ireland , we must create laws that show citizens that Community institutions are keeping them that they are not simply easy to gain , but places where work is being done to safeguard and protect the rights of European citizens .
as a result of the pressure of this procedure , the Italian authorities are currently changing their positions .
moreover , we are very concerned , with the fact that there is one of the founding countries of the European Union among these countries .
this is a very dangerous development .
I could also mention the recent example of my own country , where my party , Vlaams Belang , the second largest party in Flanders , suffers from discrimination by a taxpayer @-@ funded public service broadcaster , which was only recently appointed by the Belgian Supreme Administrative Court , the National Council , to abuse the trust of the electorate .
we therefore ask the Commission to respond to requests made by the European Parliament in recent years and to propose definitions of certain criteria in order to assess possible violations of their rights and freedoms in each Member State .
I think that is what the European Parliament ultimately wants .
but I strongly oppose the federalist spirit of various amendments .
we should continue to support these practical measures to assist Member States at a time when they really need it .
it is important that the people who are suffering the consequences of the crisis receive support and help , but it can best be organised at national level , not through bureaucratic international systems .
decisions concerning certain documents : see Minutes
the money is mostly directed towards the development of sustainable growth and job creation .
and when we talk about agreements , banana producers are also closely monitoring the negotiations that , in some cases , have bilateral negotiations with third countries , because such transactions may have irreparable consequences if they do not go hand in hand with compensatory measures .
I believe that the Marshall Plan is very necessary and a much more specific and tangible objective , which is to help one billion of our fellow people suffering from hunger to rise to the poverty line .
however , closer analysis points out that the principles of cooperation between certain institutions are ignored , both at European Union level and between Member States of the European Union .
therefore , the evaluation mechanism must be based on a uniform allocation of tasks currently shared between the first and the third pillars .
risk analyses provide for on @-@ the @-@ spot checks ; unannounced checks and knowledge are high throughout the evaluation exercise , and the number of experts involved will make the checks effective .
as Vice @-@ President Barrot reminded us , we will open them in accordance with the rules .
anyone who knows a little bit about installing large IT networks in the public sector in their Member State knows that all these technical and budgetary problems are often created .
we should therefore avoid further financial burdens on Member States which may result from analyses and tests , as well as further delays in the system .
the Commission is talking about restructuring .
countries must have full participation , regardless of which mechanisms provide financial assistance .
I would like to ask Mr Carlgren whether the Council will support his ambitious objectives .
the most important thing is that the developing countries themselves must be given a voice in making the use of the climate fund transparent .
the shortage of this gas would be much more serious than oversupply .
not only does it deal thoroughly with the issue of carbon emissions , but it also forms part of a comprehensive climate policy .
for the most affected areas , an action plan is needed which includes the use of new plant species resistant to climate conditions , adaptation of the timetable for agricultural activities to new conditions , afforestation , the construction of greenhouse gases , management of agricultural waters and making polluted land less environmentally harmful .
provision of audiovisual media services ( codified version ) (
the Commission &apos;s proposal for a Council directive laying down principles for the organisation of veterinary checks on animals arriving in the Community from third countries ( codified version ) is a step in this direction and I support it .
the proposed charitable measure ( European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ) does not make people forget that , in fact , the European Union is directly responsible for the tragedy of the redundant workers , as it has opted for free and fair competition .
this is really important , because it means that Commissioner Verheugen should choose his words more carefully than he says that there are no problems .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I call and look forward to all of you there .
I think the answer to this question was given by the European Parliament , which recently gave me a new mandate , which shows that the European Parliament believes that I am credible in continuing this policy .
I think it is in Europe &apos;s interests to maintain global open markets .
we also see every year that , over a year , the Commission and the Council must use a number of specific measures that are not compatible with normal budgetary methods to finance the needs that we all knew were there from the start .
the first concerns the issue of implementing supervisory structures at European Union level .
in some Member States , such as my own , we are discussing not where to channel the money , but how much must be cut so that the costs are reasonable .
in this context , I cannot understand how the Swedish Presidency can claim that the Baltic Sea Strategy is a priority for it .
regional representatives have met in the open days held in Brussels in recent weeks and have said that they can use these funds very effectively by increasing participation in all possible policy areas .
for example , the leaders of one beneficiary country have said that the revenues of that country have increased significantly thanks to the enlargement of the European Union , which has given access to a large market .
this is an inexorable and difficult task .
what good practices have been introduced , particularly in view of the activities of the European Network of Women engaged in political and economic decision @-@ making ?
my answer to this question is &apos; yes &apos; .
from the Commission &apos;s point of view , the Bologna Process should in the coming years focus on how to further promote mobility in higher education , how to strengthen the social dimension through equal access to higher education and how to develop the global dimension of the process , which means cooperation between European higher education institutions and their global partners .
I will talk later about the studies that we have carried out and which we have evaluated on this subject , and it is absolutely clear that there are two sides to this coin .
as regards the long @-@ term measures mentioned in your resolution , we have set up a high @-@ level group .
another large group that should be considered is farmers in the new Member States , particularly small farmers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , yes , we should accept the inclusion of milk in Article 186 .
finally , I would also like to say that this cannot be a stalemate .
agenda of the next sitting : see Minutes
firstly , I believe that the European Council should be able to take final decisions to enforce the Treaty of Lisbon .
the Treaty of Lisbon has two fundamental objectives : on the one hand , to increase democracy in Europe , including parliamentary democracy , especially in relation to the European Parliament .
I do want it .
I hope that next week &apos;s summit will reach an agreement on the concept of funding .
these are not new issues .
this must not be allowed to happen .
the first concerns the Treaty of Lisbon : after the Irish &apos; yes &apos; , and when the Polish President signed the Treaty , the judgment of the Czech Constitutional Court is expected , and President Klaus must do what is necessary and sign the Treaty .
this means that the principle of unanimity remains binding on us in the European Union .
we will not achieve this by the end of the year , partly because we first need the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
one of the main objectives of the next European Council is to ensure the effectiveness of the UN climate conference in Copenhagen in December .
of course , we cannot rejoice because we would have preferred to have come to Parliament and talk about the real problems that people are asking us to solve , but we can laugh that at least Europe has arrived at a decision that even Mr di Pietro cannot question .
and we should ensure that this applies to the whole of Europe , because we should not just be discussing one particular country .
I share my group &apos;s concerns that , if Parliament had called for pan @-@ European media pluralism and ownership legislation , it would have contributed to the destruction of freedom of the press rather than to its creation .
we needed to state clearly the role of the European Parliament : we are a legislative body and not a decisive Tribunal for the internal affairs of the Member States .
we , together with the Council Secretariat , are working with the High Representative / Vice @-@ President to ensure that there is no difference .
some of our requests are intended to achieve the same result .
we are therefore concerned that the Treaty of Lisbon , if it were to become law , will create a number of developments that could ultimately undermine this prerogative .
consistency is crucial here .
this also applies to the EEAS , but the appointment of the candidate must also be based on merit , so that the service and gender mainstreaming must go hand in hand .
we have been working regularly and increasingly closely on crisis management , such as the US &apos;s participation in CSDP civilian missions , the EULEX Kosovo mission .
the final stage is the development of a statement aimed at renewing our transatlantic partnership in these areas .
secondly , in the case of conflicts , they are either because of the need to protect our economic interests - as in the case of Airbus - or because of our health or environmental rules - for example , hormone @-@ containing beef or chlorinated chicken meat , and we should not therefore place economic relations above our internal model , our social model , our environmental model and our development model , because economic relations cannot be an end in itself .
the SWIFT Agreement is necessary because it sets out specific data protection measures .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Malmström for her excellent detailed reply .
this is a continuing process in which progress has been painfully slow , but we hope that it is a tool that we can use to make progress .
I would also like to assure you that this is probably the case and that Sweden will continue to monitor this issue and take the necessary measures during its Presidency .
in fact , the response to the pandemic is primarily based on well @-@ equipped healthcare infrastructure , which could deal with cases as early as possible so that , when preventive tools are available , they are fairly accessible .
( RO ) I , too , would like to welcome the Commission &apos;s intention to support the Republic of Moldova .
the IMF delegation is currently in Chişinău .
the use of force which caused irreversible damage cannot be accepted either now or during any other period .
there is no truth about it , there are several facts , and often they conflict with each other .
this list of adjustments is usually presented every year and shows that the secretariat is doing a good job .
Mr Buzek kindly said that the reason could have been that he spoke too quickly .
Members of the European Parliament have confirmed today their support for a European cohesion policy that does indeed have the means to implement the objectives set .
however , I also believe that these Commission rights should only apply for a maximum of two years in order to ensure the smooth implementation of this package .
we , as one of the world &apos;s major players in trade and also development , have a huge responsibility .
I would also like to mention one point that has already been highlighted .
the notorious clampers , known as Basij , are now affiliated to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , which is yet another hostile organisation .
author . - Mr President , the people of Sri Lanka - Sinhals and , in particular , Tamils - have suffered immensely over the last 30 years from a ruthless terrorist campaign carried out by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) .
that is simply not true .
sadly , concessions cannot be imposed , because the exploitation of concessions for their purposes is a evil in nature .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which sets out the values or ideals on which the Union is based in all its power and which it is committed to when making decisions , would , of course , be an organic component or a real first part of such a constitution .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Treaty of Lisbon has ratified the 27 Member States of Europe , and it must produce results .
however , given how much we like Václav Havel &apos;s speech , we must actually strive for a common agreement whereby we need strong men and women in the most important political positions of the European Union and that individual interests , including those of those countries that are actually opposed to stronger integration , should remain a priority .
this is not possible because we will never be able to achieve the 2 ° C target .
in so doing , we are leading the countries of the South and forcing the Americans to reach an agreement .
we must show political will to transpose and implement the Treaty of Lisbon .
secondly , I want to reinstate the fundamental principle of the European Union what the European Union wants to achieve .
I think we should also reflect on this title .
( applause )
( PL ) Mr President , the forthcoming EU @-@ Russia Summit confirms that the European Union really regards relations with Russia as important .
otherwise , we will soon have to be concerned not only about the arrival of a bilateral ice period , but also about the gas crisis for the citizens who are sown in Europe .
in Ukraine , and particularly in the case of gas transit , we have worked with the Ukrainian authorities in the Commission , but also with international financial institutions , on the loan package , which would eliminate tax havens both for the storage and modernisation of gas from Russia and for Ukraine .
that is not very good .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , I am grateful that we are able to discuss this issue today , because it is so important .
that is why we were very pleased with the decision on the Services Directive , which we believe would mean that the rights to negotiate , to conclude and apply collective agreements and to take industrial measures in accordance with national legislation and practice would not be undermined .
the directive has opened up a number of opportunities for both consumers and businesses .
in my opinion , defining political priorities means that they should be investigated and they should be transparent and democratic .
patients &apos; relatives are also suffering from the disease .
for these reasons , the Council is of the opinion , while the Council was unable to provide a specific amount of funding for developing countries , nor was it able to say anything about funding for world forest preservation , at a time when there is no coherent policy or coordination at European Union level on the protection of ecosystems at risk in southern Europe .
this decision will make it easier for Poweo to install a metal terminal Antifer and restrict the project to create a Fécampi near @-@ shore wind park , despite the support that local elected representatives , people and even fishermen are showing for this project .
that is the case , Mr President .
these are : firstly , that public expenditure is of high quality , that money should not be squandered ; secondly , that social security systems and sustainable development are respected ; thirdly , that the policy of full implementation of sufficient quality is not abandoned and , fourthly , that climate change is combated .
however , it must be asked what part of these not just the small sums have reached those who are most affected by the crisis or who are suffering most from this difficult situation .
here we are all democrats , and therefore we are fighting for freedom .
( es ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very concerned about the suspension of the San José Agreement .
I agree with my colleagues that the 2005 approach to country of origin marking must be adopted .
they go hand in hand .
in this respect , it would be appropriate to draw attention to the progress made by the Bank in cooperation with NGOs and other stakeholders in civil society , which has made the cooperation mentioned easier and more transparent , and we welcome that .
the second and perhaps even more important thing is the right of intervention given to the Ombudsman with such definitions , but the Ombudsman &apos;s intervention may probably appear to be arbitrary to the other institutions , as it has not been properly demarcated and regulated .
I believe that Mr Diamandouros has been effective and consistent and has worked to draw attention to issues relating to increasing transparency and its lack of transparency .
the procedure is made up of a number of components and will be difficult , depending on the extent to which the European Parliament and the Council reach an agreement , or even more likely if they do not achieve it to a large extent .
however , I want to make it clear that the Council can participate in our meetings at any time .
this means not only that the rights of migrants in the situation in question are violated , but also that they are subject to unacceptable pressure and blackmail .
I hope that the energy dialogue and the commitments made at the forthcoming EU @-@ Russia Summit will lead , in the long term , to greater transparency and capacity in the energy sector and , through commercial and economic cooperation , to the creation of new essential relations between the two blocs .
unfortunately , it is not possible to cure the disease at the moment , and its prevention and treatment knowledge is also limited .
( DE ) Mr President , at a time of climate change and global warming , it is obvious that we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save energy .
53 % of industrial GDP , 9 % of jobs in industry and 12 % of exports .
in the House that took place in May , I have already presented my views to you and announced that the Commission would continue its reforms by consulting a great many next year on the broader application of the principles for reporting on the scope of the future universal service and data breaches .
this compromise sends a clear signal to the Member States that things like the French Hadopi law or the UK &apos;s Mandelson method are simply unacceptable .
I have still not decided how I will ultimately vote because , as I said , there is a lot of good in this package .
this is a debate in which both procedural and substantive problems have arisen .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , these reports set out rules for Europol on how to collect and exchange the most personal information of EU citizens and also with third countries .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as shadow rapporteur for one document on Europol , I can only repeat what has already been said by the Members who have spoken before me .
the most vague in the decision is control by the European Parliament .
just now , Mr Coelho raised the issue , which has been mentioned by others , including Mrs Vergiat , and which has given us a lot of food for thought .
such assistance is not particularly significant , given the real difficulties faced by this country , the economic crisis and also the problems posed by the war with Russia , which have significantly slowed down the economic development of Georgia .
the most important thing is that we be able to start to exercise our rights in practice as soon as possible .
now is the time for agreement .
at the same time , it is necessary to conclude agreements to ensure that these funds make an active and effective contribution to reducing climate change , as well as agreements on technology transfer and the protection of intellectual property rights .
we have four weeks and there is a momentum in the negotiations .
let them become aware of their great responsibility .
as far as technologies are concerned , we must abstain .
thirdly , politics must take into account the scientific debate .
without them , we are on the road to climate , political and moral disaster .
we should also have referred to biopiraticism and the autonomous property rights of indigenous peoples , as these are important tools for combating climate change .
Mr President , this was a very interesting debate with some extraordinary and constructive interventions .
this is the only way in which we can maintain production in the European Union and , consequently , jobs .
in order to meet the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda , we must provide adequate incentives for investment in new high @-@ speed networks in order to support the renewal of content @-@ based internet services and to increase the competitiveness of the European Union at international level .
long @-@ term experience of data collection on the sale and use of pesticides has shown the need for uniform methods for the collection of statistical data , not only at national level but also at Community level .
Parliament must fully assume its new powers in these matters .
there was no conviction .
we will have time to learn to use the new arrangements to achieve the best results in terms of the greater role of the European Union in the world .
President of the Commission . - I agree with your general opinion that the institutions are also as we are practically shaping them .
this is necessary because , if these problems are not resolved , the External Action Service will simply be something partial without the necessary budgetary provisions and without the necessary capacity to determine content .
it is also of great interest to improve cooperation with countries of origin and transit .
for example , in the fight against illegal immigration , we must not simply take the view of an NGO , we must be a serious partner .
that is all very well , but there are already some first signs and trends in restricting , banning and , sooner or later , penalising the so @-@ called &apos; political correctness consensus &apos; .
European rules are based on Community rules and case law of the European courts , but they are also a source of the activities of workers , businesses , students and judges operating in both national and European networks .
nevertheless , it is important to ensure that the objectives set are met .
the first is formative .
it is certainly an effective instrument for further developing the area of freedom , security and justice , which citizens so much want .
moreover , Member States are obliged to ensure that no article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights is in breach of return , which obliges Member States to ensure that the person is not returned to his country if he may be subjected to persecution or serious attacks when he returns .
what concerns the House and I am concerned that the security situation in Afghanistan is such that we do not know whether someone can be returned there .
however , let me also make it clear that we are both waiting and demanding that this step be marked by a change in the Council &apos;s attitude towards Parliament .
the first was that the Council refused to accept any formal , formal meeting with Parliament .
question Time ( Council )
this comes at a time when both the Commission and the Member States are equally stressing the need to reduce consumption and the possibility of price comparison with the aim of changing supplier in their energy envelopes .
Commissioner , do you ask all goods sellers to have a direct contact number where people encounter problems can contact directly with those who have sold faulty goods or services ?
potential savings from the measures proposed by the Commission but not yet adopted by the legislators amount to EUR 31 billion a year .
what do you have to say to women who , under the pretext of equality between men and women , have been told that their retirement age must be increased for between 5 and 18 years , as is happening in Greece ?
it is already the case that the Commission of the workers &apos; representatives of Dell is here today showing how close the fund is to Dell &apos;s workers and how much they value it .
thanks to the funds that have been received for people who have lost their jobs , both for workers in the Belgian textile industry and for workers in the Dell factory in Ireland , there is a direct opportunity for retraining and finding new employment .
the Euro @-@ Mediterranean trade area also has a South @-@ South dimension .
if this money had been spent on safety , we would have a European railway market and the safety on the agenda today would be guaranteed .
we have a number of common problems and they also exist in Slovakia and Hungary , such as problems with Romanians .
unfortunately , Sinn Fein has used culture and , in particular , language as a weapon in its anti @-@ state campaign , which has led to inconsistencies and disputes .
( SK ) I actually wanted to reply to Lajos Bokros , but you did not give me the floor .
we cannot negotiate to exclude scientific advice and we must at least reach an agreement that meets the 2 ° C objective .
or are we threatened by the intensification of conflicts on Europe &apos;s borders arising from the purchase of gas , oil and other raw materials ?
I would like to make it clear that I am not ashamed of what the leader of the Conservative Party has said or did , and it is particularly clear to all of us what we have always said - if the Lisbon Treaty had not been ratified , we would have liked the British people to have been asked to have an opinion on it .
( protests )
we are also forced to carry out an evaluation to learn from experience .
it is our duty to question the incomprehensible trade that surrounds these appointments arising from the Treaty of Lisbon .
this will continue to be one of the main tasks of the European Union and also of the new Commission .
in any case , I would like to thank all the candidates from my own region , particularly the President of Estonia , Toomas Hendrik Ilves , and the former President of Latvia , Vaira Vīķe @-@ Freibergis .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , we should be happy today because we have overcome institutional problems .
( DE ) Mr President , just now , the translation referred to Article 20 , not Article 22 , and it is difficult for us to understand in this way what you are planning .
but what has been said a thousand times , therefore , may not be the right thing yet .
Auditors report consistently that the control of the use of EU funds is insufficient in the Member States .
how can European citizens believe that the European Union is good for them in allowing such tricks ?
the efforts of industrialised countries and emerging economies that are better off should be comparable .
additional funds must also be allocated at the expense of payments by countries that signed a global agreement , which reflect the economic development and solvency of these countries .
the current situation confirms that these predictions were valid .
in this respect , I would point out that drawing up plans in line with the framework set out in Paris in July 2008 , in strategic areas such as new infrastructure , cooperation between SMEs , the use of communications and renewable energy sources can contribute to development and facilitating exchanges and investments , which is desperately needed by countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean .
ensuring safety is our priority .
I believe that Europe must be open and that we should remain faithful to the enlargement process , which leads to good governance , the rule of law , reconciliation , peace and prosperity for the ever larger regions of Europe .
I would say something else about Kosovo , which was also mentioned by the previous speaker .
we should offer Ukraine a clear accession option .
as a candidate country , Turkey is already receiving EUR 2.26 billion between 2007 and 2010 .
therefore , we should all be encouraged amicably to find a long @-@ term solution on both sides , with broad scope and scope .
as far as the European Parliament is concerned , the names with which everyone has agreed must be used , and this candidate country has been agreed to use the name &apos; former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia &apos; , not Macedonia .
I do not see the European Union as a nearby union .
most importantly , however , bilateral disputes should be resolved by involving the parties involved .
women who can freely exploit all their potential are at risk of violence less than women who are marginalised .
and since it is a question of criminal law , it is a question of an independent state , and it is up to the state to take the lead .
in Europe , for example , 20 @-@ 25 % of women are estimated to be victims of physical violence during their adult lives , and 10 % of women are even subjected to sexual violence .
however , we all know that much more needs to be done .
furthermore , I do not see what value the EU can add , and I think that the money could be better spent on other projects that the Commission is already pursuing .
in fact , tuna fishing vessels are particularly vulnerable because , on the one hand , they have a very low level of free fishing and , on the other , they are mobile and unmanoeuvred during the fishing of young fish - that is , between four and five hours and more .
now we can help these people and prevent their illness in the future , and we must take advantage of this opportunity .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( Thursday , 26 November 2009 ) .
finally , in the Annual Report on decent Work 2008 , there is a requirement to monitor policies relating to ratification .
more than a billion people in the world are currently not satisfied with the daily need for food and there is a risk that the situation in many developing countries will deteriorate , partly due to climate change , which creates additional problems for these countries in terms of public food security .
but can we really be clear about consciousness here if a child dies of hunger every five seconds ?
and thirdly , food security and everything that it entails for the European Union means costs .
( es ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , following the recent FAO World Summit on Food Security , I would like to say how disappointed I am with its modest social , journalistic and political impact .
very detailed norms and requirements have been laid down at the level of the World Organisation for Animal Health to avoid the spread of foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease .
the Health Card must be clean if we want to reassure farmers , taxpayers and consumers that they are protected and that free and fair trade can continue between Brazil and the EU .
the problem is that both the Commission and the Food and veterinary Office consistently confuse their findings and negative information .
of course , I am a joke , but if the rules are applied , they must be the same and mandatory for everyone .
it is therefore too early to assess whether changes to rules or systems have reduced the error rate .
I believe it must be reiterated that the Court of Auditors must always retain independence and autonomy when it comes to doing its work , which is vital for proper assessments and good decisions to be made .
is the Commission prepared , for example , to ask for money back to those countries that should not have been spending ?
would it also be possible to add information on the effectiveness of policies in the future ?
it is also very important that these improvements in the transposition of European legislation are implemented much more emphatically in procurement rules and that the powers necessary to resolve various problems and ensure compliance with the rules are improved , particularly in the Member States themselves .
the aim here is to find inaccurate and incorrect data in all areas of expenditure and then correct the errors found .
the agreement has been implemented for all world books published in English and in countries where the Convention applies .
so I say : &apos; every cow a copy of his or her vagant and therefore every book &apos; and every author and artist with his or her copyright and intellectual rights .
Joanna Senyszyn accused the Catholic Church of oppression of women .
unfortunately , I see the problem of hunger and poverty resolved as a media issue rather than a specific problem that requires urgent action .
the EU cannot remain a club closed for other European countries , but the EU cannot keep its doors open .
in writing . - ( FR ) I very much welcome the vote of the European Parliament on the resolution on the elimination of violence against women , yet on the International Day for the elimination of Violence against Women .
on the other hand , I believe that Member States should promote smoke @-@ free policies , but at the same time they must not impose restrictions on the freedom of choice of service providers , especially in the hotel sector , where owners should be able to choose whether or not they want to be smoke free .
we do not believe that these support measures and payments will increase food security in the long term in developing countries .
it should not be forgotten that Johannes Cornelis van Baalen is Chairman of the liberal InterNational and Friedrich Naumann Foundation &apos;s website states that he discussed the coup d &apos;état with the armed forces of Nicaragua .
the leaders of the student movement initiated by students and teachers 10 years ago are still being held in secret custody in Laos , under military dictatorship .
it is certainly all represented : Tibet , the Dalai Lama and his successor , religious crushing and , in the event that something had been forgotten , even criticism of all the existing , past and future communist regimes .
I recently visited Pakistan , where I met with the President , Prime Minister and senior ministers to discuss human rights and counter @-@ terrorism issues .
( el ) Mr President , the fact that the Commissioner here , Mariann Fischer Boel , mentioned the text on the review of the Community budget in connection with the common agricultural policy as inadequate , at the meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament is a very good sign .
there are a number of legal , psychological and technical problems that need to be overcome in order to connect national airspace and to make all national inspection authorities work together .
as far as vegetables are concerned , the economic crisis has reduced local consumption and we have also seen a reduction in some export markets .
in this sector , the rules that deal with intervention in the event of a market crisis do not allow us to react adequately to the needs of farmers and of the agricultural sector , even though there are very difficult times in the entire agricultural sector , but particularly in the fruit and vegetable sector , for example , in the cultivation of apples and peaches , and in the cereal sector , such as wheat and swearing .
price stability is necessary at consumer level because , due to other financial commitments , such as mortgages , children &apos;s raising and leisure costs , consumers will no longer have enough money to deal with price volatility .
now to the question of the regulatory framework - I did not hear exactly that wording , but I think that is what was meant by these comments on this subject .
public information is now also necessary .
( it ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to mention that a number of months ago , a colleague from my Namibia outside the World Trade Organisation , whose member I am , expressed my disappointment at the fact that the prices of certain European agricultural products and other products are much lower compared to local products in Namibia .
you told us that the European Social Fund must not be used as the only source of funding .
we should carefully analyse the impact of funding in order to see whether we have used best practices and where we have been able to make a real contribution to finding jobs , but above all where we have been able to reintegrate redundant workers into the labour market as quickly and efficiently as possible .
( FR ) Mr President , I would point out that , during the previous debate , you referred to this debate as a debate on the Progress programme .
in this regard , Parliament took a wise decision in 2006 that the European Social Fund &apos;s resources could also be paid as micro @-@ credit or interest @-@ rate loans , as set out in Article 11 of the European Social Fund Regulation .
unfortunately , however , it is not the people who will soon be able to lose their jobs , and it is they who will be the ones who will be most familiar with the effects of the current crisis .
I would like to reassure you once again that it was not easy to make this decision , and I do not think that this was the only solution and , when we discuss the compromise , we will certainly find a good solution , at least I hope so .
I imagine that even if all Members were present here today , there would be very few of you who dared to say that they understand them .
this register should be an important element in protecting consumers , including the youngest and most helpless .
I would remind the European Parliament that , in 2008 , when we adopted the 2009 budget , we designated the competitiveness , growth and employment of the European Union as our priorities .
if the system is not satisfied , the system must be changed .
colleagues , listen to your conscience and vote against this budget .
however , the annual request for more resources available freely goes against this principle .
the Commission &apos;s special report on the use of EU funds in Bulgaria up to summer this year did not mention Kozloduy , although it has been allocated funding under the PHARE programme .
the second point concerns the inclusion in the budget of pensions paid to workers in the European Union .
I would like to draw attention to the speech by my colleague , Mr Godman , who mentioned that some Member States have been unable to manage financial support for more than a year .
the drafting of the EU budget in the context of the economic crisis and the Treaty of Nice during the transition to the Treaty of Lisbon was a very difficult task .
it helps businesses all over Wales , and I am disappointed that colleagues from UKIP were not able to support this progressive initiative .
secondly , there is one thing that we do not understand , and that is the genetic technology that you , Mr Barroso , are in favour of and which is part of the health portfolio and no longer an environmental or agricultural portfolio .
it is a mistake that the Commission has had good programmes , but the Member States do what they think they are good .
we have supported this idea not only morally but also financially .
we believe that , in some cases , it makes more sense to spend the euro at European level rather than at national level if it supports the European dimension and the internal market .
the EU will continue to strongly support and closely work with the US in the Quartet .
I have a number of objections to the Council statement in principle .
we saw hopeful navies in the face of Palestinian representatives .
I regret that we have heard too much today about Israel &apos;s democratic state .
there are already a number of cases where people have been wrongly listed for years and have had to fight for fair trials .
Article 215 deals with the role of Parliament and the Council , and the legislator should not deviate from the Treaty .
basically , Article 215 seems to be the most appropriate article .
we must facilitate access to documents .
in addition , other legally protected rights such as data protection or the right to privacy have been neglected .
I am very proud to have played my part in creating this together with Michael Cashman and with the contribution made by the Commission by Margot Wallström .
it remains to be seen whether the new EU leaders will be able to prove their worth in this case .
let me speak about the Tagliavini report .
it is certainly not necessary to change the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact - no one has asked for that .
it is also possible to help the European Investment Bank by offering targeted credit to small and medium @-@ sized enterprises in the region , while at the same time the EU institutions could adapt the rules on the use of cohesion and structural funds to bring them into line with this extreme situation .
of course , liquidity is always a precondition for creditworthiness , and it is therefore particularly important to have discussions on the creditworthiness of companies , banks and workers .
we are already working in a number of areas in line with what he has put forward .
the new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe have proved most vulnerable .
I think we need to start by education and information .
we must say that subsidiarity is a rule of European law that does not apply in this case , because its concepts and application have nothing to do with this case .
of course , all the European institutions , organisations and courts must respect and recognise the principle of subsidiarity , above all , freedom of opinion or freedom of religion .
Mr President , could you discuss this with the rapporteur , Mr Martin , to find a solution as soon as possible ?
it was a victory for European cooperation .
I now expect our partners to do the same .
the European Union should lead the peace process and should be the main force for peace in the Middle East .
as regards the adoption of the Stockholm Programme , we support the principle that the Member States of the Union must work more together to combat the problems associated with immigration , cross @-@ border crime and terrorism .
this is not necessarily the fault of the Swedish Presidency , but rather of the European Commission .
in writing . - The Treaty of Lisbon has given the green light and created all the necessary conditions for institutional reforms .
these situations , which are occurring at an alarming rate , require decision @-@ makers to think carefully about both the European economic and social model and its sustainability and future .
its main thrust , however , is the emphasis on full liberalisation of the world market .
this report is not clear enough in its approach and it also says too little about past failures and data protection issues .
what is happening , however ?
Pakistan is a country which has undergone major changes in recent years .
thus , our civil aid represents more than 20 % of Afghanistan &apos;s annual GDP - a sum that , if used correctly , can change its fate .
we need a radical change of strategy that drives away from the military and goes in particular towards a more human @-@ centred strategy .
the sense of Fortress is also widespread in the main cities , despite the ongoing commitment of ISAF forces and monitoring activities .
however , I agree that we need to act more effectively .
although I understand the historical and political circumstances of Belarus , I strongly believe that the time has come for Belarus , too , to join those countries that have abolished the death penalty .
just a few weeks ago , a conference took place in Brussels , involving representatives of civil society .
the EU is firmly committed to contributing to the population of this country for peace , stability and development .
in addition , last month , a group of Congolese women here had to rightly remind us of this , with a view to our support for this shameful strategy .
therefore , the rapid response of the European Union is crucial .
in these conclusions , the Council welcomed Serbia &apos;s commitment to EU integration and its work on implementing key reforms in line with European standards .
the agenda of all these events has given priority to climate issues , so a large number of meetings have taken place .
in reply to your question , I would say that without a comprehensive and comprehensive directive , it is very difficult to set standards for discrimination against disabled people in Europe .
I think that all Members of this House will support these efforts .
however , this cannot be excused for delays and the European Court of Justice has not accepted such delays in the six decisions taken so far .
I do not think we can solve this issue as a composition of the current Commission , nor is it any point in trying to do so .
we need to reach a new era of business innovation where we work together in Europe to produce top @-@ class products in the world .
with regard to your question on the Commission &apos;s intention to publish the White Paper on territorial cohesion , I note that there is currently no provision for a separate White Paper on this subject .
it has also been incorporated into the Lisbon Strategy and the EU 2020 strategy .
the debate on the post @-@ 2013 budget and the future objectives of this policy must involve all actors - Member States , regions , the Commission and the European Parliament .
in my opinion , the speeches have two main points to make .
obstacles between the various funds must be removed so that as many resources can be allocated as possible .
I repeat , this information should have been communicated to us yesterday , before the joint resolution debate .
rapporteur . - Mr President , it was proposed to vote on Amendments 3 and 7 , the text of which is the same , in three parts , and to propose an oral amendment to the second part .
European military intervention helped to prevent a situation like Rwanda .
I would also like to point out that energy security is vital for the Union , and I therefore welcome the signing of the Nabucco project .
today , we adopted the European Union budget for 2010 , with a total budget of almost EUR 123 billion .
this is often linked to the plundering of raw materials and the illegal use of rebel or state troops and its leaders .
I will therefore return to the agenda .
I asked for the floor simply to add my voice to those of others before we vote later .
we call on the Azerbaijani authorities to release imprisoned journalists immediately .
2 .
Mr President , we often say that let us not be afraid to lead .
our aim must be to prevent such situations in the European Union .
the public consultation ran until the end of last week , i.e. until 15 January , and we will still have hearings for the new Commission , which is only scheduled for its posts in February next year .
the European food surplus must be sent to the people of Haiti as a matter of urgency .
( FR ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton .
I do not agree with those of us who claim that the presence of soldiers and other legal protesters can be declared the beginning of our colonial attitude towards Haiti .
secondly , as regards civil protection and its coordination , EU civil protection coordination has been strengthened and greatly enhanced since the tsunami in 2004 .
the state rejected the hand of President Obama and also rejected the most recent plan proposed by six , including Russia and France .
I see no better way forward for the people of Iran .
I do not have the power to speak on behalf of the Iranian regime of time or its anti @-@ democratic attitudes .
I do not think that this gives us a very good impression of the failure of the bomb attack on the plane causing just general discussions on Yemen .
we must help to combat this .
there are not many ways of combating terrorism , and the way in which the West has been elected is certainly not one of them .
Mr President , I , too , would like to thank the High Representative for his words , which struck the optimism that was so much needed .
over the last few months , there has been encouragement of a reconfiguration of unions which has made a significant contribution to overcoming the ethnil @-@ religious divides that have marked Iraq &apos;s policy over recent years .
we fully support Iraq &apos;s remaining a unitary and sovereign state .
in your report , you express your concern that the conclusion of economic cooperation agreements and the increase in regional distribution could damage the cohesion of the ACP countries .
above all , and mainly , this freedom should be free of bureaucracy , which is becoming increasingly excessive in the ACP countries and which is constantly hampering economic growth .
it would be just a loophole in the ocean , but it would be symbolic and would show that we really mean all the remote words that have been spoken in this House .
Interestingly , British courts seem to be ashamed to use this clause to prevent transfers .
thank you , Mr Watson .
this issue will be brought to the attention of the Spanish Presidency over the next six months , and this has undoubtedly been supported by a number of arguments in all the speeches that I have heard and viewed from various points of view : we need to move towards harmonised procedural guarantees .
finally , during 2010 , the Commission will publish its first report on the implementation of the Directive on residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who are victims of trafficking and cooperate with the competent authorities .
the two main parameters that I would like to emphasise without reducing the importance of other parameters are as follows : firstly , the European institutional framework for combating this crime , which is cross @-@ border and exacerbated by illegal immigration - as has rightly been said here - is insufficient .
it is therefore very important to strengthen cooperation between Member States and with third countries in order to ensure dialogue with non @-@ governmental organisations and to call on the Commission to establish a European coordinator for dealing with these issues .
I believe that a strong information campaign is needed to improve prevention measures , particularly for minors who come from disadvantaged areas and social strata .
progress has been made in the field of energy , but no progress has been made .
in my opinion , the next six months will be the springboard when we set ambitious targets - the goals that I presented in my political guidelines and which we discussed here in the European Parliament last autumn .
not because it would not have been possible to implement it .
unfortunately , our group considers that your plan does not solve fundamental problems .
Mr Schulz , thank you for your speech .
( LT ) I , too , hope that the Spanish Presidency will be successful and that , in addition to the priorities presented , Spain will also devote attention to a problem that is particularly important at this time , namely human rights and fundamental freedoms .
of course , if we do not confuse Haiti with Tahlean .
the European Parliament was disappointed with the compromise reached by the Council last December on financial supervision .
now that we are coming out of the financial crisis , its emphasis on economic growth and job creation is very important for all of us , and I am looking forward to working with my fellow Members of the Socialist Government .
I would like to talk about immigration .
this should be one of the priorities of both the current Presidency and the subsequent Presidencies .
in this small Asian country , ethnic and religious minorities are still discriminated against , and Ankara is stubbornly refusing to recognise Cyprus , which is an EU Member State .
according to the latest figures from 2008 , 3 406 complaints were submitted in 2008 , up from 3211 in the year before .
the outermost regions can act as the main intermediaries of the EU in EPAs .
the agreement will officially expire on 31 January .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am before the European Parliament today to share with you my views on the results of the Copenhagen Summit and the challenges arising from the summit , both for the European Union and for the rotating Presidency , which is Spain , in the first half of 2010 .
we must be innovative both in relation to the carbon market and set a price cap and be innovative in terms of financing methods .
I would be pleased to see that we appoint this 30 % target to the UN Secretariat on 31 January in Bonn , not the old 20 % target .
this should make us think again , because we have always stressed that it is precisely in the global fight against climate change that we want to take the lead .
so I think it is absolutely essential - and I echo what Mr Lepage said - that in a few time &apos; time , we should consider the introduction of a carbon tax at the borders of the European Union .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Copenhagen Accord agreed to a 20 % target for 180 countries , but it is still not legally binding .
firstly , I believe that one of our problems is the lack of moderation and realism , as my fellow Members have already said .
priority funding would be given to measures that would help to reduce emissions in real terms for the lowest costs .
the time has come when no effort appears to be sufficient when we talk about the future on the planet , which we all share together .
I think you started your work very well this week .
for example , the High Level Group of the Member States comes together every six months to share experiences of social responsibility .
that is what the Treaty ultimately provides for .
this is simply not the case in today &apos;s Europe .
I do not understand at all how the government intends to deepen its democratic opening in such a situation .
the PKK is like a mafia whose members commit crimes , obtain money and provide support .
political murders and violence by law enforcement authorities continue .
the work to be done to this end has now started , with the development of our planning documents for a number of years , and the transition from project @-@ specific programmes to sectoral programmes .
this is why I hope that the new Commission will consider this issue and not hamper funding in the public @-@ private partnerships .
this means that my brother &apos;s winter in the region is in danger .
I also welcome the fact that the strategy was included in the eighteen @-@ month programme of the future Presidencies of the European Union .
it seems that the new Danube Strategy is likely to be approved under the Hungarian Presidency .
EU @-@ Tunisia relations are governed by the Association Agreement signed in 1995 .
the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left contributed a great deal to the organisation of the debate .
a quarter of politicians , local officials and journalists are women .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - Mr President , anyone who is committed to democratic rights and freedom of expression of religious beliefs condemns the murders of Christians in Egypt and also bomb attacks on Christian churches in Malaysia .
so I welcome this resolution .
Mr President , China is a country with a great deal of rich history and enormous potential for development .
by the way , we are also involved in the protection of the right to sexual expression and orientation , as Mrs Trüpel mentioned .
this is the biggest massacre of journalists in world history .
although this trial could have replaced the death penalty with life imprisonment , the Prosecutor rejected this possibility at the end of January .
if you think , for example , of the situation of train stations , this is essentially similar to that of airports .
it is no secret that gambling goes hand in hand with criminality , violence , organised crime , prostitution and various other related phenomena .
I am not going to make an exhaustive comment and will focus on the main changes .
as regards the amendments aimed at establishing more defined rules for the protection of private data , I would like to stress that , in any case , Member States are forced to respect existing Community legislation on this issue and that these rules must therefore be respected without further amending the draft directive .
however , as my grandmother once said , this is another story .
I sincerely hope that it will be adopted in our plenary session on Wednesday .
that is why the issue of information exchange is important , where we need to review the decisions taken in international organisations , such as the OECD , which has really investigated the matter as such .
as we have heard before , gross domestic product is now at a crisis point in various parts of Europe .
we must ensure that we do not penalise honest citizens who do not pay taxes away from them .
the European Commission was next to the achievement of General Motors triumphant .
Spyker cars will change the transaction of EUR 400 million to Spykks , but - note - it is not a normal business deal where one company pays and another is paid .
( RO ) I would like to start with three vitally important issues .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Marc Tarabella , for the support expressed in Parliament for the approach and measures taken by the European Commission to promote gender equality .
it is time to take important steps towards improving the lives of most women , including in the area of sexual and reproductive health , and to put an end to the hypocrisy surrounding abortion .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , the motion for a resolution by Mr Tarabella , who joined us in the last European elections , is ambitious .
there are several aspects to this and many of them have been included in this report .
in my opinion , this is the solution we should work towards , particularly in challenging economic times .
women are better hit , for example , by micro @-@ enterprises , but their participation in the management of large companies is rather low .
there are measures to achieve equal pay , and now it is time to put them into practice .
and , not least , they are also the fruit of intensive discussions with this House .
the answer to the question of whether the European Union is being taken into account in the world was to be seen in Copenhagen .
every time there is a chance for a political Europe , we violate it .
Mr Szájer , you cannot deny that we now have a better team than during the original hearing of the first candidate from Bulgaria .
( FR ) Mr President , we have reached the end of the previous procedure for the appointment of commissioners , with the hearings being nothing unusual .
it also excludes the sui generis structure .
I would also like to express my vision of the work of the European Commission and its objectives .
we can see that the majority of the political spectrum supports us ; this is an important moment for Europe - a real , encouraging mandate .
we hope that you will accept this preference and come up with clear , firm and ambitious proposals and reforms in all these areas .
would we employ a assistant who would be a laughing stock like Mr Oettinger in the slogan &apos; Oettinger to Yemen &apos; ( ee Oettinger is trying to speak English ) .
Mr President , I voted against the appointment of the new European Commission because the Commission would simply continue with the same right @-@ wing neoliberal economic policy , which has caused catastrophic crises in the capitalist economies of many EU Member States .
increasing the number of meetings between the Commission and the institutions involved in Parliament will not help us create a more effective European policy .
moreover , Baroness Ashton never gave us the impression that she was able to fulfil the responsibilities of the Commissioner &apos;s office .
when we talk about economic and financial problems ( Lisbon Strategy , supervision in the euro area ) , we are all well aware of the failures of the previous Commission .
this is a very dangerous trend .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) I do not think that , unlike representatives of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I support the intervention of the Commission .
no Member State in this zone will be able to come out of the crisis , regardless of its export strategy , deficit or level of public debt , if one of the links is under attack .
however , my country and other countries have lost their statements and current policies .
after all , it must be said that the euro has been incredibly successful in this most severe financial crisis .
firstly , it seems to me that , during the debate , there has been general trust in the euro area .
however , let us not forget the victims - those who are victims of terrorism !
because you said very categorically , Mr Papanikolaou , that there are illegal prisons in Europe , including in Poland and Romania .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great honour for me to be here on behalf of the Council Presidency .
by then , in the Mediterranean , there will no longer be a fish poet , but people will still be able to eat the fat if they continue to eat the money .
politics must be fair , so we need to find a solution that protects tuna , but does not penalise fishermen who use traditional fishing methods .
let us therefore bravely and respectfully do our duty , as is the case with the European Union .
together , we stressed that this was , in fact , already an agreement under the Treaty of Nice .
for this reason , we should consider carefully the targeted use of certain resources at European Union level only to completely clean up some of the first @-@ level areas of local administrative units .
( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , first of all , let me highlight the rapporteur , Mr van Nistelrooij , who worked hard to achieve consensus and was always ready to take the other proposals that others have proposed into his report .
let me remind you of the conclusions on Croatia adopted by the Council in December .
however , the Commission is concerned because the Constitutional Court decided to terminate the activities of the party supporting the Kurds ( Democratic Society Party , DTP ) in parliament .
this means that we recognise that the policy of minority groups in these two countries is better than in many Member States of the European Union , and that all minorities and ethnic groups in both countries are represented in their respective governments .
1 .
bringing Croatia into the family of the Member States of the European Union is part of our strategy to build a democratic and prosperous continent .
finally , we must not forget that Turkey , with 90 million inhabitants , will be the country with the highest population in the European Union by 2030 .
this reference makes the problem an international problem , because indeed it is not a bilateral problem but an international problem , and sends out a more precise message than just hope that the problem will be resolved by itself .
we want to support the membership of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , and we therefore call for the method of consensus , which forms part of the history of the European Union , and we call on the European institutions to offer their favourable support for the views of all Member States on the causes that are still an obstacle .
the Greek Government knows that the process needs a new impetus and has made a firm decision that the problem must be solved .
furthermore , we cannot break the promises we have made to candidate countries , although we should also respect the well @-@ known principles of consolidation and conditionality .
I understand that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a new independent state at a later ethnogenetic stage .
however , the country continues to face a number of urgent challenges , including political criteria .
Mr President , I had understood the representative of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Mr Brantner , and I recommend voting in favour of the first part and against the second part , contrary to the list we have drawn up .
we intend to allow a rescue package , obviously against Article 125 of the Treaties .
we must ask ourselves how to make progress in cooperation with other countries .
women still earn less than men , they run the greater risk of falling into poverty and it is more difficult to develop an academic or business career .
( SK ) People &apos;s country , which is making efforts to join the European Union , must identify with it internally not only the minimum standards of democracy and respect for human rights .
it has this responsibility and the necessary means to fulfil this obligation .
in writing . - The increased mobility of both people and capital is the basis for the EU and this principle has worked very well .
I am very pleased with the recent commitments to write off Haiti &apos;s debts and I call on all aid countries to contribute to long @-@ term and sustainable reconstruction .
it is vital that we relaunch dialogue with Iran .
therefore , whatever you think about this , illegal immigrants demand their status and that wealth , and you give them that .
new climate diplomacy is needed to achieve this objective .
the European Parliament reiterates its objective of increasing this reduction to 30 % .
it is regrettable that the text does not address the main problem and does not attempt to put the issue of a fair distribution of wealth created for the common good on the agenda of European policy .
it also stresses that women must be able to obtain free advice on abortion .
since then , the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas decided at its annual meeting to significantly reduce catches of bluefin tuna by 13 500 tonnes , and the European Commission again voiced its concerns about the decline in tuna stocks and committed itself to conducting more reliable research into this .
international trade in endangered species is estimated to amount to billions of dollars a year and covers hundreds of millions of plant and animal species .
some of the opponents of Turkey &apos;s integration are guided by reasons that are not related to the nuclear issue at all , but others fear that , as Turkey is a large country , it will have a significant influence on EU decisions , since , according to the Treaty of Lisbon , the right to vote in each Member State depends on the number of people in the country .
all countries have tried to improve internal and external coordination , to obtain more information and , finally , to cooperate with other actors in the same fight .
I would like to make this very clear .
we are ready to consider postponing the vote , but if this cannot be done , we should vote in favour .
they have listened to our institution quite suddenly , and I hope it will be repeated in the future as well .
but I think we need to understand and remember why we have an interim agreement .
we must not stop trying to monitor the flow of money and to identify the source of funding used to support terrorism .
however , such an inventory does not mean my complete ignorance that the threat of terrorism has not been reduced .
we need to think about what kind of Europe we want to live in , because there is no complete security .
it has only managed to exacerbate the problem .
Manchester Airport , where one scanner is tested , confirms that black @-@ white images are not pornographic or erosy , are viewed by one remote official and are destroyed immediately after the review .
Ukraine itself decides what model it wants to use .
Commissioner , be courageous and be the first to say that the place is there .
we in the European Union must support the legacy of the Orange Revolution and the shared democratic values shared with Ukraine .
I would like to emphasise that Hungary , which is the largest neighbour , is particularly interested in creating political and economic stability in Ukraine .
I thank the Council representative for his reply .
it was also conditional on the systematic monitoring by the WTO , the OECD and the Commission of trade restrictive measures .
Mr President , in the current global economy , most national borders allow for more efficient movement of people , capital and services .
I am not talking about protectionism here , but a policy that creates a level playing field that our producers do not have at the moment .
if the proposal had been adopted , it would have cost the European economy EUR 2 billion , and the Community population would have lost hundreds of jobs .
the next item is the debate on the proposal for a Council directive implementing the Framework Agreement between Elizabeth Lynne and Pervenche Berès , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the prevention of sharp injuries in the hospital and healthcare sector in Europe ( HOSPEEM ) and the European Public Service Confederation ( EPSU ) .
it is vital to create a working environment that is as safe as possible for workers , families and citizens .
in the United States , this figure is estimated at 380 000 circles , although the Americans themselves say that this figure has been underestimated .
Member States state that , in the case of online gambling ( and this applies both to Hughes and Santa Casa ) , they are able to implement consumer protection objectives and effectively address the crimes themselves , without the need for European intervention .
I firmly believe that advertising of online gambling aimed at young people must be banned .
personally , I would prefer to buy the shoes , but other people offer satisfaction .
the Commission continues to face the paradoxical reality of the national jurisdiction of the Member States regulating this area and of the restrictions on complaints from gambling service providers .
on gambling , I am opposed to protectionism , and I would like the Green Paper to be able to solve this problem for the benefit of everyone , both consumers and national governments , and the fundamental principles of the European Union .
I believe that he is a living example of our history either holding us in prison or releasing us .
democracy is simply lacking .
these desperate attempts to censor information and the right of expression remind me of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s behaviour .
his security forces have often intervened violently in the escalation of the opposition protests and have been both dead and wounded .
tens of thousands of people have been displaced against their will .
( RO ) You mentioned earlier that we have already discussed Burma in this House .
since it is only natural that any legislative proposal raises doubts about one thing or another , we in the Committee on Legal Affairs have solved the outstanding issues by means of compromise .
I believe that all the European institutions can and must work together to achieve these objectives .
how do you respond to them ?
we cannot expect an effective economy if we make even more demands on growth and jobs by introducing a heavy tax system and bureaucratic rules .
it is our duty now to draw up a new Lisbon Strategy , in other words the EU 2020 strategy .
is it just a modification of the name or a change in direction ?
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say a few more words about the social dimension of the action plan , namely , the demands , dreams and fears of citizens , the dreams and fears of those who are on the labour market or those who are left out of it , the hopes and fears of the victims of the arrogance of the financial markets .
ladies and gentlemen , one of the EU &apos;s most important tasks is to reassess the Lisbon Strategy and the related fight against poverty and exclusion and to strengthen social cohesion .
in my opinion , the greatest possible strength and effectiveness of this body , the Human Rights Council , is in the interests of the European Parliament , as we need a reliable partner in the human rights dialogue .
the next item is the Council and Commission statements on the implementation of the Goldstone recommendations on Israel and Palestine .
furthermore , the conclusions of the report should immediately consider whether measures aimed at strengthening ties between the European Union and Israel should be suspended and whether to apply the provisions of the Association Agreement .
if we are able to achieve unity on Friday , I am very pleased ; perhaps the solution will be to the situation in the Middle East within our grasp .
I urge that we do not consider this idea before Hamas unequivocally recognises Israel &apos;s right to exist and renounce violence .
the European Union must ensure that economic relations with Israel are as good as possible .
we do not want political sanctions , but we want to have a good passage through Belarus and the European Union .
in writing . - ( RO ) The Republic of Belarus is one of the European countries for which participation in the Eastern Partnership of the European Union marks an important step in developing both bilateral relations and relations with Belarus and with each EU Member State .
we need women if we want Europe to overcome the difficulties and , of course , these new indicators will help us along this road .
not only poverty still has the face of women &apos;s people , but also of illiteracy , unemployment and low wages .
those who champion the rights of women in Islamic countries turn to us in the hope that something can be done here .
the implementation of the Platform is a sovereign responsibility of each Member State , and it requires Member States to take into account and strictly respect the diverse religious and ethical values , cultural heritage and philosophical beliefs of individuals and their communities .
school allowances for national minorities have been reduced and preparations are being made for their closure under the so @-@ called reform .
the order of the speeches is as you asked to speak : you have registered in the order in which you asked to speak .
seeds , heavy winds and storms in the sea changed the functional tourist centre to the sensibilities and sow destruction and death .
there had been the same mistakes as in our country .
secondly , we also want a political debate with the European Parliament and the Member States in order to draw conclusions from this .
I congratulate the rapporteur .
I doubt that .
I fully agree that our policy needs a thorough reform to solve the structural problems that exist in it .
the ECR Group supports the report in the hope that the existing system will be changed .
today we have the opportunity to change something and to give a new direction to a policy that everyone thinks has failed completely .
we have also succeeded in this : the provisions on transferable fishing quotas were withdrawn and support for small @-@ scale fishing and coastal fishing was maintained .
( the President cut off the speaker )
this House must therefore recognise recreational fishing and all its forms as an important stakeholders in the fisheries industry and the White Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy must take into account the economic and social benefits of recreational fishing .
third countries such as Taiwan have also decided to use ERTMS , not least because of interoperability .
these are the questions that need to be answered , because the SNCB cannot immediately give an apology for the lack of money .
the level of funding must be increased immediately in order to accelerate the implementation of the proposed renewal programme .
in the course of the investigation , it is now necessary to establish the extent to which they were personally responsible for the tragedy .
I am also pleased that , soon , even one post @-@ Soviet country could obtain visa @-@ free travel to the European Union .
it is our duty to set a good example , but today we are setting a bad example .
the reliability of the system is also very important , as its functioning must be consistent .
in writing . - ( PT ) Following the break @-@ up of the Eastern bloc and the Soviet Union , Ukrainians and the Ukrainian institutions have been committed to making their country democratic and to creating a modern society , with the development of a social , economic and political system capable of standing up for the rule of law and the defence of human rights , despite the difficulties that usually exist in a country that restores its own structural organisation and political identity .
the European Union must actively participate in the work of the Human Rights Council , while being aware of its limitations and problems , and represent a balanced but strict and demanding view of what respect for human rights must mean .
in writing . - ( SV ) Today , 25 February 2010 , the Swedish Conservatives voted in favour of the resolution on the Beijing + 15 UN Platform for Gender Equality .
at the same time , however , Members of the European Parliament pay themselves a few million euros with an increase in the &apos; small &apos; budget , so that the political groups can employ more staff , on the pretext of allegedly raising the workload entailed by the Treaty of Lisbon and of Parliament &apos;s supposed concerns about the quality of their legislative texts .
first of all , I would like to emphasise the excellent report drawn up by Mrs Patrão Neves .
there was another earthquake last week , namely in Chile , and there were almost 300 deaths , with over 60 people killed in storms ravaged throughout Europe , most of whom were French citizens .
the causes of the problems often lie in culture , and this must also be taken into account in improving the situation of women .
I would like to see a debate on the problem of the occupation of countries in Spain and for it to be resolved in order to put an end to the suffering of many women and men who are threatened with destruction and who can no longer live there .
Mr President , I would ask you to provide this information to the relevant authorities so that they can properly investigate the matter and provide the necessary remedies .
unfortunately , this wine is now under attack by some politicians in the Labour Party .
the economy exists or should exist to serve our people .
in this regard , I welcome the written statement agreed by the European Parliament and the Council during the trialogue , which states that this regulation must not be regarded as a precedent .
the Swedish Authority , or the National Agricultural Authority , has said that without the possibility of applying special controls , for example , cancer would probably have reached Sweden .
Fourthly , I believe - and this has already been emphasised here - that the assessment of the work of travel agents , which differs from one country to another , also means that the cross @-@ border provision of goods and services has been made very difficult for travel agents .
the sovereign debt crisis is causing a critical year for Greek tourism , which we know .
many financial transactions are interim periods and not final sales , so tax intermediaries , such as banks , pay the tax and so on .
of course , the question arises as to whether the European Union is capable of taking this step with its own powers .
they must be paid for in some other way .
there are a number of things that must be taken into account .
the next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Bowles on the Single Euro Payments Area .
however , its rules should apply to the functioning of the single market and cross @-@ border trade , not to matters relating solely to the economy of the Member States .
if the presentation of annual accounts is no longer mandatory and therefore no longer constitutes a source of information , the only option is to request tax documentation .
furthermore , micro @-@ entities cannot afford to do so .
secondly , it is absolutely right that the compromise provides for minimum provisions .
the Commission &apos;s current report clearly shows that it has remained very firm on such principles , and that prevention of any distortion of competition is essential , even at a time of crisis , while being flexible and open to procedures where necessary .
nevertheless , I believe that these figures provide a good basis for setting priorities and drawing conclusions on further necessary analyses .
I intend , together with Vice @-@ Presidents Joaquín Almunia and Viviane Reding , to ensure that the Commission acts in a coordinated manner on this issue .
in today &apos;s plenary session , we are discussing the report by Mrs Thun und Hohenstein , which must be acknowledged , is truly excellent , but which deals with the 2008 Scoreboard .
SOLVIT is aimed at citizens and aims to help people who face obstacles and problems with the EU , and to solve these problems within 10 weeks .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , this morning &apos;s joint debate and the quality of the three reports in question show how important the internal market and consumer policy are for Europe .
I imagine that this is something you would certainly like to achieve .
in my opinion , SOLVIT offers consumers a practical solution .
in fact , the Member States have issued long @-@ stay visas and residence permits ex post , without first consulting on the Schengen Information System , in particular on the requirements of Article 96 concerning the non @-@ authorisation of entry .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the report proposes that Member States may issue long @-@ stay visas to third @-@ country nationals for up to 12 months , which is recognised by other Schengen countries .
we should all be positive about these prospects , and the urgently needed SIS II system must proceed quickly , be it forthcoming .
consumer protection (
furthermore , publishing current data and informing citizens and businesspeople about their rights and market situation will help improve the functioning of the market and the transparency of its principles , ensuring equal conditions of competition .
I agree that public action should not be limited to this form of promotion , but that removing artificial and bureaucratic obstacles to entrepreneurship is also crucial .
the Protocol directly relates to issues such as environmental protection , climate change , security , public health , regional development , relations with third countries and development cooperation .
the safety of products circulating on the internal market requires a combination of efforts with the authorities of third countries , thus justifying the Commission &apos;s initiative to establish international cooperation and to conclude formal agreements with the relevant authorities of third countries , particularly China , the USA and Japan .
with this in mind , the Commission urges Member States to promote the SOLVIT network on a regular basis before the public and businesses , given its possibilities and the added value offered .
it is therefore contradictory that students who have a visa to study in Portugal cannot go to Belgium , for example , to collect material for their statements .
protectionism and the fragmentation of the single market must be avoided , as they weaken Europe &apos;s position in the global economy .
in writing . - I fully support the concept of the Internal Market Scoreboard as a tool to measure the success of the Single Market .
I believe that this is a risky strategy which , in our citizens &apos; opinion , is unacceptable .
tell us if there is any timetable , because if we receive some kind of support from this mechanism , I would know when we are going to borrow from the international market .
under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights , the Commission is channelling EUR 150 million annually to support NGOs worldwide .
therefore , it is also very important , in my view , for all of us , to implement such a gradual approach and to try to do all we can to ensure that the world can get legally binding agreements before 2012 .
I would say to Mrs Hassi that this was a position on the need to keep to 30 % and , in many respects , it also concerns what Martin Callanan says .
in my opinion , this is also a logical matter for citizens .
does CO2 emissions therefore also have some connection with the economy , which is so &apos; green &apos; ?
in my opinion , the initiative is welcome for a moment to take stock of developments at Member State , European and international level since 2008 .
I would like to make it very clear that no child can fail due to education or language barriers .
for this reason , we welcome the non @-@ discrimination directive in all areas - a directive that has not always received the support of all political groups in this Chamber .
unfortunately , there is still a large disparity between plans and studies and their practical application in order to make a tangible difference to the lives of the Roma community , which is still the most vulnerable ethnic group in Europe at a time when they face the highest levels of poverty and social exclusion .
the education reform process requires not only the involvement of state institutions , but also non @-@ governmental organisations , which must no longer make it their main objective to identify acts of discrimination , but to educate ethnic groups .
in situations where there could be cross @-@ border implications , it may even be appropriate to promote insurance schemes , which are more European than national .
what the Commission can do is to use the open method of coordination and to use analytical and reporting capacity to help Member States better target social protection measures .
as you well know , drugs are a problem that , although we have relatively advanced technology to find drink @-@ driving drivers , it is much more difficult to identify drugs .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - The deployment of ERTMS on Europe &apos;s main railway networks is planned before 2015 , so there is a date when we consider the deployment plan to be implemented , but this does not mean that each line , particularly regional lines , is equipped with such high @-@ level equipment , so there must always be other systems .
this is not a failure to do this Parliament .
now to the point .
that is why I proposed it as such , so I really do not think that I should bear the brush that comes from the jungle of plurality at the other end of the Chamber .
if I read that the network and non @-@ network environment should both represent the digital world , does it mean that there will be restrictions and searches for laptops , iPods and MP3 players at borders ?
since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , we have had new powers , which we would like to see respected from now on , and we have therefore listened to you and ask you to introduce a transparent discussion procedure in the area of the Anti @-@ Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) to ensure that citizens represented in this Chamber and the European Parliament are informed regularly and fully about the progress made in the negotiations , while respecting the confidentiality clauses that you have just given us an understanding are related to the agreement .
this agreement should fundamentally improve international cooperation in detecting counterfeiters , but in my opinion , it should not be our objective to prosecute secondary school pupils who download games on the Internet .
here , of course , I refer to the notorious laws of &apos; three miscarriages &apos; .
however , when we asked whether some ACP countries , which had specific concerns , could become an alternative to GSP + , we were told that this was not possible , because they violate certain conventions , and therefore the GSP + would not be eligible .
the European Parliament is ready to play its useful and constructive role fully in order to help you achieve this objective , our common objective .
in Bosnia , we have adapted Operation ALTHEA to the way in which the situation has stabilised , and we have also developed a training plan .
however , we have also witnessed many of these unambiguously confirmed events : constant natural disasters and terrible attacks , the fact that some governments in the countries of the Middle East have , despite their democratic regime , taken decisions that are clearly blocking the peace process or the little that is still after it , and so on .
however , I think it is extremely important to keep the picture of the priorities set for the future - which I think this House will agree to a large extent - and to make sure that my actions are linked to their achievement , one of them being the creation of the External Action Service .
( DE ) Mr President , Mrs Ashton , I would like to thank Mr Danjean for his excellent report , which explains where we have come up with in the area of the common security and defence policy .
you are moving on to Cuba , and most people would now like you to stay there .
the Council gives you and your successors a mandate only formally .
it is essential that the service acts in this way , because otherwise we will end up being fragmented again .
let us change this situation .
I am convinced that we need to prepare common European Union rules .
the report is impartial and balanced , and we must therefore create the conditions for fulfilling the recommendations it makes .
this paragraph - although the choice of words has been very careful - shows that this is the desired result .
I am voting in favour of the Lehne report on micro @-@ enterprises &apos; reports because I support measures that will effectively reduce bureaucracy and support small and medium @-@ sized enterprises which create the most jobs in Portugal and throughout Europe .
I also welcome the European Council &apos;s decision to make the strategy more realistic and to ensure greater clarity and objectives , albeit less , but better measurable .
I voted against the resolution because it does not sufficiently emphasise the objective of full employment .
the EU 2020 strategy proposed by the Commission also includes incentives for new structural reforms .
according to the latter , this has only been halted so far by the Palestinian side , which is a disgrace .
the lack of freedom of expression , problems with the registration of political and even social organisations and the use of state media for propaganda purposes are symptomatic of an excessively authoritarian state .
the Single Euro Payments Area ( SEPA ) is a system which makes life easier for millions of Europeans .
to think that China , which is the largest country of counterfeits in the world , will later sign a ready agreement , is unrealistic .
as regards the reduction in nuclear weapons , it is essential that we continue to reduce the two main weapons - Russia and the US - which currently account for 95 % of the world &apos;s nuclear weapons .
Mr President , a few moments ago , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated in an interview how difficult his work is and added that it is going through one crisis to another .
the Arctic is entering the centre of new shipping routes , endless natural resources and the interests of countries seeking fish stocks .
I believe that we should pursue a determined policy towards Russia that would rule out the rival race .
Europe must intervene actively here .
that is why it is our characteristic , our most characteristic feature .
will it be condemned ?
moreover , it is in their own interests .
finally , I would like to remind the Council that , in its conclusions of June 2009 , it said that the future of political dialogue with the Cuban authorities depends on progress , particularly in the field of human rights .
one thing called for in the resolution was the possibility of creating a clear legal basis in this area .
( el ) Minister , thank you for your reply .
a lot has happened and changed since the 1990s ; we need to move forward towards a new treaty , and we are wise about that .
the draft conclusions to be discussed at the Council meeting include the issue of financing , although it is approached with due caution .
I think this is one of the most important challenges that has also been mentioned in the communication .
the Commission must co @-@ finance as many large @-@ scale projects as possible in order to promote the use of smart meters and smart networks as standard , including in Member States where there are still no technologies .
it is essential for humanity that the remaining oil reserves in the world are managed very wisely , which means , above all , very economical management .
as I said in my introduction , the main sources must come from where the main sources lie , namely industry and Member States .
after a visit by the Commissioner - whom I sincerely thank - he went on to see the scale of the disaster with his own eyes , and I know that he was also deeply affected , we must combine our efforts to improve the use of this fund so that we can move forward more quickly .
I would like to pay tribute and gratitude to all the professionals and volunteers who have contributed to rescue and reconstruction efforts in the affected regions , and I would like to express my special condolences to the families of the victims .
today , however , let us face solidarity with Chile , and let us remember that people are still suffering from the lack of hygiene and drinking water , as well as the scarcity of food , medicines and giants .
in writing . - ( PT ) Following the earthquake in Haiti , we must once again be dealing with a terrible disaster with 800 confirmed victims and losses amounting to approximately 15 % of Chile &apos;s GDP .
in writing . - While we recognise that Cuba is a tyranny of communism and , although we want Cuba to become a peaceful democracy , we do not recognise the EU in this process .
for this reason , I urge a new approach to energy policy based on clean energy , more efficient use of the natural resources at our disposal and massive investments in research and greener technologies , so that we can maintain Europe &apos;s competitiveness and create jobs in an environment of innovation and a sustainable economy .
over the years and on many occasions , including the last EU @-@ Israel Association Council in June last year and the Foreign Affairs Council conclusions in December 2009 , the EU has consistently called for the immediate release of those detained by Galid Shalit .
without human rights , there is neither the rule of law nor democracy .
more importantly , the death penalty is irreversible ; it cannot be rectified .
we also particularly note the views expressed by three out of five judges who thought that capital punishment was in accordance with the Constitution .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your invitation to me to appear at the meeting of the Pan @-@ African Parliament in three weeks &apos; time .
no .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is quite clear - and this has already been said , Mr Langen - that Greece must do its homework .
( es ) Mr President , I think we are all aware that the European Council next week will monitor with extraordinary attention five million citizens .
that is what the Commission has in mind , and the proposals will soon come to that end .
particular attention must be paid to the participation of lower socio @-@ economic groups , as they are the ones who are quite likely to be outside the digital society .
I would also like to recall , here , Alain Lamassoure and Jürgen Mayer , because they were the ones who drafted a proposal for a citizens &apos; initiative , a citizens &apos; initiative , which is currently covered by the Treaties .
for example , I would like to point out that the costs associated with the charging of notaries who check the validity of signatures must be reasonable .
I would like to make two requests to you , now that you have reached the end of this regulation .
it is clear that there are different systems in Member States to verify the authenticity of the signature .
meanwhile , the fight against Taavet and Koljati has continued , especially as China is changing the demographic balance in Tibet , which is of great concern , and even using military means of pressure , as happened two years ago .
the dialogue between the Chinese Government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama is starting to take a line .
...
Mr President , it is now more than a year since the ATM company SR Technics announced that they would close their branches at Dublin Airport , resulting in over 1 000 jobs being lost .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , this evening I am happy to listen to you .
I believe that these are the substantive issues in this debate .
spending someone else &apos;s money without permission is not budget planning but theft .
we should develop programmes such as making milk and fruit available in schools .
this reasoning must certainly be seen in the European Parliament &apos;s report .
quality is a key factor in the entire food chain , contributing to the competitiveness of European food producers .
adequate resources must also be made available to farmers so that they can develop their own quality policy , and it is also important that farmers in both eastern and western Member States have a level playing field .
I would like to make a proposal in the interests of consumers , and I am not sure whether it will receive support or not : why not ask consumers what they want to know ?
according to estimates by the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , unemployment in industrial countries has not yet reached its peak , and more than 200 million people are likely to end up in extreme poverty .
tuberculosis is a cross @-@ sectoral issue and relates to many public health problems we face in the European Union : for example , the growing resistance to AMT drugs , the lack of effective new tools for diagnosing and treating tuberculosis , the rapid growth of infections such as HIV and inequalities , which means that tuberculosis disproportionately affects many of the most vulnerable members of society .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this very comprehensive report .
I hope that the Spanish and French police will bring justice not only to the killers themselves , but also to the people who have committed themselves to murder .
the euro , a stable single currency , has played a true monetary shield .
it must all change , certainly , and we also need to demand a social protection indicator , not satisfy the general calls , but do not do something that would affect excessively low incomes .
it is true that many are calling for economic governance .
we must not allow the financial crisis to slow down the transition to a green economy .
this is true both within and outside the euro area .
first of all , looking at the different opinions in this House , we do not agree on the issue of imbalances .
the oral amendment aims to fill this gap and the text that I propose to the European Parliament satisfies precisely that need .
( CS ) I very much appreciate the fact that the report on agricultural product quality policy is in line with the steps taken in the past to strengthen quality policy .
we voted in favour of the Tobin Tax to saddle the already weak western financial institutions and to give it to a number of people who are likely to steal it anyway .
although this may only be the tip of the iceberg of the unemployment problem in Lithuania , this financial contribution will still help those most in need .
it suddenly became apparent that the Member States &apos; authorities , as well as the EU authorities , rejected the Stability and Growth Pact , which should , in principle , have been ensured compliance with the convergence criteria .
the EU and its Member States contribute significantly to the UN budget .
otherwise , the legitimate requirement for respect for minorities threatens to become known as the opposite form of discrimination , to the detriment of all honest citizens who suffer from many Roma crimes and abuses .
this is why programmes such as Erasmus , especially the Erasmus scheme for Young entrepreneurs , must feature as a priority , which is also reflected in the 2011 budget .
in truth , I do not want to support such anti @-@ productive ideas as the desire to mark the so @-@ called ecological footprint and to relocate some agricultural production .
I voted in favour of the report by Enrique Guerrero Salom , which reminds Europe of the commitments made in relation to official development aid , in particular the objective of contributing 0.7 % of GDP by 2015 , and the resulting responsibility and demands .
the Central Bank did not foresee a major crisis and it did not appear in the best of all about its own regulation , which is far from perfect .
this part of the text , which falls within the competence of the European Council , was discussed and agreed by the European Council .
you all know that , in order to achieve a solution that was ultimately acceptable , there was a need for consistent work and difficult negotiations .
Greece must abide by the agreements and actually implement the reform programmes .
it is inevitable that we must increasingly coordinate our economic policies , our tax policy , the drawing up of public budgets , ensuring competitiveness , and that we must take responsibility together .
the first truth - and I have heard it time , but not often enough - is that the problems we have to solve first emerged in a country with budget deficits .
I can only agree with the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the European Council that we are very optimistic about reaching a political agreement on this strategy and its objectives .
I also wanted to tell you once again how much Parliament - or at least some of us - appreciates that you were here to come here and prepare for the meetings of the European Council , rather than sending here a Council that is not a member of the European Council .
Mr Karas is of course from Austria , but he was on behalf of Herbert Reul .
resolving this contradiction will be an interesting balancing act .
in writing . - ( PL ) In view of developments in Europe , such as the demographic decline of indigenous populations and economic crises , I give my full support to a well thought @-@ out strategic agenda .
before I start , I have one announcement .
Mr President , passengers whose timetables have been destroyed by volcanic ash are now confused with insurance .
I would like to stress that the Commission fully supports the idea of a common understanding , or even an interinstitutional agreement , between all three institutions on delegated acts , because this creates the necessary procedures for drawing up legislation .
they listened to us of courtesy , but the deadlines were so short that Parliament did not even hold hearings within that time .
is our system really watertight ?
I can also promise that all the questions that have been asked will be sent to reply in writing because , if I would like to reply to all the questions , I would certainly not be able to do so in the one and a half minutes left to me .
Mr President , this interference , which is absolutely justified , is mixing the debate that is under way .
this means that the various objects can be confiscated .
as regards the whole aviation security sector , Parliament is also taking a step further .
however , the EU refuses to give a legally binding commitment for the post @-@ 2013 period and , as a result , these countries are in a very precarious situation .
I think that the debate will help the Commission to form a proposal on methodology , which basically means that the Committee on Transport can already speak about it in May at best .
otherwise , all our good intentions with regard to safety and job creation will be doomed .
I would like to take this opportunity to debate once again the request that I made to the Commission : the request for us to make full use of the direct access of the European Union to the Black Sea , which is a region of particular geostrategic importance .
we must therefore do everything to ensure that this sector is competitive and sustainable , while not forgetting the environment and the human factor .
Parliament stresses that Europeana should provide access to public works as well as material to which copyright is still in force .
we also agree that fair competition must be promoted between EU and non @-@ Community producers .
to what extent has the CAP already introduced climate protection requirements and what resources can be mobilised within the CAP in the future ?
this is particularly the case for small businesses , where the impact of bureaucracy is sometimes simply disproportionate , given the benefits to be paid .
of course , it is difficult for us , too , to reach Strasbourg and Brussels , but that is our problem , and that is something we should certainly not consider to be the most important .
the main thing - as everyone has said , including airlines - was that it is very important to re @-@ open air traffic .
what we are experiencing now is the reality of future transport .
coordination between national authorities could also be improved , but you yourself , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , said that the European Union does not have the power to make these improvements now .
finally , they are also right that airlines receive state aid .
( DE ) Mr President , in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , which is also responsible for civil protection , an own @-@ initiative report on the Community approach to the prevention of natural disasters is being prepared , as if we had envisaged what will happen .
( es ) Mr President , the Commissioner said that the order so far is absurd and outdated .
today , the decision taken at yesterday &apos;s extraordinary Council meeting will be implemented .
they also ask why it was not possible to come to Krakow on Sunday , or to the railways , if in this way it was possible to reach Strasbourg on Monday .
it is very important for the Commission to bring the Single Market into the 21st century ; the Commission will present new proposals for 2012 .
they are in Strasbourg , but they are not here in the plenary where they should be .
there is still much work to do .
if there is one area entirely within the competence of the Member States , it is precisely air traffic management .
I would like to draw attention to the situation in the outermost regions , which , due to its permanent structural features , must overcome barriers that have a serious impact on economic development and therefore require specific measures .
it would be equally irresponsible to postpone reconstruction .
people feel that aid does not reach where it is needed .
they are the guarantee that , if the process is well organised , it will be successful .
in particular , the Commission should ensure that at least half of the EEAS staff are guaranteed and that the service should not be affected by an intergovernmental decision @-@ making process .
President of the Commission . - The European digital library , which aims to publish libraries , museums and their archives on the web in our countries , is a very important task of our times in digitising , making our rich culture available and preserving .
respect for the political , social , environmental and cultural rights of indigenous peoples must be at the heart of our transatlantic relations .
( es ) Mr President , I , too , would like to thank Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Neyra .
however , I believe it is extremely important for us to include civil society and non @-@ governmental organisations in the activities to implement the objectives of this strategy .
Kyrgyzstan has received quite a lot of press and political attention , and I have been watching the situation closely since the start and making two statements - one on 7 April and the other on 8 April .
despite some discussions , the European Union is still not sufficiently represented in this region of the world .
it seems that this was an attempt to have an international conflict that would put the whole of Central Asia at risk .
in the light of the post @-@ Copenhagen situation , adaptation to climate change and its mitigation remain one of the most important issues that needs to be supported by energy policy .
( DE ) Mr President , just as it is not embarrassing enough that , during the negotiations on a comprehensive economic and trade agreement , there has been a factsheet , the accusation that Canada is being forced to adapt its copyright legislation to US and EU standards under CETA .
this is one of the reasons why the number of visa applications is so high .
there are now suddenly problems emerging due to the fact that operators are removing these services from networks and are not prepared to provide the necessary support .
I was travelling here with great difficulty from the second part of the European Union and I am not satisfied with the Commissioner &apos;s response that he had no time .
the Communication may include proposals to enhance the preventive and corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact - proposals for more effective and comprehensive monitoring of macroeconomic imbalances within the euro area - and explore ways to create a resolution mechanism for euro area countries .
Curiously , however , the loss of memory to the same Member States seems to be striking when it comes to changing words into deeds and making a commitment to these common rules into texts .
however , this is not yet another office .
we urgently need to accelerate the implementation of these plans .
can you answer that ?
Mr Kirilov &apos;s report is a good example of this .
the question we are concerned about is due to the overall crisis that has hit the entire agricultural sector .
economic performance fell to EUR 29 300 ( 45 % ) and € 43 000 ( down from 18 % ) .
this is an extremely large amount of money !
this overall growth is certainly impressive .
there is a huge need for information on this directive in the European Union .
in these days , when the crisis burdens every citizen , we must be particularly careful when spending taxpayers &apos; money .
what are these travel arrangements being spent on ?
I also propose to shorten the deadlines .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we all know this little trick : if you want to put someone in an embarrassing situation , then put your question around : are you still peculitating your children ?
I believe it is also important to examine the functioning of our procurement procedures here in Parliament .
in addition , there are general principles to be respected when it comes to the transfer of personal data , such as the right of the person to know that his or her data is processed , or the right to amend or delete data if they prove wrong .
in this regard , I can only say that I appreciate the new spirit of cooperation shown by both the Council and the Commission for involving this House .
it seems to us that , in its current form , the mandate offers solutions to many problems , but leaves many other problems unsolved .
the resolution adopted in May reflects what is specifically connected with the protection of our citizens &apos; data and remedies , including erroneous territorial protection , particularly in cases where their rights may be violated inappropriately .
it is of the utmost importance to remember that a small delay damages EU @-@ US relations much less than the second rejection of the draft agreement .
however , this is , as the Council also said , a very important part of the negotiations .
perhaps there will also be room in the future to consider combating terrorism and crime , together with our transatlantic partners in the joint institution .
I think that the strategy that Parliament has adopted on the PNR agreement shows that even Parliament has understood that it has more power and must therefore bear greater responsibility .
personal data must be processed in accordance with Directives 46 / 1995 , 58 / 2002 and 24 / 2006 .
I would also like to point out that the working group set up to investigate the accident in Baia Mare established that the plant project did not contain waste from mining , that the supervisory authorities did not check the design permit , the dam and the exploitation of the plant , so that the operator of the plant made many mistakes .
this is because the risks of cyanide are disproportionately high , especially in third world countries with lower levels of environmental protection .
I see great potential in this trade .
I have been given a firm undertaking that operators will act in a very discreet manner and not with our work .
powers of legislative delegation (
in the context of the European Parliament &apos;s consultation procedure , I voted in favour of the report by my excellent Spanish colleague , Mr García @-@ Margallo y Marfil , on the proposal for a Council regulation on administrative cooperation and the fight against tax fraud in the field of VAT .
I believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
I believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
these principles are : non @-@ discrimination , consultation and remedial measures , transparency of security charges and the link between revenue and the establishment of a supervisory authority .
if we want to maintain the competitiveness of the port , its current infrastructure must be modernised and the bureaucratic requirements removed .
I support the call for at least 15 million different digitised objects to be available in Europeana by 2015 .
for these reasons , we must make every effort to create a legal framework specifying minimum standards for all forms of livestock farming throughout the EU .
these policies must be supported with ambitious targets for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide with a negative environmental impact , because we are in a vicious circle .
I also welcome the presentation of the concept of &apos; vulnerability in the days &apos; , which will help to take account of the link between the soil and the climate .
furthermore , the action plan will enable us to provide support for innovative research and development , thereby encouraging the rapid growth of knowledge and access to cultural heritage .
I welcome the fact that certain ideas have started to be addressed , which is very important to me : the organisation of an interinstitutional conference involving all the parties involved , in particular the national parliaments and audit authorities , in order to reform the discharge procedure ; the reduction of deadlines so that the discharge is voted on in the year after the year following to come ; and the call by the European Court of Auditors for a unified opinion ( the enforcement of the &quot; single audit &quot; rule ) on the reliability and regularity of underlying transactions , as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon .
all the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function .
the ultimate objective is the establishment by 2015 of a global interregional partnership between Europe and Latin America , with the aim of ensuring sustainable development in both regions .
terrorism must be fought with determination , but the measures taken must not create a precarious environment for citizens &apos; rights , which is the main objective of terrorist attacks .
only a consistent approach and the establishment of general principles and rules on the use of PNR data will we be able to put an end to this impossible situation and move forward in this area with international agreements , whether with the three countries or with many other countries whose requests are due to be expected .
this poses a serious threat to the environment and human health .
in addition , we are allowing 12 countries to restructure their situation here in Parliament , as they have an agreement with the whole of the European Union that they should have the right to greater representation than they have at present .
European citizens , not national governments , are the ones who choose whom they wish to represent in the European Parliament .
that is why we , the coordinators - and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them , particularly Mr Jáuregui Atondo and Mr Duff - have agreed on Amendment 2 , which will be voted on tomorrow .
this includes differences in their ability to compete , as this is one of the key factors causing other types of differentiation .
we share this responsibility together and the time will not stand for us .
let us take the initiative , the joint initiative of this Parliament to amend the Treaties , so that we finally have a European monetary fund that can actually combat speculation .
you all thought it is excellent , but now Spain has 20 % of unemployed people , and the country itself is in great trouble , like Portugal .
I must tell you , in connection with the preparatory work currently underway with our partners in the G20 , that there are many who oppose this idea , but I think we should follow it .
let me make one comparison .
we must show solidarity , but it must not be a one @-@ way street .
the only culprit is the political and economic philosophy adopted by international companies against workers , small farmers and local small businesses .
in this context , I consider it important to continue to focus strategically on growth and jobs in particular .
this requires a comprehensive initiative on these potential green jobs .
however , it is clear and necessary that we must put in place a permanent resolution mechanism with strong internal conditions , as well as negative incentives for its use .
the normal practice of the Soviet Union was to allow communism to arrive in ten years &apos; time , without taking into account reality .
I know that the Spanish Presidency is doing its utmost to provoke these debates .
Commissioner , I fundamentally agree with this view , but I fear that this process , including its individual ingredients , will not be easy at all .
we think , therefore , that it is absolutely justified why the European Union should sign the convention .
if we miss this opportunity , we can find ourselves in a fragmented market for many years ; it would be not only bad for consumers and European businesses , but it would also be foolish , taking into account numerous competing international initiatives .
we now want standardised electric cars in the European Union .
hybrid cars are already on the market and the hybrid model works for both electric and hydrogen powered vehicles : hydrogen with methane and other traditional diesel or petrol components .
in order to enable the European car industry to maintain global competitiveness and to ensure that it plays an important role in clean technologies , the European Union must create an appropriate framework for promoting innovative technologies by stimulating research and developing the infrastructure needed to support the transition to an efficient economy based on low carbon resources and emissions .
these have been some 120 years of workers &apos; fantastic progress , painful repercussions and resistance .
fellow Members , let us not delude ourselves that ordinary Greeks are completely innocent of what has happened in Greece .
we need a strong distribution system .
we will only be bringing the Commission closer to an ambitious target if we join forces both vertically and horizontally .
however , it is extremely difficult to face a progressive disease and families must not be left alone in this difficult situation .
the next item is the report by Patrizia Toia , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on the activation of information and communication technologies to facilitate the transition to an energy @-@ efficient and low @-@ carbon economy - .
the Commission understands that Parliament strongly underlines the shared responsibility of EU institutions and Member States in this regard .
another priority is support for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises ; we increased our loans to banks so that they can continue lending to small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , with a new product that will enable us to better control the actual use of the funds we provide .
we think that is a very good thing .
the third priority is energy and the fight against climate change .
according to the Constitution , President Jonathanu automatically gets the President &apos;s Deputy .
it should be noted that three major refineries are not working , and even worse , in recent years , oil production in the country has been reduced due to constant attacks on oil installations .
the debate is closed .
I would prefer a science @-@ based approach based on emotion to animal welfare .
the next important step would be to transfer and disseminate successful treatment methods in all countries of the European Union , including lower experience in cancer treatment centres , in order to improve access to effective treatment .
to the sceptics who , despite all these achievements , are still questioning the transatlantic relationship or the attitude of my own country towards a united Europe , I will answer this : even if the United States and all the countries that you represent were not bound up with common values and the common national background of millions of our citizens , including my own , would inextricably associate us with global common interests alone .
we need each other now more than ever .
in order to ensure that the Lisbon Treaty is in line with Article 5 of the Act on direct universal suffrage of MEPs , a transitional measure is needed .
in writing . - ( ET ) The events that started in Kyrgyzstan at the beginning of April , a month ago , have left a serious mark , both of the national situation in this country and of international relations .
we are therefore using this motion for a resolution , which I supported , to make clear our concerns about some of the proposals that have been tabled .
the various types of cancer statistics are among the most disadvantaged in the EU .
revenues from the ETS must contribute to adaptation and the EU budget must reflect the need to tackle such problems quickly .
in these countries , various political and financial strains are forming , aimed at controlling the allocation of European Union funds .
with me , 11 Members of the European Parliament were present at this meeting .
the debate on Mrs Bauer &apos;s report will be postponed to the next part @-@ session .
I assume that the justification for exceptional events does not take into account the financial irresponsibility that is the cause of this confusion .
I think that the European Union directive on the seasonal workers system should reach the European Parliament as soon as possible , so that we can solve the problems as helpful and efficient as possible .
let us not forget , however , that there is another directive waiting , which also stresses the need to extend this leave - and I stress that this is a lack of leave , not a disease - on the basis of equality .
from now on , self @-@ employed women and spouses of self @-@ employed workers and de facto life partners will have the right to equal and high maternity benefits than the pay gap .
that is just one amendment .
moving towards zero energy buildings means that a bar has been set even higher for builders than planned when discussing passive house technology .
only if we increase the funds allocated by the European Regional Development Fund for the energy efficiency of buildings for the period 2010 @-@ 2013 ( currently 4 % ) can we ask for a significant increase in this percentage in the budgetary period 2014 @-@ 2020 .
the work carried out so far by the European Parliament has undoubtedly given us the opportunity to extend the original scope by setting standards for other labelling requirements , which we believe is essential .
this is very important and absolutely right .
this is undoubtedly a very sensitive and important piece of information and it is important because the European Union has become an added value : the European Union guarantees consumer safety and protection .
but maybe in future people will simply have to delete their radio frequency identification number from Google street .
we believe that it is essential to simplify the rules and achieve greater legal certainty .
the debate is closed .
we are all aware of additional commitments , but additional commitments do not necessarily require additional costs .
this Commission has a great many legislative obligations in the codecision procedure or in the ordinary legislative procedure .
thirdly , the necessary flexibility of the legal framework is provided for in order to develop a system based on an alternative technical scenario , and I think we all agree with the reasons for this .
for the first time in granting financial assistance to Member States receiving refugees , we must be careful , particularly due to their relatively unequal status .
in the Dublin Regulation , we have proposed the suspension of temporary transfers and created the European Asylum Support Office ( EASO ) , which will be opened in Malta this year .
our group fully supports the compromise that has been reached , because it is extremely important and absolutely obvious that the economic and social development of the outermost regions of the EU is largely determined by their location on the periphery , difficult weather conditions and geography , and economic dependence on restricted goods and services .
that is why - and here I will also reply to Mr Tirolien - we did not introduce any other changes .
14 .
farmers in the European Union must once again be able to spend more time on farce than at the working table .
the issue of immigration and , in particular , of the right to asylum , is very sensitive .
2 .
this is one of the eligible criteria of the European Refugee Fund .
if the EU really wants to spend additional millions , it should be spent on border guards or support families of local origin .
from this point of view , and in view of the economic system that is built on our education system and almost entirely on small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , it is to be hoped that the need to strengthen the link between institutions , especially vocational education and businesses , must be recognised .
this fight lasts for a long time , but it is worth the effort .
we should have had to be clearer and more specific when it comes to the organisation of youth policies and structures .
while I respect national prerogatives , I think there is such a need to define minimum protection rules for self @-@ employed women and mothers and assisting spouses and life partners recognised under their national law , and to provide them with the same protection as those of mothers who are not self @-@ employed but employed .
origin marking guarantees transparency , safety and information for European citizens and clear and common rules for our businesses .
I voted against the Trüpel report .
for these reasons , the reform of the common agricultural policy must take account of its impact on prices , which must be compared with production and where direct prices have been recorded .
the Court of Justice has examined a disproportionate number of infringement proceedings in the field of public procurement , which shows that many Member States have had difficulties complying with the public procurement directives .
however , Mrs Keller &apos;s report also talks , for example , about a developed services market and clear competition rules that prevent the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals .
quality and safety standards for human organs intended for transplantation - Action Plan for organ donation and transplantation ( 2009 @-@ 2015 ) ( debate )
however , the scope of the proposal is limited to quality and safety , as defined in the article on public health of the agreement .
I do not think we need to harmonise the different systems .
( PL ) I am pleased that the issue of organ donation and transplantation is a priority of the Spanish Presidency , because it can be said that this is a matter of life and death .
what does this mean ?
( it ) Madam President , Mr López Garrido , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this membership is certainly a sign of one of the European Union &apos;s missions - to defend and promote human rights .
( es ) Madam President , I would like to clarify two things .
the accession of the EU to the ECHR complements the level of protection established by the Treaty of Lisbon through the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which has binding legal force .
what has become of the agreement currently being negotiated by Frontex with Turkey ?
we need to build mutual trust through legislation and with measures to promote the rights of citizens of all our Member States , so that judges also implement the rules we have sought and , yes , we are making rapid progress on this .
I declared it when I was before you on 13 January , and that is the principle that I am guided by .
Member of the Commission . - The latest publication of Eurostat statistics on crime and justice in criminal matters was published on 29 May , covering the period 1998 @-@ 2007 and does not indicate the growth described by the honourable Member .
when you came up with ways and in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs some time ago , you said , as you said today , that there is a great deal of progress and that you are very close to the conclusion of the final agreement on illegal immigration issues with Turkey .
the Commission has also drawn up a number of programmes providing financial support to help small and medium @-@ sized enterprises so that they have access to the capital required to develop their activities .
it was also highlighted later in the minutes on services of general interest .
therefore , I strongly oppose any principle of restricting the concept of social housing to the poorest social groups , particularly with regard to the diversity and subsidiarity of European countries .
what measures will be planned to exploit offshore oil exploration sites in larger depths and , in particular , in the Far North region ?
( ga ) Mr President , it is a good thing that this important issue is being discussed , but in fact I do not know what our debates are changing or what impact we are having on large companies - oil companies , which have been subject to oil shortages , which have caused this damage and disaster .
we must also recognise the importance of closer cooperation in other areas : boosting the Single European Sky initiative and creating a Mobility Action Plan to help the EU better deal with such crises .
we are a high @-@ tech location , we have many opportunities and , for example , scientists in Germany are calling for a special monitoring network for aerosols , small particles in volcanic ash .
after all , it must be understood that the current legislation was introduced so that airlines cannot cancel flights if it is convenient for them , but now we are in a situation where airspace is closed and airlines cannot fly .
recently , we have seen that there are far from massive speculation not only in the financial sector , but also some airlines are ready to risk passenger safety , at least in words - albeit fortunately not yet in action .
we do not have information that other modes of transport are used to bring people to home .
ten days ago , the European Union adopted bold and necessary decisions to secure financial stability in Europe .
this is therefore the first assurance we should give them : that their savings are protected .
we have been practising it for many years .
these speeches really took over a few seconds .
it is a fact that the European currency cannot simply be a strong currency in the long term , as it has brought together one monetary policy under the umbrella of so @-@ called rainfall economies of very different countries , some of which are in a weak position .
is it European rhetoric when we complain about mistakes in the design of the euro , for which there is still no common tax and pension policy ?
( PT ) Mr President , several of my fellow Members from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) have already painted quite a complete picture of the situation .
the Commission has simply forgotten to include the objectives of this programme in order to strengthen small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
please read the ten pages of the communication on strengthening economic governance in Europe .
in writing . - ( RO ) The report accurately mentions the important contribution made by the Structural and Cohesion Funds to European economic life and to the achievement of the objectives set out to us as part of the EU 2020 agenda .
rapporteur . - ( PL ) I could say that we are in a significantly better position than last year , because then we did not grant discharge before November .
Thrombin is naturally present in any meat .
however , previous experience is less encouraging than many Members referred to during the debate yesterday .
energy efficiency marks are also highlighted in any advertisement containing information on energy consumption or on product prices .
however , the principle of non @-@ payment of organs does not prevent living donors from being compensated provided that such compensation is strictly limited to the loss of costs and income resulting from donation .
doubts persist over the possibility of using unpackaged products , the risk of consumer information , as well as the prohibition of the use of these products in restaurants and other social catering companies .
in Romania , 13 people on the waiting lists die every day due to a shortage of donors .
therefore , donation should be as accessible as possible - it can often be effective promotion .
politically , I oppose , in principle , the motive of EU accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms , to move forward in the process of European integration ( accompanied by ) another step towards political union .
firstly , support measures must be maintained until recovery is fully secured .
in view of many of the problems that have already been addressed in the legislative discussions , I sincerely hope that Parliament and the Council will be able to quickly find a solution to the differences between the texts under discussion .
the report clearly states that the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact must be implemented , but if they are applied only to costs - limiting them - the result will probably be a drop .
these expectations include the majority of the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs who are working to silence calls aimed at returning to their own @-@ initiative and thereby destroying solidarity .
I would like to see Europe as a pioneer in a different way of consumption based on a combination of knowledge triangle and sustainable development ; a Europe that is capable of developing production conditions and products created precisely for the interests of consumers and with them ; a Europe that has concentrated more on quality and no longer just on quantity .
it was a very interesting report to work on .
the quantified objectives of this 2020 strategy - increasing the employment rate , reducing the level of poverty , and so on - are simply vain hopes , as they are based on the same model that failed Lisbon Strategy .
only this offers us the opportunity to successfully overcome this crisis in the long term , and regional policy can make an important contribution to this .
as my speaking time is limited , I would like to make three brief points .
as stated in the report , an assessment of the impact of cohesion policy spending on regional development is needed , based on specific indicators .
it would also make this strategy important for individuals and citizens across Europe .
that must be our starting point .
perhaps nation states should encourage an increase in the birth rate among their population as far as it is in the power of the state .
however , if the coordination of budgetary policy means rejecting national parliaments in order to force its citizens into hunger , then I fear that this is a nice idea of the EU , which will end up starving to death .
we have an excellent example of cooperation between entrepreneurs and universities in Finland : the famous University of Aalto , which is the name of the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto .
if entrepreneurs and universities work together , they will inevitably learn from each other , because one will train those who the other can never be employed in their own businesses .
there is also no mention of any education or training system to reduce these gaps .
in writing . - ( PL ) The dialogue between the academic community and businesses aimed at modernising European universities should take account of their current situation , which is aligned with the Bologna Process , and the economic challenges associated with innovation should also be taken into account .
I take this opportunity to ask you all to try to speak a little more slowly , because our esteemed interpreters are constantly sending me SOS messages and saying to me that they are unable to keep pace with us when we talk too quickly .
this is because the Balkans as a whole - including Bulgaria - are a vulnerable region in the European Union , as has been shown by the current economic crisis .
the production of nuclear energy does not cause CO2 emissions , not to mention that in Member States using nuclear power , household monthly electricity bills are lower .
fourth , progress must be made in establishing a positive relationship that avoids barriers and clashes and instead seeks synergies between the Union for the Mediterranean and the Union for the Mediterranean .
ahead of the Barcelona Summit in June , it is very important that we reaffirm Parliament &apos;s commitment to the success of this project in a region which , as we all know , is located in contact with the three continents and which is clearly an important region in Europe &apos;s geostrategic and cultural context .
the resolution on the Union for the Mediterranean is an important political document , which , after more than 20 years of substantial energy devoted to the East , draws the attention of the Council , the Commission and the Member States to the need to change its geopolitical outlook and to place the development of relations with the countries of the Mediterranean basin at the heart of foreign policy , starting with the adoption of a common position on the conflict in the Middle East .
I would like a common solution in the near future to be found to the two problems for which Turkey is partly responsible or liable , in other words , the problems associated with Turkey &apos;s neighbour Armenia and the problems associated with Nagorno @-@ Karabakh .
it is equally important to achieve greater stability in Georgia , because if Georgia is divided , as many people in Moscow want it , there will be destabilisation of the entire region .
I hope that the competitive South Stream project will be more successful , so that we do not lose the resources of the Caspian region to China .
however , one thing is absolutely clear : the content of the resolution , which won a general consensus in February , has been moved away and , given the serious crisis , this is not surprising .
our towns and cities are already burdened with problems arising from massive and uncontrolled immigration .
the links between universities and businesses must be strengthened in order to make it easier for students to access employment and easier for businesses to accept atypical agencies .
in this context , the EU &apos;s intervention strategy must ensure that support is removed in the affected areas in order to encourage the creation of new jobs and sustainable industry .
this is crucial for economic development and growth in the various regions .
in writing . - ( PT ) We are completely opposed to the guidelines set out in the report , whose main objective is to increase the economic domination of large firms in the southern Mediterranean , access to and control of natural resources in the southern part of the EU , particularly energy , the exploitation of labour force and the blocking of migrants .
the most obvious example is the Pakistani Taliban , the terrorist movement , the intentions of which were once again made very clear in the recent Times Square bomb attack in New York , which fortunately failed .
so let us want something .
we Europeans are therefore entitled to recommend that others do not choose this route .
the deaths included doctors and children .
Burma needs our help to develop a strong civil society and a legal system which should focus on a transitional legal system for the massive crimes committed by the junta .
I fear that the problem is there , but I will take note of your comments .
as you know , the European Parliament , together with the Council , has adopted new rules on driving time , introduced requirements for modern , reliable digital tachographs and adopted a specific directive on enforcement .
it would also promote social dumping and deregulation of employment , as the number of fictitious self @-@ employed drivers is increasing .
we believe there are several reasons for involving self @-@ employed workers .
that would be pointless and incomprehensible .
I draw attention to the fact that false self @-@ employed drivers are weakening the overall labour market , and the main problem is that it is difficult in practice to prove false self @-@ employment .
it is therefore regrettable that the proposed amendments call into question the criteria to be measurable as a basis for enforcement .
consumers have different demands and we must try to fulfil as many of them as possible .
at least they should be indicated on the packaging , so that we know what we are buying , for example , cookies , chocolate , potatoes or waste .
for the same reason , I am also opposed to the mandatory daily quantification .
with regard to requests for claims and their approval , which Mr Davies spoke about , I admit that some 44 000 claims were made from Member States under Article 13 .
in the light of such a past , restoring confidence takes time , and the lack of trust was one of the reasons why Member States had to earmark a great deal of money in relation to the problems that we have just had .
those who vote in favour press the &apos; Yes &apos; button , those who vote &apos; no &apos; , press the &apos; No &apos; button , and those who want to abstain press the &apos; 0 &apos; button .
of course , the United States played a very important role and I would like to thank him for this , and it was also an important part of Canada , Australia and New Zealand , but it is important to emphasise that , since 2006 , 57 % of the European Union is actually funding .
I do not believe that this should be different in the European Parliament .
however , I am saddened that today , he has become a victim - first because of a computer error , which caused 168 votes to be wrongly calculated , and then because the person who led the proceedings added them to 168 votes on the total , and this is the result of a general wording .
since this is an exceptional measure , the funding of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund must be independent and it is a serious mistake to allocate support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund , which is a measure intended for unforeseen circumstances , at the expense of the European Social Fund or of some other structural funds .
the EGF is aimed at helping workers who have been victims of company relocations , and the EGF is helping to make it easier for them to become new jobs in the future .
this compromise with the Council is an attempt to improve the situation , which is why I voted in favour .
I urge Deutsche Bahnil to examine the possibility of challenging this decision .
on the other hand , it is also important to increase the rate of EU cofinancing for countries with weaker economies , particularly as regards social programmes and cost @-@ effective investments .
combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is very important .
the current financial , economic and climate crisis is responsible for the rich countries , but developing countries are the ones most affected by global warming .
Mr President , I have a brief supplementary question .
I would also like to know whether you are discussing the need to improve the technical control of oil platforms as a matter of urgency .
the Commission cannot change the level of corrections according to its discretion , as it respects the principles established to ensure equal treatment of all Member States .
this should also involve , first and foremost , those more than 20 million Europeans who feel marginalised , as the brutal crisis has left them in the labour market behind the door .
ratings may therefore be legal , but is it also legal to publish ratings as they do agencies ?
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , a short while ago , there were voices saying that credit rating agencies should not have downgraded Greece and other sovereign debt ratings .
it seems that they were not convinced even by an influential and outrageous package of EUR 750 billion .
on this matter , I would like to add one nuance so that we can try to understand whether the framework for the operation of these agencies is complete , whether it is transparent and whether it is official .
it set out harmonised rules ( including one important innovation ) on what European companies must publish when issuing securities .
it was based on the understanding that all investors must be treated equally .
anyone involved in the conciliation process knows that it was essential and therefore we must protect it .
by respecting and understanding the differences between regions , we must only strive for the elimination of negative contrasts and large social inequalities .
we also need solutions to tackle the social crisis that has developed as a result of the economic and financial crisis .
now we are trying to lay the foundations for something that I would call critical intervention .
it will also help to carry out staff training and retraining to facilitate the transition from institutional care to local services .
since 1999 , when this approach started , 84 studies have already been carried out within the Community , involving approximately 2 million people .
I think it is therefore time , therefore , to stop and reflect on what this report is about .
it is almost half a year since the appointment of Commissioner Reding .
all in all , there are three areas where I would like to see very effective and very tangible steps taken by the EU , even though , when I speak of three areas , this does not mean that their number is limited to three , and I think we could perhaps read these three areas for our own priorities .
for example , a woman who has not received child maintenance aid for months must know what to do to whom to turn for help .
I am sure there are a number of proposals , perhaps not all , but in any case a number of issues relating to equality .
conscious of all these risks , we should try to use horizontal solutions to ensure pre @-@ crisis employment rates and not allow a downward trend .
however , we must remember that research alone does not solve anything .
( PL ) I would like to thank Mr Coelho , who is Parliament &apos;s expert in the Schengen area , who has indeed done a tremendous job in this area .
( the sitting was closed at 24.00 )
I will not go into detail , but I would like to say that we are committed to using this opportunity to strengthen economic governance at European level .
one approach to help ensure their loss and our victory is to limit the current trend of renationalisation in Europe .
we cannot achieve everything we want through the Treaties .
when it comes to the longer term challenges , the European Council should once again address the Europe 2020 strategy .
who is paying for this now ?
( SK ) We are discussing how to find a way out of the relatively difficult economic and financial situation in Europe .
the European Union can only emerge from the crisis through Community solutions ; national egotism and endarism only make the problem worse .
I think this is a thorough change , which is highlighted both in the conclusions of the Council meeting tomorrow and in the motion for a resolution of the European Parliament .
thank you .
nevertheless , I believe that there is hope : Baroness Ashton .
( DE ) Mr President , many things were not achieved at the EU @-@ Russia Summit .
in writing . - Russia , it is still believed that the West is the main responsible for the collapse of the Soviet Union and for the loss of government years .
this would be much clearer for the consumer .
it is not up to you to decide because you are not a state .
I therefore call on Parliament and the Commission to consider the possibility of creating joint research programmes for south @-@ eastern Europe , focusing on important areas such as the sea and the sea energy , given the sustainable development of the Euro @-@ Atlantic axis and its neighbouring regions .
in writing . - A vote on the European Earth observation Programme ( GMES ) 2011 @-@ 2013 ( Glante ) is easy , and this is another text that we have also supported .
from the example of Estonia , we can clearly see that a balanced and ambitious policy can meet the convergence criteria .
in writing . - This report did not create any controversy in our group , which is why we supported it without further discussion .
the situation is even less acceptable because the interests of the market appear to be above the people &apos;s interests .
yes , there have been cases where lorry drivers have violated EU safety and labour regulations .
for the first time , we have harmonised regulations across the internal market on food labelling , which do not leave individual countries the opportunity to act on their own .
we also rejected the idea of specific national provisions , because the labelling system must be as uniform as possible .
they can choose local and regional products and avoid unnecessary transportation of food by far .
in writing . - ( IT ) I listened with interest to the statements made by President Barroso and President Van Rompuy .
I also agree that it is important that the EU budget should reflect the need to finance the transition to a green economy .
we must find common answers to these questions .
and did they not wait for the road , coffee and coding to be accepted ?
let us suspend the EU @-@ Israel Association Agreement until something is actually done .
in a situation where 95 % of industrial companies in the Gaza Strip are closed , 42 % of the labour force is unemployed and 75 % of the population are in a state of food insecurity , the Gaza Strip is almost completely dependent on humanitarian aid .
I welcome Israel &apos;s steps to set up a commission of inquiry , but it seems to me that this is not enough .
we are therefore using the resolution we drafted to request that the Commission publish a detailed report on trafficking in torture means .
in the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , I also believe that we need to make the most of the new External Action Service by making sure that it includes organisations and individuals who are well known for respect for human rights .
once again , I would like to make it clear that Parliament and your Commission have worked very well together .
the facts are very clear , and British and Swedish experts participated in international investigations into the incident .
people do not participate in our programmes because they do not have the expertise they need .
the country needs a full education system that is worthy of this great history , of multi @-@ ethnic child wars , out of a new European university .
secondly , we must emphasise the bilateral nature of such agreements .
on the issue of core functions , the Commission has already made its position very clear in its communication of May 2006 .
unfortunately , the Commission , the Council and most of this Parliament have made a dogmatic choice to make rail transport not a means of freedom , but a price commodity like any other one left in the power of the market and competition .
the debate is closed .
indeed , this must be our central objective in the future .
as Europeans , we should always be ready to join forces and help those in need .
we would also like to help them at the expense of our national budgets , but our national budgets have been exhausted , because we have had to fight the economic and financial crisis to the full extent and because we were committed to complying with the rules of the Growth and Stability Pact .
these regions face the challenges of the specific features of their landscapes and their poor infrastructure on a daily basis .
it is imperative that all media provide information in a way that is accessible and unhindered ( subtitled , clearly visible ) and helps people in times of natural disasters , and that mobile operators work together to provide subscribers with the desired individual preferences and free and direct information tailored to needs .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - ( PL ) The principle of mutual recognition , which is one of the fundamental principles , requires mutual trust and trust in the legal systems of other countries .
Spain : thank you , muchas gracias .
I am surprised by the attitude shown to statements made in plenary today , namely that we are all satisfied .
( DE ) Mr Schulz , we are not here in the German Bundestag or in Germany .
however , it is also very important for us , the Members of the European Parliament from other Member States , to monitor what is happening in Spain , because the Presidency is not only about leadership but also about leading the whole of the European Union .
perhaps the objective is not shared , which is perfectly legitimate .
it gives the European authority the power , namely Europol , to verify that every single requirement is designed as narrowly as possible to minimise the amount of data requested .
the agreement is neither ideal nor perfect , but I think it is the best possible option that we were able to achieve in such a short time .
the effectiveness of these data transfers in the fight against terrorism has been highlighted many times in the last few months .
this should not be used as a pretext for giving EU agencies and the Commission access to national budgets in the Member States before they are submitted to the national parliaments of the respective countries .
Mr President , the Committee on Petitions is one of the biggest breakthroughs in the European Union .
the European Union cannot accede to the Paris Convention itself , as it is only sovereign states that have this right .
therefore , all efforts to strengthen Frontex must be welcomed .
the formal Committee on ethics of the Republic of Lithuania adopted a decision to make public nominations on the basis of codes of conduct by politicians in the Republic of Lithuania .
however , it seems to me that cooperation could also take place very freely without the intervention of the European Commission .
our SMEs , which make up 99 % of Europe &apos;s production power , need less bureaucracy .
in writing . - ( FR ) This report seeks to improve the rights of bus and coach passengers , which I consider to be a very good objective and which I voted for .
these include the liability of carriers , which must be met with responsibility for other modes of transport , paying particular attention to assistance and advance payments in the event of accidents , passengers &apos; rights in the event of cancellation and exit , and the rights of disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility .
Member States should in turn take the necessary measures to ensure efficient and uniform deployment of transport modes and services in the Community : modernisation of road transport information and cooperation between management centres .
greater efforts and innovative ways of investment are needed , enabling the development of a trans @-@ European transport network to be completed and ensuring sustainable development of transport in the medium and long term .
I feel that we cannot allow young Europeans to be removed from social exclusion .
the assumption is that traineeships work under fair conditions , with a focus on providing training rather than replacing permanent workers .
we would also like to introduce a European Youth Guarantee that young people should not be unemployed for more than four months and be able to guarantee them both high quality traineeships and decent wages .
in writing . - ( DE ) I voted in favour of Mrs Gruny &apos;s own @-@ initiative report on atypical employment contracts in the EU .
the production of bio @-@ waste is certainly indispensable , but insufficient management can be avoided , particularly when waste is disposed of in landfills which constitute the main source of gas separating the ozone layer .
they represent a response to the challenges facing our single currency in Europe , but they also have a major impact on the global financial markets .
I applaud the fact that the Commission is focusing on addressing the central concerns , and I believe that , although very different methods , we will soon finally achieve a global financial system that is safer and better serves our economy .
( applause )
this was the second case where we had to fight to weaken the proposals .
we are not in a position to prevent banks from going bankrupt , but rather to ensure that their restructuring or possible liquidation is regular , limiting the effects on the rest of the system and , above all , preventing taxpayers from having to pay for the resulting crises themselves .
any other situation without regulations would jeopardise both the euro , the unified EU and democracy .
next week , please hold an open dialogue with the Ecofin Council .
however , priority has been given to national supervisory authorities , which finally cooperate with each other and keep each other fully informed of matters , thereby preventing risky transactions .
finally , I would like to thank the rapporteurs , who were my compatriot , Ramon Tremosa and Mr García @-@ Margallo , Mr Giegold and Mrs Goulard , Mr Skinner and Mrs Ferreira .
this really does seem to be a good idea , but it does not solve the main problem under any circumstances .
the supervisory authority must carry out a detailed review of the risk management regime and companies must establish internal procedures to address potential problems and conflicts between their risk management units and entities .
as we lost , we had to compromise .
Mr Christensen , you stressed the importance of transparency .
subject : full implementation by Turkey of the Association Agreement and the Additional Protocol
Member of the Commission . - The core of the European Neighbourhood Policy is respect for human rights and fundamental values and respect for democratic principles .
so these are , for example , products which were not or have not yet been recognised as EU food on the EU market before 15 May 1997 .
we want the Commission to table a legislative proposal without delay and we really want to put pressure on it .
if the precautionary principle had existed some forty years ago , heart transplants would never have been committed and hundreds of hospitals would have remained untreated .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to talk about the use of nanomaterials in food , because there is a very high level of confidence among citizens in this regard .
I have heard many arguments in this debate .
all parties involved have made huge efforts to prevent this text from being sent to the agreement procedure .
however , we can only respond to this challenge if we implement the best available techniques in as many industries as possible .
we cannot prevent countries that are currently poor from engaging in exports and trade .
five years ago , I put this problem before Louis Michel , the then Commissioner , and said that we needed a measure like this .
in addition , in order to ensure the effectiveness of the regulation , we should emphasise the need for regular checks and strict , dissuasive penalty systems for offenders .
I myself have witnessed how a worker is trying to drive a spawning house down to comply with EU rules , and this gives me an idea of the challenges ahead of us .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , agricultural policy needs a common framework .
it is vital that agricultural production and the common agricultural policy be seen as a solution to these objectives , not part of the problem .
although the most important task for agriculture is food supply , the importance of agriculture as a public good has been increasingly understood , both social policy , the environment or cultural aspects .
many poultry farmers - particularly in Bretagne - paid a certain price for this transaction .
now there will be the fourth EU @-@ Brazil Summit , where we aim to review progress in our relations and discuss major world challenges .
I am extremely concerned that the Commission intends to continue trade talks relentlessly on the basis of a mandate dating back to 1999 , which will undoubtedly have a negative impact on agriculture throughout the European Union .
the joint debate is closed .
sensitivity in this area will be taken into account in the implementation of the common commercial policy .
another way to enable the European fisheries sector to survive is by better marketing .
4 .
Mr President , there are a number of reasons for voting against this resolution , but 60 seconds is too short to deal with them .
we are the fourth largest military power and the fifth largest economy in the world .
it is certain that , after 11 September 2001 , no person will take their security and physical security for granted .
after thorough consideration , I decided to vote in favour of the new agreement because the legal framework for combating terrorism is necessary and we are finally on the way to a European system for data transmission inspections , which allows data extraction on European soil .
this compromise was preceded by extensive negotiations and it seems to me that the compromise is satisfactory and balanced .
the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left has always opposed the unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo , as this act goes against international law .
we should be concerned about people , about their illness and its suffering , and we should think about the impact it has on society , particularly in the least developed countries .
however , we believe that the capacity and security of our armed forces must not be undermined in any way .
I voted against Amendment 69 of the proposed resolution because it calls into question the general approach of the common agricultural policy and threatens the interests of Portuguese agriculture by recommending the elimination of funding for structural measures without ensuring its replacement through changes to the first pillar .
however , the report assumes that , to some extent , problems can be solved by offering protection for competition from the outside world .
the arrest of Farai Maguwu , head of the Centre for Research and Development , following an interview with the architect of the Kimberley Process , Abbey Chikane , is , unfortunately , just another section in the long list of human rights violations in that country .
the government of Zimbabwe has voluntarily joined the Kimberley Process , and we must insist that it fulfils its obligations .
that is why we have this implementation campaign .
I would therefore urge , first of all , the embassies of the Member States of the European Union to accept people who have managed to flee these embassies , to help them reach more secure countries and to ensure that they can start a new life there .
( PL ) Mr President , North Korea and Cuba are the last Communist remnants in the world .
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see Minutes
agenda of the next sitting : see Minutes
on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , the EPP always welcomes the good and thorough discussions on social issues in plenary , but they must be well prepared .
( applause )
I am very pleased with this debate in plenary today , as it shows quite clearly our commitment to the fundamental value of our Union .
it is therefore important to have an effective system of catching and convicting criminals .
these are the very important things that we have put forward in this resolution .
the pressure to maximise oil production goes hand in hand with measures intended to improve safety or with proper risk assessment .
my point is that the issue of the conservation of species is not a kind of charitable attempt to rescue a few little poor trees , without which we should manage .
as Mr Mitchell expressed this brilliantly , this wall of poverty - and , I would add , a shortage - must fall .
I therefore think that this gives us a real opportunity to show in this House that we are serious about what we say .
recent studies show that our natural resources are under serious threat , particularly in the seas of Mediterranean countries .
as some of you have mentioned , it is a genuine and fundamental issue of moral and ethical ethics , but for those who do not understand it , it is becoming more than obvious that this is a question of our quality of life and of our economic success .
we must also take into account the social dimension of the Europe 2020 strategy , which , as you know , was adopted by the European Union at the June European Council .
it therefore includes a horizontal social clause which states that the definition and implementation of all EU policies must be guided by promoting a high level of employment , adequate social protection and the fight against exclusion .
there are many other issues , however .
by supporting visa liberalisation , we are not only sending out a political message .
however , we must insist that all these countries achieve and maintain a high level of security in biometric passports in the future .
that is a fact ; it is a reality .
it has also proved that the principle of applying the conditions used by the European Union to grant visa liberalisation has worked well and has produced positive results .
the facts are clear .
this gives us cause for concern .
I therefore agree that Parliament should be more involved in the negotiations with a view to making the changes necessary to ensure that European industry and the European economy are not disadvantaged .
last year , we asked the Commission to submit proposals on better instruments .
under Regulation ( EC ) No 1107 / 2006 , the airport must assist these two groups .
has the EU - or should I say the Commission - considered what the demand is for Ireland to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact by 2014 , with social and indeed economic consequences ?
why should we then secure or pay for the disease , for surgical intervention , if there is no hospital , is neither doctor nor medicine ?
thirdly , this is because it is less polluting .
I therefore support my group &apos;s call to make the European Social Fund more visible , particularly in order to improve the allocation of funds .
in Northern Ireland , we receive significant support from the European Social Fund through the Agency for Training and Employment , and I draw attention to a recent study by the Senate on the Social Fund , which stated that the Social Fund contributes to the promotion of economic growth in Northern Ireland in the former way , with the aim of creating a knowledge @-@ based economy with a skilled and flexible labour force .
firstly , care must be taken to ensure that a second option is given .
as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , I believe that it is vital to strive to achieve greater coherence and better synergies between regional policy and rural development policy in the future .
this work must therefore be fully aligned with that of the European Regional Development Fund .
this includes , in particular , the important links between the south @-@ western European electorate , the interesting Pyrenees between France and Spain .
nor does it contribute to the fact that Latvia forms part of one region .
these days were of great importance to our continent ; we can be proud , and we will remember these days forever .
other countries and nations have defended our freedom and have done their utmost to help us achieve unity .
it was my duty to send a message of greeting and hope to our East German friends .
in fact , you announced the vote on the original text of the paragraph .
written explanations of vote
other EU countries have already used this fund in the past ; so we should now allow aid to support 703 workers made redundant from 82 companies in the Galicia clothing manufacturing industry .
the European Union is an area of solidarity , and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) is part of this .
this is a process that follows recent events with regard to Serbia , Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
significant progress has been made in these countries in meeting the requirements of the European Union .
in writing . - ( LV ) quite recently , more than 500 people were victims of mass gang rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that the EU should use diplomatic means to contribute to the abolition of the death penalty by putting pressure on governments to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty , with a view to its total abolition .
I therefore voted in favour of this resolution because it is important that we lay down strict rules in Europe for preventing accidents on oil platforms and for the Union to strengthen legislation on environmental liability .
in writing . - ( FR ) The risk of a serious accident taking place in the waters of the European Union is great and Europe is simply not prepared to cope with the devastating consequences of such an accident .
I agree with the request contained in the resolution to support efforts aimed at increasing synergies and links between biodiversity policy and climate policy .
I voted against the cover of speculation .
these data , which can be classified as striking , warn us that humanitarian aid , which is essential for these countries , must be properly managed in the health sector and that the very deprived communities must be provided with basic medical care .
if these funds were to attract and make the best use of them , GDP would have risen by 15 % over the next five years .
the EU must give regions the opportunity to intervene by making use of targeted subsidies to reunite regions facing demographic decline .
in fact , the opposite should be done : this fund should be closely linked to other instruments , particularly regional policy , in order to increase efficiency .
however , the introduction of parental leave in the maternity leave directive is not in line with our overall objective , nor with the legal basis on which the proposal is based .
this is a debate that we have during the vote on Wednesday .
most cases of fake declarations or undeclared work relate to women .
here we have no alternative .
we want women to feel protected enough , but if it goes too far in defence for ideological reasons , it will be an important obstacle to women &apos;s employment - something that we must get rid of and which must not be encouraged .
we must also respect the diverse social and cultural differences in the various Member States .
( ga ) Mr President , we have had an excellent debate this evening and , generally speaking , many correct remarks were made in this Chamber .
among the priorities of the European Union &apos;s social agenda are the need to promote measures aimed at supporting reconciliation of work , private and family life for women .
the call to maintain full pay for maternity leave is also an important step towards reducing the income gap between women and men .
it is rather a consensual democracy and not so much a conflict democracy as in our countries .
the oral question to the Commission by Sophia in &apos; t Veld and Alexander Alvaro , on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , and Mrs Sippel , on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , on the transfer of data by Member States to the United States on the basis of Memoranda of Understanding - B7 @-@ 0555 / 2010 ) ;
I agree with you : I , too , would like it .
the Commission has therefore decided that the regulation will not prejudice the future positions of our institution to transpose the measures of Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union for the Management of Regional Resources .
we have excellent coastlines that depend on fishing , but , as I have said before , I have never met as much hope for any group of people as their fishermen .
thank you , Commissioner , for your words , and I hope for good cooperation in the future .
( RO ) In Romania , a Member State of the European Union , democracy is actually violated by a government party , without fear of the consequences .
I would also like to ask all Member States to support standardisation and my fellow Members to support Kožušník &apos;s report .
however , according to the initial structure , the EEAS suffered a number of shortcomings arising from its complex , decentralised structure , with consequences throughout the world .
the work we are doing this week will be completed by the difficult work to establish the legal and budgetary basis of the EEAS .
once again , however , there are intergovernors and quotas , but ultimately , candidates should be assessed on the basis of their characteristics .
for us , there are two priorities : conflict prevention and civil crisis control .
Mr President , although the idea of the European External Action Service has never been strongly supported in Europe , EU bureaucrats were able to sell it down , claiming that it does not affect the budget .
I want full crisis management , I want human rights to be part of mainstream politics and related to trade , and I live up to what many of our colleagues in Eastern Europe are talking about , but can I be absolutely sure that the service of the people is fully in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon ?
this criterion and competence do not exclude each other .
at the end of the year , the European Commission will present a European Platform against Poverty by setting out concrete measures to support Member States to achieve the target of bringing at least 20 million European citizens out of poverty by 2020 .
answer : more rules and more red tape for businesses , which are hardest hit by SMEs , which employ 50 % of the workforce .
child poverty data is a source of desperation in our country .
the EU 2020 strategy is also there .
the number of active European citizens will be reduced by millions over the next decade .
no country , no political group or region can cope with this alone .
the most gloomy chapters in Europe are written in precisely this language .
( SK ) If I waived some points , I was in favour of this report .
as data on European road , rail and inland waterway transport statistics are already to be collected by type of goods , I consider it necessary to have a common framework for the collection of statistics on maritime transport , which also helps to ensure the greatest comparability possible between the various modes of transport .
given that the Netherlands has requested assistance for 512 redundancies at NXL Semiconductors Netherlands , a company operating in the electronics sector in the NUTS II region of Gelderland and Eindhoven , I voted in favour of this resolution as I agree with the Commission &apos;s proposal and with Parliament &apos;s respective amendments .
Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1006 / 2008 on the authorisation of Community fishing vessels for fishing activities outside Community waters and the access of third country vessels to Community waters provides that EU vessels must have fishing licences for fishing activities outside EU waters .
in order to avoid such situations , we need to promote basic training and professional self @-@ improvement , better knowledge of our own rights , and looking at the true situation of women &apos;s work and family life , because , although women &apos;s income is seen as second income , it can be misleading , as it is often the only income of the family .
unfortunately , these new areas of responsibility do not involve the necessary financial resources .
at the moment , I will indeed limit myself to informing you of the main points of the Council &apos;s position and , of course , it is precisely in the conciliation procedure , which should take place if the Assembly votes in favour of all the amendments - and this is never certain - that it is possible to finalise all political positions .
in addition to the Inames programme , which aims to increase the mobility of doctoral candidates and doctoral candidates , to enable closer cooperation with industry and to modernise EU universities , there is the question of EUR 10 million for communication and communication .
we would have liked to have seen different figures in certain parts of the agricultural budget .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
the programme aims to ensure a truly economic approach by promoting the respective preferences of each country , the sustainable use of resources , investment in production and the creation of jobs with rights .
has it not been the dogma of the so @-@ called free market and the comprehensive Lisbon Strategy to blame for all these years of unemployment and increasing poverty and unemployment ?
( NL ) Mr President , my group sees no reason why the 2011 budget should be higher than that for 2010 .
in the case of the first budget adopted under the Treaty of Lisbon , this would be a strong political signal from Parliament , which does not intend to use its new codecision powers solely to manage a lack of money , in other words , to decide which debt will be paid back with the money that has been borrowed .
this is the first time that we are using this new procedure , following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , but I believe that we all - even anti @-@ European and anti @-@ European sceptics - must be wholeheartedly convinced that the European Union is making us strong in the face of both general criticism and targeted criticism .
it is very easy to criticise the current system and say it is unfair , complex and contrary to the Treaty , but it is also easy to make unjustified accusations if we are to start discussions on this matter .
abolishing returns and introducing a new European tax - let us still name things with these correct names - does not require treaty changes .
I do not think today we can talk about the EU budget without starting a debate on own resources and communitarisation , or without mentioning certain areas of expenditure .
ladies and gentlemen , our citizens - the taxpayers - have already paid once ; do they have to pay for another time ?
does the Commission approve of the World Fund for Nature proposal to restrict commercial transport in the Baltic Sea ?
I therefore believe that we need to address this issue and , if necessary , find an appropriate solution in the budget to speed up this process .
the Commission &apos;s objective is to provide a level playing field at global level , both for our fisheries sector and for the fishing sectors in other countries , which produce the products that we import .
therefore , the timely payment of debt should not create difficulties for them .
in order to reimburse late payments , a new 1 % reimbursement rate could be introduced for private individuals , businesses and public authorities , and interest rates and other penalties should be calculated only on the basis of late payments .
the tragic event in Hungary also represents a loss for Europe .
the criteria for hazardous waste must certainly be specified in such a way as to include high levels of diesel or high ph levels .
in order to avoid a risk becoming a disaster , first of all , supervision , preparedness and prevention are needed , and I absolutely agree with those speakers who stressed it .
only recently , a Dutch national government planned to set up an ethnic database containing ethnic data , but the project was cancelled on the recommendation of the Dutch Data Protection Agency .
I have to admit that I am disappointed this evening , and many of us have listened to and even supported your previous statements .
agenda of the next sitting : see Minutes
some other issues still need to be resolved .
we ask for strong measures based on the added value of the European Union , so that we can lift Europeans out of this recession and ensure that , in the future , everyone in Europe has a job , that poverty is lost and that it is possible to believe again in the European project .
what Nicolas and Angela herself did with the French @-@ German joint management committee is an attack on the institutions of the European Union .
do you not see what is threatening us now ?
I would like to thank Mrs Berès openly and my colleagues in the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis , who have shown that we in the European Parliament can cross the political groups &apos; boundaries and find common solutions in the interests of Europe .
we need to strengthen integration , we need to harmonise economic and budgetary policies more , we need European infrastructure projects in the field of energy , transport and telecommunications .
this is a wage battle , a wage competition .
this is very dangerous .
Mr President , I have a suggestion that , in future , we should have a single representative on economic issues .
a Europe that has the views of the Council , the Commission and Parliament , and a Europe that attaches importance to economic governance cannot be based on two @-@ leaning summits , must take into account the opinions of the institutions , the opinion of the European Parliament and the opinion of the people .
the recovery of the global economy is still weak and its pace differs from one country to another .
I mentioned them first and foremost because of the tremendous work they did to reach a good agreement on the European External Action Service .
I very much appreciate the way in which you chaired the sitting today and I hope that you will also share your excellent skills with the other Vice @-@ Presidents of the European Parliament .
these changes mean that the people of Europe now have a new role to play in decision @-@ making at EU level .
France , which may be proud of its oldest diplomatic service in the world , must once again surrender its diplomatic prerogatives to the EU , whose citizens are completely indifferent to what positions it adopts .
in writing . - For those of us who come from the new Member States , it is disappointing that the legally binding obligation to ensure geographical balance in the European External Action Service has been removed .
those in need should still receive support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund , which should be a permanent fund and should have its own budget .
I welcome the decision of this Parliament to follow the guidelines of the Committee on Budgets and the Member States , which are often forced to borrow money due to excessive EU advances .
enabling the reconciliation of family and working life between women and the achievement of the gender equality objectives - this is what we stand for all European women .
all in all , it is likely that the minimum duration of leave will be the period proposed by the European Commission and supported by the delegation of the Democratic Movement for the Party - namely , 18 weeks &apos; leave - in line with the recommendations of the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) .
the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) has stressed that many of the proposals tabled ( amendments ) exceed the scope and purpose of the directive .
the adoption of this arrangement would have a significant impact on the budgets of Member States and businesses , with an annual extra cost of EUR 1.3 billion , which is an intolerable financial burden during budget cuts .
I welcome the adoption of the report on the proposal for a directive on improving the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding , as well as measures to encourage the reconciliation of workers &apos; work and family life .
the recommendation of the European Parliament that small and medium @-@ sized enterprises should only be charged with VAT after invoicing , and that the setting of a clear deadline for paying invoices will help those who are concerned about their survival at a time when market indicators are in decline .
I therefore hope that other factors will also be taken into account during the implementation phase , by relaxing the rules arising from the Stability Pact for public authorities while , at the same time , gradually reducing payment deadlines .
in order to ensure that this does not happen correctly , it is recommended that people receiving this income should also have the opportunity to work a certain number of hours for the benefit of society .
there is extreme poverty behind these figures , which is growing alarmingly , especially during the current economic downturn , which is why the minimum income is crucial .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the Berès report because I support the majority of its contents .
I believe that the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis has done its job well by presenting new ways , measures and initiatives in this document , which will allow the EU to be much better prepared for any crisis that might occur in the future .
I voted in favour of this report because I believe that improving economic governance in the European Union is essential .
in writing . - ( LV ) In my opinion , Mr Feio &apos;s report is the most professional report in the last three months .
please do not cut off the sitting with such comments .
the Commission is ready to consult the European Parliament in order to find a solution that takes account of Parliament &apos;s requests .
this democratic accountability is essential , especially at a time when Member States are cutting their spending significantly .
instead of giving European consumers something , we take away from them .
there are serious violations of democracy and respect for human rights in Transnistria .
therefore , this instrument is important and we believe that it is necessary to promote all technical simplifications that allow these organisations to access aid , which is often crucial for their survival .
indeed , you took a rather gloomy picture of what is happening in Ukraine at the moment , even going so far as to compare it with China .
this is an achievement that we cannot question until the next elections have taken place .
no changes have been made to the law or to the electoral Commission over a week .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
there are three reasons for my relative pessimism .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , combating violence against women is a common objective of the European Parliament and of the Council .
with regard to the 3 % threshold for flexibility , as you know , we are showing a great deal of flexibility , and we have been flexible since 2009 , we have been flexible in 2010 , and we remain flexible in 2011 and 2012 too , so that our various Member States can restore budgetary sustainability , because if we had wanted to apply this 3 % limit rigorously , without allowing any less deviation , for example this year almost all Member States would have infringed this principle of budgetary control .
I welcome this because it gives Pakistan the chance to comply with social and human rights standards by 2014 , so that it can join the GSP + system in 2014 .
the regulation proposed by the Commission focuses , in particular , on the suspension of duties in the textile and leather goods sector , which accounts for 60 % of Pakistan &apos;s exports , with a turnover of almost EUR 200 million for the textile industry and a turnover of EUR 510 million for the skin industry , and it is characteristic of both industries that produce is located in neighbouring regions , which have not been directly affected by floods .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
it is made of cotton from Egypt , which would cane a cocktail in Italy .
I am in favour of more accurate data on products , which is why I oppose this Commission proposal .
I would feel rather stupid if I were to go down a long road to Sweden to buy something that has been produced in my neighbourhood .
I am concerned that the total exclusion of patents , important intellectual property rights , may result in many industries losing out on the benefits of this chapter .
however , the questions that we could have put to the Commission recently after the negotiations in Question Time - for which I would like to thank you once again - we did not receive satisfactory answers .
secondly , the ACTA Committee seems to be able to introduce amendments to the texts .
the initialling of the agreement is a Commission right and does not fully integrate into the European Union .
progress shows the political will , hard work and commitment to be paid for .
however , in order for the reforms to continue after 28 November , a clear signal from the European Union is needed , so I hope that the forthcoming Council summit will succeed in pushing for visa facilitation .
I participated in a conference organised by the Minister for Culture on the integration of Moldova into Europe , particularly in the field of culture .
we know that the number of containers lost at sea has risen dramatically and , as I said earlier , Commissioner Kallas is dealing with this problem .
Mr President , Commissioner , the sustainable use of the marine environment is essential for the sustainability and growth of all European economies , particularly those with a direct maritime economy .
it is not enough to promote environmental protection in the EU , even though we always do this with a great deal of air , because it is well known that nuclear and waves do not recognise borders .
if we do not make our ports more resolutely free , they will not be able to expand the important role they are required to play within the framework of intermodal transport .
however , setting different emission limits in EU waters runs counter to an integrated maritime policy aimed at taking into account all factors .
the question was simply how to resolve whether there should be a new fund in Europe for the renovation of old ships or a strategy .
Mr President , if we cannot achieve a majority , I would like to ask Parliament to postpone the vote on the resolution at the next sitting in Strasbourg .
despite the fact that trade relations between these two regions have improved , trade between the EU and Latin America is less active than our trade relations with other regions in the world .
in its legislative proposal for a mid @-@ term review of the DCI Regulation , the Commission proposed only one technical amendment whereby taxes , duties and other charges relating to the financing of measures under the DCI Regulation would be allowed to be financed in beneficiary countries from the DCI budget .
on the other hand , the extension of the geographical scope of Regulation ( EC ) No 1934 / 2006 places the developing countries concerned within the scope of the two different external action instruments .
the aim is to create a level playing field for EU producers and producers from third countries ( the United States , Japan and Canada ) which , as has already been said , show us the way in terms of such measures .
the processes described in this text do not take account of inequalities .
the legislation in force must also improve the safety of oil exploration and drilling .
South America has much in common with Europe because of many historical , social and economic reasons .
the Zimbabwean Government is severely violating civil , political , economic and social rights enshrined in the African Charter on Human Rights and peoples &apos; Rights .
it is clear that we need to see how they are actually implemented .
these organisations must therefore be supported , and the deplorable actions carried out in the North Caucasus must also be condemned , the word must be spoken on behalf of more and more people who have lost and not forget the suffering of displaced people .
the government should strive to convict people who carry out kidnappings and murders , not to silence those who bring these problems to light , as Mr Orlov does .
however , we also want to discuss the unfavourable position of the opposition in regional and local elections , where the opposition could not nominate its candidacy anywhere , and even more so , the separation of judicial power and executive power .
we must support the peace process in the Middle East with a view to creating , within one year , a framework for an agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
we believe that the dialogue and relations between the European Union and the United States must be developed in a spirit of mutual understanding and independence .
unfortunately , this is not very likely to be so much in line with the principles of globalisation .
if we want the voice of Europe to be heard on important issues , we must be enterprising and speak with one voice .
after the Copenhagen climate summit and the way in which President Obama ignored the Spanish Presidency , the Americans once again brought shame to us and to the rest of the world by taking a unilateral decision to print the money .
thank you very much for today &apos;s debate .
I would like to assure you in my general income management that , although PNR data is very important for the Council , the Council certainly wants to take maximum account of Parliament &apos;s legitimate request for a good balance between privacy and security , which always needs to be guaranteed .
I was pleased to hear that the Commission is studying the issue of profiling , but I think there is still a need for further discussion .
the fact that there are a number of parallel initiatives at one time indicates the need for harmonisation .
it is equally questionable whether the FBI needs to know the names , address , email , credit card and baggage transfer numbers of passengers in the United States and be able to store these data for up to 15 years .
I would like to thank him and all the coordinators and all the shadow rapporteurs and - as Mr Reynders said a short while ago - the Belgian Presidency and the entire team for the important and determined work they have done over the past few weeks , but also for the previous presidencies .
it is still up to Member States to decide how deep debt funds may fall , which in turn proves that we have not learned the lessons of the crisis .
on that occasion , too , my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left declared that a text has been submitted to Parliament that is neither ideal nor perfect , but for years now they have been grateful for the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament pushed through it .
the new financial supervisory regime will help ensure that this is the case , and hopefully today we will be able to put things in place once and for all on alternative investment fund managers .
alternative investment funds ( hedge funds ) entering Europe will henceforth be controlled and regulated more rigorously .
in the current European and international context , characterised by the globalisation of trade , technological development and the emergence of new players on the world stage , it is certainly necessary to relaunch the single market decisively in order to ensure the right balance of protection for all those involved : businesses , consumers and workers .
Bernadette Vergnaud and Sophie Auconie , the same applies to the framework of quality requirements , which President Barroso is committed to for services of general interest .
we also call on the new political will to refrain from temptations of economic nationalism and to maximise everyone &apos;s potential .
our Council held the first informal debate on this subject in July and then in formal debate on 12 October , and this debate allowed the Presidency to present a draft Council decision which is currently being examined and which , as I have already said , is on the Competitiveness Council &apos;s agenda on 25 and 26 November .
we therefore need to significantly increase capacity , renew capacity and research governance in order to guide research and help businesses to start work on this very difficult and difficult business for the future .
it is necessary to strengthen the OSCE &apos;s capabilities with regard to all three dimensions in order to enable this to play a better role in early warning , conflict prevention , crisis resolution and reconstruction .
there are many serious human rights violations , appalling conditions in prisons , and so on .
the country has fulfilled all the necessary technical requirements .
one of the possible developments that should be considered is the negotiation of broader trade arrangements with Taiwan , especially now that the country reached an important milestone in signing the framework agreement for economic cooperation .
in my opinion , this is a very serious decision , as it will be relative to the content of the very important European Union directive on terrorism .
instead , public pensions should be monitored .
large groups of people born during baby boom are approaching retirement age , while new groups reaching the labour market are much smaller .
lastly , ensuring support for businesses for access to funds earmarked for agricultural projects is another key issue , which must be regarded as an incentive , especially in the inclusion of young people in agriculture .
the Commission services are currently trying to find solutions that can be implemented quickly .
this decision is a good sign that our efforts to improve controls have a definite impact .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , over the last 16 years , the auditors have refused to control and approve 90 % or more of the budget year , and this year is not an exception .
we do not think out of the facts ; we are not open to the Commission or the Member States .
this means that we are doing something that has a direct local impact and which will act as a model for the future activities of my intelligent cities .
priority topics are , in my opinion , support for cross @-@ border gas and electricity infrastructure ( including interconnections ) and carbon capture and storage projects .
there are currently difficulties in the livestock sector in the EU caused by a number of factors , including increased production costs , competition from imports from third countries and , of course , various issues that create an increase in feed costs .
Mr President , I am very pleased that we are dealing with the situation in the livestock sector , which is serious .
Fourthly , livestock farmers are disadvantaged in the supply chain compared to processors and merchants .
now that the European Parliament &apos;s decision to lift the visa requirement for citizens of the People &apos;s Republic of China ( Taiwan ) entering the Member States of the European Union and Schengen countries has been adopted by such a large and significant majority , I warmly welcome the citizens of Taiwan .
however , thanks to an ageing Europe , it seems rather difficult to achieve this .
several EU countries have already used the EGF , so we should also provide assistance to Ireland , which has asked for 850 redundancies in the air transport sector in the NUTS III region of SR Technics Ireland Ltd , which operates in Dublin .
however , it needed a financial crisis so that Member States and a majority in the European Parliament agree to adopt binding legislation on alternative funds .
the EU Directive on hedge funds , private equity and other alternative investment funds put forward by the European Commission in April 2009 in response to the financial crisis , in line with the guidelines agreed at the G20 summit , was finally approved by a large majority .
since the first democratic elections in 1996 , Taiwan has undergone significant democratic developments and substantial institutional reforms to respect for civil liberties and rights , which have helped to strengthen its political stability .
in some countries , projects on the renovation of buildings , gas and electricity infrastructure , energy interconnections , offshore wind farms and carbon capture and storage are progressing very slowly .
the military path of ensuring the domination of the resource markets is becoming dangerously more important , as will the US and the EU &apos;s closer &apos; strategic &apos; cooperation &apos; in the framework of NATO .
in my opinion , the Commission must make sure that all agreements or measures on personal data transfer pass through a proportionality test and ensure the confidentiality of personal data .
if it is to be amended in the future , it is important to maintain a balance between freedom and security .
at a time when the economy , technology and information science are constantly developing , we must not forget the most important factor - the person .
furthermore , women of all ages often take care of children and older dependents .
as the retirement age is expected to increase , working conditions should be adapted to the needs of older people and made work more attractive for them .
we are ready to do all this , and the submitted report also deals with these opportunities .
I therefore found that the report aimed at simplifying the way in which funds for research , development and innovation are allocated through the Seventh Framework Programme should be supported .
the role of the European Parliament should be limited to two areas .
I voted in favour of this resolution precisely in order to embark on a path leading to the imminent restoration of income for people for whom livestock farming is a life .
secondly , in recent years , we have seen that the virus in the case of live animals can quickly deteriorate .
I believe that this is a subject worthy of the plenary debate on Baroness Ashton &apos;s presence .
the second issue concerns the currencies of emerging countries , which have current account surpluses and exchange rates , which are not flexible enough .
it is unacceptable that we have huge austerity programmes on the expenditure side , while on the revenue side countries continue to compete without restrictions .
48 out of 50 states in the United States have a deficit budget .
perhaps Gerard Batten does not understand this word , or Ireland needs Britain as much as England needs Ireland and its economy .
we are trying to do this .
at this stage , the Commission cannot agree on a monthly proposal on VAT rates .
the Commission has strengthened its humanitarian presence by providing appropriate medical expertise and has mobilised € 12 million to support partners in Haiti .
I would like us to remain supportive and put pressure on where it is needed .
I have not yet been to Haiti , but it is my opinion that the exclusion or postponement of the elections can , in fact , destabilise the already difficult situation .
the action plan adopted by me on the basis of the report must help to eliminate discards in the Baltic Sea by imposing , if necessary , a total discard ban , for example , in the Baltic Sea fisheries .
I sincerely believe that , against this background of uncertainty , the Commission should strive today in Parliament to send a positive signal to the sector .
I understand the problems and we need to find the right balance and solution .
we therefore rejected advertising in all so @-@ called &apos; forced &apos; channels such as radio , television and newspapers .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , at the threshold of the 21st century , patients need , in particular , appropriate information so that they can participate fully in the consideration of treatments , know where to seek treatment , can choose the best treatment with healthcare professionals and must be scrupulously followed by the planned treatment .
we must therefore apply certain safeguards to ensure the welfare of European pathists .
Commission position on amendments proposed by the European Parliament :
this has led to significant changes in the development of electronic products both in the European Union and in the rest of the world .
another difficult issue was the detailed definition of nanomaterials , which was suspended during the Commission proposal on this matter .
however , such weighty decisions would require the courage and the strength of our politicians .
if the democratic forces that are currently concentrated in the Alliance for European Integration are to win , then the development of recent years - the development of democratic government , rights and the welfare of the people - will be ensured .
what can the EU do about this ?
finally , we must ensure that , in the new emergency , we are able to take better coordinated action to improve the flow of water .
wars cause the most damage to innocent civilians , and during armed conflicts , the civilian population is mainly made up of women .
tomorrow , there will be a general strike in Portugal , during which men and women will again protest against the principles of anti @-@ social values .
I wonder how the College of Commissioners chose a year , for example .
this is the stage in which the Council has also entered when discussing the regulation .
on the other hand , the 2020 deadline , proposed specifically by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , did not receive sufficient positive feedback .
( RO ) Mr President , fellow Members have already mentioned here that this is a recurrent debate in the European Parliament .
I would like to say that the European Union &apos;s economic problems during the crisis are not only the result of unfair financial speculation worldwide , but are also caused by a lack of a credible , coherent and fair industrial policy , particularly fuel and energy policy within the European Union itself .
however , since I believe that the existence of a long @-@ term plan for anchovy fishing is more important for the sector , I intend to vote in favour of it , and I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Council , which has a lot of doubts , to accept the power of codecision granted to the European Parliament under the Treaty of Lisbon and to set the date for starting negotiations today , because if this plan does not go ahead , the sector will suffer most .
so our first step was the dissolution of the KGB and the dismissal of police forces ...
they could play an extremely positive role in the current transformation of our common area , treating other countries as partners rather than being subordinated .
although the total damage remains below the normal threshold , Ireland &apos;s application falls under the criterion of the so @-@ called &apos; extraordinary regional disaster &apos; , which sets out the conditions for mobilising the Solidarity Fund under exceptional circumstances .
in writing . - ( PT ) A further six requests have been made for the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund , which means that hundreds of European businesses have once again been closed .
this support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of relocations resulting from globalisation .
in writing . - ( DE ) During the nine @-@ month reference period from 1 April to 29 December 2009 , 598 workers were made redundant in eight companies operating in the regions of Noord Holland and Zuid Holland .
finally , I support the mechanism being put in place to protect the interests and health of European consumers .
the renewal of the agreement confirms this success and we hope that this will continue to be the case .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of this resolution because it concerns the resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 25 February and the Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy as regards the need to cooperate at regional level in order to ensure the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources outside EU waters .
in writing . - ( PT ) This report is on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC establishing a minimum rate of 15 % of VAT , which is intended to be extended for a further five years at the end of the current period ( which was due to expire by the end of the year ) , since the agreement on the final harmonisation of VAT rates has not been reached .
during the crisis , ECB interest rates fell to 1 % and continued to implement important and unprecedented non @-@ standard credit support measures throughout 2009 .
this report , which I voted in favour of , also draws attention to the fact that the austerity packages of the governments of the Member States should not jeopardise the capacity to promote economic growth , and stresses that fiscal consolidation must be balanced with the need to invest in jobs and sustainable development , and that measures and instruments should be used that give meaning and a clear timetable to the sacrifices made by citizens .
under the Treaty of Lisbon , the development of a common defence policy is one of the EU &apos;s specific objectives .
I agree with the rapporteur when it comes to access to the area for horse mackerel fishing vessels .
as regards the process of drafting the report , I am pleased that the Commission has included in its proposal for a regulation the proposals adopted by the Committee on Fisheries .
on the basis of this impact assessment and the logical continuation of Regulation ( EC ) No 1407 / 2002 , 2018 is an appropriate deadline , ensuring socially acceptable solutions , while at the same time creating massive redundancies in several Member States .
it has been able to carry out high quality work , on the basis of the principles of cooperation , debate , transparency and democratic dialogue , and even closer communication between European and ACP parliamentarians .
the implementation of the Stockholm Programme has been , and will continue to be , difficult .
I strongly condemn the attack by the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Korea on the island of Yeonpyeong in South Korea .
if there is no budget , there will be no ITER project or nuclear fusion reactors .
would you accept , rather than making negative comments about Ireland &apos;s search for help , that it is the European Union that is helping Ireland itself ?
I hope that , in view of this objective , we will take advantage of the next few weeks to ensure that the first procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon is successful and not a failure .
President Barroso &apos;s speech this evening was a good one .
the European Parliament has been very benign and agreed to the figures for 2011 , because we understand the economic situation in the Member States .
personally , I think that the failure of the 2011 budget negotiations is a loss for all of us .
similarly , criticism of EU taxation has nothing to do with the supposed lack of solidarity .
in our opinion , the proposals in this area are too weak .
Mr Vice @-@ President , I would like to say that I am quite sceptical about this .
similarly , we would have liked this year , when we have two new Member States - Hungary and Poland - to be able to continue to promote cohesion and the integration process in the EU .
finally , the important task is still to work on the objectives and the Multiannual Financial Framework for the 2014 @-@ 2020 period .
to this end , I will propose a European Skills passport which will allow people to record their skills in a clear and comparable way .
there are many good approaches to this , which have already been referred to by colleagues from our group .
it could work with the southern Member States and employ qualified staff in the EU .
I hope that the Member States will work closely with us on the use of the various energy sources .
( el ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to come to the subject referred to by the honourable friend in his question .
simplification was also one of the main reasons for encouraging the Commission to make the health check proposals .
however , in addition to simplification , which would benefit all farmers and , above all , small and medium @-@ sized producers , the common agricultural policy needs to be fundamentally changed , which would strengthen intervention instruments and ensure fair prices for farmers , restore production @-@ related instruments , such as quotas and production rights , and ensure , for each country - since we are talking about simplification - as simple as the right to produce , as well as the right to food security and sovereignty ; in addition , it would establish the principles of aid and the development of limits , with the elimination of imbalances between producer countries and production levels .
the European Parliament has expressed its opinion on this issue several times , including the recent Ashworth report on the simplification of the CAP .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
as the number of beekeepers is constantly shrinking , we also need to invest more in education and training .
this includes the common agricultural policy , biodiversity , food security , the use of pesticides , veterinary regulations and even the laboratories of requirements for obtaining EU funding .
Member States have different initiatives , but there is little or no coordination .
there has been a lot , including recent events in Ireland , since the last European Council , and the actions planned are an important further step towards ensuring the financial stability of Ireland , the euro area and the whole of the European Union .
in addition to that , I am not quite sure whether the amendment to the EU Treaty will be so easy to accept in Ireland as your report states to the European Council .
we know that this is only a matter of time if they also want solidarity and crisis management .
secondly - and finally - the European Council opposes automatic system of sanctions : no treaty changes and no Pandora &apos;s box is opened .
we can contribute to codecision .
what is Europe today ?
Mr President , as a member of the European Parliament representing Ireland , it was unpleasant for me to come here this morning to hear almost every speaker talk about Ireland because of our economic situation , especially when we were regarded a few years ago as a model of economic success in the European Union .
we would have identified property bubbles .
as Europeans , we were well prepared for these meetings , both at ministerial level and at Heads of State or Government level .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in her question today , Mrs Harms asked why the level of summits will no longer be handed over to the people and why there will be no new courage and new self @-@ confidence from summits .
therefore , in the short term , we must introduce a minimum level of coordination and , in the medium term , move towards a framework for resolution that harmonises the resolution of the crisis to a much greater extent , especially those based on the Commission &apos;s legislative proposals .
we call on North Korea to avoid exacerbating the situation and to make every effort to ensure peace and stability in the Korean peninsula .
I understand that you are difficult ...
we voted in favour of mobilising the European Union Solidarity Fund for Ireland , which was hit by floods last November .
all the other solutions will simply stop increasing the tension in Moldova , not tackling the problems well - in addition , these problems are at least partly due to the uneven attitude shown in the past by the EU .
in the field of health care , access to high quality information will ensure better results , because if patients understand the treatment they are much more likely to continue to do so .
these are the two main messages that we wish to highlight when we adopt the legislative package on information to patients .
the amendments tabled by the European Parliament on the European Commission &apos;s legislative proposal highlight the need for pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide key information , such as product characteristics , labelling , patient information and the publicly available version of the evaluation report .
I abstained from voting on the Evans report on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment , as I find Parliament &apos;s approach strange .
criteria for deciding on the duration / extension of the derogation ;
the agreement establishes a complete international framework to strengthen the fight against infringements of intellectual property rights .
today , energy policy is increasingly linked to the European Union &apos;s external policy .
Jens Rohdel is right .
however , I would caution in this area so that our ambitious plans do not jeopardise our industrial and commercial competitiveness .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have reached the debate and , if I summarise the main points of your speeches , we have a very wide range of energy sources in the European Union , in the Member States and also in Parliament .
I am confident that structural changes will soon be made to support the effective implementation of the single market and that we will be able to introduce a rapid and transparent authorisation process , make regional proposals and provide access to new funding instruments .
if only the EU takes on the second commitment period , it will not be sufficient or reliable .
according to the 2010 barometer compiled by the consultancy Ernst &amp; Young , China and the United States are the most attractive countries for the development of renewable energy .
( LT ) Mr President , the world will soon be receiving good news again about climate change , or rather bad news , as is the case recently , this time from Cancún .
Commissioner , we can conclude that the cause of climate change is the irrational nature of this same economic and social system .
the debate is closed .
we can also build on the good results achieved so far jointly , such as peace and security and regional integration .
to achieve this , priority must be given to strengthening the institutional organisation and organisation of the African Union .
firstly , we must focus our priorities on developing infrastructure , increasing food security and supporting governance .
I believe that this is an opportunity for Portuguese traders to enter into closer ties on the African market as part of their business networks , but the issues of insecurity and the high level of criminality committed by the Portuguese community , particularly the inhabitants of the communities of Madeira in South Africa , must be addressed .
UN security forces are limited to their activities in Western Sahara , although they should be able to exercise full control and monitoring of humanitarian aid .
if our resolution is directed at anyone , in the current context , I believe that it should be the citizens of Ukraine who will ensure that Ukrainian democracy continues to develop .
Ukraine is a country divided into the West and the Russian face between the East .
this regulation covers countries and their economies , but it is clear that the main economic players are companies , particularly international corporations - they play the most important role in world trade .
last but not least , since 20 % of emissions are generated by transport , we need to move towards short distribution channels , particularly in agriculture , which leads to jobs in our own countries and developing countries , and to a reduction in our emissions .
the conditions are often appalling for subcontracting and suppliers , including the production of raw materials .
I would like to express my thanks and sincerely congratulate my colleague , Mrs Saïfi , on this document , which is an example of Parliament making progress .
the vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , 25 November 2010 , at 12 noon .
China remains the main source of unfair trade in general ( approximately 35 % of EU cases are against China ) .
one example of this is children &apos;s toys - the hazardous ingredients contained in colours or plastics can lead to health warnings , and poor delivery can lead to accidents which may end up in the hospital .
in 2009 , my office closed 318 inquiries , 70 % of which were carried out within one year .
at the same time , the Commission recognises the importance of giving citizens a full and clear assessment of the results of the work done , together with Member States , in a timely manner and is committed to ensuring that complainants have the opportunity to comment on the outcome .
the actual form of the complaint is equally complex .
although the European Ombudsman does a dignified and good job , does the Ombudsman really have to spend almost EUR 9 million on his Office ?
( PL ) Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur for a very good , comprehensive and balanced report , and also the Ombudsman for his unfailing work on combating maladministration and improving the administrative standards of the European Union .
in response to Mr Häfner &apos;s question on the EU pilot project and its name : the reason for this is that , when we started this new project to create opportunities for Member States to correct their mistakes more quickly themselves , it was the procedure adopted , initiated only by some Member States .
I believe that it is vital to review the 2002 communication , particularly as regards the rights of the complainant .
although this does not completely remove the risk , it will reduce it .
thank you very much indeed .
nor will it be of the same benefit if we have a blot of similar industrial economies in Europe where we have cut ourselves off the rest of the world &apos;s growth markets .
the crisis area has also been blocked , so it cannot even accept international aid .
in writing . - ( SV ) I regret that the negotiations have not yet produced a result .
cooperation between international organisations must be stepped up as part of the global climate change agreement - particularly at the level of carbon inclusion mechanisms for the EU Emissions Trading Scheme - while ensuring that existing leakage is stopped .
the office of the European Ombudsman was established in 1992 by the Maastricht Treaty , which established a mediator between European citizens and the authorities of the European Union .
in the light of the consultations referred to in Article 4 ( 4 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 1049 / 2001 , the Commission must set a deadline for responding to the author of a third @-@ person document , and the Commission must exercise this right in a way that allows it to meet its own deadlines .
the analysis focuses on the Commission &apos;s report on the EU pilot evaluation report , in which the Commission proposes an assessment of the effectiveness of the EU pilot project 22 months after its implementation .
I support the recommendations made , which highlight incentives for exchange of best practices between Member States and greater cooperation between media regulators within the framework of the European network of national control authorities ( EPRA ) .
it is ten years since the aforementioned resolutions were adopted and there is still a long way to go , as stated in the resolution , which I voted in favour of .
this has a negative impact on the whole environment and agriculture , as bees are important pollinators .
in addition , the objective of reducing carbon dioxide emissions must be carefully revised in order to mitigate risks of carbon leakage and loss of competitiveness for European producers .
in writing . - ( PT ) I support the conclusion of a binding agreement at the Cancún climate summit covering the system of international sanctions .
global warming has now been scientifically proven , and therefore the objective must be to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions by 2015 at the latest , so that we can halve them by 2050 .
however , it is regrettable that this text was drafted before Parliament had access to all the facts and detailed information on the circumstances that highlighted this tragedy , including the exact number of victims .
the EU must adapt its trade policy to some form of discrimination against products on the basis of their climate impact , thus stimulating the shifts in patterns of production and consumption and investment strategies .
the expansion of international trade will only bring overall benefits in terms of meeting certain conditions , which is why it is necessary to guide the liberalisation of trade , including its practical organisation and scope - a need that is increasingly known when the globalisation process is accelerated .
the Christian minority of Mesoposions has been exposed to flagrant religious persecution for years .
Thursday afternoon &apos;s meetings are taking place in this House in an increasingly hot weather , both in terms of the amount we see , and in terms of the nature of the issues to be dealt with and their handling .
it is truly incredible that there are people who do not have the freedom to bow to the symbols of freedom , because they are being sacrificed when they leave the church simply because they were there .
for this reason , we should express our opposition to the attempt to deprive the Tibetans of their main means of communication .
people should not live in small or large prisons because of their own ideas .
we welcome the decision of certain opposition parties not to participate , but also that some other parties , including ethnic parties , were involved .
it is a little uncomfortable for me to do so , because it is not only my group &apos;s request ; it is supported by several other groups .
in this process , they dissolved the former media monitoring body based on equal representation and set up a body composed of representatives of the government political party .
following the economic and social destruction of the country , the current Romanian Government is implementing ridiculous measures , accompanied by a serious violation of the recognised fundamental rights of the European Union - the right to a pension , the right to trade union , the right to pay and the rights of young mothers .
I would like to reassure this House once again , either solemn or educational , that , following your statement , we will not be excluded , that our participation will not be restricted and that we will be given all the information about the start and progress of the negotiations on the treaties .
Member States apply uniform and simplified procedures .
Commissioner , I can tell you , without any doubt , that the current visa regime is flawed and particularly harmful for the EU .
this testifies to political will , and this is very important , but it must be very technical and inflexible in achieving this objective .
the next item is the report by Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation ( EC ) No 377 / 2004 on the creation of a network of immigration liaison officers - C7 @-@ 0055 / 2009 - .
of course , it cannot be said that we have reached our ultimate goal .
we know that well @-@ managed migration flows will benefit everyone .
if agreed , the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights would be violated .
let it be said clearly : it is important to harmonise national legislation on admission and residence criteria for third @-@ country nationals , to ensure equal treatment and to ensure that they have comparable rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens .
if adopted , this directive will be a very important tool in the fight against social dumping and protection of migrant workers .
with regard to increasing the European Union &apos;s global competitiveness , I believe that part of the funds allocated to cohesion policy should be used to create and maintain Europe &apos;s global leadership in areas where it already has a competitive advantage , and in areas where Europe has the prospect of taking on this role .
on these issues , a number of amendments have been tabled to optimise the impact of cohesion policy and thus increase the Union &apos;s economic competitiveness .
these regions face obstacles and problems reflect the shortcomings of European integration .
moreover , I must highlight precisely the fact that youngsters may not be the most likely threat , even the normal media such as television or radio , but the Internet world .
in my opinion , excluding large investments from stronger supervision is pointless and even wrong .
we live in a two @-@ level Europe , where some people are more equal than others .
( HU ) Mr President , the European Union has always been prepared to criticise countries outside its borders in order to promote fundamental rights .
we are not going to give up the objective of fair and necessary , and supported by the majority of Europeans , simply because some people are afraid and never dare to take a step forward .
I also think that it is very difficult to enforce these bans in the United Kingdom because , in the end , we end up with a situation where a foreign judge has issued a ban on foreign land knows nothing about the terms of the United Kingdom or about our way of life .
in my opinion , the penalties contained in the legislative proposal have taken several steps forward .
it must also be recognised that pregnant women and disabled people and sick people must be taken into account when dealing with this problem .
( da ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , given that several hundred thousand people are sold to Western Europe every year , we are obliged to act .
in the case of human trafficking , the activities of the European Union cannot be limited to condemnation ; it must be recognised that precise measures are taken following the committing of offences , in order to ensure that the perpetrators of such barbaric acts do not get away with punishment .
I believe that the whole of the European Union wants Georgia to join the family of the peoples of Europe .
many of the investments cofinanced by the Structural Funds have proved their worth , not least by highlighting the improvement of infrastructure , which has brought foreign investment to many regions , which contributes to economic development .
I therefore voted in favour of this report .
given the structural changes in international trade , it is important for the European economy to be able to rapidly implement measures to assist workers affected by these changes , while also providing these workers with the skills needed to quickly return to the labour market .
I also agree that :
I am voting in favour of this report because increased unemployment must be tackled urgently , especially in small regions where the economy is fragile .
in addition , clear mechanisms need to be established to coordinate the work of the Commission and the Council on the use and coordination of EU military resources in disaster response .
I also agree with the rapporteur , Iva Zanicchi , that the encouraging results of the preparatory action for 2008 should be further evaluated and that the idea of a voluntary pooling of Member States &apos; resources into the waiting regime should be developed further for EU operations .
although the number of CBRN material cases in the EU has so far been relatively low , due to industrial accidents or the increase in dangerous pathogens and global spread , there is a full possibility of accidents and deliberate incidents linked to CBRN materials .
I voted in favour of the draft directive on a European Protection Order aimed at protecting victims of crime throughout the European Union .
this new directive , which I voted for , replaces the previous framework decision and complies with the new relevant mandate .
trafficking in human beings is also a very lucrative business for organised crime , as profit @-@ making opportunities are high and risks are low .
my colleague Nathalie Griesbeck was the rapporteur for both agreements on the movement of persons between the EU and Georgia .
this support , which is so generous for that and then , comes from the taxpayers &apos; pockets - from mothers and fathers , who decide every month , which is a priority and which must wait .
thank you for your reply .
will the Commission be able to do so in such a way that China loses its subsidies , increase its currency value , or then respect international property rights , which obviously account for around 5 % of Chinese GDP ?
my question is : do you think it is being used to limit the possibility of data transfers ?
we need to find the right balance and therefore , in all our proposals , we must respect these two principles ; they are sometimes difficult to reconcile , but they are nevertheless important .
I must commend the budget rapporteur , Reimer Böge , and Mr Wathelet , for trying to reach an agreement on this matter , with some flexibility .
Sixty @-@ hearty chambers , especially the Greens , must calm down .
it is unacceptable that Parliament &apos;s request to discuss future EU own resources was not accepted .
this will ensure financial certainty for the protected agricultural sector .
however , we also know that this regulation does not solve all the problems in this sector , which , as we have seen , has caused a deepening of the crisis in recent years .
these ratings are far from reality and are obviously preventing countries from coming out of the crisis .
two new structures will be established : the Technology Executive Committee and the Climate Technology Centre and Network .
even China recognised , this time , that state sovereignty has limits and agreed that its emissions should be controlled internationally , because that is our common problem : we are all living on the same planet .
one could ask what the EU intends to do more precisely to try to reach an agreement in Durban .
this disappears from the centre , and perhaps it is good .
these include young people with a migrant background and young people belonging to ethnic minorities , such as the Roma .
in Germany , for example , it is a very fine project that we could also use in other countries ; there are measurements in public places which show how much longer a woman has to work to earn the same average wage as men .
if this is achieved one day and Turkey joins the European Union , is there no danger that Turkey will again ignore many of the things we want and have not achieved so far ?
according to current initiatives , we seem to achieve a 10 @-@ 11 % @-@ 11 % result .
Mr President , Commissioner , energy efficiency is one of the main challenges facing the European Union over the next 10 years .
from this point of view , the action plan proposed by him today is outrageous .
that means 2060 , but at the same time we have set ourselves the targets that we need to achieve by 2050 .
this does not always mean more money ; it also means the intelligent use of existing resources .
the report discusses arguments for greater energy efficiency : social ( the possibility of creating one million jobs or reducing energy poverty in the EU ) , economic ( potential energy savings of up to EUR 100 billion ) , strategic ( preservation of the competitiveness of European businesses through energy saving ) , as well as energy security ( greater EU energy independence ) .
in future , Member States may wish to set national rules .
it is important that there is no legal gap , as Mr Comi also said .
as regards the other specific issues raised in the submitted question , I would like to start by the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental risks , which refers to a study carried out by the Joint Research Centre to analyse methodology used in laboratories to identify heavy metals such as lead traces in toys .
it offers real prospects for economic growth in Europe .
that is simply not enough .
strict austerity packages for Greece and Ireland mean that people are paying for a crisis they did not cause .
Mr Rehn has just mentioned that the Commission proposed the use of the European mechanism , but the Council did not agree to participate .
we want this to be the solution for restoring Europe &apos;s sound budgetary discipline throughout the Union .
we must not forget what happened in 2005 when the Stability and Growth Pact was watered down .
this situation was brought about by grotesque and irresponsible populist policies by the political forces on the right and left .
it should not surprise you that , according to the Eurosceptics , solidarity means losing Ireland &apos;s independence .
secondly , we must continue with the next round of bank resistance tests and do them more comprehensively and comprehensively than last time , using the new European Financial Regulation and Financial supervision architecture , which will apply from January next year .
most importantly , we have been able to remove almost completely the obstacles that have proved to be a success since the beginning and that it was necessary to verify admissibility after 300 000 signatures were collected before citizens could have continued collecting signatures .
Europe will , in any case , benefit greatly from this instrument .
undoubtedly , Parliament has exercised its rights very exemplary and made a great improvement on the original proposal .
this has been described wrongly as an example of direct democracy .
the European Parliament encourages swift and effective implementation .
Parliament &apos;s position on the new draft budget for 2011 amended by the Council (
future of the Africa @-@ EU Strategic Partnership ahead of the 3rd Africa @-@ EU Summit (
Mr President , I consider the citizens &apos; initiative useful because it allows citizens to speak directly to the Commission , but it remains a question of how the Commission reacts to proposals that do not like it .
yesterday , the Italian Parliament started its first day in the wave of legalising Members &apos; corruption .
what MEPs say in this Chamber , in a democratic Chamber , as it says here , when they speak , is their business , not mine .
their role is clarified every day .
this is very important , not only because the use of the initial budget was avoided , but also , in principle , because we can be sure of the planning of expenditure related to cohesion policy , which is very important for the people of the EU and , above all , for the beneficiaries of Union funds .
in writing . - ( PT ) The application submitted by the Netherlands for assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) for 613 redundancies in two companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 46 ( wholesale trade , except motor vehicles and motorcycles ) in the NUTS II region of North Holland fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria .
what happens if a German man wants to divorce a marriage in Germany , but his husband wants to do so in Sicily , because his mother was a circus ?
however , has the domination of three US agencies , which have taken on all the initiative in European markets , government bonds and , consequently , the extent to which European countries can borrow ?
since we are preparing a revision of this directive , a number of instruments have now proved obsolete and should be deleted in the interests of better readability .
I consider it a victory for citizens of Parliament and the EU to have signatures collected from at least one quarter of Member States and not one third , as in the original proposal .
it also aims to create an easily accessible and free internet @-@ based system for collecting signatures .
it must be recognised that , at a time when the public is relatively critical of various European initiatives , the European citizens &apos; initiative has been largely well @-@ viewed since the start and approved .
at the same time , these same people have found for a long time that not only this Parliament , but all the European institutions , are too far removed from them and impassioned about their problems .
I support the renewal of the EURES portal , which aims to make it more accessible to young workers .
2 . stresses that the basic principles of the Joint Africa @-@ EU Strategy should be formulated in such a way as to support the sustainable needs of developing countries in order to combat poverty , ensure a reasonable income and live and ensure basic human rights , including social , economic , environmental rights .
my vote in favour was due to the emphasis on these points , with a clear reference to national minorities , which is another of the fundamental values of the European Union .
in writing . - ( DE ) The new media , particularly social networking sites and blogs , offer new opportunities for communication and advertising .
the 2005 unfair Commercial Practices Directive , which does not provide a corresponding legal framework for combating misleading and aggressive advertising , while the Internet is developing a series of new and more convincing forms of advertising .
it is significantly easier to implement measures of this kind in the case of new buildings than existing buildings under the umbrella of the old buildings under the Muinusususus buildings .
the interest rates that you are now taking from Ireland for loans are 3 % higher than those taken from Latvia , Romania and Hungary , according to today &apos;s newspapers .
in other words , this is the worst version of the recipe that led to the crisis and economic downturn in the EU and dramatically aggravated its social problems .
however , the value of this report lies in the short term .
where are we in this regard ?
I would also like to congratulate the Council on the LGBT instrument adopted in 2009 .
Culosity - why do you always sit alongside the Council representative ?
one final point I would like to make is that , in my opinion , when we review the human rights situation , we need to look for practical and innovative ways of getting our messages right .
bringing our efforts and approaches into line is a key element of the plan .
the US invasion of Afghanistan was not aimed at promoting the interests of the Afghan people , but at promoting the geostrategic interests of the United States in Central Asia , which is , of course , rich in energy , oil and gas .
we have heard fine words about the fight against corruption , but nothing has been done about and about corruption in the presidential face .
( RO ) Mr President , although both women and children are undoubtedly an important issue , the Pino Arlacchi report makes it clear .
I am very pleased that I was able to participate in some debates .
Cold War is now a past and threats to us are increasingly asymmetrical and global .
after some of the Commission and some Member States had called for an election observation mission in Ethiopia and , if the mission leader &apos;s report could not be presented in Addis Ababa , it was completely missed in Brussels .
strengthening the strategic partnership between NATO and the European Union is crucial for neutral countries such as Austria .
that is our position at the moment , of course we are not participating fully in NATO &apos;s activities , for well @-@ understood reasons in this Parliament .
it is important for us to make an equally active effort until the situation has stabilised .
rapporteur . - Mr President , it is only a year since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , which provides for significant changes in delegation of powers from the European Parliament and the Council to the Commission .
I believe that this issue is the most important issue to be voted on after the budget , as it balances the power of the European institutions .
I have made such a alignment - the Integrated Directive - before , and the Commission made exactly the same commitment , while fully respecting it with very small exceptions .
( DE ) Mr President , this type of marking is reasonable , but only on two conditions : firstly , it must be very visible that it is known - finally , we already have such symbols sufficiently .
it would be very important to organise competitions for young people in schools and universities , which would also help to rebuild a common European history and would mean that young people , too , contribute to the sense of European citizenship .
this is a message to the next generation that their active participation is very much to be welcomed .
what a huge lack of consistency !
at the same time , however , we must support producers who are undertaking enforcement , but who cannot afford a high adjustment price by the set deadline .
the vote will take place shortly .
( FI ) Mr President , I would like to say that the lifelong learning programme is one of Europe &apos;s success stories , and Mrs Pack must be thanked for her excellent work .
this diversity , in addition to respect for and preservation of a rich history and heritage , makes Europe a unique place .
the European Union can be proud of its well @-@ developed student exchange system and its open labour markets , which means that every young European has many opportunities for mental and professional development .
the European Union must do everything it takes to ensure that human rights principles and freedoms are applied so that it can take a leading role in this sector .
prevention of the killing of civilians remains , of course , a priority , but we must not prohibit ourselves from using drones which do good work in areas adjacent to the Pakistani border .
two parties are fighting for power and , in serious incidents , the supporters of both sides have lost their lives .
it is very important to remain reasonable in this debate and to find a solution that takes into account both animal welfare and the economic interests at stake .
in Malaysia , caning sentences apply to thousands of people every year .
in many African countries , homosexuality is , unfortunately , indeed forbidden by law .
the brutal and reactionary homophobic campaign waged by some religious bodies and media countries , which includes threats to the killing of homosexuals , means that a great many LGBT people in Uganda are now living in great uncertainty and fear .
when I hear the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) refer to everything that should happen in Egypt , what do we have to do and how can we refuse to accept that people are at risk here simply because we do not want to take responsibility ?
I will read it out : &apos; calls on Member States to address this humanitarian emergency through the voluntary resettlement of all asylum seekers involved in the crisis in the European Union ; calls on the European Commission to coordinate these activities and to use the available funds through the European Refugee Fund . &apos;
I understand their motives , but I will explain to you that this is not a case of human rights at the moment .
this means a complete review of the partnerships and neighbourhood policy that followed us so far , and I urge you to deal with it , Commissioner .
countries like Spain , Portugal and Ireland will soon be able to follow Greece if their economies do not slip away from the euro coffers .
I think there is still a long way to go with labelling .
the single market for construction products requires appropriate support for its size and specifications , including support for the sensitive aspects that I mentioned at the beginning of my speech .
I think we all agree that we need a positive list of substances that can actually contain feed .
they will not lapse .
what is even more alarming is the fact that such a situation could have arisen because of people who have deliberately violated the law , and this was not an honest mistake .
free partnership agreements will benefit our planet , benefit our partner countries , and the EU will benefit from them .
it is obvious , however , that voluntary agreements , rather than no agreements , are already in place , and I therefore support them .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , as shadow rapporteur for the PPE Group , first of all , we welcome the fact that the role of the EU as a trade partner is becoming increasingly important in all regions of the world , including the Pacific region .
for this reason , I would ask the Commission to take into account the huge consequences of this concession , firstly for the European canning industry and , secondly , for the environmental and economic sustainability of Papua New Guinea , and also to take into account the very negative precedent that will be created for future negotiations .
we must remember that the provisions of the Charter are aimed at the institutions and bodies of the European Union if the principle of subsidiarity is properly respected , and only at Member States if they implement Community law .
in these matters , we must not lose sight of the fact that the EU must work with the Hague Conference on private international law in order to ensure the coordination of procedures .
this is doubly more important for international adoption .
finally , I will pass on to Vice @-@ President Reding the comments made here this evening , including the question put by one Member and which is expected to be answered .
this Hungarian scientist set up a centre to develop scientific learning methods for teaching young children who are very young .
the Commission has not yet proposed the harmonisation of maximum quantities of vitamins and minerals which may be used in food additives under the Directive .
I will not repeat everything he said , but I would like to emphasise two points .
agricultural policy must respond to the challenges at European and global level , especially given that the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations states that food production must increase by at least 70 % to meet the growing demands of the population , which is expected to exceed 9 billion , by 2050 .
I would like to stress that it is vital that the Copenhagen criteria are implemented throughout the region , including Serbia , in a proper , rigorous and careful manner , because only these will guarantee respect for European values , the rule of law and viable democracy .
let us not seek incentives - and I stress this once again - to extend Serbia &apos;s journey to the European Union .
Serbia &apos;s future and the Western Balkans lie in the European Union .
it committed itself to a number of undoubtedly difficult reforms .
this applies to our Presidency , but in fact it also applies to the European Parliament , although it is up to you to decide on this .
one of these achievements is the free trade agreement signed with South Korea on 6 October , the most ambitious trade agreement ever concluded by the European Union , which must become a benchmark for our future bilateral trade agreements .
if we finally have a European supervision agreement that has finally achieved the objectives of the European Parliament , this is because the Belgian Presidency said to our colleagues in the Council that this is not working and that the solution must be European , unlike the solution drawn up by Finance Ministers in December 2009 .
to be honest , this debate has been somewhat unusual , but at the same time we can be proud of it , so I am happy to join with the congratulations of my fellow Parliament to the Belgian Presidency .
among other things , because - and I can say this , having spoken on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on transport - you chose not the most simple issues to deal with .
this means that the EU has obviously exceeded its remit , which is why it is ultimately essential to establish a proper procedure for amending the Treaty .
in response to some speeches , it seems to me that we have nevertheless included services of general interest in the European agenda .
( FI ) Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs Stihler for her excellent report .
for this reason , I was also in favour of the report .
if our internal market is now protected , can we say the same about the globalised market we are participating in ?
trade barriers need to be removed for the survival of businesses and thus for jobs to be preserved .
the European Union is a global actor .
the world as a whole knows and recognises the EU &apos;s leading role in humanitarian aid .
the Union &apos;s humanitarian aid is a practical expression of its commitment to support people in third countries , if they are the most vulnerable .
it must be consistent in the sense that it does not allow production surpluses that distort the market and create environmental problems , and it must be social , ensuring that all people with any social background have access to high quality food .
for global food security , agriculture is of huge importance and we must therefore act .
a strong common agricultural policy ( CAP ) is essential and the CAP does indeed follow this line , but needs to be reformed to ensure sustainability and improve food security .
therefore , the least we can and should do is increase the capacity of the fund .
I would like to make sure that I have understood you correctly , and so far the Polish Government has not asked the Commission to investigate the causes of the Smoleński disaster .
what additional measures would the European Union need to introduce in the energy sector , or whether these measures also include the conditions you mentioned in reply to my fellow Member &apos;s question .
this creates the necessary momentum for participation .
this may be the case for patients living in border areas , where healthcare abroad is sometimes closer than the services provided in their own country .
I am grateful to the rapporteur , Mrs Grossetête , and to my colleagues for their cooperation .
that is the state of affairs before , and in the light of this , the fact that we have a decision at all represents huge progress .
to thank you for your attention , I would like to ask for support for the directive , despite the final phase referred to as the protection .
it is clear at this point that the current rules are not sufficient - on the contrary , they are confused and contradictory .
this directive is very important for our people , as the current system is complex and the availability of relevant information has been made more difficult .
in the debate in the Commission on this draft directive on the rights of cross @-@ border patients , some of the participants , like my colleague Peter Liese , had seen it not as a threat but rather an opportunity .
at the end of the procedure , they also questioned the lawfulness of the request made by the government of the upper Bavaria and called for it to be applied in accordance with the safeguard clause procedure under continued reservations .
the prices of medicines and health insurance are rising all over Europe , and everyone is trying to find ways of reducing them .
as you can appreciate , such statistics are devastating .
currently , one in 20 people aged over 65 suffers from dementia and one in five people over 80 .
it should also send out a message for the forthcoming programming period , perhaps universities , which will ultimately also have specific effects .
I would like to ask you whether you intend to create an action plan at European level to increase the participation of SMEs in accessing European funds for developing the tourism industry ?
as set out in the Europe 2020 strategy , Europe , as a knowledge @-@ based society and society for the future , is vital to reform and modernise education systems to the best education systems in the world .
secondly , the progress made on interconnections on both sides can be communicated .
the people of Haiti were the first in the world to free themselves from French colonialism .
how long can this situation last ?
I therefore believe that the EU must do its utmost to support the legitimate and transparent electoral process .
if this is a thorough debate aimed at helping the Campania region and trying to find a solution to the long @-@ term problem , then the resolution we are expected to vote on in February may certainly be a joint resolution .
through dialogue with the relevant population and with the necessary determination , they exceed the obstacles and objections that are often caused by the Nimby syndrome or by the idea that people do not want their sleep in other rubbish .
the debate is closed .
Europe should combat all forms of discrimination , including discrimination on the grounds of sexual preference .
the complete separation of church and state is important , as homophobia is spreading in areas where religion plays an excessive role .
the other two points concern work to be done jointly by the Member States and institutions of the European Union .
I think we are in agreement on this .
you claim to be democrats , but you are making the markets of the working people in Europe , the slaves of the financial markets , the markets that are letting you down .
are we really ready to admit that the euro is on the brink of bankruptcy as a currency ?
I would therefore like to address all those who share the European ideal : let us not divert our attention from some of the differences caused by political orientation .
ladies and gentlemen , supporters of the European project are very much dominated by Parliament .
however , I think that is what European citizens expect of us .
the aim is to develop a more coherent understanding of the European added value of this region .
my first demonstration was in 1956 , when I had expressed my protest against the invasion of Budapest by the Soviet troops , keeping my feet closed .
my country , Hungary , and the Hungarian Presidency , must show that it is wrong that the Emperor is on the ball .
they are in honour , lecturing the President &apos;s desk .
you make it clear that your law is similar to that of other Member States , but even if there is still much to be done in some countries - I am thinking in particular of my own country - in which other EU Member States , the media are threatened with fines of EUR 700 000 for violating ethical norms ?
I am sure that the European Parliament will support this work and play its part in the spirit of constructive cooperation .
( FR ) Do you be back there ?
now , at the beginning of 2011 , this task is almost accomplished .
the Hungarian Presidency of the EU Council has set itself a general target for promoting the institutional , economic , social and political aspects of the EU .
I am pleased that it bans something that may be misused , and that is medical tourism .
this could last for such a long time .
in order to ensure the functioning of any European strategy in this area , it is imperative - I will finish now - that countries give priority to drawing up national action plans .
it must be said that there are still too many unresolved issues in the area of cross @-@ border healthcare services , access to healthcare , reimbursement and clinical follow @-@ up to the current directive should enable all patients - not only the best informed or the richest - to enjoy certain rights that have already been recognised by the Court of Justice in the field of health services .
furthermore , I agree with Parliament &apos;s position that , in order to prevent discrimination against people on lower incomes , the Member State of origin must pay the treatment directly to another Member State without the patient first having to pay for treatment , or at least the costs paid by the patient should be reimbursed immediately .
for three years now , the European Parliament has been fighting to ensure legal certainty for cross @-@ border healthcare and to clarify the conditions for reimbursement .
the market value of timber products is also significant .
according to environmental organisations , the Government of Cameroon is aware of environmental crimes committed in the field of forestry , but corruption prevents companies from being supervised and brought to justice .
in order to ensure a reduction in corruption , it is necessary to support measures to ensure the independence of the national justice system and the development of new judicial procedures .
I am in favour of developing this area , but it is unacceptable for me to allow an exemption from the rules of origin applicable to processed fishery products .
in writing . - The Verts / ALE Group abstained .
as the country can become an important factor in ensuring security and stability in the region , Serbia &apos;s future is closely linked to that of the European Union , so it must make every effort to become a full member of the EU .
the EU &apos;s international credibility is closely linked to its ability to do something in neighbouring countries .
Alzheimer &apos;s disease and other dementias are diseases that have rightly called for attention and cause concern .
it is therefore essential to step up the external intervention of pharmacology by promoting ways of intervention that improve the well @-@ being of people suffering from the disease .
that is my final vote in favour .
I therefore agree with the call for the EU and its Member States to make reconstruction and reconstruction of Haiti one of their most important priorities and that the time has come to help Haiti become a economically and politically strong and independent state .
we all have to admit , regardless of our views on particular religion , that people have the right to practise their faith in peace .
has the European Parliament , my group and I not already asked a number of questions about the consistent suppression of Christians in Islamic countries ?
in any case , I would have done the same for any other religion .
the European Union must develop instruments that actually protect the right to comply with any religion .
we must also be careful not to encroach on all Muslims on terrorism , because those who advocate violence and extremism are in the minority .
I think it is important that we should see our delegations around the world as sources of discrimination that MEPs believe to be a beautiful superficial shell - if you will allow me to put it that way - and inform us of this discrimination when it is seen .
in order to tackle security threats together , we should base existing national strategies and support regional initiatives and encourage regional resources .
so , calmly and knowing the facts , we can claim that the democratic opposition in Belarus can claim to be a moral victory in these elections .
our only partner should be civil society .
the reaction to their actions was unjustified .
he has managed to lecture some politicians here , such as Mr Ruberia , whose greatest concern in this situation seems to be whether the opposition receives assistance from abroad .
by the way , this is shamefully the case with Saudi Arabia .
I would like to stress the need to cooperate with Libya in managing migration flows , which includes - as is the case with all readmission agreements concluded by the Union - the readmission agreement for illegal immigrants , including third @-@ country nationals .
because these harmonised procedures will help authorities to identify false claims more easily from the start and provide clearer guidance for the reasons of decisions .
others provided information in part , mainly on the costs of legal assistance and translation .
these differences show that the directive needs to be revised .
however , that is what we must do .
first of all , and I think this is essential , I want Parliament to be kept regularly informed of all initiatives in this area .
in my opinion , it is advisable to include a chapter on this subject which focuses on small businesses and puts an emphasis on fair competition .
I am convinced that this draft policy paper will provide better guidance for a comprehensive and successful EU Arctic policy which will also benefit our northern neighbours .
we , the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , demand that the Arctic does not end up becoming the next geopolitical crisis .
I would also like to say to Mr Søndergaard that I listened very carefully to his words about the majority of Iceland .
however , when it comes to the High North , it is important that we are seen as diplomatic , not as candidates , as cooperatives , and not as intrusions , and as investigators rather than as exploits .
once again , the report is welcome , and we will certainly be following this recommendation .
this region brings together EU Member States and countries that are important for regional cooperation .
as Mr Brok stressed in his excellent comment , I also believe that the report we are going to vote on today is a very good example of cross @-@ group cooperation in the European Parliament , and I would like to express particular thanks to Mr Paşcu , who has shown himself to be a very active and fair supporter of the report .
5 .
it is important to remember the roots of the Jewish @-@ Christian values .
it is appalling that in this area , where merely technical matters are concerned , we have never managed to reach an agreement .
at the same time , however , it considers a series of violations of human rights and democracy by a regime called &apos; authoritarian &apos; .
religious intolerance is becoming an increasingly frequent phenomenon in various parts of the world , and the terrible attacks on Christians perpetrated in Egypt and Iraq over the last few weeks are the latest example of the dangerous problem posed by fundamentalist terrorism .
I also believe that the proposal not to organise the 2014 ice World Cup in Minsk would be one of the most effective tools for putting pressure on the Belarusian authorities to abandon repressive policies .
I am voting in favour of this report , given that three countries currently belong to the Arctic Council of the EU Member States , with accession negotiations with Iceland .
the Arctic provides Europe with significant supplies of energy , raw materials and also fish .
achieving peace and stability in the region is , in my opinion , one of the priorities , and ensuring energy security through the Nabucco project is no less important .
I would like the European Union to assess the consequences of applying such inhumane laws for relations with Pakistan .
today , the European Parliament is asking for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be regarded not merely as paperwork and for citizens to be treated not only as consumers of the common market , but as inalienable and unquestionable holders of fundamental rights .
( the President asked the speaker to continue )
Mr President , may I ask you , in your speech , to force our Italian colleagues to remain silent , because it really disturbs them when they start talking to the Chamber about matters that are important for themselves .
his only crime is that he acted in his profession , which was to protect people who cannot protect them from the brutal regime in Iran itself .
the European Union considers that the death penalty can never be regarded as a fair punishment .
it is not acceptable that in the 21st century , Roma still face discrimination because of their ethnic origin .
freedom , equality and solidarity are not the prerogative of some , but the right of all , as human rights and civil rights are indivisible .
I believe that the European Council will deal with very complex issues , which can be formulated on specific issues and which will also determine the work of the Council in the coming months , and President Van Rompuy will inform you of this after the meeting .
( applause )
this is a significant victory , and the renewables sector is going on .
yes , Mr Saryusz @-@ Wolski , among them , the EU &apos;s dependency on energy imports .
energy is part of the emission allowance trading system and the main driver of development must now be the carbon price .
Mr President , in the medium term , it is important that the European Union reflects in depth the strategic approach of reforming our neighbourhood policy , as we asked Mr Füle yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
the EU &apos;s diplomatic efforts in Tunisia and Egypt should be directed entirely towards ensuring stability and order and against those who want to sow violence and fear , as we see now .
( DE ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , I would like to reiterate the call for you to give us a list of people who have received EU money in these countries .
( el ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , obviously the overwhelming majority of Members support the Egyptian uprising , which is quite correct , although there are also some exceptions , as we have just heard .
its impact cannot be underestimated .
however , when we remember the 1989 Revolution , we must remember that we were faced with the same dilemma .
nothing will guarantee that the uprising in Tunisia , Egypt and other countries will not be an excuse for taking up the power of Islamic extremists , as has happened in Iran .
we must not allow a strategy of fear to be developed to send them home .
in Egyptian society , however , cruel behaviour , cruel practices and oppressive policies are very much possible .
however , as in the case of a small child , it is also necessary to support this young country until it is able to act independently .
I would also like us to review our policy , which has so far not recognised the efforts made by the people of the Republic of Somaliland , who have built a free and democratic Muslim state in the region , a country that we treat as if it were not .
Minister , this is very important .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , now everyone must work smoothly , because frankly , I have noticed that markets are developing very quickly , much faster than we have in this era of democracy , and they must act very quickly .
to what extent has the Commission intensified its activities in this area ?
tuberculosis is currently a completely treatable disease .
together we must defend our rights , freedoms and democracy .
the recommendation for second reading by Mr Mitchell , on behalf of the Committee on Development , on the financing instrument for development cooperation ( amendment of Regulation ( EC ) No 1905 / 2006 ) &#91; 16442 / 1 / 2010 - C7 @-@ 0426 / 2010 - ;
the accompanying measures are aimed at supporting 10 ACP banana @-@ exporting countries so that they can adapt to the declining flexibilities resulting from the Geneva Agreement .
we therefore need to remove the ball from our own eyes , and only then can we see the ground in our brother &apos;s eyes , and this will ultimately give us real , strong control over these funds .
we are not asking for less and no more .
at that time , Italy was condemned , but no proper plan has been put forward .
these are around four @-@ way in my home city and they are only open in certain times .
I would like to thank Karl @-@ Heinz Florenz for his excellent and skilful work .
I welcome the proposal , which includes stricter provisions , which seeks to prevent illegal shipments of waste in question and to eliminate loopholes in legislation .
the majority of the committee is now recommending that all candidates be approved , and I personally agree with that .
I would also like to say something else that has not come up in any debate .
( es ) Mr President , in my opinion , the situation in Tunisia has hit the European Union unexpectedly .
I do not think that a simple complaint accusing the public of making alleged slander statements is sufficient reason to request waiver of parliamentary immunity .
the need to reduce tariffs on imported products from the European Union stems from the World Trade Organisation classification .
if we cannot guarantee human rights and democracy , we risk losing much more .
in writing . - ( PT ) I think it is very important that Europe creates strong relations with certain regional and global actors , supporting them and establishing close political and economic ties with them .
under the agreement , the EU will gradually reduce its import tariffs for Latin American bananas from EUR 176 to EUR 114 per tonne by 2017 .
I welcome this report because it takes into account the current need to include and increase the functionality and effectiveness of waste disposal from electrical and electronic equipment .
these products reach the markets of the Member States and should be subject to the laws in force in the markets concerned .
it is therefore necessary to agree with the rapporteur that the Member States are responsible for introducing an effective control procedure for the proper implementation of the directive and for the storage and processing of waste .
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Tunisia because I agree that we must express our solidarity with the Tunisian people and support them and their call for progress in democracy and social matters .
excise duties are the cheapest and most effective means of health to protect Europeans from infectious diseases , and it is also important for healthcare to reach developing countries and help to increase life expectancy and combat poverty .
on the other hand , alcohol , drug addiction and high poverty are some of the main risk factors that increase mortality .
there is confusion about who is responsible for what .
both the Commission and the Council are responsible for this situation and it is important that we learn lessons for the next round of appointments .
this is why the waste management plan , under which Directive 2008 / 98 / EC , is most important to comply with the waste hierarchy , must be implemented quickly .
we admire their courage , determination and aspirations for democracy .
this is about the procedure relating to the European Arrest Warrant and whether it has been misused for political purposes .
they must have easy access , both physically and electronically - as has already been said - and they must be effective and interoperable .
now that the full implementation of the directive in all countries is still pending , we already know that these expectations have , at least partially , failed .
perhaps this will lead to some of the expected results in the future .
we are very proud of this because we have been able to deal with it at a very difficult time for Greece , namely in a period of crisis , and the fact that we were able to do so is very important , because first of all , the Services Directive , in particular through the points of single contact , will support small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , and the European economy needs it most of all .
since 2000 , the European Parliament has been asking for progress in its resolutions on the European patent in the light of the Lisbon and the new 2020 action plan .
many Member States have therefore asked for enhanced cooperation in this area .
the procedure is full of uncertainty , which is of concern to big Digital Europe &apos;s technology companies , such as Blackberry , IBM , Nokia , Srebrenica and Siemens , whose statement will hopefully reach everyone , despite the regrettable efforts of one of the heads of unit of the European Commission .
these two languages would have no legal force , but they would have a great informative and utility value .
the project has been on the agenda for more than 10 years , and in a regrettable way , it has been blocked by cooperation groups between national governments .
many of us remember how alarmed the public was at the time , and how long radioactive contamination was in certain places such as Lake District in England , where soil conditions and strong reservoirs led to decades of contamination on the ground .
once again , we are not blaming you , far from it , but we believe that an excellent opportunity has been missed .
will we not create more bureaucracy and complicated procedures in this way ?
I can only speak for my own country , but given the support that the SME sector has received from Irish taxpayers , this sector is a driving force for economic growth .
thank you .
we believe that there are three basic preconditions for effective implementation of the strategy : a list of priorities and common projects , coordination at Commission level and appropriate funding , so that we can achieve the common objective .
if we look at the Danube and its tributaries as one of the great ecosystems , we can see that this strategy for the Danube region offers a great opportunity , although , on the other , the structure of the strategy requires a very good vision of the future .
current regional differences can only be reduced by applying a well thought @-@ out and transparent strategy whereby unspent funds are allocated effectively , supporting local businesses and investments without intermediaries .
( SK ) Mr President , I would like to talk about the collection and storage of cord blood , which is an important source of stem cells .
one or two has been done , but much remains to be done .
this was possible in this case , because we reached a compromise between the proposals of the European Commission , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on the most controversial issue .
in this case , I absolutely disagree with what the previous speaker , Mr Schlyter , said .
Mr President , does the honourable gentleman really think it is right to vote in favour of legislation that actually increases the price of vehicles ?
the original short @-@ term objective of setting a limit of 175 grams with a view to achieving the target of 147 grams by 2020 will significantly increase production costs for light commercial vehicles , making them more expensive for many small businesses using them as day @-@ to @-@ day work .
in this context , we need to reconcile ambition and realism and prudence .
railway companies pay rail access charges for every kilometre they have travelled , the same system does not apply to buses and this is beneficial to coach companies .
equal treatment and assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility , as well as the right of passengers to information before and after their trip , are considered fundamental rights in the regulation applicable regardless of the length of their journey .
the modernisation agreement between the EU and Russia will prove successful only if it is based on the modernisation agreement between Russian leaders and residents .
perhaps you know that , since last year , one European Council meeting will be devoted to discussing issues related to strategic partners .
that concludes the vote .
Mr President , I fully support passenger rights and , above all , the rights of disabled people .
( it ) Mr President , we are operating in a market in which our businesses operate according to global competition .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this document as it contains important changes .
the agreement , which entered into force in 1994 , allows Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway to participate in the EU &apos;s Single Market without EU Member States .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this report because the EU has exclusive competence in various aspects of external aviation , which have traditionally been regulated by bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries .
three associated countries - Norway , Iceland and Switzerland - have also joined the Schengen area , and Liechtenstein should become the fourth .
in a context where negotiations with Liechtenstein have been concluded successfully and the legal basis has been amended , consent should be given to the conclusion of the protocol .
in voting against the report on the agreement between the European Union and the Federal Republic of Brazil on short @-@ stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports , I wanted to express a position that goes beyond this issue .
the sentence that Cesare Battisti should serve in Italy was handed down by a normal judge who applied ordinary legislation to a common crime , mass murder .
the established system has significantly reduced administrative barriers .
1. additional costs for guaranteeing rights will result in a steady rise in ticket prices for all passengers ;
the agreement on the rights of bus and coach passengers , which was reached between the European Parliament and the Council in the Conciliation Committee , amended the scope of the regulation , which was put in place at second reading , limiting it to passengers who use the so @-@ called distance travel service ; the latter was defined as passenger movements of at least 250 km .
the text of the regulation provides for , among other things , multiple types of compensation : snacks and refreshments when departure is delayed for more than 90 minutes ; the cost of one night accommodation in the event of a journey , accident or delay , which necessitates the need for overnight stays ; and compensation in the event of loss or damage to luggage entrusted to maintenance companies at least EUR 1 200 .
I am also in favour of the proposal that this issue should be addressed in a number of stages in 2011 and not only in 2014 , as proposed by the Commission .
according to the compromise , the short @-@ term objective of reducing emissions is 175 grams per kilometre to be achieved by 2014 .
the 2020 target remained at 147g / km and the fines for non @-@ compliance were reduced from EUR 120 to EUR 95 per gram .
I therefore voted against the recommendation because I consider it unacceptable to have enhanced cooperation in such a sensitive area as political equality of languages , as this would discriminate against the right to equal access to fundamental freedoms in the EU .
although the aim of creating an EU patent is positive in terms of helping to revitalise and encourage innovation in Europe , I would argue , however , that this cannot be achieved through violations of fundamental principles of European citizenship , damage to Community cohesion or fragmentation of the internal market , as well as the introduction of new discrimination , inequalities or imbalances .
China intended to become an innovation @-@ orientated country , launched in 2006 , and managed to increase the number of patents compared with the US , the EU and Japan by 14.1 % , 33.55 % and 15.9 % respectively .
it is unthinkable to delegate powers in this way to the irresponsible Commission , particularly as regards public health .
let us be very clear : all Member States must pursue responsible financial policies .
this is a perfectly clear position and I would like to share this objective with you .
the European Union will be reformed politically for the future .
until recently 90 % of migrants and asylum seekers arrived in Europe via Greece .
we must allow Tunisia to achieve rapid and positive economic development by offering trade with the European Union and supporting projects in this area .
some Member States - Italy , Greece , Malta , etc . - quite rightly have to deal with these issues and have a duty to show solidarity , while most Member States are watched idly and restricted to others .
today Italy needs concrete help ; tomorrow it may need another country .
therefore , the current public health crisis is taking shape .
women are therefore more likely to accept precarious or part @-@ time jobs than men in order to meet their family responsibilities , resulting in an average pay gap of 18 % in the European Union .
Mr President , you know , I do not want there to be a misunderstanding here .
the report recognises that , at a time when European Union citizens are particularly vulnerable , it is important for Member States to ensure that social protection instruments and , in particular , pensions are greater and more reliable , and thus to give an increasingly ageing population peace of mind and ensure that people remain economically independent .
why is the current conservative government in Hungary also demolishing the inefficient second pillar of the pension system ?
the falsification of medicines Harms both patients and pharmaceutical companies in Member States .
according to the World Health Organisation expert Group , there are regions in many African countries and in Asia and Latin America where more than 30 % of the medicines sold can be counterfeit .
we cannot allow counterfeiters to benefit from a legal vacuum while putting patients &apos; health at risk .
investigations have been carried out either consistently or when information on the potential misuse of funds has been obtained .
today , it is still a Staff Working document , but in two months &apos; time it will be discussed by business leaders and then a public debate will start .
we ask Commissioner Füle and the Executive Director , Lajčák , to do all we can to ensure that international aid and international supervision of these elections are free and fair , or that we at least be able to assess how free and fair they are .
Commissioner , I am the first to admit that it is easier to say this than to do , but nevertheless it is a request for assistance .
we must turn to the Constitutional Court or the electoral Commission .
we also need your support for the leaders of the main opposition party and the Albanian Prime Minister to understand our message .
the problems of internal policy lie with the Bulgarian authorities , which have to identify problems and solve them themselves .
according to the higher Court of Cassation , 15 946 eavesdropping orders were issued in 2010 and only 1918 or 12 % were used in court .
we promised it in the climate negotiations and we should keep our promise .
finally , we have a number of statements , particularly that the World Bank should be given priority over access to small @-@ scale local energy production .
we have EUR 200 million for the energy sector .
bold steps have already been taken to combat corruption , but there is still a need for the last few steps .
however , on the basis of our experience with other countries , I would say that Croatia must also work , in its own interests , to reform its judicial and administrative system , regardless of the accession process .
what is actually possible , however , depends on the Croatian Government and cooperation between the government , that is , the government coalition , and the opposition in the Croatian parliament .
Croatia is one step away from achieving its historic objective .
the Council should adopt policies and recommendations before the summer .
for economic governance and fiscal consolidation , you set a tight period : 1 January 2011 to 1 January 2012 .
( el ) Mr President , poverty , climate change , low birth , immigration , energy and , most importantly , unemployment in the European Union are our main problems at the moment .
( DE ) If you look at the measures adopted here in recent months and calculate the costs involved , then - not always , but very often - they interfere with economic development .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I agree that Parliament must be given sufficient time to propose the best guidelines for employment policies by 2020 .
as regards institutional issues relating to the employment guidelines - which , I believe , will remain at the heart of our attention , and which we will also be essentially guided by - Article 148 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that the European Parliament has a clear role to play .
given that the main concerns of European citizens still relate to the persistence of jobs , I believe that the Europe 2020 strategy will only be successful if social Europe becomes a reality .
it is therefore necessary to adopt a new European strategy to combat the unbridled spread of falsified medicines in order to take action against this public health phenomenon and to ensure the safety of all patients .
we face major demographic challenges .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I congratulate the good progress made in the area of public administration , the economy and the judiciary , and I am also pleased that Croatia is actively cooperating in prosecuting war criminals .
I also fully agree with the proposal to include the sale of medicines on the Internet within the scope of the directive .
the second gives the European Food Safety Authority the power to accept or reject health claims on food additives , including plants , but the European Food Safety Authority rarely gives its approval and refuses for such arbitrary reasons that it has even irritated the Commission .
however , I do not believe that the measures proposed in the report are sufficient .
it should be borne in mind that , in the current situation , it is more important than ever to provide SMEs with strong institutional and financial support , because they are the backbone of the European economy and only able to develop with adequate and sustainable funding .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this document because 23 million small and medium @-@ sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , which account for around 99 % of all businesses in the EU and employ over 100 million people , play a vital role in stimulating economic growth , social cohesion and creating jobs , are one of the main sources of innovation and play a vital role in maintaining and increasing employment .
in writing . - ( PT ) The future of pensions for European citizens is one of the greatest challenges facing Europe , and I recognise that there are problems with Member States &apos; pension systems .
if we want future European citizens to be motivated and able to work across borders , it is already important to guarantee them the prospect of adequate and sustainable retirement pensions that are harmonised at European level .
in writing . - ( DE ) Yesterday , the EU &apos;s population pyramid will soon turn , meaning that over 55 years of age will be the largest social group , life expectancy will continue to rise , birth rates will remain low and young people will start working longer and later .
the Greek Communist Party voted against the EU &apos;s anti @-@ labour Green Paper on European pension systems .
I find it regrettable that , in its motion for a resolution , the rapporteur has decided to give an opinion on issues such as sexual orientation and constitutional protection , which in no way relate to the actual problems that we are talking about , but should fall within the competence of the Member States alone .
we want to contribute to more effective regulation of our G20 partners and also wider regulation of derivative markets for the benefit of both producers and users .
so far , only USD 925 million has been paid .
it is up to the Commission and Parliament to translate it .
Commissioner , this situation , this crisis , gives you exceptionally strong arguments .
however , it may be necessary to decide what role such reserves could play and how they could influence the proper functioning of markets .
Michel Barnier , Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services , proposed new measures to limit speculation on the commodities market .
I mentioned at the beginning that the High Representative and Vice @-@ President will travel to the region just now .
its conditions are very unambiguous : all countries that sign an association agreement with the European Union must respect international law and international human rights .
yesterday it was broadcast in Diyarbakir in Turkey and in Teheran and other cities in Iran .
Geography and history make Europe the natural ally of these Mediterranean countries .
the group of lawyers has taken note of the situation and has ten days to submit amendments .
all this is also when Hungary holds the Presidency of the Council .
there is still no protection for the Alliance .
the Commission has done its work very well in the past as guardian of this legislation .
although these many benefits are immediate and glaring , I welcome the fact that the free trade agreement has an effective bilateral safeguard mechanism allowing the EU to restore the tariffs of the auction regime in the event that this particular free trade agreement has caused or may cause serious damage to the EU &apos;s internal industry .
and thank you also for your words .
that is also a good thing .
I have a Norway on this subject , as I am personally involved in agriculture .
subject : water and drinking water management initiatives
however , the Bureau cannot decide on the time of debates , the content of the debates or the speaking time , which is decided by the Conference of Presidents , which , strangely enough , always tries to put too many items on the agenda .
however , only five years ago , no one would have thought that it could be possible to implement it in the near future .
it is time to make clear decisions on capital supervision and taxation .
tomorrow &apos;s vote - and I am finishing with this - is therefore in favour of the report and of the principle that financial services should pay for themselves .
the second is that we still have the Millennium Development Goals - poverty , water , forests , infrastructure , education and health - and they require USD 300 billion by 2015 .
at a time when supposedly wonderful cost @-@ cutting measures require more revenue paradoxically , I think it is more than necessary to introduce a tax .
we managed to send out a strong message , particularly by adopting the most questionable amendment aimed at introducing a tax in Europe and not in the world .
in order to maintain the balance and ensure that these benefits are distributed fairly , initiatives such as those mentioned in the report should be supported .
that is what we want .
( es ) Mr President , Commissioner , it is very good news that the Commission has requested powers to initiate negotiations for the renewal of the protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Mauritania , which will replace the current protocol of 31 July 2012 .
the killing of columns is also a lucrative business for the mafia .
we cannot communicate with a regime that takes political prisoners , civil society has no freedom of expression and does not have free media .
as consumers , we regularly read in newspapers and hear from other media that consumer organisations have made attempts and always made non @-@ compliant products .
two months later , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) declared a flu pandemic .
the fact that there is systematic cross @-@ compliance between health and social classes shows that these differences are due to inadequate conditions that do not allow basic social services to be accessible .
firstly , the so @-@ called &apos; Economic Partnership Agreements &apos; that we have imposed on developing countries , despite their opposition , and which are significantly restricting their national tax systems and causing other serious losses .
one of the most important contributions that the EU can make in this regard is to open up its markets , for example , to oil , to help the people of these countries really see themselves and to help their country to have a better future .
therefore , under no circumstances justifies softening the principle of zero tolerance to the presence of genetically modified organisms or ...
any food dependency puts the EU in a very vulnerable position .
we have quite qualified people in the various Directorates @-@ General , and I am sure we will be able to pool their skills in an effective way .
they must also find better ways of reconciling work and private life and remove barriers which make it disadvantageous for households to take part in the employment of other workers , which is mainly women .
I would like to thank the rapporteur because this is indeed a good and thorough report .
and those countries where the quota is used , where it began to be used a few decades ago , I am thinking of the northern countries here , have shown that we are achieving this objective through this instrument and , today , the behaviour of society has been rethought - quotas are no longer needed as before .
I have said nothing about the situation before 2011 ; it will not be bad if we are still realistic , but it will deteriorate if we adopt an utopian and unrealistic approach .
it is obvious that a day like today , when we are reminded of the unequal situation of women , is more than necessary .
there are several aspects to this issue .
equality is also not a separate value .
however , this Holy reminds us first of all that we should not forget the most important issue in today &apos;s Europe , namely equality between women and men , on the other 364 days of the year .
the final report also uses the word &apos; retfærdig &apos; , meaning &apos; fair &apos; .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the current economic and financial crisis has shown that there are serious shortcomings in the regulatory and supervisory framework of the global financial system .
if this is indeed the case , I foresee major problems in many agricultural sectors , particularly in the livestock sector .
women are prevented from doing their jobs by not having adequate leave systems and flexible working arrangements for their dependents , such as children , disabled people and older people .
the German Prosecutor has requested the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of MEP Elmar Brok .
I would like to highlight the emphasis that the report places on standardisation as a means of regulating smart regulation , which is essentially an example of regulation that is not top @-@ down but comes from the bottom , from the parties involved .
finally , more transparency in the sense that the document calls for an assessment of the effectiveness of vaccination strategies .
better coordination of the activities of the responsible authorities of the Member States and the European agencies is also important .
in writing . - The European Parliament has today taken the spotlight on the outbreak of disproportionate response in Europe .
it provides that the provisions of this regulation can be amended under the comitology procedure , while the Commission is assisted by a management committee composed of representatives of the Commission and representatives of the Member States .
it has often been stated here in the European Parliament that the economic crisis has highlighted the lack of regulation and supervision of the global financial system .
however , the European Commission is stubbornly refusing to make these proposals .
a global agreement would be the best way to introduce such a tax , but the UK &apos;s stamp on shares shows that it is possible to introduce a functioning , well @-@ designed financial transaction tax without diminishing competitiveness .
the challenges facing the European Union , arising from demographic changes , require a firm plan to combat health inequalities in rural areas .
the report also states that Member States should put an end to cuts in the budget for health services .
the increase in unemployment and austerity measures can aggravate the health inequalities that already exist in the EU .
it is also important to emphasise that the communication on corporate social responsibility considers the possibility of developing a system that makes it mandatory to publish management information in annual reports .
the report also briefly tackles the problem of &apos; predatory loan funds &apos; , which , in my opinion , should be completely prohibited .
the future of the CAP and the EU &apos;s external trade policy are closely linked .
it is therefore our duty to ensure fair competition between the European Union and its partners in trade relations .
the problem is exacerbated by the fact that price volatility on the international market has increased significantly .
one significant consequence of the crisis is the employment of women : the crisis began to affect women later than men , as women are in areas that were more resistant to the effects of the crisis ( health care , education , etc . ) .
the above figures show that it is time to introduce binding measures .
furthermore , the report calls on the Commission , the Council and the Member States to prioritise binding measures instead of non @-@ binding strategies in the field of gender equality and to pay particular attention to vulnerable women : disabled women , older women , immigrants , lesbians , bisexuals and transgender , women belonging to ethnic minorities , women with low or non @-@ existent education , and single mothers .
in writing . - ( IT ) The recent economic and financial crisis has had many negative consequences that have affected the standard of living and working life of citizens , particularly women .
traditionally , more women are at risk of poverty , especially single mothers and over 65 @-@ year @-@ olds .
this is really the way to question whether there are signs of recovery in the economy .
they are both strategies that form part of them .
in your contacts with you , Mr Barroso , the European Council is now taking the power to decide and to verify , in essence , nothing .
it is likely that Merkel and Sarkozy will manage to push their proposals through , despite opposition from other euro area countries .
let me also remind you that the Council strongly condemns the acts of terrorism perpetrated on Turkish territory .
in conclusion , there are only two other problematic areas .
in his recent appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Commissioner Füle called for a new realistic attitude , avoiding a strictly short @-@ term approach .
Turkey &apos;s economic development has indeed been significant in recent years and its industry is becoming an important partner for European businesses in many areas .
it refuses to normalise relations with one EU Member State , the Republic of Cyprus ; it continues to express the threat of war against another Member State , Greece , and refuses to recognise and apply the Convention on the Law of the Sea .
I also agree with those who say explicitly that progress on the Additional Protocol , the Ankara Agreement and progress in the thorough negotiations on Cyprus to reach a solution would put the accession process in place .
however small the country is , it is doing a great deal of work .
the seven priority areas of the European Commission are clear , and I recommend that Prime Minister Igor Lukšić &apos;s government address them with determination , which will result in the opening of negotiations on full membership of Montenegro .
let me give a brief overview of the most important principles and recommendations contained in the report .
rather , their conditions were those that prevented them from learning .
we do not give these people any service .
in my opinion , education is the most powerful instrument for improving the situation of this community than any other measure intended for social integration .
perhaps they have reached the point where aid is all they expect from the state .
the Recommendation asks Member States in particular to &apos; recognise the fundamental right of individuals to live with dignity and social assistance , which is also part of the overall and persistent need to combat social exclusion &apos; .
now is the time to provide businesses with a single set of rules to make economic activities easier and cheaper in the Single Market .
who took this decision , Mr President ?
we cannot expect the current difficulties - the current crisis in the Mediterranean - to be overcome without strong measures to promote industrial and business policies , because these policies are the only ones that enable us to develop and create new jobs .
I think this is a significant step forward , and I would like to thank Vice @-@ President Tajani for making this clear .
one final point : for me , there is a missing element - the digital agenda .
industrial policy cannot function without an integrated market .
in addition to safeguarding the resources already available , we must also be able to implement our recycling targets .
if our industries play their part in Europe , they must see the same rules applied as they play outside the European Union .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Mr President , honourable Members , as you know , at the beginning of February , the Commission approved an EU raw materials strategy based on three pillars .
the extraction of rare earth elements has caused serious environmental damage in China , as has happened in the past in the United States and elsewhere .
the first agreement with the African Union required months of work and saved under the EU @-@ EU Action Plan the agreement providing for the direct involvement of Africa in the joint work with the European Union and the Commission .
secondly , at a time when we are trying to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions , this would be totally contrary to EU policy if the consequences of using these deposits were not assessed before any in @-@ depth research were carried out solely in terms of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions .
if used for their own use , this theft will help to reduce the EU &apos;s dependency on Russian gas pipelines .
I do not think that more important events are taking place elsewhere .
I am glad that an agreement was reached in New York on a European request for referral to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court .
for years , the European Union , the Member States and Silvio Berlusconi have been negotiating , for example , the return of refugees to Libya .
it is imperative that the conflict stops immediately , but Gaddafi must not remain .
( es ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , I believe that , as a result of this debate , it is clear that the whole of the European Parliament is aware that this crisis of change in North Africa is no longer a test of European foreign policy , but has now become a test of the viability of European foreign policy .
moreover , humanitarian aid , which means food , medical needs , cloak , must be offered to the people forced to flee from the war zone ,
Vice @-@ President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Mr President , honourable Members , thank you very much for a very important debate , and I think also for a very significant debate in this Parliament .
we will also present these positions to the institutions that will be ready for Friday , and we will also bring them to the Foreign Affairs Committee , which will meet tomorrow .
the Commission should also present such questions in order to incorporate them into Community law .
it seems that no one of you understands the concept of international money .
only by making their policies more similar to German policy would these countries be able to stimulate their economies .
( PL ) Mr President , only a year ago , no one considered the possibility of amending the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon , given how difficult it was to ratify it .
for this reason , I have no doubt that we have been able to be sufficiently proactive and wise to give new impetus to overcoming this crisis and development .
however , recent crises have also shown what can happen if people &apos;s destinies are treated only from the level of money or technocracy and other basic objectives and principles are forgotten .
I would suggest that I see a happy record here .
however , it would probably have been possible to do more for mutual rights and obligations to be recognised , since it is vital to bear in mind the shared responsibility of Roma communities for their effective inclusion .
( SK ) Mr President , as part of economic policy , industrial policy objectives must be sustainable growth , higher employment and decent quality of life for all Europeans .
the democratic MEPs voted against this decision .
in such a situation , it is more than justified that the European Parliament should set an example with its budget for 2012 .
as the resolution does not concern this area almost at all , I abstained from voting .
we believe that it is important to continue membership negotiations with Turkey and put pressure on it to meet the Copenhagen criteria , which will force Turkey to meet the human rights requirements and to adopt a more progressive approach to minorities such as Kurds , Armenians , Syrians and Syrians who , in our view , might perhaps be the ones who would most benefit from Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU - a truly democratic and ready to recognise diversity .
the Union has become an aggressive and pretending liberal doctrine .
in order to respect the principle of subsidiarity , the EU must take the lead and join the various actors at all levels in order to increase the effectiveness of the use of EU funds and finally make Roma fully European citizens .
the development of European industry cannot be achieved without progressive financing , particularly in the areas of research , energy and telecommunications and transport networks ( tens ) , and thus in the field of public services that support the business environment .
in writing . - ( LT ) I agree with this report because EU industry accounts for about a third of the total value added of the EU , industrial production for almost three quarters of European exports and a third of employment , providing a living for some 57 million people .
in recent years , we have witnessed the adoption of measures that cause major burdens on European industry and encourage unfair competition from imports from third countries .
when the Iranian people wanted to demonstrate peacefully on 14 February in support of the situation in Egypt and Tunisia , protests were banned .
what are we waiting for these regime players to introduce travel restrictions ?
what is more , Ahmadinejad oppresses its own people in an appalling way .
however , the test is a precondition for learning in most Anglo @-@ Saxics universities .
the sharply increasing number of death sentences - more than 100 cases this year , as highlighted in the previous debate - and the pressure on people exercising their right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are of particular concern .
you are right , Baroness Ashton , not only is it enough to decide to do something , but we must also ensure that it is implemented .
today , we listened to Baroness Ashton &apos;s speeches in the long debate and we agreed with them in general .
however , the difficulty is that , if we come from there to the ground reality , there will be major problems .
and that is why I would like you to complain a little about it , Baroness Ashton .
many of these things do not reach the final document , but people devote time to reflecting on the different positions that are right and appropriate .
we therefore express our solidarity with young workers and teachers who will protest in the coming weeks , including next Saturday , 12 March and 19 March at the major nationwide demonstrations by the Portuguese Labour Confederation ( CGTP ) in Lisbon .
their source is that the so @-@ called market Europe has started to obscure social Europe .
we must be ambitious .
the author has already spoken about the idea of giving some guarantees for agriculture .
author . - Mr President , I am pleased that this oral question gives us the opportunity to refocus on the problems that occurred last year during the Icelandic volcano crisis on passengers and the aviation sector in general .
last but not least - and you spoke about this - airspace parts or what is said as functional airspace blocks : it is proposed that there should be seven and not 27 .
such a situation must not happen again in the future : there should be a plan for how people can be better served through these alternative plans .
no terrorist or criminal community can shake our faith in the values that form the basis of our united Europe .
EU approach to Iran (
last week , 4 000 Muslims in Egypt attacked the Coptic village near Cairo .
freedom of the press does not allow compromises ; it is a message that Parliament wanted to send not only to Budapest but also to the European Commission .
I strongly support UN Security Council resolution 1970 / 2011 and the measures that the Security Council intends to take , including an embargo , a ban on equipment used by internal repression and the freezing of human rights abuses , drawing attention to the need to implement the EU @-@ Africa resolution , which allows the freezing of illegally acquired assets .
we must take this opportunity to free ourselves from the conflict in the Middle East , which has caused too much pain , tragedies , bitterness and misunderstanding .
we must do all we can to put an end to negative discrimination and social repression in Iran as soon as possible , thus ensuring that the country can take the first steps towards democratic change .
the selectivity of the countries criticised in the report and the nature of the debate based on their own interests are clear .
I met Mr Bhatti only about a month ago .
the European Parliament resolution on this brutal murder expresses our opposition to the increasingly brutal religious extremism in Pakistan , but it is also unanimously recognised that we do not leave religious minorities , whose rights are very widespread , to ourselves .
3 .
however , we have witnessed , for example , how they have deliberately wiped out such heritage , which means that they have destroyed identity in many places such as Tibet and now they are doing the same with Uighur sites as Kashgar .
the Bureau has decided that we need to learn lessons from this unfortunate case .
amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as regards the stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro (
this mechanism must act in accordance with the basic principles of democratic decision @-@ making , namely transparency , parliamentary scrutiny and democratic accountability .
as the European Parliament has said before , the structural causes of the crisis must be addressed .
the Hungarian Presidency &apos;s objective is to complete the first European Semester by the time of the June 2011 European Council .
we must take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the Single Market and the Commission will shortly present a Single Market Act which contains a few priority proposals for the exploitation of our greatest asset , for growth and jobs , and for strengthening the competitiveness of the European Union .
I also do not know whether we have saved the Community method .
we need to start with something .
( PT ) Mr President , today , the Portuguese Parliament is voting against the fourth stability programme proposed by the government within 12 months .
every Member State outside the euro area could have the same problem with public finances .
if Sweden wishes to belong to the EU internal area , as it does , according to the Swedish Parliament , it will not be useful to sit down the door of the meeting room .
I believe that paragraph 8 of UN Security Council resolution 1973 provides an irrevocable legal basis to ensure respect for the no @-@ fly zone specifically established for the protection of civilians through all means .
through this , we can put an end to the crisis and lay the foundations for substantially preventing similar crises occurring .
the second is safety .
( FR ) Mr President , the terrible disaster that struck the region of the north @-@ east of Japan in Thoven has , of course , aroused the sympathy and sympathy of all Europeans .
the tragic situation in Japan shows us once again that we must do all we can to create rapid response mechanisms to deal with disasters .
we should consider whether the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) should be made legally binding and whether this new regulator should be given the right to demand an immediate halt if standards are not met .
we have not reduced targets by 2020 .
in writing . - ( IT ) The effects of the crisis in Japan following the earthquake of 11 March on nuclear safety and the global economy have shaken the European Union , which is already grappling with the instability in North Africa .
obviously , we are talking about global needs .
however , these countries do not have the means to adopt them , so many refugees must live in unacceptable conditions .
therefore , resettlement is one of the most important tools for us .
Mr President , thank you very much .
as we know , the US soldier Bradley Manja went to prison for providing information to WikiLeaks .
we have come a long way .
we insisted from the outset that social and health services and gambling should be excluded from the scope of this directive , because they have nothing to do with relations between the trader - they need a different approach .
this is , of course , a compromise ; it is not perfect .
in preparing its proposal , the Commission has taken into account that the appropriate legal approach must reflect in a balanced manner the accuracy and complexity of the reporting method on the one hand and the different levels of greenhouse gas emissions in different fuels on the other .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the European Parliament for the very clear message I have sent this evening .
in my opinion , the next tariff preferences scheme should also address these issues .
in some countries , such as my own , Romania , they represent half the total number of deaths .
Esterházy helped hundreds of Jews , Czechs , Slovaks and Poles to escape and was the only Slovak MEP , Mr Paška , who protested and voted against anti @-@ Jewish laws in 1942 .
the European Union should therefore develop an appropriate strategy to support regional integration .
on market access , the agreement covers the full spectrum of traffic rights and investment opportunities : 100 % participation and control .
finally , I would like to mention the division of cooperation , which is presented as an important achievement .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my work on this dossier is not yet finished .
how can we , however , pursue austerity policies in the European Union if European expenditure accounts for only 2 % of the total public expenditure of all 27 Member States ?
the highest invoices will be submitted at the end of the multiannual budgetary period , and you will also know this in advance .
the fact that this is the third year of negotiations shows very clearly that it is very difficult to reach agreement on this important issue .
a single procedure also means that it is possible to reduce the gap in rights between EU citizens and third @-@ country nationals .
in writing . - ( LT ) I agree with the report which increases the duty free tariff quota for Moldovan wine .
Parliament &apos;s consultation process on the latest scheme of generalised tariff preferences remained insufficient and did not allow for wide @-@ ranging negotiations .
I believe that the Commission should look forward to negotiating contractual issues , including : further liberalisation of traffic rights , additional opportunities for foreign investment , the impact of environmental measures and infrastructure constraints on the exercise of traffic rights , better coordination of passenger rights in order to ensure the best level of protection for passengers .
until now , air transport between EU Member States and Canada is regulated only by bilateral agreements .
although the European Union and Canada have long @-@ term economic and political ties , the only aviation agreement between the EU and Canada was born of a combination of bilateral agreements between states .
the European External Action Service should pay more attention to this important region , and new EU diplomatic missions should be opened in GCC Member States .
the GCC countries have significant financial leverage , since sovereign wealth funds were worth more than USD 1380 billion in 2009 , in other words more than 35 % of the corresponding amount .
the European Banking Authority is the result of this .
we must therefore oppose the efforts to limit the budget lines for achieving important objectives and flagship initiatives in the Europe 2020 strategy .
the directive must clarify the conditions for entry to the EU and , if necessary , special rights , but not prevent all legal migrants from being entitled to fair and equal treatment ; on the contrary , it must ensure that this treatment is guaranteed .
in writing . - ( PT ) While this proposal for a directive has been adopted , migrant workers enjoy the same rights as domestic workers , at least when it comes to pay and unpaid work , health and safety at work , working hours and leave .
I agree with the rapporteur &apos;s opinion that the fragmentation of existing legislation prevents consumers and businesses from participating in cross @-@ border trade in the same way .
the new consumer rights regulations cover almost all types of sales : shops , telephone or internet .
it is Europe &apos;s duty to protect the interests of European citizens and consumers and , today , Parliament finally recognised fair protection of these rights .
extending this period of operation will , in my opinion , prevent a dangerous shift in law .
the European executive must react to this by demanding a series of stress tests for all nuclear installations in Europe that are carried out independently and transparently .
like my colleagues , I express my deepest condolences to the Japanese people , who , as informed citizens , react to the disaster in the best possible way .
furthermore , I sympathise with the family of Ronan Kerr and strongly condemn his killing .
I would like to know whether this was justified , whether it was merely a precaution and how vulnerable our system is in fact .
( NL ) Mr President , my party , the Dutch Party for Freedom , has always been absolutely clear .
the role of Europe and the West is not to act as a huge guest of the world &apos;s vulnerable people ; it is our job to put an end to the unstable situation that gives impetus to this mass population movement .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate my colleague on the exceptional work he has done on this report , which is so technical , but which has a real impact on the security of European citizens .
that should not be the case .
it is therefore right that the report should take into account factors such as short stays or Internet use to book travel .
the Commission must therefore react now .
security is an important asset , especially for the most vulnerable of us .
the most common cause of the injuries suffered by women is domestic violence .
by allowing migration , the EU has introduced problems in every country in the world , including honour killings , forced marriages and domestic violence in patriarchal family arrangements .
we have quickly found EUR 25 million that could be made available through the External Borders Fund and the European Refugee Fund on the basis of concrete requests from Member States .
we should not be afraid of immigrants .
however , our four funds - the Refugee Fund , the Return Fund , the External Borders Fund and the Integration Fund - represent almost EUR 3 billion in financial perspectives .
how are we going to measure whether the influx is large , small or not large enough when it is all over ?
these obligations apply to so many vulnerable people who are suffering today .
I am fully aware of this and I know that you are going to take action .
by creating jobs and increasing investment in these countries , the European Union would encourage citizens to participate in the life of their communities .
a small comparison : if France , with 62 million inhabitants , faced with the same bank crisis , the debt of French citizens would be EUR 1 trillion .
it has been said that anyone who wants a thing is seeking reasons , and who does not want this sort of thing , seeking ways to avoid justifications .
I believe that we need to pay attention to the significant poverty and segregation of organic animals , while stressing the need for effective measures to ensure equal opportunities for women linked to agriculture as the main objective of the common agricultural policy .
it also demonstrated the need to reduce energy loss and gradually place emphasis on renewable energy .
I know that you are doing a great deal of work on this , and I met your rapporteurs and I will meet your coordinators this evening .
I am convinced that over the coming weeks and months , we will be as committed as much , or even more , to developing in a coherent and coordinated manner the various components of the joint response to the crisis : the European Semester , the Euro Plus Pact , the new framework for enhanced economic governance and the measures that we have taken in the spirit of solidarity and responsibility in order to maintain the stability of the euro area .
nothing will change : those who caused the crisis will continue to benefit most from the crisis .
I have not read anything about the documents .
many Europeans can think that , in general , choices are right , but slow and not very ambitious .
Ireland &apos;s economic failure is not only a failure for Europe , but also a failure for Europe .
this means that you will continue to promote imbalances in European society , which weaken rather than strengthen the acceptance of this policy .
this is a major challenge that we must tackle in order to combat poverty and create jobs , but also to ensure prosperity .
this is , above all , a victory for Conservatives , and the implementation of the agreement depends on consensus .
my third point relates to the EU and NATO .
when returning home from Brussels , the Slovak Prime Minister , Iveta Radičová , found that the Slovak Parliament did not sufficiently support his position in the Council negotiations .
the European Council will work with the European Parliament to improve economic governance and , as in other cases , I am sure that we will find compromises .
I believe that , at this time , it is vital to reach common agreements establishing equal rules and uniform mechanisms for achieving the desired objectives .
the only policy for the reception of refugees that the Union was able to offer was very much below the requirements .
the Commission must present a detailed analysis of the financial expediency of these projects , as any future subsidy must be conditional on these countries proving that they have managed their financial resources appropriately so far .
the EU is an area of solidarity and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) is part of this .
instruments such as better funding , the development of democracy , the rule of law and bilateral agreements can certainly contribute to preventing mass migration .
now they are being called upon to manage the recent influx of refugees fleeing the problems of North Africa , particularly Libya .
it is very important to facilitate women &apos;s access to agriculture and agricultural loans .
the lack of effective healthcare and basic education in rural areas is of particular concern to women in Latvia , Estonia and Lithuania .
given the budgetary constraints required in all countries , Parliament will only agree to extend aid if EU funds have really helped to improve energy security , modernise infrastructure and develop sustainable energy projects so far .
governments must urgently draw up detailed decommissioning plans .
the main instrument for controlling exports is Regulation ( EC ) No 428 / 2009 , which introduced a number of significant changes to the level of control over exports of dual @-@ use items in the European Union .
however , the most difficult and most important issue was the question of whether it is enough to control , report and register after export or export .
free competition , the fight against protectionism and the obstacles to the abolition of agricultural export subsidies are some of the nonsense that this text endorses .
I am in favour of the need for the EU and the Member States to develop a legal framework that guarantees women immigrants the right to have a personal passport and residence permit and allows criminal liability to be applied to individuals who take away these documents from them .
for this reason , I support the rapporteur &apos;s proposals , particularly the creation of places of refuge for victims , the emergency telephone number and the establishment of the European Year for Combating Violence against Women .
if you , Mr Oettinger , suspect that there are stress tests that do not produce the desired results , because the testing systems may not survive the test , why does the Commission not intervene immediately and not close these plants ?
I do not think that at this point , any other approach would be desirable .
please raise the White Card - or any other .
he said that his firm conviction is that , apart from them , there is no one for this work and that they cannot go home until work has been done .
it also reaffirms the Commission &apos;s deep conviction that the European Union cannot tolerate any form of racism , xenophobia , discrimination or social exclusion against the Roma .
when we talk about Roma integration , we should not forget that we are talking about the most specific and complex problem facing Europe and the European Union .
there are many possibilities for saving European taxpayers &apos; money .
it is very possible that I myself am one of them .
these problems cannot be solved by allocating EUR 100 million to youth policy , but this is in line with Parliament &apos;s priorities .
over EUR 2.4 billion in payments from regional and social funds were pre @-@ emptively suspended in 2010 .
why continue to have problems with access to databases when the Commission states that it supports OLAF &apos;s work and considers it just as important as we do ?
the report repeatedly highlights the data provided by many countries on the unusually low level of fraud and irregularities in relation to agricultural expenditure , structural funds and pre @-@ accession funds .
compared to the current situation , the current military operations have not affected the level of access to humanitarian aid , as soldiers loyal to Gaddafi have restricted it from the start of the crisis .
we need the support of the European Parliament , particularly following the Treaty of Lisbon and the new powers given to the European Parliament , and I believe - as a former Member of the European Parliament - that this cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission will lead to good results in this sector , which is so important for the growth and competitiveness of the European economy .
I agree that the situation is very difficult .
almost all Member States have now set national RD intensity targets to be finalised in their National Reform Programmes by the end of April 2011 .
all of this will significantly improve the situation of SMEs and , of course , I have no doubt that , thanks to the common strategic framework , we will have other very good ideas on what we can still do to help them .
under the Waste Framework Directive , Member States are obliged to introduce separate collection of paper , metal , plastic and glass by 2015 .
what is needed now is for what was done at national level to start operating at European level .
it is particularly important that party management bodies are established according to transparent principles in order to ensure the democratic election of all political bodies and democratic decision @-@ making .
Commission ?
the position expressed by the Committee on Legal Affairs in its opinion - and I quote - was as follows : &apos; the objective of the proposed decision is to require Greenland to transpose EU health rules , which is conditional on the application of EU internal market rules on fishery products from Greenland &apos; , which ensures that the agreement is adapted to the existing Union rules on animal health , food safety and the common organisation of the market in fishery products .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs on the report presented and , due to time constraints , I will limit my remarks to the Grelier report .
I appreciate the Commissioner &apos;s position , including his personal position on the participation of Members of the European Parliament , and I hope that his personal position will have an impact on the Commission &apos;s formal position so that we can achieve the objective on which we are working .
I appreciate the excellent work done by the Commission , particularly by Commissioner Barnier , in this regard , and I would like to congratulate him once again on his firm commitment and his efforts to revitalise the internal market .
that is why we intend to present this year , with Mr De Gucht , legislation to transpose international obligations on public procurement contracts into EU law , which will give us the necessary impetus to negotiate .
today we are discussing how to give fresh impetus to the Single Market .
Mr President , I very much hope that the 200 people in need can be saved because this is a very important issue .
it is important that this is an opportunity , not an obligation , which some directives have often changed before .
in order to promote the creation of a market for European citizens , greater coordination of trade activities must be given priority in order to control goods from third countries .
this is a reality in which real businesses show the diversity of the economy and business .
many sectors are still closed , many of the practices of our Member States are hampering the free flow of services and the thrust of the Services Directive - the points of single contact - have still not been fully implemented .
the Single Market must be deepened and led towards the citizens and their interests .
you are fully responsible for them .
I note that the debate in the European Parliament on asylum seekers did not take place in a nervous tone , which is often used by several EU Member States .
another slogan of money : how many billion will it cost this House of History , where it is going to sell propaganda and talk about how the European Union &apos; saved the world &apos; ?
these countries are Poland , Slovakia , the Czech Republic , Hungary , Croatia and Romania .
in our opinion , the introduction of this support is important and necessary , and we have therefore voted in favour of the report .
I voted in favour of adopting this report , including the allocation of funds to the Czech Republic and Croatia , where the situation was the same .
obviously , this is not sufficient reason for the EU to stop moving forward towards the establishment of a free trade area agreed with these same disshops .
therefore , the introduction of general rules for trade and imports of fishery products originating in Greenland must not be completely left to the Commission and the Council , as this would be contrary to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
given the terrible tragedies , such as the recent disappearance of one Libyan vessel near the island of Lampedusa , this revision is essential , particularly given that the applicant &apos;s ability to obtain asylum can vary greatly between Member States .
in writing . - ( PT ) The development of the Common European Asylum System was launched in May 1999 , following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , building on the principles approved by the Tampere European Council .
the introduction of a regulation taking into account tourism statistics in all Member States is a useful step .
accessibility of tax firms , services for people with disabilities and the costs of basic services are important data for which an up @-@ to @-@ date database is needed , where users can query .
this would allow monitoring and monitoring of the environment and health , which would contribute to making the sector more sustainable .
unfortunately , the rapporteur and the majority in the European Parliament have ruled out this in accordance with the Commission &apos;s position .
this requires changing the Statute for Members of the European Parliament .
in writing . - ( FR ) This resolution concerned the authorisation and refusal of health claims made on foods and referring to children &apos;s development and health .
furthermore , even if the generally recognised scientific evidence shows that DHA in breast milk contributes to the development of infants , there is currently no scientific consensus on the possible link between the consumption of milk enriched with DHA and the better development of infants .
in order for investment agreements to bring even greater benefits to these countries , they should also be based on investors &apos; commitments to respect human rights and anti @-@ corruption standards as part of a broader partnership between the EU and developing countries aimed at reducing poverty .
in writing . - ( LT ) I agreed with this report , which calls for measures and funds to be made available to ensure that EU funds do not take corrupt action and to ensure the overall transparency of recipients of EU funds .
in writing . - ( IT ) The focus of the report on combating fraud in the Community is right : it focuses on the need to demand greater clarity and reiterates that under no circumstances should there be less vigilance .
like the rapporteur , I agree with the need to introduce changes to financial regulations governing the financing of European political parties and foundations , and I am also in favour of these funds being fully allocated at the beginning of the year .
only 40.3 % of voting Finns took part in the last European elections .
however , in the final vote , I voted against the report in order to express my total disagreement with the rejection of Amendment 10 .
this dialogue has a special and multiple impact on the lives of all Europeans , but it becomes even more important in view of the creation of a single market aimed at stimulating the entire European economy and improving the exchange of information between legislative bodies and the immediate users of the internal market .
I am very pleased that three resolutions on relaunching the Single Market were adopted , which strengthen governance and increase the role of businesses , growth and citizens in this policy .
with Mr Correia de Campos &apos;s report , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has fought for better regulation of the single market and for it to serve the general interests of Europeans and not just businesses .
I therefore agree with the need to develop areas in which European SMEs are lagging behind : e @-@ commerce , tax policy coordination and better harmonisation of cross @-@ border public procurement contracts .
the report blatantly blatantly accuses of a neo @-@ liberal ideology of hindering economic growth of administrative rules and the protection of public services .
on the basis of this latest report , the European Council will assess the initial results by the end of the year .
do you really think that national regulators suddenly realise that they have performed their duties so far poorly and were too tolerant ?
Germany &apos;s two older power stations , situated at 180 km from Strasbourg , have been provisionally closed and removed from the distribution network .
are you still of the opinion that nuclear power stations are safe , or do you share my view that Zwentendorf is the only safe nuclear power plant in the world ?
safety limits have been greatly exceeded and we do not know what will happen in the near future .
thirdly , these tests should be carried out by an independent authority .
however , there are countries such as Finland , which are currently building new nuclear power stations , and there are also countries which already have nuclear power and plan new plants , and countries where there is no nuclear power and which want to build their first station .
although the EU has a legal framework which leads to constant improvements in technology , there must be massive investment in research and training to ensure the highest possible level of safety and health and environmental protection on the basis of the latest scientific and technical findings .
it is time to act .
this small country has a strategic position for balance in the Gulf and energy transition .
countries will make a solemn but usually unwritten agreement on secession and risk @-@ taking with their troops , but only if the vital interests of the state or its citizens are at stake .
it has made significant progress in terms of both official development assistance and policy coherence for development .
on 17 June 2010 , the European Council unanimously decided to grant Iceland candidate status .
if the forthcoming Icelandic referendum on the matter ends with a negative outcome , it may be difficult for the British Government to give its support .
the extended banking sector and public debt , which account for 90 % of GDP , are worrying .
we believe that the country is ready to participate at a higher level in EU integration .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , the Committee on Foreign Affairs has presented a good and balanced report on Macedonia &apos;s progress , and we as Greens support it .
in my opinion , it is unacceptable , and indeed scandalous , that no significant progress was made in this regard last year either .
immediately afterwards , the democratically elected President , Alassane Ouattara , began a loyal republican offensive on the ground in the last supporting point , Laurent Gbagbo , in Abidjan , in order to force Gbagbo to hand over power .
was that justified ?
this week we have talked about refugees coming from North Africa to Europe , but we have also heard reports of some million people fleeing neighbouring countries , which are almost the same poor or even poorer than Côte d &apos;Ivoire .
the resolution draws attention to the need for better functioning financial instruments to support economic development , infrastructure renewal and investment in areas where they produce results ... where results may not be so obvious but are felt in the long term , such as the integration of education , research and academic institutions and the introduction of new technologies .
I agree with the new guidelines that can be summarised as three tools : &apos; money &apos; , &apos; market access &apos; and &apos; mobility &apos; .
is the European Union itself at the forefront in all these areas , taking into account , for example , the situation of the press in Italy and Hungary , the issue of citizenship in Latvia and Estonia , and the corruption in the European Parliament ?
some Members of the European People &apos;s Party are so beloved to Yulia Tymoshenko that , without him , the Ukrainian Government appears to be undemocratic , despite the fact that the government has managed to improve the country &apos;s economic and political situation significantly over the last year .
Mr President , the so @-@ called &apos; arson check &apos; perpetrated by the Egyptian army on female demonstrators in Tahrir square and the repeated rape perpetrated by soldiers against Libyan women are horrific crimes which prompted the motion for a resolution today .
as we are discussing possible solutions for getting out of the financial crisis today , this debate will lead to transparency and tax havens .
I am happy to share these reports with you , but I cannot answer this question in more detail at this point .
infrastructure must be transformed into a well @-@ functioning whole .
we are lending to Asia and the United States , and with the funds that have been collected so far we can finance projects under favourable conditions .
I hope that the Council will show sufficient flexibility so that this legislation can be adopted in time before the next bluetongue season begins .
we will now continue with this subject , we will agree on rapid solutions to such urgent issues and we will move forward and allow our livestock to be vaccinated .
the next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Erminia Mazzoni PETI , on behalf of the Commission - B7 @-@ 0211 / 2011 - on the importation of tomatoes from Morocco into the European Union ( petition 1565 / 2009 by Spanish citizen José Maria Pozancos ) .
5 .
the resolution provoked many differences in Parliament .
we really must present a concept and an understanding of what human rights mean .
over the last few years , progress has been made in the area of animal vaccination .
the resolution on this subject cannot focus on the issue of nuclear safety without addressing the most important means of ensuring nuclear safety , which is the abandonment of nuclear power .
Fourthly , my country had to stop investing in coal @-@ fired power stations because of misleading regulations in the EU , and now the same interest group says that we also need to stop investing in nuclear technology .
no nuclear exit strategy has been secured so far to make a real change in Europe &apos;s energy policy , which must move towards the removal of alternatives and the decommissioning of nuclear energy , so that Europe can gradually abandon the nuclear energy sector .
we cannot decide to stop using nuclear energy without ascertaining what kind of renewable energy is available , which would meet the EU &apos;s energy needs in the future , at affordable prices for citizens .
however , this does not yet make the opposition a completely democratic alternative .
therefore , the recent formal request made by poor countries for the abolition of export restrictions cannot be ignored .
we look forward to further progress , particularly on 9 April 2011 , in order to form a clearer position on Iceland &apos;s membership of the EU .
the current political situation in the country , including the boycott of opposition parties in the national parliament , could have a negative impact on the country &apos;s EU agenda .
you only support the results that suit you .
in the light of the latest events in the Mediterranean region and the immediate and indirect consequences of these events on European countries , a thorough review of the European Neighbourhood Policy is urgently needed .
urgent action is needed to put an end to this degrading treatment and to ensure that all security and armed forces are given clear guidance that there is a thorough investigation into torture and other forms of abuse .
however , we are not in favour of transforming the EIB into a simple instrument for implementing the EU &apos;s policy objectives , as well as its use to solve the problems of social and economic cohesion and social development , which must be done with the EU budget and the EU Structural and Cohesion Funds .
today &apos;s news , as Mr Preda stressed , is very significant , because now we see dictators abiding by each other and exchanging data .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Mr President , the detention of Chinese artist Ai Weiwei at Beijing Airport on 3 April , when he attempted to travel to Hong Kong , has rightly caused international concern .
the pressure from China is something that we absolutely must fight against , and if we do not do so now , when we try to launch a dialogue with China , then I am afraid we will never .
the aim of these resolutions is to ensure that he and his colleagues from the MDC party have a new motivation to continue his work .
what we are hearing from that country now is simply intolerable .
I think I have misunderstood , and I would therefore like to have clarity in this matter .
it is in our own interest to maintain the fisheries sector , as it will enable us to develop our territory and coastal regions , to guarantee the food security of the European Union and to protect jobs in this sector .
it is necessary to provide assistance so that all Member States that want to protect their sectors can do so .
the price of fuel has tripled , which has , of course , put the question on the agenda whether EU legislation is adequate and appropriate for its economic reality and whether it satisfies the needs of European fishermen .
this would create unequal conditions in our sector , which are favourable for the richest countries .
both public and private broadcasters are important advocates of media pluralism and diversity of opinion in Europe .
the characteristics of overlaps of these frequencies and of the passing of buildings are generally recognised , so to say , the golden frequencies .
as has been said , radio spectrum is a scarce resource , but it is also a public good , and it is our duty to use it as well and as effectively as possible - as Mrs Trautmann also stressed .
we know that any targeted aid to Pakistan is not being used to help the people affected by the floods which took place almost a year ago .
in private situations , we think it is possible to make concessions in the form of trade preferences , but on condition that they take account of the sensitivities of European industry , particularly in the textile industry , which has been severely affected in regions like Valencia kommun in Spain as a result of the crisis .
I am thinking in particular of Christian minorities and women &apos;s rights .
we are fully aware of the views of the European Parliament on this issue and take them fully into account .
we have a duty to adhere to the principle of cohesion in development policy , enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon , which tells us that none of our policies can harm development .
Mr Rinaldi mentioned the example of the railway sector , which is , of course , one of the biggest sectors , given the difficult situation in India in terms of infrastructure .
author . - Mr President , the free trade agreement between the EU and Japan obviously has the potential to create a significant number of jobs in Europe and to benefit European businesses , and the reason for this is that so far , the EU has been able to include Japan &apos;s market to a very modest extent compared with EU exports elsewhere .
at the same time , a trade agreement with Japan with a relatively small but dynamic economy is already in place - from 2009 .
our second problem is that we cannot even use the argument to ensure maximum protection for investments .
I believe it would be good if other groups , too , were to consider this issue and find that the compromise proposed is indeed a very good solution that seeks to meet everyone &apos;s needs .
the next item is one @-@ minute speeches on matters of political importance .
I will give you three examples in the 20 seconds left to me .
the role of forests in the European Union &apos;s energy strategy is also an important point , as the potential of forests is currently not being exploited sufficiently as a source of renewable energy .
thank you also for the guidelines that help the Member States .
the European Court of Auditors ( ECA ) has examined the financial management of the European Development Fund in depth , not only in its annual report , but also in very many special reports , and made genuinely good and valuable comments .
in fact , we should have administrative sanctions for minor offences rather than the criminal justice system currently in force in my country .
obviously it is good that we get such a museum , but it troubles me greatly that we have never had a proper debate in this Chamber on this project .
( NL ) Mr President , the rapporteur , Mr Chatzimarkakis , and many other speakers have rightly drawn attention to the need for Member States to submit declarations of assurance .
however , on the other hand , we rely on them when problems arise almost overnight , for example when more staff are needed in the Mediterranean , or when dioxins are found from animal feed .
he spoke very clearly , and we may not like what he said , but at least he was very clear , and we are grateful for that .
2009 discharge : European Centre for the Development of vocational Training (
therefore , it should read : &apos; the European Parliament notes that the possibility of receiving lower pensions has been lost since 50 years of life and 25 % of the possibility of receiving a one @-@ off amount equal to pension rights &apos; .
three months have passed and the EU and the World Trade Organisation &apos;s response is still insufficient .
in writing . - ( PT ) In the last few years , there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of agencies , so the interinstitutional working group on agencies is vital , as is the forthcoming special report by the Court of Auditors , which includes a study of the performance of the agencies and a comparative analysis of their costs .
the European Parliament is pleased to see the Centre mid @-@ term review of its strategy for 2008 @-@ 2012 ; however , it calls on the Centre for Translation to further develop its performance assessment by improving the interaction between strategic activities and activities foreseen in its work programme and reviewing its performance monitoring indicators to meet smart criteria .
it is clear that every debate on discharge has its own specific context , and today we have had an economic and financial crisis that has created financial and budgetary problems for some Member States .
in writing . - I voted to give discharge to the European Environment Agency .
in writing . - I voted to give discharge to the European Maritime Safety Agency for the financial year 2009 , but call on the Agency to further reduce the number of legal commitments made ( i.e. prior to the corresponding budget commitments ) , which reminds the Agency that since 2006 , the Court of Auditors has reported breaches of Article 62 ( 1 ) of the Financial Regulation ; welcomes nonetheless the Agency &apos;s efforts to improve the situation in order to avoid specific training practices .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Foundation for the improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2009 , as it helps to verify how the funds are used by the European institutions .
in writing . - ( DE ) I abstained from voting .
however , I think that , although justified to some extent , the Joint Undertaking is still in a start @-@ up phase , it should stop implementing its control systems and act more cautiously and transparently in the coming years .
Bruno Gollnisch has requested that the European Parliament defend his immunity in relation to the measures he claims to restrict his freedom , which were applied by the French authorities in the framework of a judicial investigation in the case and in the context of compensation ( record inte avec Navigation Bate Scheme ) , launched by the International League against racism and Anti @-@ Semitism on 26 January 2009 for incitement to racial hatred .
the agreement was approved at the 36th session of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation conference , held in Rome on 23 November 2009 , which concluded a process of discussion , preceded by a series of other agreements and codes of conduct adopted over the last two decades under the auspices of the FAO .
at the moment , such activities have been partly blocked because one Member State &apos;s lenders do not want to lend to borrowers living in other Member States .
in order to ensure effective enforcement , courts must be able to request disclosure of debtors &apos; assets and freeze in the context of measures offering temporary legal protection .
in writing . - ( IT ) I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2009 , as I believe that the money has been managed transparently and generally also effectively , taking into account certain situations that the European Union had to cope with during this period .
in writing . - ( DE ) I cannot vote in favour of the discharge of the European Parliament &apos;s budget because the taxpayer is not even able to keep up the circus travelling between Strasbourg and Brussels .
the amounts allocated are earmarked for specific purposes , and the discharge procedure will verify retrospect compliance with these objectives .
one of the most severe effects of these measures would be in Portugal , where the textile and clothing industry generates 11 % of exports and employs 160 000 people , and the subsidised competition provided by Pakistan would hit this hard .
in addition , the Greens were afraid that measures could pave the way for Pakistan to be included in the GSP + scheme without the country having signed and implemented the relevant labour and environmental conventions ( not to mention the Geneva conventions ) .
since the new investment policy is being developed , bearing in mind the validity of bilateral investment agreements concluded by Member States during the transitional period , it must recognise the rights of investors whose investments fall within the scope of these agreements and ensure their legal certainty .
the country has made significant progress in combating corruption , which is an important problem in all the former countries of the Council .
at its meeting of 12 May 2011 , the Presidency intends to launch a debate on the different ideas of the Schengen acquis , presented by the Commission in its communication on migration of 4 May 2011 .
if it is now decided in the courts of the European Union that the Dublin II regulation will be made ineffective - in other words , that refugees must not be sent to their first arrival countries - then we must ask the Commission how committed it is to taking action against those countries that obviously do not implement the current law .
( applause )
above all , however , it is necessary for the European Parliament to insist on its powers to decide on this matter together with the Council .
any authorities that violated international maritime and humanitarian law must be held accountable .
Schengen is a symbol of Europe and a perfect cooperation on freedom of travel , open borders and security .
tens of millions of Europeans travel this summer .
finally , the Council looks forward to the Commission &apos;s revised proposals on the Procedures Directive and the reception Conditions Directive , which are expected if I am not mistaken , at the beginning of June .
we Hungarians understand the importance of this very much , as many countries in the world adopted hundreds of thousands of our compatriots following the 1956 uprising .
they do not need to be included in this register , but if they have separate offices whose role is merely to maintain contact with the European authorities , they must be included in the register , even though they are subject to a different treatment regime for stakeholders .
it cannot be stopped , because it is absolutely normal ; we live in a free and open society , but yet in this structure we must make our voice heard and maintain our independence .
finally , I will say the following .
( LT ) Mr President , the causes of the Chernobyl disaster include errors in the design plan and the failure to test the reactor in extreme situations .
responsible politicians must keep a blind eye to hasty solutions .
therefore , on behalf of the Commission tomorrow evening , I will present my position on behalf of the Commission to all 27 nuclear authorities , based on thorough preparatory work , and I say to them that we must take all risks into account , regardless of their origin .
and why do we do it ?
however , given that time is running out , I will limit myself to just one debate , if I may .
I am not hiding from the fact that , in the face of the Council &apos;s leaflets , I am self @-@ confident about my future .
there is still a long time to go until 2013 , so I am pleased that the Commissioner wants to bring forward a legislative date that will ensure full information for consumers .
adapting legislation is one way of protecting competitiveness , but there are other industrial policy initiatives .
then we should measure , keep an eye on temperature , keep up the wedding constantly .
the financial crisis should have taught us all that transparency must be assessed .
however , the bank book lists bank names up to the final deadline .
Janusz Władysław Zemke asked a very comprehensive question about future threats and risks .
this self @-@ interest in waste management leads to environmental and health problems in these countries and can , in extreme cases , claim many lives .
the solution must be two @-@ way : the administrative burden on companies that reuse hazardous waste and get rid of them legally must be facilitated and , in parallel , of course , the manufacturers of hazardous waste must be encouraged to choose the legal route and interest in preventing the activities of the hazardous waste mafia .
however , as honourable Members know , on the basis of letters sent to me personally and sent to me and to the European Parliament and other institutions , there is no simple solution .
it is therefore gratifying to see that the Nigerian elections are going well and that Goodluck Jonathan is now appointed properly .
there is a major disaster in Syria .
the first part of the report deals in detail with relations between the European Parliament and other institutions , particularly the Council and the Commission , and this was prompted by the following approach to European policy following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
Mr Tannock , you spoke about many of the issues concerning the support of the 27 Member States , your desire to see us have the necessary resources and the lack of resources .
I want to make this clear to my colleague , Mr Tannock , and his crude friends .
this is a test that must be carried out effectively and with dignity .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
it is for this reason that we must do everything we can to get the service started as soon as possible .
I know that it is difficult for you to do your job , Mrs Ashton , because you are alone and you did not decide - that is , the European External Action Service - but now the impression is that , in the autumn , Belarus was , in our view , the most important issue , but today we are looking at North Africa , just like children , who have suddenly had an interest in something else .
faced with a number of crises and threats , we cannot leave everything to our US friends and allies or NATO .
aggressive wars in which the peoples of Europe have no legitimate interests should be avoided at all costs .
as far as our delegations are concerned , I support the efforts to strengthen what our delegations are doing in opening up the Banenghazi office and what we are doing in Iraq .
our common European values nevertheless provide us with an opportunity to shape a European foreign policy based on sustainable development and human rights .
the second part of paragraph 26 and paragraph 37 will be put to roll call votes .
I would like to point out that in October last year , the European Parliament voted by a large majority for the proposal for a regulation on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries , including textile products , and that the Council has so far not started negotiations or debate with the European Parliament , even at an informal level .
Mr President , Singapore &apos;s government and the Hong Kong and Shanghai authorities are in London and other European financial centres , wanting to recruit people who have gone abroad because of the excessive regulatory burden imposed by the European Union .
Mr President , I voted against the report on EU foreign and security policy .
if they are amended , it will be difficult to understand what provision is currently in force .
this will ensure greater clarity , as various provisions regulating the same issue are often spread across different legal texts .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this report , which seeks to adopt a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the operating space , access to management and doors and windows of wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors ( codified text ) .
in writing . - ( ES ) I support this report because the proposal is limited to the codification of existing legislation without any change in their substance .
this provision is essential , above all , for consumers who are allergic to leather products , and consumers who , for ideological reasons , do not want to buy textiles containing animal origin parts .
as the interim agreements / Stabilisation and Association Agreement grants Bosnia and Herzegovina trade preferences for the same products as those determined by autonomous trade preferences , these preferences must be removed from Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1215 / 2009 .
I agree with the rapporteur &apos;s opinion that , in order for Europe to play a leading role in the global economy , it is vital to achieve a single internal market , an emphasis on the services sector and a knowledge @-@ based economy .
wireless broadband is essential to ensure that all citizens have access to new and innovative services .
it will create new jobs , create new services and attract investment in Europe .
Parliament and the Commission will set a good example of the establishment of a common transparency register for accreditation of lobbyists and other interest groups .
they represent general interests , and therefore they should be differentiated from lobbyists defending the interests of individuals .
the common register is a step towards greater transparency in the institutions of the European Union , which will hopefully contribute to greater legitimacy of European integration in the eyes of the citizens of the Union .
representative democracy can only work if citizens communicate with their elected representatives and ask them to stand up for their interests .
strengthening corporate governance is at the heart of the financial market reform and crisis prevention programme proposed by the European Commission .
although the most extreme poverty has not gone anywhere , it is equally true that wealth flows have given India a more prominent place on the international stage and have shown that the economy and society of that country are advancing and renewing quickly and effectively .
the EU and Japan are important partners and investors in each other &apos;s economies , with a total of EUR 200 billion in direct foreign direct investment in 2009 .
I welcome the adoption of this report , which draws attention to the neglect of this sector and calls for recognition and appreciation of the diversity of species in the European Union , as well as the need to implement modern and active strategies for the use of biomass and CO2 credits , as well as for continuing traditional activities .
therefore , wild species that habitually establish a particular life environment of forests deserve special attention from forest owners , as they help to preserve biodiversity .
I cannot agree with this prospect - Member States would no longer be able to establish their own foreign policy based on their own national priorities .
I support a European foreign and security policy where the word &apos; Europe &apos; is most important .
the current upheaval events , which are leveraging even more now that Osama Bin Laden is dead , must be combated in full compliance with the Treaty of Lisbon .
today , the EU is a legal personality , a form that gives it a more weighing global profile .
in writing . - ( IT ) I voted in favour of this report because the multilateral role of the EU must be further strengthened in the coming years .
this would indeed have been a step in the right direction .
you have heard all that we have to say on this subject .
we must be more self @-@ confident if we want to implement it in the face of opposition from third countries .
consumers therefore still do not know whether , for example , the milk they drink comes from cloned animals or not .
these initiatives were prepared as a result of extensive consultations with small and medium @-@ sized enterprises associations and the institutions involved .
( RO ) Mr President , at the end of March 2011 , the unemployment rate in the European Union was 9.5 % and the unemployment rate in the euro area was 9.9 % .
this is not really an impossible task .
the global financial crisis has had a significant impact in all our countries on both revenue and expenditure , even though its impact and nature in all cases has not been the same , and the ability of the various Member States to deal with the consequences is very different .
I am sure that all of us will continue to be wise and courageous to make these decisions .
then they are lending and lending and , even worse , they are going to print the money , because politicians and their central banks have machines that print the money .
I think everyone understands this .
( el ) I understand that you are unable to come forward with proposals to solve the acute problems faced by workers both in your own country and in the other 26 Member States of the European Union .
a massive credit crunch .
the Commission is keen to ensure synergies between these two agencies , in particular through exchange of information , joint work programmes , joint conferences and seminars and joint projects .
in my opinion , this is a very one @-@ sided approach .
we hope that , by means of innovation , we will be able to integrate all these things , push the economy vigorously and , at the same time , move towards a sustainable society .
in addition to increasing innovation , we must examine how it can bring benefits directly to European Union citizens .
we have constantly said that the future of the European Union will depend on whether we can successfully solve the problem of innovation .
how do you now intend to have a dialogue ?
it was a very inclusive process .
at present , the Commission has no intention of amending the framework directive on safety and health at work .
in the future , we must ensure that work that does not offer a decent income is brought to the knees of society and that a tolerant attitude is stopped .
Antibiotic resistance ( debate )
every year , 25 000 people die in Europe for reasons associated with AMR .
if the EU adopts strict measures on the use of antibiotics in agricultural animals , it is also expected to amend legislation in third countries , particularly as a result of financial losses resulting from restrictions on the export of meat to the European Union .
new technologies increasingly support the right to cultural development and other fundamental rights .
in particular , accessible , inclusive and high quality early childhood care and education contribute to reconciling family and professional life .
we certainly need to invest much more in creating a single European public space .
this includes the creation of fora where financial actors and students with innovative ideas can interact .
therefore , my attitude to this report is twofold to say it directly .
the employment crisis can only be solved by massive public investments in the creation of decent jobs .
on the contrary , the aim should be to create new standards of social cohesion and collective commitment that the European system of classification of universities based on humanitarian science and them can develop in the right direction .
the Europe 2020 strategy aims to increase the proportion of people completing tertiary education to 40 % and reduce the proportion of early school leavers to 10 % .
having examined the views received from all stakeholders on this subject and following public consultation with stakeholders , we will make recommendations on how the cultural and creative industries should be strengthened and supported in order to highlight the results that we expect from this industry .
if the schools of the majority were taught the history and literature of minority communities , and if the education given to minorities were to cover the culture of the majority , there would be greater consensus between communities living together .
these priorities and objectives cannot be fully implemented and achieved if the EU does not provide long @-@ term financial support from its budget .
greater mobility for young people , better job opportunities and a labour market that must take into account not only young people working in this context , but all sectors that provide young people with opportunities for development are central .
increasing the minimum aid available to businesses for a period of just three years from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 may help them in this difficult situation .
exploitation is not only about extracted from outside the European Union ; we are also exploiting our own citizens .
the Youth on the Move initiative forms part of the EU 2020 strategy .
from this point of view , I support the idea in Mr Zver &apos;s report that funding for the education and mobility of young people , despite the current difficult economic situation , is an investment in the future of Europe and not an additional burden on the budget .
although we must act to ensure that as many as possible are in higher education and to combat early school leaving - only 31 % of Europeans have higher education , but in the United States this figure is 40 % and 50 % in Japan - we must also ensure that graduates are fit for work .
they also provide an early years basis for children &apos;s lifelong learning .
there is also an economic need , given the increase in the number of women on the labour market .
first of all , mechanisms should be established to assess the provision of such services and to ensure the required quality .
equally important is the request to the Commission to address the problems associated with exceptionally low offers and to put forward appropriate solutions .
temporary emergency measures are needed to enable European fishermen to overcome the difficult economic situation , but the Commission should also draw up a long and medium @-@ term plan to increase fuel efficiency in the fisheries and aquaculture sector .
I voted in favour of this document because I believe that the incentives proposed by the Small Business Act for small businesses will help to improve the competitiveness of the EU .
the approach to innovation is multi @-@ faceted in nature , not only involves research , development and the development of new technologies , but also the development of new processes , methods and organisational and behavioural models .
an annual conference of the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) will take place in June and will adopt a convention on domestic workers , which will require them to receive equivalent treatment with other workers and to meet all the conditions of decent work .
the European Parliament also supported the need for the EU and its Member States to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All migrant Workers and their families .
antibiotics are often used for animal health .
I voted in favour of this resolution because cultural diplomacy lays the foundations for trust and sustainable links with third @-@ country nationals .
however , the Group of the Greens insisted instead on promoting cultural cooperation .
in my opinion , we must ensure interdisciplinary learning programmes and demand cooperation and partnership between schools , students and professionals in the cultural and creative sectors , as well as between every SME , private and public sector and craft workers and financial institutions .
at present , images of the beacon of Sarajevo , who are stunned in the streets of the warfare , are known all over the world in an attempt to alleviate the suffering of the people who have been tortured , who cannot leave the city .
therefore , the Government of Sri Lanka should immediately investigate violations of international humanitarian law and human rights standards .
we have a report which should follow up , and I strongly support the need for a genuine process of responsibility , which would lead to painful , yet compulsory , investigation for Sri Lanka for truth , justice and reconciliation .
at least 30 people who also protested peacefully were sentenced to five to eight days imprisonment in closed secret meetings without being able to contact their legitimate representatives .
the European Union must support all those who risk their life and freedom in this country for our common values .
we should understand that the right response would be the message to Belarusians - the people of Belarus - that they are welcome in Europe and , at the same time , exert pressure on the regime and , in principle , talk very firmly about these human rights violations .
today , it is our common responsibility to hold dear Soviet terror to the memory of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the Baltic States and to condemn most strongly the totalitarian system and crimes against humanity committed by its leaders .
what the rapporteur , the shadow rapporteurs and my predecessor , Mrs Joly , have now presented is acceptable and supportive .
( el ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to congratulate Mr Leinen on an excellent report .
we are also planning a third set , so the work is ongoing and ongoing .
we have to admit that when Dominique Strauss @-@ Kahn was appointed as Executive Director of the IMF , the situation was very different : people were told that it was led by the organisation .
what else explains your great savage and determination to see Europeans in this job , if not your desire to take a step , which you say is not urgent and may be waiting for a few more time ?
as far as simplification is concerned , my colleague , Mrs Carvalho , will discuss her excellent report in detail and - Commissioner - we support the Commission &apos;s decision of 24 January 2011 to create a central database of participants , the Unique register , but we must go further .
we cannot accept this model .
such statements should not be made arbitrarily .
unfortunately , beneficiaries of research programmes use numerous national and EU funding sources .
in this regard , it is necessary to pay greater attention to support this programme , to ensure a stronger link with business claims and to ensure a better level of coordination with other EU instruments and structural funds .
Fourthly , we cannot accept an agreement that does not take into account the standards and preferences of local SMEs or Canadian state monopolies .
this would mean losing sight of the wool .
after all , the most important trade relations are trade relations , and I believe that environmental and social problems also require clear regulation in individual agreements .
firstly , the EU and Canada have different systems of origin .
Serbia , which is characterised by a Christian tradition , has proved its good intentions time and again .
ensuring independence of impact assessments ( short presentation )
I am very pleased that Parliament has rejected this directive .
however , we have already said that strict criteria will be set for the next step .
we must reduce early school leavers and ensure that there is a strong link between training and work , for example through exchange systems , as is the case in Germany and Denmark .
EHEC and resistance to antibiotics are both major problems .
the problem is that the Commission does not have the resources and the opportunity to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the Member States .
nevertheless , crisis management covering the whole of the European Union cannot be described as professional until a common language is found .
if people comply with basic hygiene rules and if they stick to their personal hygiene , hide and heat their food , it is enough to protect against infection .
this has caused millions of losses , and Polish farmers have also not been affected .
producers are giving up the increase in vegetables , which means restructuring production to something else , and this in turn means redundancies in jobs .
the directive allows Member States to issue lorries not only for infrastructure costs , as is currently the case , but also for noise and air pollution .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her enormous and very important work .
what is most disturbing , however , is the fact that the European Parliament is likely to consider this proposal to be only a first step .
I hope that many EU Member States , including the Netherlands , will embrace the system .
we cannot allow interinstitutional agreements , common perceptions or other positions to restrict the rights conferred on the European Parliament in the Treaty , so this text must not move forward .
on 6 July 2010 , Buda &apos;s regional court sent a request for immunity from Ágnes Hankiss following the re @-@ launched criminal proceedings called for in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Hungary in 2009 .
in particular , allergies will benefit from this proposal , as fur can pose a risk to their health and , without proper labelling , they can buy a product containing textiles without understanding it .
according to a report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 2009 , the situation has deteriorated in relation to drugs such as cocaine , heroin and new synthetic drugs , and the level of use of which has been consistently high and on the increase .
the agreement was then revised in December 2009 to take into account the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
thanks to the creation of such a European service , the situation will improve in all areas .
the project aims to provide signals for civil use and to ensure that all industrial levels in Europe are able to compete in this growing strategic market .
general agreements with neighbouring countries or important global partners can bring significant benefits by offering better services to passengers and freight operators - both in terms of diversity and costs - while offering airlines new opportunities and competitive advantages .
in fact , he cannot be involved only at the end of the process , when his activities are limited to giving a &apos; yes &apos; or &apos; no &apos; reply to the final settlement , without having any appropriate indicators for the decision being considered .
I do not want to underestimate the environmental problem , but it seems to me that this is not the right time to burden European businesses with yet another tax .
given the positive experience of Switzerland following the introduction in 2001 of heavy goods vehicles tax based on cannage , I have no objection to the new directive .
environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation , as this will enable data on the environmental impact of economic activities to be obtained .
we have seen in the news pictures of the people left to their fate and also of the dead .
we all want the Internet to be public .
would it not have been a good idea to raise the issue of corruption at the G8 summit ?
there is a risk that tensions , which turn into a public conflict , will envy the independence of South Sudan and once again create chaos in the region .
I think that this department should now be encouraged to prepare an action plan explaining further measures to the Committee on Foreign Affairs , which will allow us to understand how valuable EU foreign policy can be if we all work together to achieve the best result .
those who are sick and injured are not even being counted .
that is why I said that this is a great victory for us , because we supported the process politically , both through our actions and through our funding .
the facts simply do not support this .
the report also states : &apos; irregular migration from Turkey to Europe is spreading to the Bulgarian coast and drugs and trafficking of crime groups in Turkey and Albania is increasing &apos; .
( HU ) Mr President , the Coelho report states that both Romania and Bulgaria have proved that they are prepared to apply the provisions of the Schengen acquis appropriately .
Europe undoubtedly differs greatly from what it was 20 years ago .
we must avoid a system based on double standards which is very strict with regard to the candidate countries , and which is very flattering with regard to the countries within the Schengen area .
we will come back to this later and , at the same time , will take into account today &apos;s extraordinary meeting of the Agriculture Council .
( it ) Commissioner , before the end of next month , the European Commission will formulate a proposal for a new Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014 @-@ 2020 .
at the same time , we are working on preventive measures which should help us avoid infringement procedures .
regardless of what final arrangements we will finally find , the issue of governance will , in my opinion , have a significant impact on the final arrangements .
you certainly have experience in this area .
it is clear that today &apos;s Europe can no longer be compared to the Europe of EU founding fathers .
there is one saying that if you do not change course , then you will end up where you wanted to get to at the beginning .
this relates to both legislation and the budget .
faith in Europe is disappearing .
the result is that they are going to be painted by cocktails .
the future viability of the EU must not be measured by dogs .
we should have set priorities .
the Union &apos;s budget is a means of ensuring global and integrated development at a time when the Member States cannot get alone ...
the report completely rejects the idea of freezing the budget after 2013 and stresses that even if the budget is increased by 5 % , it could only make a limited contribution to EU funding .
the draft proposal , supported by eight parliamentary committees , starts with problems which the new Multiannual Financial Framework must also respond to .
the vision of the whole of the European Parliament is firmly based on the Europe 2020 strategy .
the financial resources that could be received by some new Member States are half the smaller than the funds received by some project participants in the old Member States .
I am completely opposed to such an approach .
this horrendous agreement was finalised under secret cover and was approved one day in August in the 1980s .
I am of the opinion that the closure of Schengen doors to Romania and Bulgaria should not be a punishment for honest citizens who would suffer most if they would now lose the opportunity to travel freely in Europe .
in writing . - As a friend of Bulgaria , albeit with a critical attitude as a friend , I want to do all I can to support the development of this country , but not at the expense of the prosperity of my own country .
furthermore , the report deals with important issues such as strengthening the role of the ICC and the international criminal justice system , promoting accountability and putting an end to impunity ; it also deals with strengthening crisis prevention structures and their effectiveness within the framework of the United Nations Development Programme with a view to making this organisation a world leader in crisis prevention and recovery ; it also stresses the need for close cooperation between the EU and the UN in managing civil and military crisis and , in particular , in humanitarian operations .
the report proposes , for example , an increase in funding for the programme , but at the same time proposes that common research areas should be identified among those that are most promising at the level of specific applications which , on the ethical side , allow for the most comprehensive distribution with a view to achieving concrete results in the implementation of the programme .
in particular , the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development ( FP7 ) is currently the only way to achieve the objectives set out in the Innovation Union and to accelerate the transformation of Europe &apos;s knowledge @-@ based society , meaning job creation , the use of knowledge capital and its conversion into practices in our everyday lives .
the global competition of the major economic powers , such as China , India and Brazil , forces us to take exceptional measures to gain a technological advantage that would effectively implement the European Union &apos;s strategic objectives .
I was very pleased with this document because the mutual relations between the EU and Canada in the field of trade and foreign direct investment are very close .
the recent financial crisis highlighted three main problems in this area : lack of competition , over @-@ reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and the lack of accountability of credit rating agencies for their ratings .
it would be good if credit rating agencies were to be more responsible for their activities in the future .
lastly , it is very important to look into ways of determining civil liability for rating agencies for their own ratings .
the EU is considered to be a reasonable and reliable partner in this area .
the funds will be divided into strict , indicative and financial .
this is a legitimate objective ; however , I have certain doubts as to whether we are able to achieve this objective .
I am concerned about the high rate of youth unemployment .
it seems obvious to me that the mutual recognition of qualifications in an increasingly united Europe , where mobility is growing , is essential .
the Europe 2020 strategy includes key factors for smart growth ( fostering knowledge , innovation and education and digital society ) , sustainable growth ( production of resource efficiency , while increasing our competitiveness ) and inclusive growth ( increasing the employment rate , providing vocational skills and combating poverty ) .
in order to combat low @-@ skilled people &apos;s unemployment and to promote the employment of older citizens , it is also essential to promote the recognition of national qualifications between Member States and to encourage certification through an assessment of skills acquired through informal work practices .
I voted in favour of this report because I agree that it is essential to continuously improve the quality of EU legislation , and it makes specific proposals for improving the legislative process both in the European Parliament and in the Commission .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this report .
divergences in European contract law are hampering the willingness of businesses to participate in cross @-@ border trade and preventing them from benefiting from the opportunities and benefits offered by the internal market .
on the one hand , they call into question the underlying principle of contract law in the future , while , more importantly , they fear that the legal situation will become even more difficult .
this is the most tangible and most accessible measure of macro @-@ economic activity .
&quot; GDP and beyond . measuring progress in a changing world &quot; is a report aimed at assessing the level of progress made by the European Union through gross domestic product , which has become an integral indicator of society and economic development .
as we have said on the implementation of the global European satellite navigation system for transport , the use of technology can make a significant contribution to the development , modernisation and diversification of public services , the creation of opportunities for cooperation , the progress and exchange of information in science and research applications , and access to information , while ensuring respect for public rights , freedoms and guarantees .
the Galileo programme , which , together with the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System ( EGNOS ) , seeks the creation of global navigation satellite systems ( GNSS ) , is in line with the Union &apos;s strategic choice : it reaffirms entry into the global market , while efforts are being made to establish a programme in a global market dominated by the United States at the moment ; moreover , it is important for the European economy itself to be overcome .
if there is no budget , there will be no project .
in short , despite the exceptional length of the text , Parliament is insisting that , after 2013 , the total amount and allocation of the European budget be adjusted to the competences of the European Union and a very wide range of priorities according to Parliament &apos;s definition .
although I think that there is a significant value when the 27 Member States put their resources together , I was unable to vote in favour of a 5 % increase in the EU budget after 2013 , unless we have thoroughly examined existing expenditure to eliminate waste and duplication .
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo , on behalf of the special committee on political challenges and budgetary resources , on a sustainable European Union post @-@ 2013 .
trust in the EU will only be restored if our citizens are convinced that the Union is serving their values and interests .
if a state decides to use fair elections and two @-@ thirds majority to create autocracy , then we will have the right of others to be shocked and to try to oppose it .
the Council of Europe , Parliament and the Commission cannot ignore such violations of European values , as this could set a negative precedent which other non @-@ liberal regimes will follow .
if I think that the Hungarians are reacting to this debate and the accusations that some of my fellow Members are sleep with any direct quotations , then I can well imagine how some consider the way in which the development of Hungarians and their country is being discussed here today to be very brutal .
what I do not understand in this debate is that until now we have been told that laws amending by two @-@ thirds majority are to ensure that they cannot be misused .
the question was whether or not this constitution covered a specific four @-@ fifths majority .
both then and now , this debate is only an excuse for attacking Hungary .
Mr President , Birgit Sippel described the European Arrest Warrant as a child .
it always has the opportunity to fully implement its defence rights in the issuing Member State where there is a substantive trial .
the existence and operation of this instrument must therefore be supported , but we should also support the fact that it is monitored .
( PT ) Mr President , the European Union is an experiment made up of experiments : the euro area , the same parliament in which we are present , the Schengen area and a number of other instruments are all experiments .
training , which will be high on the agenda in the coming weeks , months and years , is very important because we need to train judges , prosecutors and lawyers in the application of our European rules .
for us , for Parliament , this is an important part of the partnership .
Mr President , the dialogue between the European Union and Russia must be broadened as far as possible in various areas from the economy to human rights , because there are no alternatives to dialogue .
I remember the words of our colleague , Hannes Swoboda , who yesterday asked for the utter cleansing of Russia &apos;s history , particularly the Stalin era .
we cannot accept that .
having investigated the matter on the ground , we came to the conclusion that the legislation applicable in Austria on environmental impact assessments was adhered to at that time - at least in principle .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Oettinger , ladies and gentlemen , according to the precautionary principle , environmental impact assessment aims to identify and assess the direct impact of projects , as well as the indirect impact .
we will give you a written answer on this .
they may think they are protected in their own country , but they do not know what will happen in another Member State .
many organisations are prevented from starting legal proceedings at its cost .
these European teams are made up of nuclear energy experts and Commission officials from different Member States .
I now understand that we need to do more to introduce stricter safety standards for European nuclear power plants .
I then asked what power stations he was thinking about .
does the Commission intend to demand that all Member States carry out the stress tests properly , not in any less lenient version ?
I would also like to emphasise the urgent need for additional investment in research into nuclear energy as well as in other important research in order to prevent and combat future disasters and their harmful consequences .
Mr Oettinger , you can count on the support of the European Parliament .
this would give a clear assurance that this cannot be a national issue , but it must be a European issue aimed at ensuring the safety of European citizens .
I will remind you of the April part @-@ session , when some Members of Parliament felt that they had lost any proportion since the accident .
it is of the utmost importance that the EU continues to provide assistance and guide this assistance to build the necessary institutions for a well @-@ functioning independent state .
we must do all we can to prevent this .
furthermore , the Government of South Sudan should start to establish an external investment policy that would bring foreign investment into natural resources to the country and thus help implement policies to reduce poverty .
however , respect for and protection of fundamental and human rights , the rule of law , independence of the judiciary , political control over the media , repressive measures adopted by journalists and opposition representatives and fair elections in Russia continue to be of concern .
granting such rights should be the sovereign internal affair of each country .
these misleading practices usually involve attracting businesses , as well as professionals and non @-@ profit entities , to be able to carry themselves in a business directory free of charge .
we condemn the illegal exploitation of mineral resources and the plundering of malicious forests , particularly palislic forests .
we attach great importance to overcoming the current political crisis and the economic and social consequences for the people of Madagascar , which make people &apos;s lives more difficult every day .
I regret that he is creating insults at me .
we demand that human rights belong to all people .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
I have the same comments and the same cruelty as most of the speakers here today .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I apologise for interrupting the vote .
it should just be recalled that the Hungarian Presidency obtained a mandate from the European Council to reach a political agreement with the European Parliament by the end of June .
as a last resort - and only if critical of the situation requires this - such decisions could allow the reintroduction of controls at internal borders , but this must always take place within the Community framework .
of course , they will receive money for their proposals from those who are interested in these proposals .
obviously , we have reached the last pages of the bail @-@ out chapter .
in fact , Mr Barroso was right about this .
that is why it is right that we resolutely promote and support the reduction of Greece &apos;s foreign debt .
it is very important for Croatia to join , but it is also important to remember that the Pope warned horns of a bureaucratic centralist structure .
the influx of migrants must be administered from Brussels in a way that rewards inclusion , solidarity and security .
few of you addressed the very important issue of the closure of the European semester .
in writing . - ( FR ) What could the outcome of this Council be ?
I also noticed that you have included higher maximum levels for direct payments in the proposal .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I think that the world @-@ renowned Scottish poet Rabbie Burns would have described this report in its original form as a kind of inflammatory mob ( English bis in , tim &apos;robeastie ) .
I am sure that this Parliament , which has been strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon , will only succeed in achieving these theoretical objectives as concrete actions so far .
we should not care whether the agricultural company is large or small , but whether it is well managed .
European spending is 42 % of CAP spending , which is why we must certainly give citizens a thorough account of the use of this money .
( es ) Mr President , the most important point that comes from this House today is this : Parliament wants the common agricultural policy to be fair , i.e. that all producers would be guaranteed a decent level of income regardless of their area of activity and place of business .
special payments must be aimed at areas with natural handicaps that have specific needs .
this is the best way to solve the major , comprehensive problems that agriculture has had since the 2000s in its present form .
the Council has worked in good faith to try , if necessary , to improve the directive and transparency , but not to address sensitive issues relating to the constitutions of individual Member States .
from an economic point of view , I would first like to point out that , thanks to the work we have done in Parliament , we have a proposal agreed with the Council that is sufficiently transparent and also includes a solution that is sufficiently automatic .
for one decision , Parliament and the Council disagree .
I would like to mention four points that I consider controversial .
European leaders have waited and created uncertainty .
the EU is currently pursuing a new approach .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , Minister , ladies and gentlemen , a number of remarks have already been made on the various reports forming this governance package .
we cannot allow this to happen again and , at the same time , we must learn lessons from past mistakes .
the current economic governance package is better than the Commission &apos;s original proposal , and it is better since several Members of this House have contributed to it .
Europe must focus on a common strategy , but we must not forget the differences between each country .
we in the Commission are therefore ready to adopt any possible restrictive solution , including export bans and restrictions .
adequate funding for national programmes must be ensured , but taking into account the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle .
Mr President , less than a year ago , I drafted a cross @-@ party petition on the referendum on EU membership in the United Kingdom .
these are important issues for hundreds of Welsh farmers who are leading high quality businesses , which have often belonged to families for generations .
the EU would be wrong if it were to set new unilateral targets , given that we do not have global legislation that would set binding reduction targets .
therefore , the draft budget for 2012 amounts to almost EUR 9 billion less than the ceiling set out in the financial perspective for 2012 .
I believe that investment in these sectors is the only way to get Europe out of the crisis .
the justification for the destruction of this food aid programme with technical and legal difficulties is disastrous not only for the people concerned , but also for the credibility and image of Europe .
in such a difficult situation , the EU budget must play an important role in promoting the European economy .
I had the honour of dealing with the subject of future European territorial cooperation - Objective 3 of cohesion policy - and I would like to thank the shadow rapporteur and the Commission for their fruitful cooperation .
considering the increased focus on urban and urban areas , as well as the creation of a new infrastructure fund and a possible performance reserve , we must ensure that none of them jeopardise or damage the poorer regions of the EU .
for Germany , it is also important that the European Union continues to develop harmoniously , as it benefits Germany .
however , it emerged from the debate that we also need to take into account other regions , particularly those affected by the crisis .
there are worrying information indicating that some decision makers in the Commission intend to drastically cut the cohesion policy budget from 2014 .
cohesion policy is exclusively directed at investment .
3 .
rapporteur . - ( SL ) Mr President , it may be that I did not take good note , but in my voting time , we have not yet voted on Amendment 62 .
on the other hand , experience shows that market mechanisms are not capable of reacting quickly and flexibly to negative developments , resulting in the financial crisis becoming a debt crisis .
- ( CS ) Mr President , I am very pleased that Mr Schwab has reached a compromise with the Council that improves consumer rights and also includes my proposals on Internet trade .
written explanations of vote
Opel Antwerp was a modern , successful car placement company .
on the basis of the report and the work carried out by the Committee on Legal Affairs , it is quite clear that there is no reason for the Romanian authorities to act against Adrian Severin with a desire to persecute him , although the position of a fictional lobbying company may raise doubts about the regularity of users &apos; behaviour , it is nevertheless true that this issue does not appear to be part of a case where legal integrity can be based .
at the same time , it promotes political dialogue to discuss the necessary reforms aimed at strengthening cooperation between the two contracting parties by supporting the partnership framework for the development of a sustainable fisheries policy and responsible exploitation of fisheries resources in the Seychelles fishing zone .
in view of the conclusion of the Air Transport Agreement , it is right that Canada was given priority , as both Europe and Canada are at the forefront of the global market as manufacturers of aircraft , engines and air electronics .
this is the objective that all Member States aspire to within the framework of the European integration process .
I believe that in some areas , the effective selection and implementation of projects is hampered by the lack of the necessary preconditions , such as simpler application procedures at national level , clear national priorities in certain areas of intervention , timely transposition of EU legislation and combined institutional and administrative capacity and excessive bureaucracy at national level .
the Commission should prepare a study which compares current practices in individual Member States on integrated strategic planning and draw up specific EU guidelines for urban development planning , integrated on the basis of the results of this study , to promote effective and legally regulated partnerships , including cross @-@ border urban partnerships .
in implementing the Urban Agenda , we must focus more on the objective of contributing to the development and qualitative modernisation of infrastructure and services in European cities .
EU Member States will continue to benefit greatly from better instruments for cooperation with other Member States .
it should be remembered that the good outcome of most programmes and actions depends , to a significant extent , on a successful combination of factors , in which the development of human resources is paramount .
it proposes bureaucracy for new distribution tools , such as macro @-@ regional entities , and the nation state is once again undermining a determined shift towards regionalisation .
labour MEPs support the improvements to the Commission &apos;s proposals on macroeconomic imbalances in the Ferreira report , which supports workers &apos; rights and the importance of a thorough analysis of economic activity , including employment .
the European Parliament has sent a clear message to everyone and , above all , to the Council .
in writing . - The ECR Group has always worked constructively to ensure that the euro area can formulate a lasting solution to the public debt crisis .
this financial reform package is hitting the poorest in Europe hardest , but leaves the cause of the crisis - the financial sector - untouched .
this report , like other similar reports in this package , refers directly to the recent financial crisis in Greece and sets out the objective of creating a legal framework to avoid repetition of such crises .
we must do everything to achieve macro @-@ economic stability and the sustainability of public finances .
this not only allows greater coordination , but also greater responsibility on the part of governments , both at Member State and European Union level .
I welcome this vote because it represents real progress for the internal market and the result of difficult and complicated negotiations .
I voted in favour of the Consumer Rights Directive today because I believe that it simplifies and improves existing consumer protection rules .
the directive , which puts an end to the lengthy debate between the European Parliament and the Council , doubles , inter alia , the period during which consumers may withdraw from purchasing , from 7 to 14 days and provides for more effective protection in the event of non @-@ compliance with the goods .
however , since the implementation of new technological solutions has been delayed and turnover fell by more than 20 % in 2009 and 2010 , the proposal does not provide for as much reduction as was originally planned .
responsibility for the safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste remains with the Member States , but they can act together in the framework of joint projects and in accordance with the strict requirements appropriately formulated .
we must always exchange good practice throughout the European Union in this area .
since the cost of the project has increased steadily since its launch in 2006 - from EUR 6 billion to EUR 16 billion - in my opinion , it must now continue with the resources available .
in my opinion , the report on the mandate for the trialogue is quite satisfactory .
finally , we must not forget that the problems of agriculture are directly related to the problems of the food sector , which is why it is very important to resolve them in order to protect the health of European citizens .
however , we must recognise that the European Parliament still has important work to do , because there are issues that have been outlined in the Deß report only in general , because the opinions of MEPs on resolving this problem were divided , or were even diametrically opposed .
given that the world &apos;s population is only increasing , world agricultural production must also increase accordingly .
