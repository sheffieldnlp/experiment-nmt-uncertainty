four members of the Group of Cape Verde were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to Mr Posselt , in Spain , the police apprehended the leader of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Kallirovo Group &apos; in Estonia , Sbel Gulevich , who is known in the criminal world under the name of SpinKCape rovski .
Gulevich , who was detained in Spain , was arrested on the court &apos;s list .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
it is suspected that the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde &apos; criminal community members aged between 27 and 57 years of life , who commit mainly drug crimes .
in the province of Mala Mijas in Spain , the alleged head of the criminal community was detained .
three men were detained in Estonia as a suspect , one of them collected according to data is the leading figure in the criminal community and two are members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicate that tasks and roles were clearly shared in the criminal community .
the purpose of criminal activities was to commit drug crimes and thus to earn criminal proceeds , &quot; commented on the head of pre @-@ trial proceedings , Public Prosecutor Vagio Verte .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; added the Prosecutor .
it is people who have previously been interested in law enforcement authorities , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become commonplace for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; said Public Prosecutor Verte .
the head of the central criminal police service , ago Leis , said that detention was preceded by a preliminary investigation of nearly one and a half years .
&quot; in the first half of the week , long @-@ term work was realised and , at the same time , in Estonia and Spain , we suspected of committing crimes , &quot; he said .
Leis added that central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
these detentions are yet another message to criminals that we will get them from another European end , &quot; said Leis .
the information that has been gathered so far clearly indicates that men suspected of being in freedom can continue to commit new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office requested their arrest and also approved by the court .
a man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
in this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation .
the pre @-@ trial proceedings in criminal matters are carried out by the central criminal police &apos;s organised crime office and run by the prosecution service .
in 2005 , the city of Tallinn was convicted of blackmail by ShiGulevich and punished him with five years &apos; imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gulevitši was regarded as the second most important man in the criminal world in Estonia following the Gendarmerie , Nikolai Tarankov .
Gulevich , from Cape rovos , emerged from the Estonian Alliance at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Admittedly , he taxed taxi drivers and women on various hotels and ordered a monthly rotation tax on businessmen .
international joint operations , confiscation of proceeds of crime and entry into force of judicial decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest judgments , the eight accused of the so @-@ called Dikyev criminal offence , who seized EUR 80 000 of criminal proceeds , or the judgment against nine individuals that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal connection in 2006 aimed at illegal trafficking of illegal cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in Eastern Viruland and southern Estonia .
it has a total of around € 71 500 in confiscated criminal profits .
in these criminal matters , it has been a success that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and , if necessary , act together in any country of the European Union .
civil Liberties Group warns of Missourisse travel
the National Association for the AdvanGuard of the People of Colored People ( NAPs ) has warned the people of the Muslim population travelling to Missourisse for discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the State .
the Group &apos;s statement states : &apos; the NASR issued for the State of Missouri State , valid until 28 August 2017 , calls on all Iraqis to be particularly attentive and very careful when moving across the country , taking into account the suspicious racial events that have recently taken place in the country and have also been pointed out here &apos; .
according to NAC , the group urged both the recent Missouri law to issue a travel warning , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that the targets for the state &apos;s law of law @-@ enforcement defenders are , to a large extent , minorities .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
they are pulled down because of their skin colours , beaten or killed , &quot; said Rod Chapel , President of NAARas City Star .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints before . &quot;
this is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for the US State .
the group referred to events such as racist insults against black students at Missouri University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black Sandersi .
the Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , after he had run through the state of petrol and was arrested by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the comment refers to the recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri , which shows that in the State the cars of black car drivers are halted by 75 % more likely than those of white drivers .
&apos;The comment is designed to make people aware and to warn their families , friends and collaborators of what might happen in Missouris &apos; said Chapel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it is to involve the money of distance or to inform relatives that they pass through the state . &quot;
based on the latest figures from the FBI hate crime programme , 100 hate crime crimes were documented in Missouris in 2015 , which places the state in a cross @-@ border 16th place in terms of the number of similar offences .
the travel warning is also a response to the new law of Missouri , which makes it difficult for a company to be brought to court for reasons of discrimination in search of housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( American Civil Liberties Union ) had previously issued travel barriers for Texas and Arizona following the adoption of immigration laws by these states , which obliged local authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration because , according to ACLU , it increases racial profiling .
usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter @-@ reaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
Hepatitis : what could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
Hepatitis , or incineration , may be caused by five different types of hepatitis A , B , C , D and E virus .
all these viruses highlight the acute burst of the liver .
there is , however , chronic hepatitis B and C , which can develop into a liver rock , in other words , a lips and a liver cancer .
the epidemiology Adviser of the Health Agency , Kuulo Kuabir , says that acute hepatitis disease is the same for all types of skimmed infection - fever , fatigue , rubble , birth , oliberalisation , cruelty , grey emissions , horse mackerel , meat and excess pain , and swine and limasters .
the last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of the liver &apos;s burner , yellow disease .
children can undergo hepatitis without disease .
the various types of cyanide can only be identified on the basis of laboratory research data .
hepatitis may turn to chronic hepatitis and go decades without disease phenomena , which means that man may not know anything about his or her dangerous pay @-@ off disease .
Mr Kunilr points out various forms of hepatitis and describes their culmination more closely .
a hepatitis virus is spreading from a hospital to humans and infectious us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , through seals , emissions of infected human beings from hand and hand to food , soil , objects , contact and consumption of drugs .
a hepatitis was carried out by family members and carers of the disease , people suffering from chronic diseases , sex people with infection , sex men with men , drug users , and passengers visiting countries with a hepatitis A high spread .
vaccination can be prevented , in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling a lot and at the hepatitis A risk group .
furthermore , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to wash or disinfect hands before eating food , to wash all fruit and vegetables .
the hepatitis viral virus is spreading in the circulation of a person &apos;s blood , in the treatment of drugs , in induction , in honour , in the use of blood @-@ contaminated foeder ( dentists , pregnancy ) , in donor blood , in the sex of hepatitis sufferers , and in hepatitis disease to animals / newborn .
the risk group of hepatitis infection includes drugs , sex partners of infected human beings , sex men , newborn mothers of infected mother , sick family members and carers , health care , rescue workers and police officers , as well as passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis B .
in order to prevent hepatitis , it is possible to vaccinate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vaccinate people from the risk group , as well as those suffering from chronic diseases , HIV infections , sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes .
there is a hepatitis of other preventive measures : non @-@ refraining from the use of strangers &apos; hygiene and manikysis devices , other sharp tools and systalstalde @-@ counters , tomatoes and augmentation , and the use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection or prevention of sexual risk @-@ taking .
vaccination against hepatitis b is part of the National immunisation Scheme and free of charge for children in Estonia .
Hepatitis C viruses spread when dealing with the blood of the sick , when it comes to drug injection , therapeutic , augmentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated foetuses , donor blood blood , the person of hepatitis @-@ hall in sex and hepatitis hospital for animals / newborn babies .
the risk group of hepatitis C @-@ hepatitis drug users , sex partners of infected person , sex men , infants of infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police officers , persons with HIV infections , and passengers visiting countries with hepatitis C .
the Hepatitis C is a preventive measure : refrain from the use of alien hygiene and manheyl devices , other sharp tools and systals @-@ councillors , tomatoes and augmentation , and condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection .
there is no vaccine against hepatitis C .
Ahepatitis causes hepatitis D virus , which is multiplying in the presence of hepatitis B virus .
as a result , Dhepatitis D infections , together with hepatitis B or superinformation , occur on chronic hepatitis B sufferers .
Apatitis viruses spread exposure to blood and other body liquids , contaminated spirits , relatives and rarely infected animals .
d hepatitis risk group is chronic hepatitis B infections and people who do not have immunity from hepatitis B .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against hepatitis B vaccines , which also protects people from hepatitis D infection .
Ehepatitis viral viruses spread by weight to drinking water and food , including low heat @-@ treated beef , fish and marine carrots , donor blood , psychiatric and infected animals .
passengers may be infected with high levels of E hepatitis in countries .
the measures to prevent hepatitis are compliance with hygiene requirements : to wash or disinfect hands after the fire , before food production and eating , after care for the disease .
fruit and vegetables are washing ahead of consumption , avoiding eating little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption .
although , over the last few months , competitors tried to get rid of a four @-@ fold Olympic winner , 34 @-@ year @-@ old Farah ended up in power and won 26.49.51 .
the Farah did not think long , bringing the husband Tania and the children with him after the finch .
this was a special moment for me .
I am very much counting on my family .
being with them was wonderful , &quot; said Farah for journalists .
Farah is focusing the fifth edition of the London title on a golden dump of 5 000 and 10 000 metres .
everything is possible if it is believed .
despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connorm in Daam gold , Gustav Klimti &apos;s masterpiece , Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri &apos;s wonderful story of &apos; one of the art works of much deeper than the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna &apos;s cultural life .
but even more deeply in history .
it would have been possible to get more influence on the exceptional nature of the portfolio , which is to say , a sleep cut in the coffee , a narrower topic .
at the moment , there would be two books between some of them : Gustav Klimt and his painting &apos; Daam gold &apos; , the story of Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri , and a much more extensive and comprehensive history of Honourable Jewish families and the German occupation , with its aftermath effects in Austria .
the first third of the book leads to a thriving cultural life in the middle of Vienna , and who himself entered the Austrian capital , can hardly imagine how life was going around Ringstrass more than a hundred years ago , or how all its heads were turned when the climate invaded .
the concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities of Europe , and when we saw the name familiar in the book , some of them seem to be more cultural than a gram .
however , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where there was an untreated arson in the voir and was the highest level of suicide in Europe does not add anything to the development of the story .
or perhaps , however , every couple of fair terrain also adds colour to the cultural life of Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in the last decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
nearly one in ten people in Vienna had an exchange of views .
parents , too , were newcomers in Vienna , but by the time the aid for the Avian was opened twice by the Czech sugar magnaad Ferdinja Blochga and the customer in his famous painting , his father had already become the seventh largest bank in Habsburg &apos;s Empire .
however , the whole life of the glaciers to which he belonged did not go .
if you look at the &apos; Daami gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end @-@ of @-@ life infection was that great @-@ like dam socialism and dreamt of a trip to the Soviet Union .
by 1907 , when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband &apos;s luggage from Climate , the last moment was the painting maker in Vienna .
the climt ordered 4 000 kroons at the time , a quarter of the price of a good @-@ place rural house .
the fact that some of the marksrs were not intimidated by the modelli of the masters , the sugar magnati .
as far as the delegate is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between modelli and the artist in the course of the work continued until the end of life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connor - &apos; Daam gold &apos; .
Gustav Klimti &apos;s Cup , Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri Corporate , exceptional story , &quot; Varrak 2016 , Aldo Randland , who translated English .
shortly before the start of the work with Adelega , Ravennas San Vitale had visited the climate , and the investigators think that it was precisely there that the wonderful mosaic countries , the Emperor na Theodorf , gave an artificial idea of making a golden portfolio called Adeledeledelete as a mosaic .
the climate was presented in his &apos; Daami gold &apos; in Vienna in 1908 and , at the same time ( between 1907 and 1908 ) , another golden country was born &apos; novel &apos; .
artistic historians did not notice the similarity of two women .
what about nature is Hitler ?
&quot; I think I am indebted to him to make his hand available to the public , &quot; said Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer a few years after the departure of the artist ( Klimt died in February 1918 ) to the Director of the Belvedere museum and wanted their family &apos;s climti to go to the museum .
six years prior to the death penalty , the customer had a tree of one of the Adelegates .
he also asked her husband to leave her two sports courses and four Gustav Klimti landscapes to Austria Galeri in February 1925 .
he has written his notes to Mariana and Lui .
one year after the climt had finished the &apos; Austrian Mona &apos; annex , Viin Kacarriart de Akademine had attempted to escape 17 @-@ year @-@ old Adolf Hitler , but failed in a footnote .
although Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ Semitism is sometimes seen as a result of the fact that Jewish professors did not accept him in the anti @-@ Scademy , none of his culminants was actually Jewish .
in any case , the role of the Austrian Galer , referred to in Mrs Building , had changed considerably by 1939 - it had become important to find decent works from the rich Jewish arts in Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal muscle of art also served some work at home for the As , but not for the climate .
Sixty years after the artistic robbery of the Nazis , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute between the Austrian Government and the heirs of Bloch @-@ Bauer was launched .
it should only be noted here that if the &apos; Snovel &apos; is seen in Belvedere Castle in Vienna , Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer &apos;s &apos; Daami gold &apos; must be seen to travel to New York to Neue Galeri .
and before Vienna , read the aforementioned book .
even if you do not plan to look at the work of the climate , because at least my emotion , after the closure of the book , the subject of laughing and hair was sold more than USD 135 million ago and modell Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer .
so not so much a tree , but rather a family embassy - and a very moving story .
there was a significant simplification of the way in which the Bauots &apos; relatives at the start of the book were communicated .
17 @-@ year @-@ old swimming in Canada was very close to Estonia &apos;s record
in eating , gold was very close to the personal record of its own 200 m seliflowing , flooding 2.16.62 .
the Tippmark comes from the 17 @-@ year @-@ old festival every week since the Canadian Honorian Championship received 2.16.58 , the Priit Aope &apos;s Ujugation blog .
gold has finally escaped a tenth A @-@ finalists .
in Finally , he went through a distance of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful March .
Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.15.13 ) , a member of Alina Kendziorn , remained a little over half a second .
in Estonia &apos;s ranking of all times , gold rose third , and its fresh personal top mark is the fifth ever result of Estonia .
the young hope of the future lies at the launch of Canadian adult Championships of 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in balfire and 200 mm and 400 mm in bundling .
last week , Canadian juggers &apos; championships took place in Tuonto and gold made successful start @-@ ups there .
he won 200 m in balfire with a silver man &apos;s time of 2.03.22 .
this distance was swamped so quickly by the last resort in 2008 .
Estonia has been distancing itself more quickly from the Golden era than Estonia &apos;s record BSE .
as a star living in Canada , a film of 100 mm vanishing vines won an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season with 56.66 .
for example , her grandmother Kertu ly Alnek has distanced it by just one century faster .
he reached an additional 100 m in the opening of a briefing in the opening of a briefing in the zoo .
for half a longer distance , he won only the seventh seat when he sleep at 2.17.31 in the finalists .
gold is currently leading the finest in Estonia on four different distances .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics insured teeth
the holiday season is in hand - it is also a mess for the President of the United States , Donald Trum .
however , as the Trump has so far been one of the President who has taken the most holiday days , the critics are already wearing teeth .
according to the US Guard and CNN , the President intends to have 17 days &apos; leave in an unseated golf club in Bedminster , located in New Jersey .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , the anti @-@ Trumpi has been speaking for a few weeks .
they are casting too much on the Olympic Games .
it is precisely that the President has the time for a weekend in his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey in cotton .
incidentally , the Trump is not the clearest President in his 196 term of office .
George W. Bush , for example , has already reached 67 days on holiday , while Barack Obama has reached half the Trump , only 21 days .
however , things are tending to be forgotten quickly by the Olympic Games .
the days after becoming President , in Trump , he said , &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , that there would be no time left for long holidays during his team , because there is a great deal to be done .
he also expressed his outrage about Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
the current President wrote on Twitter at the time : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , plays a golf , the brakes and the jungle concerts are on the brakes and the journalists in Haiti are putting their heads in the wind &apos; .
according to white house officials , 17 @-@ day golf club visits to pollen are not a betrap .
instead , it is officially called &apos; working leave &apos; , during which the Olympic Games do not have time to read or other pro @-@ sporting activities .
in addition , there was another reason for working leave .
it is precisely that the western system of the White House is being replaced , which is why all staff had to leave it .
the West Bank is also based on Ovalkar and other presidential premises .
&apos;I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West in August if there are 38 degrees and no conglomerations &apos; , the speaker of the White House , Lindsay Walters , who stressed that the President would continue to work during his leave .
where President Trump will spend 17 days , you will get an idea of a video .
blocking critics from Facebook to theory do not stand for state posts if you do not tolerate the critics of the voters .
the father of our country knew a great deal about unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans loved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to bull him for everything , from internal politics to his political principles .
of course , he was annoyed by the criticism .
but he did not force his critics to remain silent .
because , in 1783 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and that , in darkness and silence , we could be led by sheep to massacres &apos; .
this brings me to Maryland kuberner Larry Hogan , who is struggling to be more in Washington .
the Hogan has blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the American Federation for Freedom of Citizens ( American Civil Liberties Union ) has therefore brought it to court .
the Kuberner officers &apos; office tembed the action empty and web commentates slipped away from reactions in a style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos;
&apos;This is just Facebook , &apos; many people said .
but that counts .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan .
this is an amazing popular Governor of the Republican in an overwhelming democratic state .
his approval rate is the second highest ranking among the 50 Governor of the country .
Hogan is not a reactive sight .
he has led the State firmly and remains strictly firm on his principles .
in addition , it has used its main tool in communicating with its voters quite bluntly on Facebook , for example , presenting its own rock head after the chemistry for the first time .
thus , the Governor &apos;s cows are a public forum with official labelling , managed by staff who pay taxpayers &apos; dollars to block people visiting Kenya unnecessary and , ultimately , dangerous .
in an interview given to Washington Posselt , the spokesman of Hogan , defended the behaviour of the Governor , arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than a modelling .
however , it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet controls on the web , spawns or people full of hatred .
the post spoke to a number of people who were blocked by Hogan .
this is precisely what they are people who communicate with their elected leaders : the teacher , the owner of the company and the passport , and not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were respectable , thought @-@ out and not rosy at all .
Pastor quoted the Bible in his post , highlighting the Kgan Catholic movement .
the lawyer from Marylan from Bowie , Lakshm Sarma Raman , did not incite hatred , but rather hate crime .
&quot; I have replied politely that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news , &quot; he wrote The post news story in his country of comment .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that when many people comment on the same subject , some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort instead of acknowledging that it is a lot of citizens &apos; concerns . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s officials called &apos; targeted junk attack &apos; would probably invite others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the age of Facebook makes it easy to reconcile messages by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments .
it is much cleaner than it was when , in order to do the same , workers had to be expelled , so that they gather newspapers with critical editorial editorial letters and burn them or arrest protestors and force them to remain silent .
but that is exactly what is happening now , just digitally .
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media toothless .
President Trumpi has brought Twitter users to court who have been blocked from Twitter &apos;s stream .
one of the first key judgments on this matter was made last week in Virginia .
James C. Cacheris , the US civil servant , decided in Alexandria that the chair of the Managing Council of Loudouni County violated the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page .
Mr Ktuckys also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter for use by Governor Matt Bevinit ( R ) .
this should not be so difficult .
in Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar effect on the Internet .
between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers and anonymous writers dared his way of leadership .
even then , Washington had to face anonymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers from pseuudonyms such as Juricola , Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , making the decisions of Washington land .
according to historical documents repeated in the Water @-@ based George Washington project , he swamped the cabinet with petitions criticising his views on the agreements on friendship , trade and shipping with Britain .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , differences of opinion and debates are the foundation of our country .
and proper management means accepting this .
Ronan Rafferty hopes of the comfort of the territory of Renaissance Cclubs
the former European Chairwoman Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of the home territory in the next three days , when East Lobor Renaissance Club golf courses take place 25 .
the Northern Ireland , which was in the vicinity of Archerfield Linony last year , ahead of the last round of Mr Paul Ealburst , has staged a new site and is playing the role of a security Ambassador instead of the founder and executive leader of the club , Jerry Sony .
&quot; I saw Renaissance Club being built , and now we see the club blowing in full glory with this event , &quot; said Rafferty .
&quot; players see the path in their best shape , it is in a perfect state .
Jerry has done an excellent job in setting up this place .
he is a keen supporter of the golf game and proud of what has been achieved here .
this will allow a wonderful presentation of the path . &quot;
an Englishman is ever looking forward to being able to defend the championship for the first time , although the man has won both the European Toubon and the European challenge in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this is a very special feeling , &quot; said Southportis &apos;s beating player .
&quot; I was unable to defend my Extremadura OAntwerp title because it was taken away from my competition calendar one year after my victory .
it is mathematical to come back to this chicken .
this is an excellent place for golf playing .
I remember the memories of last year , for me and for my wife Sharon , last year &apos;s victory was a special one .
it was a very special time that we will always bear in our hearts . &quot;
on the ground of the country , Gary Orr will also return to the competition once again , who joined the European Union of segenius in the beginning of this year when he received 50 .
this is his first event in Scotland following the participation of Aberdeen asset Management Scottish Openil in 2013 .
&quot; it is always a little bit more important to play at home , &quot; said Helensburgh &apos;s man Orr .
&quot; there was a good deal to be done , but at the same time you are also looking at the extra .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and I have shown quite a decent golf game .
I am satisfied with the progress made so far . &quot;
the former MasterCard &apos;s winner , ian Woosnam , and the champion of the seenime Association , Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , mark James and mark McNulty , will join in Trio .
Orr and former Ryder Carika Captain Sam Turance are two of the six Scottish people in the competition , the rest being Andrew Oldcorn , Stephen McAllister , bill Longmuir and ross Drumond .
access is free of charge , and car parking costs a car with one passenger GBP 5 and GBP 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds go to the charities Probuying Caner UK .
poverty and death in the gold @-@ rich country of Indonesia
when Mr Degei &apos;s dinner is produced , he will not use lead .
he seldom uses even pots .
the Indonesian authorities , in the capital of the Municipality of Papua province Paniai , in the majority of the puppet , place the house turnine in the local language in place in the direct replacement of a bar called &apos; nota &apos; .
in half an hour &apos; time , there will be a fire in a coal sludge , and there will be a lot of skin with unbeating hands .
Degei is sitting from elsewhere on the floor of Peru , he does not have anywhere and , at the same time , he is also doing his daily homework , for example , washing the water of crafts from a nearby sex .
the role of the bridge is being played in an uncovered dose .
as he is the four women of his husband , he has not been allowed to take care of any fields .
Polügaamia is common here on May .
late working may , however , be dangerous for most of the men of the island , and many of them drink hard , and there are still soldiers here .
&quot; no one dares to go around after five o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; he says .
this is a rare pilot in Papua mäki , a former Dutch colony , which was integrated into Indonesia in 1969 following a referendum that created controversy , in which only 1 026 prisoners were forced to vote in front of the forces .
the movement towards a government of Jakarta , which has freed the Dutch people from the rule of law , is rapidly proving to keep the region under strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially split into Pope and Western Pope , so independent Papua New Guinea remained east of the island .
the majority of the wheel is both remote and deserted and , in order to get here , 90 minutes from Jayapuri , the capital of the province , will have to fly to Nabiana and then pass a five @-@ hour journey with a rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city of approximately 19 000 inhabitants is made up of tree beaches surrounded by sembs and covers lainous iron roofs , which have been transformed into a different yoke .
very few indicators have taken the road here , not to mention journalists , nor have there been almost any foreigners here .
prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries , Mee Pago &apos;s boats were marches with a God called Tamee .
there were other changes .
&apos;We were not used to wear such clothes , &apos; says Degei , referring to our colour @-@ handful turbune , the fire on the pluustery and the English .
&quot; before that , we only had a plant cow in the body . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
but it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
just 100 km away from Paniao , a mountainous province with a population of 153 000 in New Jersey , is the largest and most lucrative gold mine in the world , Grasberg , which belongs to the company Freexport McMoran , which operates in Phoenix .
in 2015 alone , Freports extracted approximately USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper .
in addition , it is possible to contend with consumer timber stocks , estimated to be worth USD 78 billion .
however , these riches are a source of suffering for boats , as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Iranian army .
a study from The New York Times in 2005 showed that Freexport paid approximately USD 20 million to local troops and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including USD 150 000 to one of the officers .
Pope attempts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden hall and are routinely betrayed .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the Iranian army .
according to the Asian Committee on Human Rights , the mass killing of the genocide in the mountains of Papua tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide .
last year alone , over 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Colombian police in the region .
the 2016 report of the Grand District of Birsbane , entitled &apos; We shall lose all &apos; , contains testimony to the atrocities committed last year , such as extrajudicial executions , torture ( rape and electric blows are particularly common according to another report ) and brutal repression of peaceful protests .
&quot; it is difficult to summarise the number of victims , as such incidents take place every week , &quot; says Andreas Harsono , a researcher of Human Rights Watch , Indonesia .
the blockade has been lifted even more strongly , as Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demographics are changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the inhabitants of Indonesia , Jaava , Kalimantan , Sumatra and Sulawes .
the white headlines are sold in the open cannabis and with mixed vegetables by gado @-@ gado @-@ gado , which are stolen along with ground level .
they cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started selling chicken and vegetables more cheaply than local boats on the traditional market , &quot; explain the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Italians born in Paniais who worked in Jayapuri , the capital of the province .
&quot; Symama @-@ mama @-@ mama &#91; women &#93; painting boats will therefore lose their market share . &quot;
the President of Indonesia , Joko Widodo , who is known to be among the people as Jokow , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Pope .
the former pump won 27 constituencies , including Paniai , on his way to the presidential Palace of Jakarta .
however , the Pope has changed very little and the local classes feel cheated .
&quot; our hearts have been broken because , in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jokow in the expectation that he would fulfil our hopes of restoring justice , &quot; says apprenticeships .
in fact , only two months after Jokow took office in October , Paniai was in a low position .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the boxes stunned on Christmas when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark .
the children who met told them that they should include the front lights .
according to the words of the local passport , Yavedt Tebai , one of the soldiers insulted their voting tone and returned later with four soldiers .
according to the victims and the spectators , in the run @-@ up to the children were driven by soldiers and beaten by their guns .
then one of the soldiers was shot among children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yulianus Yeimot , was so brutally beaten that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , the building of a close electoral commission was burnt down and things were even more pressing next day .
around 1 000 young people in Papua men , women and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they were wearing cement bulbs and putting forward Papua mee pago trickery waita @-@ tantsu in which poultry songs were buried around and buried .
some protesters started to lecture the police and the military .
&apos;If the crowd is more than three times resistance , let them go down , &apos; according to a formal document , which has been seen by the magazine , but which has not been issued to local media publications .
Kego Koto , the city of Kego Koto , the older city of Yeremias Kayme ( 56 ) , felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking for a crowd to go home .
no one had the will to listen .
&apos;While I was suddenly shot in the left , he said in his magazine at the treasure of a tree in his German colours .
we still do not know who the fire was , but it says that the soldiers &apos; rigs gathered in the month came from .
&apos;There was a lot of people , a great deal of sweat , &apos; he adds &apos; .
the local man , Alfius Youw , was shot three times , saying that he had been shot .
&quot; I would like to wait for him and I went through him as a body to make sure that it is with him , &quot; said the magazine at the moment in Yohanes , who uses only one name as many indicators .
&quot; I saw him dead ... Snovel leen . &quot;
the chief inspector of Papua police , Yotje Mende , said to reporters that he only guaranteed the security of his department because it was attacked .
&quot; we need to defend ourselves when we are threatened to kill , &quot; said Vice @-@ President Pudjo Sulistiyo , the spokesman of Papua police in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protesters were killed and there were many injured .
the news of killings arrived in Jakartail only on the next day .
three weeks later , Jokow Jayapura made a passionate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses to be dealt with in Pope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would introduce an alternative mechanism for dealing with human rights crimes .
but almost immediately the excuses were also followed .
&quot; most crimes happened a long time ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
however , when speaking about the magazine on 5 June in Jakarta , Wiranto withdrew his words by saying that he has no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Pope .
instead , he said &apos; everything will be resolved by law &apos; .
Wiranto , who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Pope , including what happened in Paniai .
the families of the victims of the Paniai have accepted such claims with gloomy mistrust .
&quot; I have been heard four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Yohanes .
&apos;I am tired &apos; .
he says that he is still living in fear years later .
&apos;I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&quot; I fear that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I will be shot . &quot;
he vend Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid of this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after helping to bury four victims .
&quot; after burying the bodies , the army had to look to me , &apos; he says .
the celebrations have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the inhabitants of the village of the Indonesian police were shot in Deiyai , neighbouring Paniai .
one person was killed and 17 wounded , including children , when he went to war between the inhabitants of the villages and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an informed man to hospital .
this man &apos;s population , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ravianus Douw , who drowned into nearby rivers , died on the way to hospital .
the recent inhabitants of villages protested against the company office at the construction site .
according to the police , the inhabitants of the villages were lecturing police officers with stoning , which the latter responded to with alerts .
however , according to local claims , mobile Britons ( the Iranian military police ) started to shoot at the people , killing one person .
&quot; we were in great panic , we are afraid of revenge , &quot; said Assistant Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and saw the insects of those injured .
&quot; I have beaten myself in my house for two days . &quot;
the Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and for the return of the police to the mobile Brigade from the region .
Paniai has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development is feeding the dissatisfaction of honey , moni , dans and dammal tribes living in Papua haljendaeva &apos;s central memory .
many of them have joined the army of Libera Papua rebels ( VPL ) , who claim to defend the rights of boats by orchestrating attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers .
some VPL leaders come from Pania , including Tadius Yog and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
in response to this , over the last few years , under the pretext of &apos; defending national sovereignty &apos; , the army has arrested in Paniai and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them will never appear again .
among other people , Panians are known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty feeds dissatisfaction .
the low rice sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
the Leib is just as unavailable .
people are growing all their food themselves mainly from the Bahá &apos;clock , plus a little fruit and vegetables .
agriculture is the work of women , each of whom can care for four or five base fields .
they usually hold most of the harvest to the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten bases cost only 10 000 sites in Indonesia ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have deepened between heavy boats and new migrants who have arrived in a great deal since the opening of new routes at Nabire airport .
the few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
the Pope himself often lacks the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the village because there are no jobs and no money here , &quot; says John Gobai , President of the Paniai tribal Council .
segregation keeps the eyes of the world out of the Pope .
in addition , strict restrictions remain on foreign media .
French journalists Franck Escudie and Babridge Longchamp were expelled from Pope at the beginning of this year because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they had been given a rare film permit .
according to the Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch , Pcomm Kine , the Vice @-@ President of the Asian department , Mr Jokow &apos;s electoral pledges have not been implemented to lift the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development .
&quot; journalists seeking reports from the most peaceful provinces in Papua ang and from the West Pope in Indonesia face new threats to the rejection and blacklist of Eurodac visas , &quot; said in his statement .
the lack of a press watch means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to Papua near neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries , Liberia , Nauru , Belau , Tupain , Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands , urged the UN Human Rights Council to examine &apos; various large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in Pope , including the shooting of Paniai .
the same countries have historically supported VPL .
Arrmanatha Nasir , the spokesman at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed the charges for the group , saying to the press : &apos; in Indonesia , democratic order and freedom of the press are still in place so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bury &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to be noticed .
when the Dutch official delegation visited Jayapura on 4 May , headed by the human rights Ambassador of the country , Mr Van Bari , the local people interrupted the meeting but , according to the source of anonymous desire to remain silent , urging that &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
new presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019 , but the boats do not believe they will vote again in favour of Jokow .
&quot; Jokow is a man with good intentions , but people around him who are involved in the shooting of Paniai will say Hobai , President of the tribal Council .
he wants to give Jokow an understanding that , apart from the fact that the people of Paniai live under the threat posed by the predatory army , they are struggling with misery due to poor education and health services .
according to Gobai , the people of Paniai , like other boats , regard their voice to Jokow as the debt they have to pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and intimidation , the families of the victims of the Paniai fire were able to cope with the last token opposition to Madagascar , which swept one victim &apos;s body dead into a police station and the army &apos;s response to the land in question .
knowing that justice can never be done , they at least do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Yacobus with a shot .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
needing to swallow Dubai Torch &apos;s pilots for the second time .
on Friday , one of the world &apos;s largest housing storms in Dubai was eaten , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to escape from this 337 metre and 79 regular buildings .
this is the second fire that has been ravaged for just two years by the high hall , which is called the Turin case , the Thuvikur .
the building was evacuated , none of the injuries were reported and no direct fire @-@ related causes were submitted .
&quot; we sleep and waited for the fire sub @-@ prime and people &apos;s fears .
we would wait for the tour down and we had about 10 minutes to get down to 50 order , &apos; said to Reuser a single person who called himself George .
according to Dubai civil protection officers , fire fighters were also deleted at around 4 o &apos;clock in the morning at local time ( 00.00 GMT ) and jailed the building .
the government said they were working to ensure shelter for those affected .
this incident may once again raise questions about the safety of high @-@ level materials used on foreign soil around the world .
during the investigation carried out by the steering Board in Tuch after the fire in 2015 , it was found that the most damage was suffered by Assathians - the decoral panels and insulation of foreign space .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of Tower , the London Grener portfolio , and the Assyrian panels , could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire there in June , which killed around 80 people .
see : these phones are likely to receive sales spots in the autumn
language and coal are the time for technological games , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony XZ Premium came to sale , and new hitt telephones are expected for poelers in the autumn .
according to the Tele2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Semother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by an innovative design , an eye @-@ shandner , a serser @-@ servani 4K resolution , and a fast @-@ track process .
Samsung Galaxy S8 , a great elephant in the technological world , has also reached the top of Estonia &apos;s smartphone sales table .
in the autumn , even more smart calibre , more resilient batteries , a higher quality cameras and greater water and customs security will be allowed .
he added that , on the basis of the rumours , you can already speculate and predict four top models , which are likely to conquer today &apos;s sales tables .
these four smart phone top models will reach pointers in the autumn of this year .
the expected iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach polephants by mid @-@ September .
however , the rumours that the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are spreading greatly .
if iPhone 7 did not lead to significant differences between iPhone 6s , Apple &apos;s 10th birthday is expected to see the new model completely separate from previous ones .
there have been four colours : black , white , rock and chromium .
one of the elements of the new design is probably a screen covering the entire telephone front , a copy has been lost and a fingerprints screen has been built .
the Apple design leader JonyIve demands that the new iPhone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk of an iPhone version .
in addition to the horizon , the unmanageable charging and even higher quality camera can be expected to accelerate the A11 process .
it is certainly one of the most expected smart phones in the year .
the outsourcing of the new model Galaxy hood 8 will start on 23 August .
there have been a lot of rumours about what new Galaxy jet 8 will look like .
Admittedly , even more business users are meant , and S pen allows even greater functionalities .
the Telephone should have two cameras , one of which is a lainurt and one with a narrow view to telescopes .
at the moment , no one knows what the cameras are capable of , but in any case it is the first test of Samsung , which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8 in terms of quality .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August .
although Nokia has sold three smart phones this year with Nokia 6 , their flagship vessel - Nokia 8 - is still missing , which is already being presented on 16 August .
we are waiting for a screen stretching from 5.3 to 5.3 dust and for a fast @-@ track Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processes and a more durable battery .
in the case of Nokia , there is also talk of aluminium corps and significant levels of water and customs security IP68 .
like Samsungone , the new model of Nokia has two queues produced by Zeiss , an optimist .
once the Sony firm flag has been XZ Premium up to now , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smart phones will be added in the near future , with even more innovative functions .
we are waiting for a smartphone that is slightly more modest than XZ Premium , but at least with the same good or better camera .
on the new model of Sony , it has been speculated that its screen is at least hot .
what the reality is , we can already see very soon , as traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flagship ship at the International Technological University IFA , which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year .
according to transcripts leaked by telephone calls , Trump Mexico pressed for payment of the border wall .
the Washington post unveiled telephone calls between US President Donald Trumpi and Mexican and Australian state leaders .
on 27 January , Enrique Pena Nieto , the President of Mexico , travelled to Trump , to end public proclamation that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President stroke with him for his public condemnation of the wall , saying : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the Trump mp set out his presidential campaign &apos;s promise to build a long seller and age on the southern border of the United States that Mexico would pay for this project .
the transcriptors were also published in his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turmes , which reveals a tense debate .
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement whereby the United States takes refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; nervous &apos; and &apos; stupid &apos; , that the agreement that was made during the Obama Government would give it the impression of &apos; lead &apos; , as it has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the Trump ended the speech by telling the Turku that &apos; this was the day &apos;s most unpleasant speech &apos; .
the Supreme Court did not take a complaint with the city of OC MRP in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their offer for bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 2029 .
it is a letter rejecting the supply of Tartu buses and coach procurement in the town of OC MRP , as the offer did not meet the requirements , Mr Anneli Aputin , President of the Tartu City Service , explained .
this is the procurement of public transport within the Tartu city for the period 01.07.2019 @-@ 30.06.2029 .
the city of MRP Lidelegations referred to the Supreme Court of Justice for the decision of the Tartu District Court .
the Supreme Court did not act .
while many people in the social media complain that the clip from the Weekise festival is disrupting their night and the whole city is full of brakes in the run , there are also many who do not have any bad words about a lasting festival .
I am even positively surprised that the brake was so polite in the shop !
I did not see any misgivings or miscourtesy .
even if I saw the Gulf , I will say a nice wave .
&quot; it is nice to come , be and enjoy the joy of a winter that has remained like a winter , &quot; he will gladly add .
the cumbersome wave of rubbish is not destroyed .
if , in the middle city , he still heard that music is being played in the beaches , then now music has not reached his home ethos .
&quot; but I hope I hear , &quot; he will gladly say .
Mrs Agnes , who talked with a study , also says that the Grand Festival is rather good for the skies - it is a great contribution to the turnover of local merchants .
he also welcomes the fact that the summer capital has come to such a large extent .
the woman of family life does not .
although I am no longer on the coast , it is nice that rand has revived .
and it is good that the people are moving , and this has been the case three times , &apos; says a woman .
the first time was probably a little worse .
&apos; then perhaps there were complaints &apos; , he is wondering .
however , what he said is normal for the summer capital cities .
&quot; this Weekise is a very good prophet for our small city , &quot; says Harri , who is hiding in the park .
life and the möll have also not put his life in the breath .
but for goodness ?
we should all pull together .
think about how it would be better to communicate between nations .
after all , the music man does not appear .
this does not happen , although I live near there .
&apos;Well people can save and there is no pause &apos; , he says .
visitors who come to the skies are , he said , courtesy .
&quot; they have , of course , joined them a little , but young people are young people and motherhood and God - give us a hand , but be people and we can do it ! &quot;
decent residents have travelled to somewhere by then , either to relatives or to acquaintances .
&quot; however , overall , the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this medal , &quot; says Persian as a Tiina with children .
his family &apos;s und Festival also does not disturb , although last year it was even further removed from the street .
last summer , we heard more .
we live outside the city that it actually goes far beyond the coast of the Persian river , &apos; he talks .
Pearson cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revive business
the British educational company Pearson said on Friday that it will cut 3 000 more jobs and reduce its interim dividends by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with the threat of business .
these jobs , which , according to John Fallon , are likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will be added to the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring .
Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs under the third cost reduction programme by another GBP 300 million ( USD 394 million ) to try to revive a business that has been hit by the transition to high @-@ speed digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell last month &apos;s participation in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann , said that their expectation for a year had not changed since the sales income increase was announced to GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year .
on Sunday , the rainy season continues to sow .
in Estonia , on Sunday , the sun with rainfall comes from the sun , with wind outbreaks at times very strong .
the Ecolabel is coming to light in Estonia with explanations .
on several sides , there is an aberration , there may be a drawback .
it is between 5 and 11 , an outbreak of up to 14 , islands and coasts up to 18 m .
air temperatures are 13 @-@ 17 degrees .
the day comes with a mixed picture .
on several sides , there is a hurry , there are possible settings .
the south @-@ west wind is between 6 and 12 , an outbreak of up to 15 , islands and coasts up to 20 m / s .
air temperatures are between 18 and 21 degrees .
attack in Kabul : suicide attack killed by NATO soldier
the suicide bomber , according to officials , attacked military convoys in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul , killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others .
in NATO &apos;s statement , five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to local reports , three civilians were killed in a incident in the town of Qarabaghi .
this bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month , with more than 30 people killed in the Herati mosque attack on Tuesday .
on Monday two people were killed near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul .
NATO &apos;s statement said that there was an explosion on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked &apos; by man @-@ made explosive body &apos; .
according to the statement , everything has been injured in a stable state and is treated in the US military hospital in Bagram airport .
according to the Correspondents , the Taliban and group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( Mexico ) , are a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabagh in Baghdad , NATO .
according to the UN , at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which nearly 20 % in the capital city .
at the end of July , the car bomb in Kabul mainly killed at least 30 people in the Shi &apos;F .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed in central city by a major bomb attack , which has led to the most deaths in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country &apos;s military and police forces .
according to the correspondent reports , the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf Ghan .
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the regulation after sharks
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency ) annulled the decision to delay the implementation of the Obama Regulation , which obliges states to limit emissions from the summer , one day after 15 states referred the Agency to court for this move .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday with the designation procedures for the &quot; Main content &quot; of 2015 , saying that it demonstrates the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage in dialogue and listen to our national partners , &quot; said Scott Pruitt , the head of the EPA , in a statement .
the Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the level of shareholder content in its various parts of the country to measure pollution in order to determine where its level of compliance with the highest air quality standard would have to be reduced by one year until 16 in 2018 .
15 main democratic states , together with the Colombian community , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President Donald Trumpi &apos;s government has tried to bring back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to the Trumpi , is part of a broader agenda for growth .
however , these efforts have provoked reactions among the democrats and nature conservation groups , who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that the breathing of ozone @-@ containing air &apos; may reduce the employability of Copts and increase the risk of disease in respiratory diseases &apos; , such as asthma .
German cigarettes can come from pigs .
German pigs and cattle can come with pipes , as heavy rain threatens the European Union &apos;s second largest wheat producer , writes Banimal berg .
this year , it can be said that the centuries of saturation before harvesting may mean that fruit intended for bread production can only be fed to animals .
&quot; the quality of wheat is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said Agravis Raiffeisen &apos;s analysis of Bernhard Nepal .
this year , up to 40 % of German nightmare for animal feed , which is from mill to business as usual , is forecast in Agratis .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have been exposed to any weather this year .
first of all , the winter was too dry .
then came the cold spring , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
in July , Germany was hit by the drama , which has continued in August .
many eyes have been turned to northern Germany , where the rain hinders harvesting .
so far , only five per cent of nicotine has been repeated .
most of the region has not yet recovered , notified the local buyer of the harvest in Ceravis .
&apos;These are quite difficult days &apos; , the senior trader in Ceravis , Frank Deckert Rendsburg , said .
Compliance in everything , i.e. the rocks of the internal design of Finns
nature plays its part in the internight of mesh homes because , through large windows , the equated views of Saimaa fishers reach many ( life ) rooms .
every step will be marked by our attempts by our northern neighbours to create both shellfish and perfect ( energy @-@ saving ) homes .
the ability of Finns to use wood as construction and processing materials , furniture and beauty is also worthy of deforestation and compliance .
Virgling techniques and smart solutions can be found in mesh houses both as a builder and ( home ) architects .
it is clear there that black , white and grey collections , if they are supplemented by wood tones and topipes , may be very desperate .
good ideas can go on a week later , because the Fair will run until 13 August .
Tarvians and spices suggest that this kitchen is often copied .
the Ööl adopted today &apos;s line for Weekise Festival Balticen , and Martin Garrido did his utmost to remember the last speaker .
the people were truly in the middle of Mr Battisti &apos;s speech - a song , a humble , a dance of self @-@ interest .
when Zapata ended , a common mastery of the dust of Persian was dispersed from the city .
we will bring you to the gallery , where there are all the pictures that our photograaf tried on Weekise for three days .
you are certainly also some of them , you are looking for yourself !
Msole y Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
Mr Vasyl Lomachenko and Mr Garcia , who should be on the brink of collision in order to face up to 66.7 kg in the most attractive poker in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were at the second end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenkot , World Boavier Council , in the presence of ESPN , in Lgeles Angeles , until Garcia , the unwinning World Boassies Council , to the other end of the day , to welcome the Lomachenkot , the World BoThurszationi sulgweight cheque .
following the unanimous decision of Garcia , the victory of the former four @-@ time world champion , Adrien Broner , on Saturday in Show157 , both combatants belong to the top of the table .
Garcia extended his hand better and said , &apos; How does the summer go , cheempion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
Lomachenko is defending his belts against Miguel Marriv on Saturday evening at 19 ESPN .
when a few photographs were found , Lomachenko &apos;s memory nejer Egis Klimas stated that a possible confrontation between the militants would be &apos; perfect measure &apos; .
&quot; I am a former consultant , &quot; said Garcia .
&quot; I called for Broner &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small about 63.5 kg .
I want to move downwards .
and he must move up to half the weight &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the Fans have asked for this .
let us then help them to do so . &quot;
Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
in the climate , the question was whether it should be worthwhile to look at it , and this is part of his strategy to allow Lomachenkol to debate the end of this year at 61.2 kg in the class to make it possible for next summer to meet with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 novans ) , who also has an interest in combating Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbelli &apos;s match match after their lighter celebrations on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as fans have called for this opposition , &quot; said Garcia later , saying that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial package .
&quot; we are the key players .
no other name can attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Garcia said that he considered Lomachenkot as a &apos; force fighters &apos; and could go to his Saturday match .
however , Mr Lomachenko was modest in praising Mrs Garcia , saying that she felt that the three divisjon champions from Riverpool were &apos; very slow ; sorry , Maey ... you wanted this nodistant &apos; .
according to Garcia , the aim was to show the strength of the blows and then to bow .
both confirmed that they felt that the tension between them is increasing in order to reach a challenge .
&quot; this is a fight that awaits realisation .
no other confrontation arouses so much attention and slander .
I am more than willing to work on this , &apos; said Garcia .
Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best combatants , and Maey is precisely that .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
what world events are being moved to Estonia ?
soil was extended and issued by the police and border control authority ( PPA ) record more than 13 000 residence permits to third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work , study or family .
when , for example , a fixed @-@ term residence permit was decided to be issued to 6702 foreigners , the number of Italians was 4928 .
the agencies cannot say how many migrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia , but such an analysis will be drawn up by the Ministry of the Interior .
when nearly 500 Ukrainians were home to Estonia ten years ago , in recent years , this figure will close to 2 000 .
the number of applicants for a residence permit rose dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis , with 1087 people receiving fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , up from 675 in the previous year .
according to the statistical authority , the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing most in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than left .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has always been big in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already facing , &quot; said Kristin Rammus , the spokesman at the Ministry of the Interior .
the number of long @-@ term resident Ukrainians , even higher than the number of Russian citizens , had been granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit , even though in 10 years the longest @-@ term residence permits have been issued to the latter .
if the Ukrainians come to work mainly here , then Russian citizens for family migration .
&quot; given the historic Russian community here , they are more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said Helina Meing , an internal protection institute .
&apos;When you look at where the citizens of Russia who have been granted Estonian residence permit have moved to live , Harjumaa is now Eastern Viruland &apos; , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them have been married with a citizen of the European Union .
soil was granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased .
&quot; compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested for Estonia to be established permanently , &quot; the spokesperson at the Ministry of the Interior , Mr Rammus , explained that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia &apos;s residence permit has remained more stable for years .
the new residence permit for permanent entry into Estonia will allow foreigners who have lived here for at least three years to apply for the previous year .
it aims to encourage the emancipation of people who have been adapted .
however , a long @-@ term resident residence permit requires five years , for example .
for the new residence permit , the extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased .
for example , soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to change their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be able to point the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit was popular at the same time as the holders of a bad passport ( 1029 ) , Russians ( 487 ) , Indians ( 54 ) and nigerans ( 36 ) .
a total of 1968 people were able to live in Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese .
with the first half of this year , the total number of such applicants is already 1269 .
in 10 years , surprisingly Nigeria has become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence .
when three residence permits were issued to Finns in 2007 , soil was 200 .
Nigeria is coming to learn from this university .
higher education institutions in Estonia are also popular , for example , among Georgians , the Chinese and the Turks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely thanks to learning games .
for them , too , the rule applies that , where the community has come forward , there will be others more easily , &apos; added Ramallah .
in ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , just as much from Laos and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four Uruguay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit per year , this is about 0.46 % of the total population .
even if you look at the citizens of the European Union , migration will remain around a percentage , &quot; the Netherlands commented that the figures are actually low .
in total , 14 822 people died in Estonia , according to the statistical office , 13 792 .
this means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration .
most of those who move are Estonian citizens , but there are more of them among those who leave .
therefore , Estonian citizens &apos; migration balance with 2 000 people was in decline .
Estonians in particular migrate between Finland and Estonia .
Mlong Couture Princssimood of Couture tricks with sats , chickens and tweed .
however , there is a history for Maria Tammeoru - old paints and defendants : &apos; I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire the thieves and crats of the old era .
if you go a long way , you will study and learn more about it every day .
this is a joy of discovery !
the world of Mouture Couture can look like some living alien , but the designer does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much you are in your life !
as a friend , I have a whole sail full of the wounds of couture that I have created .
because , and it is not his fault that he does not live in Hollywoos and does not go on a red bed every day , he wants to wear the most beautiful brokers , and he is suffering !
you can live your own life special !
the artist does not recognise the gap between the shining events and the grey day .
it was this reasoning that put the rolling stock into the countryside , between forests and fields in Estonia , into people who often do not reach the mood .
for example , a collegium was presented in comparison , Jevenvis and Perlo moealleel , where 45 modelli Royal defilee filled the entire street .
in Tallinn , there is often a hang in the shop , there is a stir of dignity , but there is more emotion elsewhere - slogvo , rising up , you want to be thanked .
a large proportion of the audience had to be heard just now , but now they are the fans of Mouture .
if you overshoot people &apos;s expectations , they are spirited !
and I like the feeling that I am with my motive like the summer .
Pernus had a 50 @-@ metre red carpet , a whole @-@ way street full of stickers , it seemed that they would not come to an end !
Mrs Maria also does not recognise the motive that animal creation must be presented by a superstar , she is happy to bring ordinary women .
I often invite my own customers - they have always come with pleasure .
after all , this is the lax of experience , the island of the ice curtain in a wonderful knife !
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own performances , I am always behind the ground to give things the last meat as a hopeless player .
my nervous would not allow a calm look on the floor .
Mrs Maria is this type of moelogy , who wants not only to play a representative role , but to be involved in everything .
I have my sister in the wind , most of the collections I myself carry out .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to find out .
I am never far from my nature and I am not afraid of work .
it is not limited , it is also a matter of injection , logistics , organisation , organisation - everyone has to jump off the day of a woman of one temperate .
for these hours of work , fanatics are still suffering enormously .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a happy day !
I am still very lucky - it is like an unstoppable joke : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compliments .
it has been said many times that in my brokers there is a magy - they make themselves feel like a printing tail .
the guerrilous treasure that Maria talent made known overnight has long since remained a Couture signal to date .
Martin Myrsep U18 boys : weapons of alagrupiturnipe for Estonians were now turned against us .
the damage , the fairytale , ran out .
the first thing was that we could not get in our hands .
and when there is such a big difference in the table , there is nothing to do &apos; , Estonia commented on U18 corvpallipots 61 : 75 falling to Britain , our only corvpalte , BC Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsel .
opponents took 28 Palace from the tsunami and were so much more assaulted as a result .
we were also not prepared to protect them aggressively , nor to attack them ; it created it .
many of the attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
in defence , however , they managed to keep their hands in hand everywhere , we could not combine .
it created the team from its feet .
the work of the opponents was better done .
according to Myrsepa &apos;s estimates , Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to withdraw the anti @-@ missile season .
the last quarter - we had zero error , but the opponents have already received a number of quick records .
Inadmissibility and a heavy offensive , which was our weapon on the alagrupiturnir , all now turned against us .
today we did not have the strength against their aggressive behaviour .
the Myrhint remained satisfied with his negligent Kalevis , Matthias Tass .
security in general can say good words about the whole team , so far there was a single shock .
it is a pity that such an aggressive response had not been met before .
Tass has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but it seemed that he was tired - he has borne quite a heavy burden .
but he made some quite nice gestures , which I have seen in the past in the trenches , adding a mentor .
horrendous figures : the EM @-@ turnir , in the corvpallition of neps , threw less than 10 points ...
the U18 age classes do not apply only to the young men &apos;s emi B @-@ divisjon corvpalliturniir in Tallinn , who started in Dublin the day after yesterday .
and Estonia &apos;s game with Poland was , unfortunately , in the area of anti @-@ queues .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , there was 9 : 49 , or only in the last ten minutes , opponents took their feet from the gas beet and 16 : 16 .
in both the first and the second quarter , Estonia dumped 4 , third point 1 ...
at the same time , in the first two minutes , two pieces were caught by the Estonians in the first two minutes , but then 25 pieces of play , then one yellow , and then another 21 tears ...
perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 fingers were taboo .
in addition , 2 points came from four free wavelengths .
the losses were a reasonable figure of this time , 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland had 33 finalists and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , while on the opening day , 83 Portuguese people had to be admitted : 56 .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement the stocks
today , NATO &apos;s 1 permanent mine group arrived for a weekend in Tallinn for a planned port visit in order to supplement vessels &apos; stocks and prepare for prospective practices .
during the visit , ships are preparing for the landing of the sea and , at the same time , giving crews the possibility of a parogue holiday .
following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in the waters of Estonia in order to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations in search of historic explosive remnants .
&quot; the participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the co @-@ operative training they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the allied forces , &quot; said Arto Reinland , the chief of the Operation and Planning Department in the Commander of the overseas fleet .
since 29 June , NATO will head a permanent delegation of mines from the Latvian Navy Captain , Gvido Laudups , who took over the tasks of the group at a ceremony in Riga from the Estonian naval officers Johan @-@ Elias Seljab .
the group &apos;s flagship ship is LVNS Virsaitis , a Latvian naval support vessel , which also operates as a group leader .
this semester , too , includes the Estonian navy &apos;s mine hunt and Sakharov .
as one of the four groups of vessels subject to the NATO naval board , NATO is the 1 permanent mine group of primary rapid reaction teams , which may be sent to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - On 13 August , the Pirita monastery &apos;s mutuaries will once again become a place where Birgitta Festival , launched 13 years ago by Maestro Eri KChildren , will be held down .
this year , Birgitta Festival will be a beautiful , powerful and unprecedented , according to the artistic leader of the city of Talharonia , Mr Joosti ( 36 ) .
risk to Joost : the &apos; Traviita &apos; and &apos; Tosca &apos; classroom , balletilareplies from Bolerost , &apos; Karlssonin &apos; , and there is also no shortage of own production of the scheme , this time Joseph Haydn &apos;s wonderful orchestra &apos; , by the same international team of creators who brought him to the Piriylah in 2015 .
Birgitta Festival has much more than just concerts and theatre answers .
this is higher than any music theatre in its normal form .
it is a festival whose snow takes power and never gets rid of it .
because the experience that the listener receives in this superior and salvable environment puts human souls ringing and touches on human beings in a way that cannot be described .
risk , you are the first anniversary of Birgitta Festival &apos;s art leader .
did the Maestro Eri KChildren &apos;s shoes not feel a little big ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been very helpful .
he went through me all my student career and also supported the restoration career at the beginning .
perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work .
in Klas , the team of Birgitta Festival has had so much charity and , of course , all of this goes to me .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going .
it was precisely the great heart of Eri Kars that gave me the strength to go ahead very well with Birgitta Festival in Tallinn .
and here I am and I can do it !
what could the audience at today &apos;s festival become , what are you offering in particular ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , as a surprise , the first ballett written on by Mrs Lindgreni comes to presentation , among other things .
it is &apos; Karlsson lb &apos; .
and one criminal nuance of this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer , Juris Karlinning , who himself expressed a desire to write this act .
apparently she has already had a carature of Karlsson , who has already lived in the breath of her child .
at the risk , how are you cheering all of this ?
it is certainly thanks to my life partners who support me .
such work requires a system of support and a lot of love , and I am lucky to have it .
and I have noticed that my personal emotion does not depend so much on other people as I myself , in other words , how I am going against every new day .
and this awareness of keeping the tone , keeping it positive and actually smiling ourselves into the mirror of the morning has greatly increased my happy percentage .
especially now this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen on it and it works .
naming itself acts as an act of amusing and raising the tone .
that is simply not a word .
I think people are not yet aware of the body that the universe offers them , but each of them will discover it slowly .
now , this is an important moment .
is there also a ritual before the dirigendi powder is taken ?
there are still , clothing must be replaced against more comfortable ones .
this is a small moment for ourselves .
but , generally speaking , I do not have the opportunity to pump or make a small straw before I speak .
in fact , I even like to talk actively to people , even before dirigendium takes place .
but come to Birgitta Festival , what is also to be discovered here is not a particularly big operator and a ballet friend .
see a stark video with the risk to Joostiga !
new results of tests on the age of Swedish asylum applicants have been published
in Sweden , the latest results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the constitutions were assessed older than 18 , but not all believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for medicine ( Rasytsmutilation inalverket ) started with tests at the beginning of this year .
the tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of the age during the asylum application after the Swedish Authority for Migration ( IOM ) criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly juvenile refugees .
up to now , 68 880 cases have been sent to the tests by migver and 24 81 tests have been issued by the Institute for Justice between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July 2017 .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 years old or older , and in 25 more cases , the Institute of Justice assessed that the test &quot; may be 18 years old . &quot;
in 432 cases , it was concluded that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
tests will only be used if the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Göransson , who works in the Institute of Justice , the results are consistent compared with those of previous months .
&quot; we do not see a big difference compared to the statistics of previous months , the figures are quite consistent , &quot; he said to the newspaper The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have chosen their age .
the Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that , in 442 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person studied is 18 years old or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson ska Dagbladet examined the results of their 581 test , it became clear that in 243 cases , a person had declared directly that he would receive 18 this year .
this medical age assessment method , whereby smart therapeutic röntgeniters and fields MRT are carried out , has been criticised in some quarters .
one of the sceptics is the endokrinologist of the Karolinska Institute , Claude Marcus , whose tasks include assessing people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through the audience sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement method currently being used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say firmly , we should not pretend to be able , &apos; he said forestry to the newspaper .
but Johan Göransson , from the Institute for medicine , defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that the risk of leaving the child inappropriately into adulthood is low .
the biggest risk , or around 10 % , is if you are a little under 18 . &quot;
9 indications that you could forgive you more dearly .
you were more expensive on Friday and spent a night with someone else .
the summer is painful , because you have so many nice times and memories together .
I would like to forgive him , but is it time ...
Your Tango lists nine signs which show that you regret and can forgive him more expensive .
it seems more expensive to understand the seriousness of the situation and to work hard to resolve it .
it is more expensive to deal with the problem that led it to a second @-@ hand bed bed .
pay is no longer in a defensive position .
he sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for his actions .
he is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
he agrees that he has made a serious mistake and genuinely tries to improve the situation .
he is attentive and he is trying to communicate with you with pleasure .
at the same time , without pressure , he is rushing to get you through .
they are not denying what has happened , nor are they trying to make it unnoticed .
it is more expensive for you and for you to understand why your intransigence came about .
you talk about this , and also about how to avoid it in the future .
you need to communicate better and assess each other &apos;s needs .
your more expensive attitude and actions have helped you to develop our condolences against his miscarriage .
a more expensive commitment and behaviour have created the basis for your proximity to be restored .
you have made progress as a couple to believe again in your unity and your relationship .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old newer , Anna Maria Orel , made a beautiful debate in London with 67.37 places of good 18 .
after that , MM noorim was a female jungle , and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for medals in the future .
the contest went well and gained a good experience .
with the first test ( 64.80 ) , I immediately took advantage of my average result , the second ( 62.80 ) risk too much and the third ( 67.37 ) I was able to keep it very clear , &quot; said Orel after the contest .
I chose my emissions , and I am very pleased that I found it .
Anna Maria Oreli MM &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 seats .
Vihmasadu Orelit did not mix because he is after all training him through the TEC stage .
&apos;I am afraid &apos; , he said a little bit more .
the London Olympic Games had almost a full house of the people , did Orel have people around themselves , or were they able to turn themselves off ?
I was Mr Tajani , but in a positive sense .
everyone says it adds - that is the case !
if you compete yourself , you can experience it .
he then confirmed that he will be satisfied with the MM debate and he is still waiting for a lot of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 32nd outcome of this season , the last outcome of which is the last one , I finished in 18 places .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and Mil - that is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of the medals .
Western Virgina kuberner announced party change
the Western Virginia Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President Trumpa , that he would change political parties .
&apos;Let it or not , but the democrats walked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I say to you , having thanked you hard and thought for ... today , I say to you , the West must , that I can no longer help you as a democratic Governor . &quot;
explanations of joy were grubbed in the mixing .
so I will be Republican , &apos; added Justice &apos; tomorrow .
&quot; as a engineer , I would say to you that it is time to play another game . &quot;
the Trump had previously promised a big announcement at the gathering of Western Virginia .
Trump won 42 points in Western Virginia and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats , Hillary Clinton .
Justice , which is the only billion star in the state , according to Forterford , was elected in 2016 .
Ford notes that it has coal mines in five states and that it has a coal business from its own father .
his value is approximately USD 1.59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday evening , the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) published a statement that &apos; Governor Justice &apos;s party exchange is yet another blow to a democratic parade that would prevent the country from improving again rather than working for it &apos; .
&apos;A mere 15 months of enquiry and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent wake @-@ up to a parade that is out of the beginning and cannot find a positive and united message , &apos; said RNC representation , Ronna McDaniel CBS Newsi in his statement .
it is hardly surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
Urmet , who is in the medical tent on the Weekise , told the girl yesterday that posters had had to be distributed quite a lot .
Vills and marbles are fundamental , excuses and light crashes .
of course , also the main , absentia and footwear .
according to Urmeti , visitors come to the festival with false footwear , and so there are problems .
the media have also had to help a few visitors with major injuries - there have been some scaremongering and also one piece of footwear .
we have also made crèches when someone has pulled the hand or the finger .
we are doing less here , we are sending a hospital more .
see the video as to whether the brakes on the media for the treatment of potablet are also asking for a painkiller .
Coe praised the Russians for their fair apologies for the anti @-@ doping scandal .
the international rally of the Kergean , Sebastian Coe , praised , according to his words , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apology &apos; for the doping scandal , but repeated that now is not the time to allow sport back to the country .
at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup , the Russian frivolous compound , Dmitry Shylithtin , said that the competition ban imposed on his country was right and has a firm aim to combat doping .
he apologised &apos; from all lighters who have been cut off the golden and silver medals in competitions &apos; .
despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on competition in force since the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) report found evidence of state @-@ sponsored doping in Russia in November 2015 .
&quot; I think it was a very honest response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IAAF President Costa to journalists .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself acknowledged that they had had had rather difficult times and that they are doing their utmost to reform the alunion . &quot;
he was also pleased , according to Coe , that Russia accepted the criteria for its own reinstatement .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the proposal of the working group that this is not the time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; we must do everything possible in the next few months to normalise the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean sportspeople from the system that has been breached , &quot; he added .
Eighteen Russian lighters who meet the strict criteria of IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World Cup in London on Friday .
on Monday , Rune Andersson , head of the IAAF Group , said that Russia did not yet meet several criteria for reinstatement .
following a presentation to the IAAF Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that trained engineers who have been banned are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution makes a significant difference to the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
little because the electric car revolution makes a significant difference from the fuel market to infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market .
although mining giants like Glencore can say that they will win from one place and lose another , smaller mining companies will not help .
Glencore coal and oil are currently serving , but in the era of electric cars , the demand for cobalt , lithium , copper , aluminium and nickel will increase .
this year , governments in the United Kingdom , France and Norway have contributed to the proliferation of electric cars , which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades .
therefore , Volvo has already known that he is planning to abandon an internal combustion engine , and Tesla is bringing cheaper bread 3 electric cars onto the market .
Banimal berg New Energy Finance forecasts predict that over two decades electric cars will be sold more than cars using oil @-@ produced fuels .
&quot; with regard to some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Simona Gambranin Beeberg , Capital Economics &apos;s raw material analysis .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium , which have been growing demand for years .
electric cars have approximately three times more copies than the conventional car , declaring Glencore .
even more answers are needed at charging stations , which is why Exane BNP Paris estimates that it will increase demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for lithium , cobalt , graphite and manganans .
Glencore will benefit from a growing trend in the price of electric cars and from the fact that there is the largest cobalt producer in the world , predicted by the Jeffitative Group .
according to this broker company , the winners of the second electric car race are Freexport @-@ McMoRan and First Quanmas Minerals .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of the London metal stock exchange line has landed .
soil prices were 37 % .
the answer has also been 14 % this year , mainly due to economic growth .
Glencore excise duty rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price rise to the rival Rio Tonip Group , BHP Billitoni and Anglo Guard .
on the side of the losers , lead companies such as Recyhtx and Campine are companies that have to adapt to the new era .
the main end @-@ use of the PL is the batteries supplying the start @-@ up of cars with petrol and diesel engines .
electric cars use flowers .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael Widmer , the Governor of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch , who analysed the metallic market .
the effect of a generous trend in price formation has not yet been noticed .
Plii has been fishing 17 % this year , with it being the best metal in London for the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems for metals in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition , &quot; said Herwig Schmidt , the manufacturer of the metal broker Triland Metals .
if lead demand falls , it will be slow .
this may be the case in about ten years &apos; time .
in the meantime , stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which are often dependent on advanced lead @-@ based batteries at the launch of engines , will be assessed by international lead and by the organisation of inquiry .
light metals such as aluminium are replaced by steel , as a lighter car can go further with less electricity .
this explains an additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes between 2013 and 2016 .
it accounts for 2.7 % of the world &apos;s output of aluminium .
this trend is likely to grow , says Widmer .
Aluminium has reached 13 % this year , as rising demand from car manufacturers has led to market shortages .
steel producers do not .
ak Shalding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce wonderful car lights .
ArcelorMittal is also trying to develop a lighter meltdown from Europe to oppose the minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris &apos;s analysis , Sylvain Brunet .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to plaice .
soil took about half of this precious metal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , announced the metal finer Johnson Matteries .
&quot; many of the raw materials currently facing high demand , such as oil and plate , may not have a high demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard Dahdah .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
Plaatinatmakers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc Grynberg , leader of the Uncore , said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 .
in the 10 @-@ year perspective , the great hope of the Plaatinatatine manufacturers is that Toyota Motors and Hymuni Motosi have been developed on hydrogen @-@ based cars that depend on a plate in order to generate electricity from hydrogen .
so far , however , this technology has not yet commercially justified itself .
&quot; it seems to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Exane BNP from Paris to Brunet .
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July , as the Stuttgart court banned diesel in the home city of Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche .
how financial rules for football affect Neyra &apos;s transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the rampant spending of European football clubs do not prevent the world @-@ wide shift of Neyra from the Spanish football club in the French club Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequence from UEFA , the steering Board , which dominates the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in the market movement of the prestigious League of MeisMinisters , is still ahead of Paris to Saint @-@ GerMay .
the financial rules on fair play ( FFP ) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that the PSG must prove at some point that the transition to Neyra was financed without huge losses .
EUR 222 million ( USD 262 million ) was paid to Barcelona for the fact that the Brazilians were able to buy out of his contract , and the salary of Neyra will reach tens of millions of dollars per year .
here are some financial aspects of moving to the French club of Neyra .
there is no doubt that the PSG will be able to get such money out for the recruitment of Neyra and to include its stars in the cloak , given that the team will be funded by the family governing the Katar power plant .
clubs have been allowed to spend a great deal on recruiting players , but they have to balance this with legal sources of income that enable them to come out of them in football .
FFFP was set up by Michel Platini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs that fall into debt in search of success would actually deal with fraud and risk swindling if banks or owners were to give up support .
from 2011 , the FFP will focus on monitoring these losses instead of the debts of clubs .
this change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 in Chelsea - buying a club with potential and then spending heavily to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of FFP , which runs until 2018 , clubs may suffer losses of up to EUR 30 million .
and despite the fact that Platini was dismissed in 2015 with shame from the presidential office , his successor , Alexander Ceferin , remains committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; FFFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said Andrea Traverso , who is the guardian of UEFA @-@ s FFP last week .
although the PSG tatus for the overpurchase clause in Neyra is one integrated payment , they will be able to distribute this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the agreement .
Mr Neymar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , so it will be possible to demonstrate a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years .
for the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , the PSG , together with Manchester Cityga from Abu Dhabi , received the most severe penalties .
a fine of EUR 60 million was imposed on the PSG ( USD 82 million at the moment ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million , and a club called for the crew of the League of MeisMinisters to be restricted to 21 players during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of the normal 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to overshake the regulatory authorities by exposing their income through companies linked to the owners of the club .
the Katar company may sponsor the PSG , but if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as a formal income .
this was the case in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of Qatar Tourism PSG &apos;s support was blowed up .
it has been said that certain parts of the Flemish PSG service may come from Qatar through contributions from the World Cup Board of 2022 .
however , the PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neyra could become a member of the World Cup and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities are easily able to expose such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to circumvent the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition pro @-@ actively with the PSG .
they talked to The Taliban , provided that their anonymity is guaranteed , because they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PSG .
the latest reports show that the PSG earned more than € 10 million in profits during the 2015 @-@ 2016 season at around € 542.4 million .
data from the last financial year have not yet been published .
the PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have a positive impact on sponsorship transactions , trade and snus .
the club expects an increase of at least 30 % in turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract .
Spain too , having clearly irritated the departure of one of the largest football stars , tried to block the transition of Neyra , claiming that the PSG would breach FP .
&quot; this is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with the club and with the state , &quot; said CoR President Javier Tebas AS to the Spanish newspaper , referring to the fact that the PSG belongs mainly to Qatar .
Arsenal mänejer ArţWenger , a club belonging to the American sports magnage , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights and it has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger on Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to the state , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a major player in the country . &quot;

together with the extension of Christianity &apos;s operational geography , there has also been an increase in the number of people who have earned their place on the plane .

today 50 years ago : the unprecedented storm in Estonia , which was knocking on houses and windows .
this hurricane of the century , which , on 6 and 7 August , caused great damage , particularly to the West , Harjuria and the Black Sea .
in the north @-@ west of Estonia , over 30 m / s were on the wind during these days .
in my old drink in Bavaria , a bottle from a map to another , and a match with the hands to support them .
everything was blind and marvellous , such as the world stage .
Taamal has already lent roofs from houses , in 2002 , a magazine from the old Mrs Linda Kurova Havava was recalled by Estonian nature in an interview .
Linda husband saw his loved treasure collapsed .
but what are you going to do with your hands , where are you going to fight such a storm ?
the sea came under the window , from windows in the water &apos; , Haapsalus Kalda , who lived on the streets , spoke of Mrs Linda then .
the fact that the roads were full and that the operation of the railway station had been flying to 20 @-@ 30 metres , Linda most shark stores , just like next morning .
according to the local authorities , the cages behind Paralepa were lagging behind , some were completely fun , some were boys .
everyone saw very depressing , the storm went through beautiful old trees as ragina and pragmatism like a war .
Western Viruland was not particularly badly affected in August 1967 compared to Western Estonia , but the losses were high there , the Virumaa Official Journal wrote in 2007 .
Haapsalu Lfossil Park and Padise Park were swept away from the ground , but our cabin parks were also severely affected .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured at speeds of up to 35 metres per second , or around 130 kilometres per hour .
in Tallinn , Meriexpression , on the evening of 6.August , one of the few lead cats had shouted : &apos; mother , mother !
the channel is in the air and will no longer be signed ! &quot; wrote Virumaa Journal .
at the time of the storm , the Building of the generation in Viljandiland was so terrified that it was subsequently decided to be dismantled .
the August pipeline was not opposed to the design of the Türi &apos;s ski mountains , which were later not restored .
on 12 August 1957 , the newspaper Red Turot wrote that the restoration of towns and settlements from landlocked trees and their vehicles is progressing slowly , and the population could be involved in corrogation works .
crops were also severely affected in Turin , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party organisations must be an incentive and a guideline for both corps and fertility harvests &apos; .
Orkades can be talked about if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s .
the watershed wind in Estonia will remain on 2 November 1969 , when Ruhnul was measured at 48 m / s .
the island of Vaindstory broke a metre , so it was not possible to register exactly the speed of the strong wind that was measured .
secret of holiday beaches : night cleaning and poor coastal weather
cold summer weather also means less corrotation in the beaches of Tallinn .
&apos;If there is no , people are on the coast and , if not , there are no people &apos; , there is a cormander .
in the Stroom of the city of Northern Tallinn , the cameras are predatory .
they are offered by a mechanical tractor on low turns of competition , which is falling behind the platinum .
in fact , the last seven @-@ cent goes through the depths , picking it out of sea litter and people &apos;s shelved risk : bottles , cigarettes and so on .
people are still coming to rank , regardless of whether the water is warm or not .
if it is beautiful , then people are on the coast , and if there are no people , then there are no people , &apos; the management of the private company Haabersti will be said by Alexander Usov , the head of the corrogation works .
there are 6.30 p.m. , and there is a bitter hole on the coast , because at 8 o &apos;clock a plate must be in order for the people .
it is already at four o &apos;clock .
apart from Stroom , he is still keeping an eye on the coast of Pirita , Harku Lake , Kakumäe and Palaraare Pikakari .
landfill amounts have fallen .
years ago , it was much more .
people can now already assess what is being done for them , &quot; says Usov , who has harvested the migrants for 15 years .
before it was the case that , when something new was defeated , it had already been broken next day .
now , what is on the coast is already being kept .
price of clean beach
one of the biggest works in the Estonian beaches is the repetition of the rubbish , known as adru .
for example , on the coast of Pirita , 400 000 tonnes have to be shipped from this coastal season .
&apos;This is an incredible amount &apos; , marks Usov .
another large category is municipal waste , that is , all that people are leaving behind .
there are eight large @-@ scale rubbish seiners at a semi @-@ kilometre in Stroom , which need to be empted three times a week .
so much is created by rubbish .
however , cold summer weather has meant that rubbish is a fifth less than otherwise .
the third species are abandoned .
these are mostly children &apos;s TV spots .
this time , Usov has pulled out of the sand ten metres of sludge .
they remain waiting for owners to go down the underground wood route .
&quot; they usually come out more , but this is normal harvests , &quot; and it is already well known that it will soon find them again in the sand .
children come to rank and take toys to burn them into the sand again .
landfill is broken down
Erika Scholler , the spokesman for administrative services , admitted that the work of the tractor is disrupting local life .
noise , which runs from night to night hours , is disrupting the people living in the neighbourhood .
on the day , however , this work is impossible .
in one month , the rand has to go through twice .
&quot; if we do not do so , we will be fined by the urban section , &quot; Scholler notes .
however , like Pirita , Pikakari and Persian , the aim is to get Stroom rand below the quality of the international flag .
&quot; compared to Europe , there is much more work in Estonia to care for beaches , &quot; says Scholler .
we have more adru , more kids and more difficult to go to the sand .
but there is less rubbish in our beaches than elsewhere in Europe .
when we hear that there is talk of rubbish , Martin , living near Stroom beaches , takes an unsolicited interlocutor of journalists and corrogation workers , highlighting current weaknesses .
there is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is with birds and wood slaves , who have pulled the rubbish bags down &apos; , Martin says .
although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the rubbish and , for example , put them on the roofs in order to prevent at least birds from going on there .
in general , however , Martin Stroom &apos;s beaches is satisfied with developments .
we can see that the city is taking care of this .
it has become more pleasant with children &apos;s fields , enlightened and newly asphalt roads .
it was once the case that only one way could be travelled on the ground , &quot; Martin notes .
findings of the village in Stroomis : coins , only coins
a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Dimitri , who , as a arbiter , is sailing the coastline with a metal metal metal , has had to be exploited .
he does not believe that , today or in the future , he will find anything worthwhile .
sea angels are not generous enough to do so .
&quot; I have been working on this for one year and I have not found anything worthwhile so far , &quot; says Dmitry .
as a refrigeration , in Dmitry , there are some euro coins , bottles and also dangerous pounds in the Municipality of Dmitry , which are later thrown in the dustbin .
normally there are still coins .
&quot; culture , fingers and so on are not usually the case , &quot; says the island &apos;s fuel .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level as weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have softened speculation in relation to the increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain a loophole , as household incomes have put interest rates on hold .
policy makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MPC ) voted 6 : 2 for 0.25 % retention and fewer members this month demand an increase because slow growth has weakened support .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank cut its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also signalled that the increase in rates is necessary to contain inflation from Brexon over the next few years , and that the expected increase in lending costs on the financial markets could be necessary .
Members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package on the economy , which was launched in Brext .
in February , the Bank will put an end to the fixed @-@ term finance scheme , which will provide banks with cheap funding , even though it said that it is now up to GBP 15 billion to go ahead with this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; GDP ( GDP ) will remain gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the near future , as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
as regards the rates , it was reiterated that some &apos; fiscal policy effort &apos; was needed to alleviate inflation , and this &apos; somewhat higher &apos; than is expected in the markets .
the Eurostars is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any benefit is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
the forecast for 1.8 % growth in 2018 remained .
after this news , the pound fell against the dollar and the euro .
women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.31 and 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to growing hopes of an increase in the GDP ratio from 0.2 % in the second quarter to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will start to boost a little .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice households suffering from rising inflation and abject wage increases , saying that the situation will go a little worse before improving .
it was added that monetary policy could not prevent income shocks in the next few years , but a significant recovery is expected towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
the heavy pound also encourages the economy to increase demand for British produce , partly compensating consumers for lower costs .
the decision will come one year after the fall last August at 0.25 % after the shocking EU referendum , which caused a sudden weakening of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to fully breathe life into prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last decision , there was a growing demand for an increase in the rate , as inflation had increased pressure on hard households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected and is expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excess growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak pound .
Andrew Montlake , governor of Coreco mortgages , said : &apos; in view of the recent downturn in exchange rates , the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again , as creditors are losing their jobs and hoping to finish the year in a positive way .
the Böge exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as refinancing , often without service and at a low rate , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
NHS announces HIV medication for 10 000 people in conflict
patients will have access to &apos; transformative &apos; treatment for HIV prevention since September , following the battle against whether the NHS should finance the medicine .
NHS England announced that public health will now make an estimated 10 000 people available for an initial three @-@ year clinical trial - a pre @-@ positioning officer ( PrEP ) - a tablet that is manned before the interim procedure and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people by around 86 % .
the NHS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported the ruling of the Supreme Court last year that the NHS is able to pay for PrEP , despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Simon Ste3.2 , Executive Director of NHS England , welcomed the launch announced on Thursday as &apos; new sweeping intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NAT ) described it as &apos; momentous moment &apos; .
sexual health clinics in London , Bright ton , Manchester , Liverpol and Sheffield are among the first to register people , and in October , there will be further clinics before the programme is introduced anywhere in England by April 2018 .
exposure to HIV infections is a pre @-@ prephylactic ( PrEP ) , which will be taken before the incident in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV to people at risk of infection .
PrEP before taking a break means that there are sufficient quantities of medicines in the human body that prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure .
the right candidates include gay or bisexual men , transgender people and people whose partners are HIV @-@ infected and do not receive treatment .
respondents identify suitable people willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , transgender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate in a local sexual health clinics in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed an agreement to get medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the clinical test aims to assess the true potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who is treated and how it is consumed and implemented in a large cloud .
Steeda said : &apos; this new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and intensify a comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
this is another milestone in the fight against one of mankind &apos;s greatest health problems for more than three decades . &quot;
Deborah gold , Chief Executive of NAT , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
the PrEP , if it is properly targeted at those who need it and belong to risk groups , offers an opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic .
since September , people with a high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool which is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with a partner , thereby improving many lives , through this clinical attempt funded by the NHS .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian Green , Executive Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation , said : &apos; now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is quickly launched and that no member of the HIV risk group is excluded .
now that the PrEP clinical trial has been obtained , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
the Minister for Public Health , Sharon Hodgson , said : &apos; the beginning of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the census of government shoes .
evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will bring us a step closer to full understanding of the advantages of PrEP .
it is now important that a clinical trial is put in place as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV and to move us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.94 compared to € 7.71 in June this year , announced by Elering .
the main cause of the price gap is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , the average electricity price for electricity was EUR 34.33 per megatt hour last month and the price increased by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania the price fell by five percentage points to EUR 36.27 per megavatt hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 34.17 and the Nord Stream systemic price of electricity exchanges was EUR 26.37 per megawatt @-@ hour .
prices rose by 12 and 7 % respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity was moving from 75 % last month to Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine % of the hours between the two countries did not happen next day .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity reached 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the hours were used by all transmission capacity .
according to transactions in the Nasdaq OMX market on the last July trading day , the price of electricity in August could be approximately 34 and EUR 37 per megawatt hour in September .
the price of carbon dioxide , which is affecting the price of electricity production , came up last month and transactions were worth 5.04 @-@ 5.47 per tonne .
living in higher life - half @-@ order and smart designers have turned it into a house for the small Earls Court of Justice .
Joanne Leigh , a former banker who is a passionate building innovator , changed his home of the Grand Knightsbridge in 2014 against the Earls Court Corter .
it is based on the first order of Queen Anne Terţi , and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold the flats has been a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived on much higher soil , together with a former life compass in Knightsbridge , &quot; said Joanne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tantamount to the price I have offered .
I was shown this by the Earls Court Corter and had the same high waves .
I knew about it and I made an offer on the same day . &quot;
since its first visit , this 93 @-@ metre corps has passed a full innovation gap .
at the beginning , it was a sleeping flat and a complex star - a kitchen had to be sleep in order to reach a sleeping pipe ; Joanne wanted to add savings and quasi @-@ order to exploit high levels of talent .
&quot; I wanted high , big windows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he is asking Erfan Azad Notting for the architecture and designer of Duck &amp; shed to take advantage of the 3.8 m ears and to create a home that is not just a development site , but a place where Joanne can live .
it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a quasi @-@ order in which to stand .
the Erfan had to approach things in a creative way .
&quot; Metallconstruction is quite complex , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to reorganise the premises so that they are located on each other , without having to bow to each other .
it was not just about building a platform , but about using steel design to ensure that both the upper and lower space is right . &quot;
this emphasis allowed Mrs Erfani to create two full @-@ blown flats with many dramatic elements in the room .
a half @-@ way street will be opened up from the old @-@ fashioned Retrouvius window to the glaciers &apos; surface .
the golden furniture , silver details and retrospect Serge Mouille &apos;s light highlight the style of space .
the use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre , space and traffic lights .
at both stages of a short corridor , mirrors have been added to enable it to appear longer .
in Knight , the mirror is giving the impression of a second @-@ tup window .
in the course of the exercise , the centrepiece of care for all Joanne &apos;s eating rides and glass requirements is a reflection .
housing is accompanied by a false opportunity to close the vegetables if it is not used , creating a more dense space .
cumulative kitchen is nothing new .
however , with this kitchen , it is a unique fact that this is a type of uprising in the garage .
&quot; it did a little bit of design work , &quot; explains the Black DF , which has been spoiled by Erfan terasastronomy .
&quot; this has a counterweight , which is why it is very simple to reject it . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and maintenance , Joanne now has 16 additional kilometres , an additional sleeping permit and a better corter plan .
after all , what you sell - or what gives value to property - is the words Erfan .
&quot; Kinnisvarrol takes an outdated form of tup and makes calculations based on an area of oil . &quot;
here they have been able to increase surgery , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to the space .
&quot; materials are what you are missing and thus help to create emotional links with your home , &quot; says Erfan .
&apos;You do not love the electricity cables in my seine .
this is important , but it does not make the languages more attractive . &quot;
this shows that a good design and an increased area of land will help to make something amazing about a rather normal coral .
in fact , they may even give rise to a desire not to leave , as happened with Joanne .
the chief figure , Jensen , is Chicago , a pelagic village operating in the pill of Chicago , who is competing with my colleague for his professionalism .
it does not count on anything other than the amount of money that has been earned , but it forgets any ethics .
his wife and his three children only see the man on his property and late night .
in the first part of the film , I find myself in the idea that this is , after all , a version of the business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler &apos;s speech maneer are similar .
what the film goes on , however , the less chaotic element remains , and the moralising intention of film @-@ makers is beginning to appear more and more .
life @-@ changing experience will be the main contractor &apos;s son &apos;s disease .
now there must be a choice between work and family life .
the poet dreaming from the Architetics Office makes father think of the great buildings of Chicago about matters of real importance such as religion , welfare , love ... without even addressing the catastrophe of the twin sectors .
after the third stomach , where the poet opens the eyes of father , there is a feeling that film @-@ makers are certainly driven to meet the target , because even the most stubborn eye @-@ maker is unable to keep tears back in the face of the suffering of a doctor &apos;s cancer poet .
if the poet falls in his house and his situation seems hopeless , the father will finally understand the morality of his work and make good work for the elderly .
now I am lucky in terms of my own layers - if the filter has a suspect , I will reward my sense of vision after a film coffee , if I am wrong , then you can praise the styard for at least one surprise .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ice coffee will be lost - when a husband calls a sick and a man is rushing to the Palace of the corridor in the slow motion .
however , the Poeg has been amazing , and although his father has just lost his job , it will prove to be positive , because now it is time to deal with the family .
I can also feel very well - I can already predict the end of the American drama quite well !
in truth , the film has been well constructed , all the elements needed to do so are there .
you get to the Council , you can laugh , you have good and moral beauty : money is not the most important thing in life .
this film is well introduced by surprise .
the new staff overhead is planning to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly will actually manage this .
in that case , it would be the first .
Politico writes that the new staffing overhead of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President Trumpin , including news , in the hope that it will balance the gap .
here , there is a full report from Josh Dawseyl :
&quot; when John F. Kelly met high officials on his first day of work , the White House revealed a key problem with President Donald Trumpi Valges Main , which he intended to address in the hands of the President Assad .
Mr Kelly told officials that information had to go through him , either on paper or at meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried to do so and have failed to monitor his media consumption .
President Trumpi &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades and , even now that he is in White Mamas , his television observation habits have not gone anywhere .
&quot; when the candidate , Trump , was a pause for dishonest media coverage , to show him that he was also fairly reflected in the publications affecting him , &quot; said Sam Nunberg Politicos in February .
Politico tara Palmer wrote at the time that , according to the six former campaigners , Trumpi Twitter &apos;s behaviour is key to ensuring that his personal media consumption also contains a song of praise . &quot;
good luck .
but the idea that the habits of using Trumpi Twitter have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaigners will know something that the rest of us do not know that the Trumpi bonuses would have been even more heartening without their interventions .
we will probably never be able to know about the shutdown that the Trump did not postal .
if he was helpless , if he could save a few times the wounds , his efforts were worth doing so .
however , no one has been able to prevent Trumpi from constantly creating polemics .
part of the problem is that , in Valges Main , which consists of competing factions , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception , by transferring materials to the TruOlympic Games that support their world views , but which may not always be credible .
Politico , which reflects the whole story , wrote in May the advisers &apos; tendency to feed the President with information of strategic value .
one of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is :
&quot; the current and former Trumpi submits that Trump can react to negative press events , particularly adverse effects on infants , exploding , entrenching their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone gave the President a cheerfully copy of the Internet provocation Charles C. GotNews.com , a website belonging to Johnson , which accused the chief depump of staff , Katie Walshi , of being a white house &apos; source of multiple leaks &apos; .
it is no matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of his admiration , or that he did not provide any specific evidence , or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
the Trump read the article and started to ask for the subject of Wales . &quot;
Goldmacher added that Rob Porter , the then staff chief , Reince Priebus , and Head of the White House , had attempted to establish a system for managing and documenting the documents reaching Trumpin . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader from Prix , but the Trump is still an impulse and his helpless will continue to compete for influence .
these unchanging factors make Mr Kelly &apos;s mission very difficult .
street musicians from abroad will not be allowed to speak .
there are many foreigners in the city centre of Tallinn who are practising foreign affairs .
those with whom the conference came to light acknowledged that they were playing in the old room without the permission of the city government .
we first found three street musicians who had taken the same amount of cocktails with Viru &apos;s gates .
it was clear to see that musicians with cocktails and broken clothes were in absentia , who would be spending one duš marr .
despite the humiliation , the only woman in the company was playing a pariah in acordial , while a man , alongside him , was calling for a gesture in his three faces and the Russians closer .
the third man had sat alongside them in one of his own houses and smoked a cordial self @-@ prepared farce .
their three chambers did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people who have passed .
Mr Bob , who has played with Mr Noemi and the palliates , said that he was beating the streets for both fun and money .
the purpose of the exhibition was to collect ticket costs on a ship travelling to Finland on the same day .
on the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for rotation in the old age , Noemi and Bob were shaking their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stay in one town for more than a day or a few , and in most cases we will be granted a month or something like that .
it makes no sense to pay for this , &quot; explained by Bob .
when we returned to Viru &apos;s gates about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in musicians and are going to go .
this team came to grips with the crosses and bags of Viru Centre in absentia .
three Polish young men were also present on the streets of Viru , one of whom played a fifth , another knife , and the third had even contributed to electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people entertainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and live , &quot; explains the trio pipe Mivosh .
according to Mivoshi , they are aware that there must be permission from the city government to speak .
&quot; of course we do not have it , &quot; he said it joking .
but we hope that , when people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
of course , when the police comes , we go elsewhere , but it must try &apos; , he added .
the Bank of Estonia purchased bonds worth EUR 149 million under the Public Private Company Programme of the Central Banks of the euro area in July , while the Central Bank &apos;s bond portfolio increased to a total of EUR 4.36 billion .
the Central Bank does not provide more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Hardo Hansson , has made it clear in the past that the assets of the central banks of the Eurosystem are covered by three different purchasing programmes : the bonds covered by the financial sector ( VIS ) , property @-@ backed bonds ( ABS ) and public bonds ( PSPP ) .
the Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases reduces the production of low @-@ risk assets and encourages investors to take greater risks .
as a rule , in the framework of the public debt programme , each central bank buys its own government bonds , and the bonds of other countries are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is making so @-@ called &apos; replacement shopping &apos; within the amount allocated to them .
the central banks also shop in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian bank generally buys the bonds of the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds , according to Hansson &apos;s confirmation .
the Estonian bank purchases bonds under the asset buy @-@ up programme as of March 2015 .
in the meantime , Elevate bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian bank will no longer buy bonds around Election from June 2016 .
on behalf of the central banks in the euro area , both Eleven and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds are purchased by the Finnish Central Bank from June .
migrants ignore degrees and return to &apos; millions of business building &apos;
some of the richest owners of the West Midlands have once again found themselves in a fierce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the unelected bureaucrats of the councillor to win back the straw away from their cotton .
migrants have parked their 20 trailers near the streets of Sokerull , who risked a wealth of millions of business .
they have returned , together with the army of horses , children and lorries , after they were shot out there only in May , without letting themselves be confused with the bureaucracies that were complaining of in order to prevent their invasion by the Council .
the active group found a weak place in the limits of protection , turning its vehicles through an unblocked part that was left to the pocket .
the people of Maruangry have been contacted by the Somusulli Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless in dealing with the problem &apos; .
a anonymous resident said : &apos; they copied there on Monday evening after their exclusion from Bentley Heathy , where they were storing furniers .
the Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were delayed and now they are back again .
they came to more yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by finding long barriers to protect his parks .
I live on the street etsbrook , and I am not happy that I must continue to pay a mandate for a total tax if the Council is not even able to block such a thing . &quot;
a local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said : &apos; this is ridiculous ; we have only seen the latter leave these migrants , and a new offensive is already under way .
this time , the number has increased and even the horse has been seen in the grassland . &quot;
&apos;We are aware that in the land near the street etsbrook route , we are working with the Somusull police and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
the gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling the number 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the Weekna festival will also visit , among others , the Minister for Culture , Indrek Saar , who is pleased to have been able to bring real world names to Estonia .
the question as to why the Weekise festival is so important for the Estonians is that it should be asked by all those who enjoy three days at the festival .
however , he will admit that the real players in his area have come to Crete .
&quot; looking at the level of artists that has been able to be brought home to Estonia , the absolute top names of this musical gesture - often not in our hall - are spoken of by the Minister for Culture .
however , which festival are the artists who speak most about Saart ?
I consider myself to be relatively old and , for some old people , one of the most experienced doctors , Armin van Bnewren , who stood up last night .
after all , according to his poster , all of us , at some point , have complicated our own feet , &apos; he says .
however , he also points out a number of names , such as Chainhavens , Deadmau5 , Knifebels .
of course , our own Estonian players too : starting with NOavier P and they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , this well @-@ known concentration of names is very high , &quot; he says .

Audi upgrades up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the midst of criticism by car manufacturers
the day before the Audi announcement , BMW said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of BMW , the company believes that &apos; there are smarter alternatives than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the town of BMW , Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines .
no company described these operations as a call for withdrawal .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
however , nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and could cause asthma .
at the same time , the cost of equipment installed for neutralising emissions from diesel vehicles for the car industry is increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of ringing powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs referring to the problem .
companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen , who was silent on the use of so @-@ called &apos; pedestrian devices &apos; , which allowed emissions to be adapted to regulations when testing a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month a former president of the Audi engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi in Germany was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen when the authorities accused the installation of the audit system in order to evade European emissions requirements , thereby extending the investigation , which was previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Audi in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen , a manufacturer of luxury cars with a disproportionately large proportion of Volkswagen &apos;s profits .
Estonian schools are acquiring EU flags for EUR 20 000 .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency .
a total of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union &apos;s flag will be 570 educational institutions .
flags are intended to be made available in indoor rooms , they must also be carried out in high quality printing techniques with a sense of assurance in indoors , and the ERR news portal will be facilitated .
there is a text on the label : &apos; Kingitus for Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education , or one flag costs EUR 35 .
murder of journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
the workers of the weekly newspaper , Riodoce , usually gather on Wednesday days to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the State of Yaloa , which is sown by organised crime , corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars .
but today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their routine .
two parents &apos; writers are discussing which seems safer : either to bring children to their office , which was the target of the grandiose attack in 2009 , or to leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the leader : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutral &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask reporters to provide the names of each water in every place without needing evidence , enough impressions and inner feelings .
the presence of government or cartels is suspected of drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists alike , of being a scapegoat who makes it dangerous to reflect the chaos that exists in Mexico .
violence is not a wake @-@ up call , and the more the bodies across the country accumulate , the majority of which are journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists , have been killed since the appointment of President Enrique Pena Montreto at least 25 in December 2012 . 589 journalists have been killed in at least seven countries following attacks and threats under public protection and have so far been killed in this year .
the most recent deaths include their editor and source of inspiration , Javier Valdez Cardenas , co @-@ founder of Riodoce .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Valdez wrote one of his many books on drug violence .
his absence gives a deep feeling , even though his presence can be felt anywhere in Uganda Riodoce Building a big picture of Valdez , together with the letter &apos; Justice &apos; , and two reporters from 30nines , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , carries T @-@ shirts , which have been portrayed with his sleep glasses or the face of the amateur attached to him .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death , and Reporters will discuss a common trauma , their nightmare , their dream , their paranoia .
although a separate prosecution service was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been brought to justice by the Committee on the Protection of journalists .
like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime @-@ related murders , the number of which amounts to thousands , the killers of journalists rarely reach justice .
Riodoce &apos;s editorial continues to reflect the violence in your country , even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and justice of murderers , the meeting on security , known as Ibarra , is of little use .
&apos;It is very nice to waste your time in this meeting , &apos; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , you will distrust everyone . &quot;
Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital of the State , Culiacan , on 15 May morning .
he managed to travel just a few quarters before two men stopped his red Toyota Coroles , forcing him to leave the car and shot 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which means &apos; twelfth river &apos; in translation .
an armed man went to the Valdez car and made an accident near it .
Valdez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adults .
the flooded spread freely in Culiacan .
however , there is basically only silence about Valdez .
since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of the United States in January , Your authorisation has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country , as rival monks are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
it does not matter that a person or even a number of people are left behind every day on the streets of your permission , or that the dead are slipped away from the double @-@ fashioned sweets of drug gangs , which are greater than many homes .
let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one cartel is headed by a sea state with valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , the co @-@ founder of Riodoce and the President , IsMay Bojorquez ( 60 ) , feels that he was unable to defend his friend .
he believes that killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
the first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Guzman &apos;s sons on a competing and military cartel with the Sikamehe Damaso Lopez .
this piece of correspondence could have been alluded to by the suspect gangs , who bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newspapers .
another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security after there was a ramp in another newspaper in the same story .
Valdez was legend , both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he existed forever .
he worked in 2003 as a veteranreporter in the Noroeste newspaper when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce , selling 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bojorquez said &apos; It was impossible to deal with the press without touching on the drug problem &apos; .
the newspaper picked up with its courageous and fair publicity , and sales and advertising grew .
Reporters were keen to publish vigorous studies without fear of censorship and readers in a sleep print of which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect .
eight years after Riodoce was founded , the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for his Latin American reports .
in the same year , Valdez &apos;s Committee for the Protection of journalists ( AKK ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow Mexican drug creation wherever it leads .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&apos;I want to live on , &apos; he said by adopting the AKK Prize .
last October , in an interview given to Rompeviento TV , he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Yaloa .
&quot; mayors will accept the challenge of the journalists &apos; office being accompanied by a second chance to play the game .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not say what is going on . &quot;
Riodoce collegiate lonelles Valdez , a joke who roppered like madrus , a friend who divided embryos and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their support to his routine .
he always gave his village a barrel .
he went from the office to El Liberties yabo bar and was always sitting on the same desk .
they are now asking whether his stubbornness became fatal to him .
his death has also cast them in doubt about how best to do his job and stay in life .
&quot; they do not like the rigidity of their women , their children , their legitimate businesses , with their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bojorquez .
the result , even in the best times , is strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination .
trust in your instincts .
if it is a matter of suspiciously , it is a matter of keeping out .
according to the editor of Riodoce , Andres Villarreal , the problem is that &apos; fragrance can be deceived ... and so it was with Javierga &apos; .
he and others say that you no longer have old rules , just as they do not apply in Tamaulik , Veracruz , Guerreros or other states which are home to the toxic composition of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in a space where the Riodoce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only the butterhouse sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in front of the house , two police officers sought a relaxation of 40 degrees .
they were appointed by the government by a more elected Riodoce office in a four @-@ time building in Culiacan &apos;s central neighbourhood .
some reporters wondered half joke whether these police officers were among the 50 % of the police officers who have themselves been discredited by the Governor .
several months have passed since reports have been travelling to mountainous areas where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gangs .
Riodoce &apos;s announcement this week dealt with three main features .
one of them was the murder of former poxlegend Julio füar Chavez venna in Blue aloa .
in addition , they had a revealing story of spending government funds on the town of the Governor .
and a group of people was kidnapped from Culiacan , one of the most expensive restaurants , from the cabinet of the public Prosecutor &apos;s office to the quarter .
there was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened , so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows is a place for drug dealers and public authorities alike .
Reporter learned from public documents that a restaurant was registered to the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( IRP ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
recently , several IRP Governor has been accused of widespread corruption in court cases .
Villarline asked the reporter to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Guzman , who wear the name El Chapo , escaped a military visit .
just a few months earlier , readers would have sought a cocktail in Valdez in order to obtain information on kidnapping from the best sources .
&apos;In the past , we would have known what happened , &apos; said the 46 @-@ year @-@ old Villark , whose body construction has earned him the name El Flaco .
&quot; now all channels of communication have broken down with our sources . &quot;
the Valdez office has become a reservoir to bridges and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the editorial workers have become something they could never expect from Morgan activists on behalf of the press .
Reporter Miriam Ramirez seized a few eyes and moved to the local public Prosecutor &apos;s office next morning for another journalist .
Mr Salvador Ava disappeared in the Western State of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez .
a dead body has been found and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists have become more vocal across the country and underline the phrase SOS press as an organised protest against pavements and buildings .
on this day , President Bojorquez is in Washington in an attempt to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case .
the day after the death of Valdez , in meetings with the Governor of Blue oa , the Ramirez authorities accused journalists of dropping and killing them for telling the truth .
after that , he asked for him to be diverted from the government &apos;s activities elsewhere , concerned that hatred has affected objectivity .
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ guilty state officials and an indifferent society .
in his last book on the &apos; drug press &apos; , he wrote that the reporters are killing not only drug gangs , but also under the command of politicians and security forces who are at the mercy of organised crime .
Articulo 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , awarded more than half of the attacks on the police and public officials last year .
&apos;In Mexico , because you want to keep quiet , &apos; said Ramirez .
murder obviously has a bloody effect .
no one will forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulik six years ago .
he was found dead with a letter that probably had been signed by a cartel LOS Zetas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
alongside his painted head , computer glass and elephants were found .
some publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the northern border state of El Norte , Chihuahuahua , following the killing of their correspondent , Ai slava Battihi , in March .
others will pass on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly spoke to the drug cartel with the slogan &apos; What do you want of us ? &apos;
some journalists have fled from home states , or even from the country .
this is a nervous decision .
in theory , it is difficult to find work , and they still have to look on the streets in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes they are being driven behind them , as was probably the case with the photograph Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered three months after the sinking of Veracruz in 2015 , together with four women in Mexico .
those who remain in place and continue to work will have to dance around risky decisions on a daily basis .
Ibarra , who once wanted to become a poet , recognises that the reporting of drug trafficking frightens him .
&quot; Mexico is on the way to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
at a recent midnight of Friday , when the latest number had already been sounded , the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and plundered the beer when all phones suddenly started to be calibrated .
19 people were killed according to confirmed data in the fire exchanges between rival gangs and security forces in Mazatlanis .
the war escalated , as did a number of messages from cartels found in the region .
on the basis of the same pavements , reporters made news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone .
a change was needed in the front of next day .
a further exchange of fire in the region was seized by the KGB .
Bojorquez piilus towards police officers to see if they are vigilant .
when they were afraid , they did not at least show this .
workers in Riodoce were wearing under a massive banner under which his average fingers can be seen for the whole blue , under his footsteps .
&apos;How can one think of closure , &apos; said Bojorquez , &apos; whereas on the same day that Javier was killed , a trainee asked me to send a report to the streets ? &apos;
Dinosaurus used protective colours to prevent enemies
at first glance , it looks like a form , albeit rather frightening .
scientists have now unveiled the first findings of the incredible rhythm size discovered by Canadian miners , which has been so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; dinosaurs Mona Lisa &apos; .
it has even been so well preserved that it was even possible to find out that the leather covered by his coffee was a red boom and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
a report published in the newspaper newspaper on the Biology described the existence as &apos; the best preserved soomance rate ever found &apos; and when &apos; one of the best Curriculum readings worldwide &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new type of nodosaxy that lived in the middle of the seasons , between 110 and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly good retention was carried out by scientists who describe it as &apos; truly significant &apos; .
this plant nutrient covered by soya has , according to the magazine National Geodic , best preserved the type of phosphorus that has ever been found .
it was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn functional when he extracted Suncor Millenium in Fort McMurray near Northern Albertas in Canada .
he struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into it .
the phosphorus identified was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleonygia museum .
for the next six years , it was designed to extract 2 500 pounds ( 1100 kilometres ) from the land unit .
after all this hard work , the end result is now finally ready for the public to be brought forward .
&apos;If you put a little eye on your eyes , you can almost believe he sleep , &apos; said Caleb Brown , the leading author , the theatre Royal Tyrrell , in the museum where the present is being vanished .
&quot; it will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur - Mona Lisana . &quot;
when he studied leather , he found that this vegetarian worker , although covered by soya and resembles walking tank , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food dinosaur .
this high @-@ profile dinosaur used a red and white colour of protection to hide from predators and applied sheltering techniques , which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
this allowed the dinosaur , according to the experts , to be absorbed and enemies to be prevented , as he was likely to be hunted by major dinosaurs .
this figure of 110 million old @-@ year @-@ old family of nodosaurs first arrived in news in May and is now visited in the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology museum .
researchers have now studied and given it the name of the Boeh opelta Marmitchelli museum mark Mitchell , a famous team that spent more than 7 000 hours to reveal the pain .
thanks to the amazing quality of his father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the soyings on the body .
they discovered a contradiction - a common method of protection in the animal state , which means that the desert of the present was a dark man than the lower .
although there is a common sense of objectivity , the findings come as a surprise , as Borealopelta is much higher than the animals living with a deferral today .
this suggests that the dinosaur was sufficiently actively hunted by other meat @-@ feed dinosaur that the evolution preferred to be a survivous policy instead of a confrontation .
however , most of the animals used today for retaliation - such as fear , seals or meals - are much smaller and more vulnerable to harvests , indicating that nodosaurus had to really work to survive .
&quot; the vigorous hunting of the dinosaur , which is covered by huge and abundant soaps , shows how dangerous it could have been to the animals kidnapped from the dinosaences of the critic era , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds of diabetes also revealed that a dinosaur &apos;s skin was a red bed .
scientists will continue to set up an investigation in order to obtain indications of this life , including the retained content of this gender style , in order to find out what the animal would last to war .
they believe that the dinosaur has fallen into the dead rivers , thereby entering the sea , where he had sunk in front of the ocean .
at the time , Albertas was as warm as it was today in South Florence , and rivers and oceans were probably far beyond the internal land .
&quot; this nodosaurus is truly remarkable , as he has been fully covered by sodious skin , but he has also remained three dimensions , preserving the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal today looks almost the same as in the age of crippers .
in order to reconstruct it , there is not much imagination to use - it is enough simply to preach bridges and it seems to be like sleeping . &quot;
the crisis era was the time when there were massive movements of meat @-@ feed dinosaurs - heteropots - on earth .
although their Roman Tyrannosaurus rex lived many millions more years later than Borealopelta , some of his frightening predecessors could be stunned by this dumped dinosaur .
these include Acrocanthosaurus , 38 legs ( 11.5 metres ) , a long and six @-@ tonne monster .
scientists whose recent findings have been published in the magazine are currently Biology believe that Borealopelta was stunned after death in the sea and this muzambique sludge .
on 21 March 2011 , Shawn functional was discovered when he extracted Fort McMurray from the Millenium mine in Northern Albertas in Canada .
according to the museum , it has been the best preserved in the world of sodium proportions , including leather and soya , and it is a complete concentration up to the pumps .
these assumptions were on average 18 legs ( five metres ) long and sparked up to GBP 3 000 ( 1300 kg ) .
two decades of customs invaded it .
scientists believe that it was through the current Western Canada , which was covered by soya , until it was swamped into the open sea .
however , the place of absorbing the dinosaur under the sea helped to maintain its characteristics in an excellent detail .
the glaciers of this particular father , coal , have so well preserved that mygarchic soomers are still covered by skin ice mountains .
as Michael Greshko wrote in the magazine of National Geodic : &apos; such statehood is as rare as a lottery .
the more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
Defied skin bears are still covered by the creation of mysterious sodium stores on the ground .
a better front is lying alongside him , and five of the assets have been blown up .
I will be able to count the sows on his winter . &quot;
how did one activist find an answer to the question of &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock .
just a day after the trip to New York , that was the birthplace of St. Louise Airbnb on a leaked bed , on Facebook on the phone .
he came on top of the post of his former school companions .
it read : &apos; the police killed a young 18 @-@ year @-@ old adolescence , and he is still on the street &apos; .
he was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his stream , so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
Pidega @ TheePsucah &apos;s user &apos;s mail was repeatedly distributed on his timeline .
Mr St. Synchronous from the Louise region sent a real @-@ time tag to Michael Brown , the death of an unarmed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson Missouris .
he gave a picture of the life of Brown , which was found on the street , for four hours .
&apos;It is crazy , &apos; thought of the Ferreira amendments .
but death was nothing new for him or for the community .
he put his phone off , but later this evening he looked again at the spark announced this time that people were gathered in Canfield Drive .
Jagati photographs of the police and the people who were afraid of the police and the man who claimed himself to be the father of Brown and kept the label &apos; The Ferguson police killed my unarmed son &apos; .
he watched a real @-@ time flow where a police officer stood before a group of protesters with graves .
in the second video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Mr Ferrell will remember how he has caught himself from the point of view : &apos; it is unusual &apos; .
&apos;This is not a murder of this kind that we are accustomed to and which we could describe as typical &apos; .
I felt horrified at this moment .
I was angry and I met . &quot;
he booked a return flight and travelled home the following day .
having buried at 23 o &apos;clock , she went to her father for his six @-@ year daughter and decided that they would travel to Ferguson next morning .
what happened next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the central theme of the new documentary &apos; Whose street &apos; . ( &apos; whose streets ? &apos; ) , which will be presented in cinemas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who thanked for their answers .
when Mrs Ferreira , together with her daughter - who had a lipsy sticker in the back and beaten it - travelled to Ferguson , they retalked about a subject that they had repeatedly talked about before this morning - about the experience and living conditions of the musicians .
&quot; remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &quot;
&quot; we are now travelling to Ferguson because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys , and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on board , &quot; said Ferreira later .
&quot; what is happening now is ... the culmination of what happened in the past .
it must know and see this and grow in the middle of it .
he must learn about activist and organisation and , at the same time , also know the different layers of experience and living conditions of the musicians , and what we must do in order to be free and free .
even if I succeed in bringing him up in such a way that he does not personally copy brutal racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel I would do him a disservice if I were to protect him from this world . &quot;
the first stop they did in the vicinity of Ferguson was through the South Florissanti - the police station in the middle of the road , which had become a kind of camps where activists were waiting for news about the police officer , Darren Wilson , who was not ultimately charged .
there , Mr Ferreira and his daughter joined forces with the local business owner , who produced lunch crops .
they brought together food homes and helped to distribute them to the protesters .
for Ferrell , a new type of activist has slowly started to take shape .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at Missouri @-@ St. Louise University , he was the President of the Union for Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organisation .
all this is simply a pipe . &quot;
weeks later , during the Ferreira evening demonstration , a film co @-@ director Sabaah Folayani met .
Folayan said that he and the film operator , Mr Alvarado @-@ Farrar , simply wanted to document what is happening .
the question of &apos; are you trying to document what is happening or to find a story that can be used ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to profit from its legitimacy and resilience .
Folayan explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born and growing in Ferguson would not be heard , and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Folayan had already put his hands in hand with the co @-@ director Damon Davati , the artist in the region , who was known as activists for prisoners sentenced to death .
his involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and for the six other local communities who were watched for years following the shooting of Brown .
&apos;In this documentary , no one is speaking to us or to us , but we are speaking to ourselves , &apos; said Davis .
&quot; it was important to me how these people are portrayed , because that is how I am portrayed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell - the intention was to show that the movement is not about &apos; donor leader , but about bringing together the community &apos; , as Folayan said - he was the most open party to the film .
as a result , the &apos; Whose street &apos; ? &apos; surprises personal aspects of the life of Ferrell , such as ruthlessness and marriage with his wife .
&apos;I felt , as I would be earlier , &apos; said Ferreira , laughing over the first time that he saw the city .
&quot; however , I realised that this work and the humanity of the black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
what is more , the Ferrell story emphasises and replaces the role of black LGBT women in the wider Black Sea Lives Matter movement .
two of the three initiators of the movement , who thought out in the social media in 2012 following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin , the hashtags # BlackLivesMatter , are homosexuals .
&quot; in leading role , Muslim women have kept the movement across the board , &quot; said Ferreira , &quot; and this is precisely because we have to fight continually on many fronts .
Roma women must bear all this burden . &quot;
Folayan agreed , stating that &apos; movement is indeed alive by black women , and many of them are black homosexuals &apos; .
he says , however , that &apos; this is not a case of creating a level playing field &apos; - Ferrell was not chosen as the focus of the film because of his identity .
&quot; he was someone who had the right energy evening , &quot; he said .
&quot; however , it is no coincidence that he was directly located on the rindex , as black LGBT women live in such hubs is a lot at stake .
his energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , news cameras Ferguson has long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the conditional sentences imposed on Ferrell during the demonstrations for blocking the road will last another 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region he calls homelessness simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
however , he still considers the mantra he has been eating since he went to the streets of Ferguson a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing other than our chains to lose . &quot;
7 examples of how to overcome the Weekise du potablet
some of the most stubborn mechangers will find help after a little bit of pipes .
or from the saying &apos; Beyond pohmelle &apos; , the cradle of the stick &apos; .
but this is only an inevitable postponement and a good word for health .
what can you do to make sure that , after today and tomorrow &apos;s Weekise trall - or other pipes - you feel better in the morning and get the poppy out as painfully as possible ?
Joo Water .
it was under fire and , after a great deal of pile in the morning ... or , if possible , even alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it must somehow be recovered .
together with water , minerals are also being thrown out of the body , and sestap is a good hair of mineral water .
since , after being stunned , the sweat has often been irritated , it is particularly good if it is free of soil , or only lightly gambled .
let &apos;s walk .
surely it would not cost the grandmother to burn the trees with poppy - it could prove fatal to be a wrong decision .
but a simple walk @-@ out helps the body to recall once again what it is like to be alive .
Sleeping in Telgis and sleeping boys is a more time @-@ consuming way of getting a whole .
give poor energy back gradually and cautiously .
if you are already on the verge of overdrinking yesterday , it is certainly not worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
for example , a fresh volume containing treasure fabrics is slowly placed on the market as a body .
if the health of the South is already suffering , for example , the wedding could be tried .
and a little later on , it is clear .
a coffee was avoided .
this softer will free your body from the last water .
as has already been said , water and volume have your friends .
there is a contribution to painkillers .
if you take a painkiller to prevent pohl on the evening , you have to deal with paratsetamol or ibuprophet , not only with alcohol , but also with the ability to do so .
so they will pay even more and , in the future , boys will be worse .
in addition , the analgesics will not remain in the jungle for a long time .
if you take a painkiller in the morning , you will do it with an empty knife - it irritates your already tired sweat .
or if you do not have a partner , you can do it well .
it is about the same thing as walking , but it does not become orgasm when it comes to walking .
however , too active a pace and an outrageous bet were avoided - during the poppy season , the physical effort should be moderate .
go a joke .
the words of friends of time with friends of friends of time have been spoken , the easy hand and the naera amicably over both himself and others ( suffering ) .
Nali and navier may not be doing a pocket , but they will certainly have a lighter chance of being tolerated .
once again , the pohmell goes over anyway !
Professor of Northwestern and staff at Oxford University are sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , professors of the University of Northwester and the University of Oxford are being sought nationally , who have been suspected of finding a single Chiicago luxury corps for men with death wounds .
according to judicial documents from the Cook County , on Monday , arrest warrants were issued for 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni , accused of being murdered at first instance because of their alleged involvement in Trenton H. Cornell @-@ Duranleu .
according to the documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Duranallou died after repeated Nazis .
according to the warning that Chicago &apos;s police station issued to the community , the body was found to be dead on 27 July .
police officers received telephone calls and found a victim from the Grand Plaza Corterhouse , whose body had several towers .
according to the officials , the Cornell @-@ Durantagu event was sentenced to death and investigators are treating coaches as murder , while the police are actively seeking two suspects .
LaPatrick has been working as co @-@ professors of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwester since 2007 .
in a statement sent as e @-@ publishing , Alan K. Cubbage , Vice @-@ President of University , said that Ladows had now been temporarily removed from work and is forbidden to enter the cities of the University of Northwester .
&quot; this is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of Northwester works with researchers , &quot; said Cubbage .
Warren is a senior assistant in the finance department of Oxford University .
the representative of the University and Somerville College said in an email statement : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to help US research authorities in every way possible &apos; .
furthermore , the statement stated that Warreni colleagues were shocked and wanted to be extradited .
Anthony Guglielm , Head of the Communications Department of Chicago , urges suspects to give themselves to the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are , but we are increasingly intensively defining the exact location , &quot; said Guglielm .
according to Guglielm , suspects can be sought by local , regional and national authorities .
Guglielm said that the police had received a telephone call from the chief Plaza Corterhouse , who had just received a kryptic hint that something had happened at Corps No 1008 .
according to the police , this was a magic spectacle .
it is not clear , according to Guglielm , whether the event itself was also taking place on 27 July .
he said that the security cameras confirm the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
the leadership of the Grand Plaza sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police are currently working to identify the background of events and victims , and is looking at various motives , including the possibility of a family dispute &apos; .
firms that help your businesses avoid getting next UbB
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ up company , but the polls were unprofitable .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised anonymity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Errett , who is leading the company Madison Reed , which sells e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees in San Franciscos .
it therefore called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups with new types of human resources are emerging , helping businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software to measure the involvement of workers , they allow companies to carry out flash surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , provide anonymity and complaint hotlines for workers and , in some cases , allow them to bypass the level C leaders and address directly to the Bureau .
&apos;There are now tools such as Strava and Fitbps for monitoring health , but where is Fitbi for your company ? &apos; asked Jim Barnett , co @-@ founder and CEO of Redwood City start @-@ ups Glint , whose software analysts are used by companies to measure worker inclusion .
according to Erretti , he has received a much better overview of what he thinks and feels by workers in three years of his use of Glinti .
in addition to inquiries and specific teams , it offers a company &apos;s thermal card , which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , enabling it to identify the causes .
companies have started to understand that they have to stay in touch with their work culture so as not to become the next Ub , which has been rebelled in scandals since the former worker published a blog mail which described an abominable environment in which those who dared to speak were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as Glint , the desire to have an overview is a profitable business option .
global governance , regulation and compliance can be worth more than USD 1187 billion by 2020 , according to the financial ethics statistics website Let &apos;s talk .
Denveris Colorados , a start company which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , observed an interest and an increase in activity this year against the background of the dubious reputation of Uberia .
there are almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
Uber recently registered himself as a customer .
like Glingi , the coalition companies will be allowed to send tailor @-@ made impulse polls , gather confidential answers in real time and look at the problematic areas of heat maps .
it also offers anonymous messages to enable workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has been anchored by regulatory authorities , &quot; said Patrick Quinlan , founder and CEO .
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act unethically , it could face serious consequences , such as consumer boycotts , the departure of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ruby communautaire , restaurant clothing , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of operation , has used inactive census for more than a year to ensure workers &apos; awareness of the rules and procedures and to provide a simple way of communicating with the headquarters of corporation .
when a worker wanted to report a problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address at the company &apos;s headquarters , make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously .
this was often a damning and inconvenient process , and Mr Parish &apos;s general adviser , James Vitrano , said that there was no good way of monitoring workers &apos; complaints .
however , now that the company uses coalicenti , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices , which did not previously reach leaders in other cities or offices located in states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I have the opportunity to get closer to the hollow experience of the workers of 360 degrees , &quot; said Vitrano , who chairs Ruby hood &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; and we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and worker involvement more seriously in 2002 , after the audit company Arthur Andersson collapsed due to ethical irregularities in relation to the Enron scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they could not prevent their black washing from being hijacked online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both Glint and Vienna are offering their software as a service , paying companies periodically for the use of their products .
it is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors , who have been in favour of both start @-@ ups .
3.4 million dollars were financed in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected at USD 47 million .
the Glinti invested USD 10 million in November in Bessemer Venture partners , increasing its total funding to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise if we take into account the interconnectedness between companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more research shows that today &apos;s workers expect more jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high wages and interesting projects are just on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy in the company , they feel they are being listened to and that the work they do is satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said Nina McQueen , Vice @-@ President Linkedtis , who has a general benefit and employee experience , who uses both Integration centi and Glinti .
investors will earn revenue if companies in their portfolio do well ; businesses will do well if workers are committed and involved .
if analytical tools on the third side promise to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , we are not sure that they will be supported .
having data on the involvement of workers is important , according to experts in professional culture .
however , these data will be useless if the company &apos;s supervisors do not go along with them .
in fact , when a company asks for feedback from its employees , it can generate expectations that changes are ahead of us .
and if changes do not take place quickly enough or at all , this could cause disappointment and decrease the involvement of workers .
&quot; when you ask for 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conversations , &quot; said Kotter International President Russell Raath , who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&apos;because if things are not brought to the end , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Erretti , the Netherlands , which is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via Glinti .
and , after receiving feedback from disappointed workers on the pace of decision @-@ making and quality of communication , he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems .
however , Mr Tavares is collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in industry , known for its high labour turnover .
&apos;If you are not committed to transparency , you will lose people , &apos; said Vitrano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose customers .
and if you lose your customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
euro area ice star is in the Baltic : incomes grow rapidly
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , Banimal berg writes with reference to the ECB report .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
there is a low debt burden behind success , fast @-@ growing institutions and business @-@ friendly and free @-@ market @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where the EU average has been substantially closer to the purchasing power of the reactor per capita . &quot;
although the aim is for the total output of the economy per capita to be equivalent to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2 / 3 / 15 of the average of the 2 / 3 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led the balls to seek better wages abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic at all .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are doing very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was thought little less than half of those questioned about their economies .
NCAA &apos;s decision to cancel trends twice a day makes Bruinsi &apos;s days long
it is almost 23 o &apos;clock when trochiond UCLA football clubs stop talking at the end of a new exercise in a team &apos;s city .
some of them have put their backs on the back , revealing their efforts in the first day of the training camp .
for a large part of the team , these Christmas minutes offer a midday break .
the players involved in cucumbers are going to learn after a three @-@ hour shift back to a common life test before returning to the Wavier man football club at 6.30 meetings next morning .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday .
NCAA &apos;s decision to cancel the trends taking place twice a day to reduce the burden of players has actually made their days longer - at least until the end of the day - to one side on Friday .
for this reason , the first three operations of UCLA were prompted to start at 19.15 in order to fit players into the already tight timeline .
the transition from two strikes per day means more days - the beginning of the Bruinsi training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season and , for the first time in Mora &apos;s six Westward season , there will be workshops during summer courses .
they have 18 March plans until 20 August , before starting formal preparations for the opening game against Texas A &amp; M in September .
according to Mora , he is in favour of a change in the NCAA rule , although it adds another item to the close schedules of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; and they break themselves through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that when it comes to Saturday and we have more time , it will be a very good thing . &quot;
once the camp is closed , UCLA &apos;s operations will be closed , which is not an easy task , however , given the clear view of the parking plate close to their fields and the remote Luskini centre , a higher @-@ class hotel that has already escaped from the net of protection around the gates .
since this weekend , hotel Bruinsi players are occupying , but Mora acknowledged that there could be problems with free tobacco during the season .
&quot; we are implementing security measures , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; this is a real concern , and it is not exaggerated to think that people can filter a rent and a tour from there .
if you have a record of a train , you can do a good deal with it .
but we are using a security team there and 8 parking stations .
we will do our best to use it .
I will try not to worry very much about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the cost of the German @-@ Ivanova electoral union , Kristiina Ojuland , who was expelled from the Reform Party and the ECB , to the forces of Maria Kaljete , who were forced to join forces in the hands of our Tallinn and the parties , seems to be at least as much as the political parties involved in the local elections this year .
however , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointed voters .
who will remain with the Sahel ?
if the support team of Edgar Salevare reduced , the events organised for his election union can be predicted .
one of the members of the national assembly , some former and current middle parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and why , in Tallinn , are some of the faithful sympathies and sisters of Saduare prevented from standing for election , can it be that the list of &apos; Saduare &apos; companies , which are suspected of corruption and corruption crime , is becoming a reality ?
on the Russian poem of a film @-@ driven music caldeo , on the part of the municipality , attended by the city of Lasnamäe ; and in any sense by the original computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas , the Prime Minister , has to avoid lomnipe and hurricans on his way - is that the central party , for the first time , is seeking the votes of the 16th and 17 @-@ year @-@ old voters to be admitted to the ballot boxes ?
we look forward to the perception of other political parties of the youth electoral campaign .
if the Kanal 2 or TV3 viewers , instead of the beginning of August , are confronted with black holes , there will be two options : to accept that in future , only ETV , ETV2 , ETV + , Tallinn TV and English @-@ language France24 channels or to dispense with 10 TV operators each month .
there are probably also those who openly rejoice at the start with free television experience , but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and advertisements .
Innumerical music , folding people and the rubbish left on the streets are unpleasant by @-@ products of almost every major music festival .
however , if you do not want to be part of the ocean , you have to go home rather than pain - and leave the sleeping place for the lung sum to the festival .
Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
media publications are quoted by President Donald Trumpi , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan provides for a 50 000 @-@ year reduction in the number of legal immigrants , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Republican and supported by the President .
the bill goes to the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law reduces poverty , increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , as it changes the way in which green cards are issued to US citizens from other countries .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process gives an advantage to the candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and to the skills that will benefit our economies , &quot; said Trump in the US media publications .
Siberia seto young people are moving back to the city , pensioners , to land .
Jevseyev Anatol continues the tradition of the famous seto gold miners along the River Maana .
she works 140 kilometres from home to Maana extra time in Kuvai as a motor driver .
it is hard work : two months of work without rest days , and then only 10 days at home and again .
during the three years of work in the Archtel , Anatol has seen the culmination only once .
&apos;There is a resounding procedure : when you go into it , you will check thoroughly that the reference does not lead , and when you go out that you do not take it &apos; , you will talk Anatol .
Mare Piho , speaking in the village of Haida , to the local seto Jaga , who has spoken a great deal to him about the memory of his family in Siberia .
the archaic culture still preserved by Siberian setopes will also affect domestic seals , as it is quite simply so shocking that it thinks the most far @-@ sighted mixtures of Piho Mare .
his first investigation trip to Siberia will be 30 years later this year .
during that period , he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year .
how much did Siberia still migrate at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took this into account in the words of Siberian seto men who have thought about it themselves .
it is difficult to say precisely because up to 30 people could come to one group at that time , but only a man was given a passport .
the passport was given to only one , but it was children , sisters and women .
look at how great this territory was here .
it was many times greater than that of historian .
after all , it was necessary to educate , to manage it in some way .
Setinos came here as farmers , but their lives changed , because here they came to areas that were not only agricultural but also river ( palgiparation ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New PetF , many pigs later went to work in Krasnojarsk @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P. ) when it was formed .
did the setos then represent a majority of the population in this region ?
yes , they lived collectively .
in addition , a long tradition of marriage and a lot of childbirth has long been preserved .
seven to eight children in families were common .
how many cultures of Siberian setopes differed and different from those of the mother country ?
they are different , although what was said here was once the same .
they gave rise to a great many popular ideas .
they then also made their own ( ideas of the people ) , but they always made a distinction between what had been brought about and what had been done here .
climate change has been heavily influenced by the traditional rivalry of seals , because it is cold here .
the changes have been proposed .
for example , Setomaal meat was skinned , but it was simply frozen here .
where are the villages of Siberian setode and what life is living there ? / graphics : Alari Paluends
the link with the mother country was spiritually strong , it was regarded as very important .
it seems to me that now this Setuony is going to return to it , it will affect them .
those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories .
Piho is thinking of the people of the Estonian setode delegation who came to the day of Haida village Seto the Kingdom in early July and lived in homes for four days - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is very easy to come and also go , because the city has an excellent location : in the railway link and at the crossroads of the roads , it says Reigo Tamm , who comes from Tapy .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a lot of nature , sports and cultural places , and the carrot gets in every corner .
Tapa is a tip @-@ pop city !
there is a small island along the River White , which runs through the Linera , where the Tamils tend to be hijacked .
&apos;This beautiful place does not appear on the train window &apos; , hails Reigo .
those who do not fear cold water can flood in the river because the river is full of resources .
I have been there , you can do it !
the river will be able to keep a long time and just do a romantics - it will be possible to look at the flow of the river and to think ahead of life and behind .
I have also been there with my own names .
Ooperisolist Tamm has , apart from anything else , been on the river between three bridges : &apos; that place is along the city , no one may come to answer if their stories are heard &apos; .
&quot; there is a wonderful view of Tapy , but there are also health professionals where you can drink , winter skies and now , for example , play a disgolf game - golf tracks have been made , chains can be borrowed from sports centres , &quot; Reigo is leading .
old processors are there , of course , with their own system , but I have not yet been able to play there .
obviously , my colleague , Mrs Rasmus , must be invited to visit Tapale , because she has experienced a discgolfimbler and she has a label .
perhaps he will lend me !
Reigo and Männikull were inseparable from the current period of childhood .
at least during hours .
there are many tears left to this memory , many disappointments , and you can live in my sporting life .
not to mention the bells and suicides that have broken .
&quot; the whole city of the city is now full of construction works , all of which will become unknown , &quot; renders Reigo .
however , Tapa &apos;s old and tired building is a very attractive place to play oral discoveries .
I am pleased that , in 2012 , the head of R.A.A.A.A.M adopted my idea and had to make a summer theatre with his theatre .
although this year &apos;s theatre season &apos; Alember Karenin &apos; has just been completed , on 11 August the railway station &apos; Elluwake &apos; , when the old building is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; from 11 to 13 August , the city of Tapa is the day of the town of Tapa , which has opened the doors of the vineyards and clothes of cultural activities , including the popular treasure , speaks of Reigo , who recommends to visit the city from 9 to 11 years .
the museum has already been in 1994 since 1 May in a tiny three @-@ house .
&apos;The house is small , but there is a great deal of publicity and information enormously &apos; , applauds Reigo &apos;s place , which is full of the history of the city of Tapa , most of which focus on railways and sisters .
Reigo muds that if you go through all the recommended sites in Tapal , you will go a long way , but fortunately the small town will be full of coffers .
&quot; we have such good eating places and sometimes when you sit in coffee , you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad , you describe it .
educated and young soldiers who have come to Tapy spend a lot of time in pumps , a star sitting there is a curious feeling that you are in Estonia and your home town , but there is such an international company together .
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to stories from the French or the Americans .
the wars , yes , we are moving a lot !
two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering
Telecanal bTV quoted a foreign minister who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering .
in the morning of 1 August , the police arrested people who illegally ordered a group on the island of Sithonia , including two Bulgarians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulgarians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing heavy penalties on all those who are caught in a spawning place that is not intended for it .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
the wolves that teach the young people are breaking the sheep .
farmers on the shelf have yet again had to give their herds a &apos; lesson &apos; - the wolves that have taught the wolves , apparently , have already broken a lot of sheep .
this year , the wolves in the Hiiu county have broken sheep three times , 23 sheep and eight have been injured , writing the Hiiu page .
soil was only three years before 124 .
there are also data from the Environment Agency at the birth of Murms that soil was not born on the Hishelf and that the advice from the Walloon Council is that two wolves have been fixed on the island this year .
at the Ööl on Monday , the wolves unleashed 15 sheep in the village of Kabul and injured the 18 survivors .
in the morning morning morning , the wolves in the village of Rehebasla were breaking one sheep in the pasture and seriously injured the other , who had to be struck by an emergency .
rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law amending the Law on the Environment of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and plant protection products .
the amendment to the law removes the creation of a separate collection of data for both genetically modified ( GM ) crops and operators , using a plant health register in the future .
in addition , the obligation to have prior agreement with the designated person dealing with beekeeping will be amended by the GM crop maker .
although there is currently no increase in GM crops in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as there are no decisions to declare the Estonian GMO @-@ free , &quot; said Sigmar Suu Kyi , the head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and the public sectors , in addition . &quot;
the draft law repeals the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of data on GM crops and operators , lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and for the start of economic activities .
specifically with regard to beekeeping , the GM crop farmer is replaced by an obligation to inform beekeepers of the start of GM crops with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeepers before starting cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination .
all interested parties will have the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the information system of the draft proposals and , if they so wish , to give their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , those in the plant farming sector , beekeepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 810 - has been authorised to grow .
so far , however , no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops .
the reason for this is that there is no magic bullet in Estonia , a European shadow media on which mon 810 is resistant .
it has also been extended to the southern regions , and this in May is not appropriate for our climate conditions .
in order to be secure , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various suicides , maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia .
the analysis of the samples carried out showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soya varieties in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms .
in turn , it can be concluded that in Estonia , GM crops are not deliberately cultivated , and it was also confirmed that there has not been random contamination .
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United in the form of Nemanja Maticu , &quot; genetic &quot;
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United States has recruited &apos; genius &apos; in the form of Nemanja Maticu , after having opposed the central player Samlov on Wednesday evening .
a player bought from Chelmer for GBP 40 million started in Dublin in the last seasonal game in the UEFA Super Cupi line against Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 in the initial indent , while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on attacks .
however , having left behind Blues &apos;s seasonal ban on Asia , Maticl was badly in need of swimming and only received 45 minutes , which , according to Mourinho , must be corrected by a firm prior to the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genious thinking - he has a football mindset , &quot; said Mourinho .
&quot; we will help him to achieve a form as soon as possible . &quot;
as in the atmosphere , in the Aviva stadium , other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romlu Mubarak , and Mourinho gradually started to put in place a man starting at the beginning of the season .
the Independent public this week revealed that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football players , but confirmed that the club had already done &apos; excellent work &apos; by concluding contracts with three of its four priority options .
&quot; I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four , &quot; he added .
&quot; I am even happier if they can do four things , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
another warm poet took the foot of the GSM Embassy on 1 August and this time in Muhus .
Mati Martinson , an observer living in Shuves , received the first cumber in Shuves , and this washing cell is already flying around , has left the washing ground and joined the great night of the Mullutu @-@ Great Gulf .
this is because , after all , there are no fertility fields , the island &apos;s voice is written .
this Tuesday , in order to break the course relatively late , the accompanying person received another poet , and that was on the island of Muhu .
according to Martinson , the installation of embassies is , in fact , an international project carried out by Aemitr Leito and Ivar Ojara .
soil was supplied with a poet called Mati GSM Embassy in Sfragile ves Turkey .
&quot; his actions are all on the internet : how he went to Spain in winter , back a long time in the German and Polish border , and then in Saareland , Martinson spoke .
the British inventor was able to install a microchip in his own body in order to get access to a handler &apos;s house and car .
the British inventor became the first person in a country to have a microchip installed so that he can only open his own example , get into office and even launch a car .
33 @-@ year @-@ old Steven Northam children to install a small chip between their pöp la and the name finger and now provide this service to businesses and private individuals who wish to make their lives easier through the bioTeq of their company .
he has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson , a consultant @-@ anestesiologist of the Royal hospital in Winchester Hants , to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards .
technology is similar to that of microchip installed on cats and bags , and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure .
the Northam company is also changing the songs of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , asking for GBP 300 per snow .
this child &apos;s father has now installed technology both at home and in his car , BMW Z4 , which will start when he has his hand in the wheel .
White House &apos;s audit cost to taxpayers thousands
according to military documents unveiled in the magazine , the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicopter last month for an event involving American production to the southern taxpayer cost even USD 24 000 .
the green and white colour Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , termed &apos; Marine One &apos; during the presidential pardon , was central to the event in Valges Main on 17 July .
President Donald Trump , senior officials of the Vice @-@ President Mike Pence and the White House reported on industrial products from all 50 countries on their move .
a helicopter built in Connecticut was sponsored together with a clone from the reputation , a fire brigade from Wisconten and a pallet made in Mississippy .
according to the documents of Mrs Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX @-@ 1 ) , the chief cabinet responsible for the operation of HeliCopter ordered the presence of a helicopter in the military office of the White House to take a little 36 hours before the helicopter for the &apos; extraordinary &apos; event in the southern horror .
&apos;I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an unusually high @-@ profile event , &apos; said HMX @-@ 1 komandör a day before the event was launched in an e @-@ mail to his superiority , the Deputy Assistant officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
the message stated that the helicopter would come to the southern horror on 17 July morning at 7 : 00 , and will remain there until the same night between 18 and 21 is cleared .
it was added that if the departure of the White House were to be present , a second epathy is needed because of the restrictions on working time .
the original air crew was in the helicopter during the event and the security team of the estur remained close to the aircraft throughout the period of its stay on the ground .
it was not possible to read out from the documents we have just given to the magazine whether or not the other ethos were eventually needed .
the Hatch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes .
documents show that HMX @-@ 1 examined whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked if it was in breach of Hatch &apos;s law and we were told that it would not rip , &apos; wrote the commander .
&apos;It seems that you do not have a choice , &apos; answered the Deputy Minister for the lead officers .
the White House declared the &apos; made in America &apos; event as a formal event , and Hatch &apos;s law would not have covered it .
but even official events have political undertones .
the President backed the efforts of health reform at the time in the Senate and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in check .
the use of an aircraft known as &apos; Marine One &apos; or Air Force &apos; for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them purely photographic is unusual .
in February , the Trump came to the attention of the President &apos;s plane at his first campaign event in Floridas Melbourne , and he is slipping from Twitter &apos;s account messages complaining about the way in which his predecessor &apos;s flight was used .
&quot; White l Mal is very pleased with the exhibition &quot; made in America , where products were represented in all 50 states made by American workers , &quot; said Lindsay Walters , the spokesman of the White House .
HMX @-@ 1 teams often carry out experiments around Washington and in the southern horror in order to get down to the white house of the President of the United States with a centimetres .
when the Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , the HMX @-@ 1 White House ordered 58 samples .
according to the official , a flight crew made in America was considered to be the norm for a month &apos;s study flights .
on that day , Eskar helicopters fly another 11 hours for &apos; non @-@ President @-@ related support missions &apos; .
according to the White House , no other actor in this event has burdened the taxpayers &apos; wallets .
according to the representative of Sikorsky , the company was not involved in carrying out evictions on the southern horror .
HMX @-@ 1 will not preserve the budgetary documents of President flights and the precise costs of the event will be difficult to identify .
however , according to the Ministry of Defence &apos;s hourly prices for the financial year 2017 , VH @-@ 3D has a compensation rate of USD 24 380 per hour .
the Eskaadr &apos;s documents indicated a flight length of 30 minutes from its main base , de Quantico airport Virgin both directions .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using helicopter is well below that amount .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated reimbursement rates is very misleading , &quot; said Walters .
&quot; these estimated compensation rates include staff , care and many other irreversible costs , which will be taken into account for annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 rand study , the Ministry of Defence does not include staff costs , but they cover fuel , maintenance and contract costs .
the former spokesman of the White House , Sean Sharier , defended the use of helicopter at the time at the event .
&quot; the point is to show the things made in America this week , &quot; said Sphoer .
&quot; and I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut State are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are probably hundreds , if not even thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment , on which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the Trump was exposed to a helicopter in the southern horror , or not , but he was hiding behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
within the White House , Trump Sikorsky addressed representatives by handing out media outlets about company products in his personal aircraft fleet .
&apos;I know Sikorská very well , &apos; said President , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .
Gari Šadeiko - Very arrived in peace and joy
the 2011 Mil Daetis hit Šadeikot in the last area , 800 m drinks were a footwear , and the stadium was taken away with the cannabis .
just before that , he had received a zero leap away from the University of China .
in 2012 , Helsinki was a wealth of cheap injuries , but in London , it received 60 13 points 23 .
I have continued , however .
after the launch of the 2013 Moscow MMF , Estonia &apos;s record time @-@ on @-@ the @-@ spot was the protagonist of a remote hyperro @-@ stick .
two years later , he became the 15th seat of Beijing and fulfilled the Olympic Games , but that was more than what he wanted to be a disappointment to the athletes .
the Raskedalipu was only passed through the soil of Šadeiko when the outcome of the Amsterdam Embassy was not received a letter at the beginning .
I would just like to put together a proper multi @-@ contest once or for all .
once &apos; , sprayed Šadeiko .
worse still lies ahead : a month later , his Olympic contest in Rios was already in the first hurdle .
time had to be taken down - was it necessary to continue with the seven competition at all ?
is the two @-@ day effort worth all this ?
Neiu thought a long time , but found peace .
I could think twice !
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time for us to treat ourselves all and think twice .
&quot; I knew that I am not going to put my dog on the screen , &quot; Sadeiko is talking about his self @-@ cleansing .
I was able to turn a clean page and move on with a new impetus .
Treener Anne hill said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of negligence , but he realised that , above all , the sportsman himself had to get to the bottom .
after all , he was so repressed by everyone .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; however , he said he is not giving up and he wants to prove what he is worth , says remember .
now there is some kind of peace .
he will do so to his credit .
the contest came back in May , when the Šadeiko set 6280 points at a new Estonian record at the Götzise multival .
in a high @-@ level competition , he improved his personal top @-@ class bullet with almost a metre ( 13.89 ) and ran a record near @-@ peak curve .
then there was a feeling of multiple competition that it was not at all a ceiling of ability , but it was only the first hunger to be defeated .
he has been instructed for years by a mountain saying that Šadeiko is a Muslim student .
she is ready to be an athlete , she is a good training .
if something does trouble or is wrong , then he says it immediately .
it feels its own body and has confidence in its own sense .
that is what we need to do .
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we follow it .
the new approach has also been found in Šadeiko .
&apos;I am not the one who makes the trend to the maximum &apos; , he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right hour , because it also provides a good result .
baby walks of young children are happy
the good emotion has also offered close luck to Mr Šadeikou .
both his former friend , Maris hill and nurse Grete , recently became parents and has received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;It has been quite interesting &apos; , says Šadeiko .
one alcohol whose drinking is tantamount to &apos; training &apos; .
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is a mother of such a great wine game that he believes that wine gets better trained than any other thing in the world .
Sheperd is a neuroscientist of the University of Yale .
his message is not about alcohol , or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
by crying the wool , by complicating wine , enjoying it and perceiving it , we are putting our brain into work in order to create a taste for wine .
in the words of Sheperdi , water cells do not actually contain tastes , but taste arises from the way wine stimulates the brain .
he makes it a comparison as to how the brain &apos; sees &apos; colour &apos; .
&quot; taste is not wine , taste creates wine as a sweet , &quot; says Sheperd .
things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , the amount of our age , our summer and even the amount of coal produced by man .
Sheperd , of course , admits that wine is not full of Jews .
&quot; there must be more , &quot; he says .
if you take too much longevity , the system will be overloaded .
excess wine drinking can harm brain rather than profit - according to a 2004 study , people who drink more than three glass lines with wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity .
10 % of staff in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay for colleagues
the figures from the staff search company Fontes reveal that 10 % of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia are paid less than their colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , writes the portal Geenius .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay study .
a total of 8 577 posts were examined .
63 % of posts were employed by men .
&quot; while only 3 companies said that the pay gap is in favour of men and that the rest of the companies believed there is no pay gap , in reality , the average salary of men per month is 10 % higher than that of women and the average annual salary of men is 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said Foncrates analysts Ilmar Nordic a .
the &quot; Narcose &quot; advertising clip 3 : now that Pablo Escobar has gone , Netflix hittsara is taking centre stage in Cali cartel .
despite the fact that the killer of Pablo Escobari was exposed in the second season of the &apos; Narcose &apos; , the Netflix sari is far from over .
the third and fourth season has been confirmed by the quota @-@ handling services , and the first has already been produced by a clip of advertising that is strangling the sardines with the new ones .
in the third season , DEA will turn its attention to the richest drug business organisation in the world - the Cali cartel .
they are acting under the leadership of four great Christian fathers , such as Ford 500 companies , simply with more bribery to the government and more violent actions .
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) is leading links with Mexico and Chepe Santaţz London ( Pepe Rapazote ) is operating in New York .
the advertised advertising clip sees Pedro Pascali return to Javier Penana as a person recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement assistance in the war against drugs .
other new players include Matias Varela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .
the third season of the &apos; Narcos &apos; will be open on 1 September .
according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
on Wednesday , the head of the UN mission for Afghanistan said that elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
the leader of the United Nations Assistance Mission , Nicholas Haysom , said that hundreds of women stand for election in local councils , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; emphasising the importance of women &apos;s role cannot be exaggerated , &quot; he said in his statement on Wednesday .
elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process .
local council elections in Afghanistan and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coincides with the transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is transferred calmly from one democratically elected government to the next .
according to Mr Haysom , women &apos;s strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan is increasing .
according to the independent Election Commission in Afghanistan , 1.2 million women have registered from 3.6 million registered voters .
the joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both large and small .
there is always too little common time , but the trend with the sticks offers a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
and what a convenient solution - wherever you were in the summer , live animals are always accompanied by the summer , and you will remember with your fine voice impatiently : &apos; let us now go to the wall ! &apos;
Asturias with insulation - It is a very good thing to have a normal game of gold or a flag of the coastline .
a single is the foundation for survival in the form of shoes and tuna - who would then like to take the form of sand sleeping from the lakes during the summer ?
it is nice to use children instead of a chicken !
firstly , it is secure and comfortable , and the race is gradually growing at the same pace as the training and force .
it is also possible to make villages with quite large children .
the child teaches the balance , counts the corps and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
larger children can at the same time make their own villages .
the extent of the movement is determined by the land shortage and you are pulling up .
keeping the fingers straight , the ball miniabically properly detained .
the child can read the flames and feel like a lecturer .
the planet is an extremely exciting but hopeless exercise for the child .
but it is easy to do it .
play @-@ plank : take a long planguColonn from which to get through .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much easier to do if , in the meantime , a friend can be given a hand .
if you add the burden , you can keep a planade , a little turf , and you can walk around it .
the additional difficulty is to make a smaller child sit on the trees , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
at the same time as the cracks on the sand , the triggers , the ash and the chlorine meat burden will become as contagious as they were .
a child walks on his feet in such a way that his body is distributed equally in advance and behind .
for security , you can keep your hands in hand .
all walks and sister straight up .
it is possible to fly , cut off , strike a balance and be difficult .
the life of a small engineer is an exhortation if he gets a small deal in every fire .
the extra burden will be pre @-@ empted .
checks to keep the mark in a neutral position .
children themselves have a lot more to do with chlorine meat and plaice .
the batteries and wedding .
follow the child &apos;s safety , the name of the fields , and the hotel in a neutral position .
the favourite and big fun of all children !
for the elderly , however , the whole body trend is truly effective .
the sports tools were Ott ( 10 ) , Säde ( 8 ) , happiness ( 4 ) .
from the Philippines to the heart of the mopeds of the wider world , or the Anlgkot .
Booked bags are the summer class , which has become a product in its own right in recent years , which is even to be hanged at the top of the hand , and which , despite its modest origin , traders have been able to display a price label in line with the mesh .
there is probably one such thing that has existed once in the life of the law and which has not been aroused much emotion .
that is simply there , and if there is no , there is nothing at all .
now , on the other hand , beer bags are making a real race , and moefers have changed their headscarves against simple beer bags for summer months .
this is not only a coastline , but today it is just as popular as a street , and more courageous women even walk it into office .
it is worth making it clear here , however , whether you are still sitting in the summer , or whether you are still paying a sign and a slapping computer to reject a little more official summer .
however , the wealth of tolerance has made beer bags a real summer love for women .
for example , when we read foreign fashion logistics , the first thing is that moeoghurts will prove to be the first thing to do with holiday trips to the local market and obtain some beer bags , which are then the truck of a whole holiday period , and which will be accompanied by beaches , the market and also , as a friend , in the lurking of the city .
some bloggers are even so generous that they buy a heavier wolf on the market and sell or give them to their loyal readers .
in doing so , it is worth noting that there is such a demand among readers that women ( and men ! ) in the real world would probably be involved in each other &apos;s fishing zone in order to become a happy owner of some homes .
in some ways , this madness is also understandable , because it is rare to have these regimes when , in the fashion of yesterday , it has been possible to buy some sort of thing into the haste for just a few EUR 10 .
it is true that white traders have also found a simple way of earning money here , and so more luxury brands are sold for a few hundred and -1 000 euros .
obviously , in order to ensure that the richer customers do not have to feel easy to die , who are proclaiming around with some cheap bags .
for example , Dolce &amp; Gabbana can buy over EUR 1 000 of beer bags .
however , for the interpretation of the Changel bregkot , a sum of EUR 6 000 can be found in the circulation .
however , unlike most of the motives , beer bags do not come from some major Cape Verde , but they were born far from being the case .
it is said that the beer bags come far from the Philippines , where they have been wearing them widely .
there is , in particular , a dumping of exports , and there is very often no mention of local practices .
it is said that the 14 centuries of nursing technique originated and is quite a series of normal corps .
however , since beer bags do not need to be as hard red as corps , they will be accompanied by muscles and other materials that will make the dog more personalised and , by extension , more operative .
for example , in recent times , there are particularly trendy bags in which paints or skins have been thrown in .
however , copies can , in particular , be sent to the actress Jane Birkini , the largest bundled beer of whom had not been seen before .
it was precisely that it sued the beer with all kinds of clothing complex and it did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival .
nowadays , however , the popularity of the applicants does not play a smaller role , nor does it mean that caring for them is a hot head and , unlike all other summer productions , they do not have to be cared for by special means , but also water and wet .
as is still the case with mentoring initiatives , apart from the classical appearance , the brands have come out with all possible interpretations .
for example , if they so wish , they can obtain a red @-@ shirt or a tiny bag .
it is worth remembering , however , that classical beer never goes from mouse , but from beer flu .
but what is the classical beer , then ?
for centuries now , such beverages have been classified as &apos; red @-@ shirts &apos; , which resemble their style corps , have been opened up and are short , as well as beer , crippers .

Aare left in his home town of Kärla on Wednesday evening in an unknown direction .
the brain was the last telephone contact yesterday , Friday evening , and the positioning of the phone was the site of the man on the west island , the village of Myles , from which he was sought with helicopter to the heart of the night and the homes .
he then got his phone empty , and the location of the man was therefore no longer possible .

GMB is concerned about investment at McVitie &apos;s Glasgow plant
the trade union expects the leaders of mature producers and McVitie to be reassured of long @-@ term production plans at the Glasgow factory .
according to GMB Scotland , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment .
more than 500 people work in the case of Hobnobsi and rich know @-@ how and other products .
McVitie &apos;s owner Pladis said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years .
there were workers and trade union chairmen &apos; is the first to hear &apos; when something changes change in the operation of the factory .
in a letter sent to the head of the company , GMB Scotland asked McVitie to &apos; allay concerns about the lack of funding to modernise production lines &apos; .
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the site on the business needs and future investment plan at the time makes our members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely made up of local communities and people around Glasgow , a vital pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social housing .
therefore , in terms of jobs , wages and welfare in the east of Glasgow , and in the Brext , rising living costs and a chronic reduction in production , a thriving production company in McVitie is badly needed . &quot;
the Pladise representative said : &apos; the head of the customs seat only received a letter from GMB Scotten yesterday , and the company will respond directly to him because we value active contact with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers in customs and representatives of the GMB , which openly discussed a number of issues .
we then discussed with the workers that , like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are reviewing our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million on the Customs site , most of which have gone into production routes and improvements in operations .
we fully understand the heritage of customs as a production site and , if there were any changes in the activities of the object , the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach to Neyra ?
la li may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain does not give up in its efforts to attract Neymar into his ranks by making an offer of GBP 189 million for his storage , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquest ?
this vicious approach has opened the summer as a transitional window , and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the current world record of buying more than twice as much as GBP 89 million in the previous season with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester Uniteu .
once the transition has been completed , Neyra will become the world &apos;s most expensive player and , at the same time , the most highly paid professional athletes in the world , who will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from the PSG .
Barcelona is also angry , both because of the approach and the break @-@ up of Neyra , although the source close to the Catalansi leadership confirms that the club has always taken the best care for football since its arrival in Santoise in 2013 .
but did the PSG President warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manchester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blair Agreement in 2014 , Nasser Al @-@ Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who think about recruiting some of the best players in the PSG .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that , when they concern some of our players , we will accept them and contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ Khelaif .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have taken over this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the central player of the PSG , Marco Verratti .
the PSG made it clear that they would not be allowed to leave the level under any circumstances and that Barcelona could become a setback as a result of this interest by removing one of its precious assets in the form of Neyra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Brexitit .
&quot; Brexit is in serious danger of breaking the wool between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Varadkar during his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods , said Varadkar .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , he stressed . &quot;
according to the horror , Britain would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as it fails , will remain part of the European single market .
this would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
another way to make Britain &apos;s departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , Varadkar said : &apos; surely we could have this with Britain &apos; .
the alternative to this would be to return to customs points , which would declare historical division and political failure .
&apos;To bring about trade , prosperity and peace &apos; , the Irish Prime Minister said .
he called Brexitit &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of the daily lives of Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met leaders of the main Irish parties when visiting Belfast .
