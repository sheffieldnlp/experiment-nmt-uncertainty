four members of Cape Verde Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to Mr Posselt , the police in Spain detained the leader of the so @-@ called K@@ Cape ro@@ vo group , S@@ las@@ h@@ vi@@ ch Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , who is known in the criminal world under the name of S@@ pin@@ K@@ Cape ro@@ v@@ ski .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch arrested in Spain was arrested on the court &apos;s trial .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
according to suspicion , the so @-@ called &apos; Cape ro@@ vo &apos; criminal Community members aged between 27 and 57 years of life , who commit mainly to drug crimes .
in the province of M@@ ala in Spain , the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained .
in Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of which has been collected according to the criminal community , and two are members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicate that the roles and roles of the criminal community were clearly divided .
the purpose of criminal activities was to commit drug crimes and thus serve the proceeds of crime , &quot; commented on the head of pre @-@ trial proceedings , Public Prosecutor Va@@ gio Ver@@ te .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; added the Prosecutor .
it is people who have previously been involved in the law enforcement authorities , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Ver@@ te stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common@@ place for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; commented on the Prosecutor Ver@@ te .
the head of the central criminal police service , ago Le@@ is , said that detention was preceded by a preliminary investigation of nearly half a year .
&quot; in the first half of the week , the long @-@ term work was realised and , at the same time , in Estonia and Spain , we suspected of crimes , &quot; said .
Le@@ is added that central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have a good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil card .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are yet another message to criminals that we can also get them from another European search , &quot; said Le@@ is .
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that , in the absence of a doubt , men can continue to commit new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office requested their arrest and the Court also approved it .
a man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
in the context of this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized in order to ensure confiscation .
the criminal court proceedings are carried out by the central criminal police Office for organised crime and led by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the city &apos;s city of Tallinn was sentenced to blackmail in 2005 and punished him with a five @-@ year imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ š@@ it was held the second most important man in the criminal world in Estonia following the Mar@@ ath@@ ko@@ v , Mr Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , from Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch from Cape Verde , emerged from the Estonian Union at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Ad@@ mittedly , he was tax@@ ing tax@@ i drivers and prostitution and demanding a monthly tax on business@@ men .
international joint operations , the confiscation of criminal proceeds and the entry into force of judicial decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest court rulings , the so @-@ called &apos; D@@ ik@@ a@@ ye@@ v criminal &apos; , eight accused persons who have been confis@@ cated by EUR 80 000 in criminal proceeds , or the judgment against nine persons in 2006 , that Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v created a criminal community aimed at illegal trade in cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in Eastern Vir@@ u@@ land and in southern Estonia .
there is a total of EUR 71 500 of the confis@@ cated criminal income there .
in these criminal matters , it has been a success that police officers exchange information and prosecutors every day with foreign colleagues and , if necessary , act together in any case in the European Union .
civil rights group war@@ ns of Mis@@ tral travel
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ tes of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ Ps ) has warned the people of the Muslim state of Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ i for discriminatory policies and racist attacks .
in the statement of the Group , the &apos; Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i State of the State of NA@@ SR &apos; , which applies until 28 August 2017 , calls on all the African Americans to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious when moving around the country , taking into account the suspi@@ cious racial events that have recently taken place in the state and at this point &apos; .
according to NA@@ Ps , the group urged the group to issue a travel warning , both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that the state of law targets for the purpose of the law of the State &apos;s law is , to a large extent , minorities .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
they are being drawn up because of their sk@@ in colour , beaten or killed , &quot; said R@@ od Cha@@ pel , President of the NA@@ P , The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints before . &quot;
this is the first such warning that has been issued by the organisation of the US State .
the group referred to events such as racist insul@@ ts against black students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of 28 @-@ year @-@ old mus@@ ici@@ ans from T@@ en@@ nes@@ ta .
the S@@ and@@ ers died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year after he had run through the state of petrol and the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police arrested without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the comment refers to the recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which shows that in the state , the cars of black car drivers are hal@@ ted by 75 % more likely than those of white drivers .
&apos;@@ The comment is for people to be aware and to warn their families , friends and collabor@@ ators for what might happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is , &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it is to be involved in the bail @-@ out or to inform relatives that they are going through the state . &quot;
according to the latest figures from the F@@ B@@ I hate crime programme , 100 hate crime crimes were documented in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is in 2015 , which places the state in a country &apos;s cross @-@ border position in terms of the number of similar offences .
the travel warning is also a response to the new law of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which makes it difficult for a company to be brought to court for reasons of discrimination in search of housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had previously issued travel barriers to T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona , following the adoption by these states of immigration laws , which obliged local authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration , because , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , it increases racial profiling .
usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or inc@@ in@@ eration , may be caused by five different - A , B , C , D and E he@@ pati@@ tis .
all these vir@@ uses highlight the acute bur@@ st of the li@@ ver .
however , the worst cost is chronic B and C he@@ pati@@ tis , which can develop into a cir@@ cus , or a li@@ p , a li@@ p and a li@@ ver cancer .
the epidemi@@ ology Ad@@ vis@@ er of the Health Agency , Ku@@ ul@@ o Ku@@ usa@@ r , is saying that acute he@@ pati@@ tis disease is the same for all types of li@@ ver inc@@ in@@ eration - f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ gue , rub@@ b@@ ish , birth , o@@ liberalisation , cru@@ el@@ ty , grey emissions , horse mackerel , meat and excess pain , and s@@ wine and li@@ mas@@ ters .
the last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of the li@@ ver bur@@ ner .
children can undergo he@@ pati@@ tis without disease .
the various species of combustion can only be identified on the basis of laboratory research data .
extreme he@@ pati@@ tis can go to chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and go for decades without disease , which means that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous disease .
Mr Ku@@ nil@@ r highlights different forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their cul@@ mination more closely .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading from a disease to humans and infec@@ tious us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , on the way to the sex , on the hands of the infected person and on food , soil , objects , contact and consumption of drugs .
a he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis was carried out by family members and carers , people suffering from chronic pay , sex people , sex men with men , drug users , the high spread of he@@ pati@@ tis A .
vaccination can be prevented by vacc@@ inations , in particular by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot and he@@ pati@@ tis A risk group .
in addition , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands , before eating food , to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
he@@ pati@@ tis vi@@ ral vir@@ uses spread to the blood of the sick man , drug injec@@ tion , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic , au@@ g@@ mentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated sites ( too@@ th@@ era@@ pe@@ ts , pregnancy facilities ) , donor blood , he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , sex with the person of he@@ pati@@ tis and he@@ pati@@ tis suff@@ e@@ rers .
the he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis risk group includes drug users , sex partners of infected people , sex men , new@@ born mothers , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , healthcare , rescue workers and police officers , and passengers visiting countries with he@@ pati@@ tis B .
in order to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis , it is possible to vacc@@ in@@ ate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vacc@@ in@@ ate people from risk groups and , in addition to chronic pay @-@ related diseases , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
he@@ pati@@ tis other preventive measures are : refrain from the hygiene and man@@ ure of stran@@ gers , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ gic @-@ coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors , toma@@ toes and au@@ g@@ mentation , and the use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection , or prevention of sexual risk @-@ taking .
vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis is part of the national immun@@ isation scheme in Estonia and free of charge for children .
He@@ pati@@ tis C vir@@ uses spread when dealing with the blood of a sick person , drug injec@@ tion , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic , au@@ g@@ mentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated fo@@ et@@ uses , donor blood , he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , sex sex and he@@ pati@@ tis hospital for animals / new@@ born babies .
C @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ infected drug users , sex partners of infected people , sex men , inf@@ ant inf@@ ant mothers , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids are exposed to health , rescue workers and police officers , HIV @-@ infected persons and passengers visiting countries with he@@ pati@@ tis C .
C he@@ pati@@ tis preventive action is : refrain from the hygiene and man@@ ure of stran@@ gers , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ gic @-@ coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ot@@ teries , g@@ oo@@ king and au@@ g@@ mentation , and the use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
A@@ he@@ pati@@ tis is caused by he@@ pati@@ tis D virus , which is multi@@ plying in the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
this is due to the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B , with he@@ pati@@ tis B or super@@ information , of chronic B he@@ pati@@ tis .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading exposure to blood and other body liquids , contaminated with need@@ les @-@ coun@@ ters , sexu@@ ally and rarely infected animals .
d he@@ pati@@ tis risk group is chronic B he@@ pati@@ tis vi@@ ral and non @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis B people .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis B , which also protects people from infection with he@@ pati@@ tis D virus .
he@@ pati@@ tis vi@@ ral vir@@ uses spread by fe@@ e@@ ble means of drinking water and food , including low heat @-@ treated animal meat , fish and marine car@@ b@@ ons , donor blood , joint sy@@ stal@@ ls and infected animals .
passengers can be infected with high levels of he@@ pati@@ tis E in countries .
E@@ pati@@ tis preventive measures are the enforcement of hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands after boarding , prior to food production and feed , after the care of the sick .
F@@ ru@@ its and vegetables are was@@ hing before consumption , to avoid eating little hot @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , only safe drinking water and to avoid drug consumption .
although the last round of competitors tried to get rid of a four @-@ fold Olympic winner , 34 @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ara@@ h final s@@ gel found strength and won 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
the F@@ ara@@ h did not think long enough , after the fin@@ alists , with the hus@@ band T@@ ania and children .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much welcome my family .
it was wonderful to be with them , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h is targeted in London at the fifth edition of 5 000 and 10 000 metres of gol@@ den du@@ mp .
all of this is possible if it is believed .
despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ norm in Da@@ am gold , G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti , the extraordinary story of A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , the extraordinary story of &apos; one art works from birth to the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna &apos; .
however , more closely in history .
the inf@@ lam@@ matory information on the subject would perhaps have been watered down in the b@@ ud , a narro@@ wer subject would have been allowed to have more influence on the extraordinary nature of the title .
at the moment , it would be like two books : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti and his pain@@ ting &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , the story of A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , and a much larger and more comprehensive history of the H@@ on@@ ourable Jewish families and the German occupation , with its subsequent effects in Austria .
the first third of the book is in the middle of a w@@ ed@@ ding Vienna cultural life and who , in the Austrian capital itself , can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago life was going around R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ s , or how the Cen@@ tr@@ ali coff@@ ee turned all its heads when the climate was introduced .
the concentration of cultural charac@@ ters was high in one of the rich@@ est cities in Europe , and when you see the name familiar with the book , some of them seem to be more cultural than a gram .
at the same time , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a city where un@@ treated ar@@ son and the highest level of suicide in Europe was , as if nothing else , it adds to development .
or perhaps , however , every couple of couples &apos; li@@ ps will add to the cultural life of the 20th century in Vienna .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had explo@@ ded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
the S@@ aj@@ an@@ di@@ um was almost one in ten people in Vienna .
parents were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time when the aid for A@@ s was opened twice by the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ te Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch@@ every and the Kli@@ m@@ man in his famous pain@@ ting , his father had already become the seventh largest bank in the H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg E@@ mp@@ ire E@@ mp@@ ire .
however , the A@@ de@@ let &apos;s life , which he belon@@ ged to , has not been drawn up .
if you look at the &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end @-@ of @-@ life infection was a more beautiful socialist and dream of a trip to the Soviet Union .
for 19@@ 0@@ 3 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s luggage from the Kli@@ m@@ ti@@ tis , the last moment was the pain@@ ting mak@@ er in Vienna .
the cli@@ m@@ t paid at the time 4 000 kro@@ on , a quarter of the price of a good location for the rural house .
the fact that there was a suspicion of the mo@@ del@@ li of the mas@@ ters of the mas@@ ters , the sugar mag@@ na@@ ti , was not discoura@@ ged .
as far as the dele@@ tion is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between the mo@@ del@@ li and the ar@@ tist created during the work continued to the end of life .

just before the start of the work with the A@@ dele@@ ga , Mr Ra@@ ven@@ nas San V@@ ita@@ le was in charge of telecommunications , and the investi@@ g@@ ators think that it was precisely there that the wonderful mo@@ sa@@ rs of the mo@@ sa@@ ic E@@ as@@ ter , The@@ o@@ dor@@ a , gave an artificial idea of making a gol@@ den t@@ ree as a gol@@ den piece of fashion .
the Kli@@ m@@ t presented his &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; in Vienna in 19@@ 08 and at the same time ( in 19@@ 07 @-@ 19@@ 08 ) , one of the gol@@ den land &apos; S@@ novel &apos; was born .
artistic his@@ tori@@ ans did not notice the simil@@ arity of two women .
how does Hitler relate to nature ?
&quot; I think that , in my friend , Mr Kli@@ m@@ ti , I am ow@@ ed to him to make his work available to the public , &quot; wrote A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer a couple of years after the departure of the ar@@ tist ( Kli@@ m@@ t died in February 19@@ 18 ) to the Director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere muse@@ um , and wanted their family to go to the muse@@ um .
six years before the death penalty , the Kli@@ m@@ l had been drawn up .
he also asked for the hus@@ band to leave his two sports courses and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti landsca@@ pes to the Austrian Gal@@ special .
in his tru@@ ths , he gave the floor to Mrs Mari@@ ana and Mr Lu@@ i .
one year after the cli@@ m@@ t had finished the &apos; Austrian Mon@@ a lisa &apos; , it had attempted to escape from the Vi@@ in Ka@@ w@@ art de A@@ ka@@ de@@ mine , Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , but failed to be a foot@@ note .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is considered to be the reason for the Jewish profes@@ sors not to be admitted to the anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism , none of his cul@@ min@@ ers was actually Jewish .
in any case , the Austrian Gal@@ special task referred to in the case of Maria Maria Gal@@ special had changed considerably by 19@@ 39 , which had become important in the search for the work of the Vienna rich Jewish art colle@@ ctions .
Hitler &apos;s personal art mus@@ ici@@ ans also had some work at home , but not those of the Kli@@ m@@ ti .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the artistic rob@@ ber@@ y of the Naz@@ is , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute between the Austrian Government and the he@@ irs of B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer .
in this regard , it should be noted that if &apos; S@@ novel &apos; is seen in Vienna in Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ er &apos;s &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; must be seen to travel to New York to Ne@@ ue Gal@@ special .
and before Vienna , the aforementioned book will also be read .
even if you do not plan to look at the work of the climate , because at least my emo@@ tion , after the closure of the book , was more Nazi and Jewish than the ma@@ gic and mode@@ ll A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer re@@ sold for USD 135 million .
so , not so much a t@@ ree , rather than a ma@@ gic emb@@ assy - and a very moving story .
it significantly facilitated the orientation of the events at the beginning of the book of the Bau@@ dis &apos; relatives .
17 @-@ year @-@ old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonia &apos;s record
in the event of life , gold was very close to the personal record of its own 200 m se@@ li@@ flow@@ ing , flooding 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 .
the Ti@@ pp@@ mark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ old pirates every week since the Canadian cheese Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships received 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 , the Pri@@ it A@@ ope &apos;s U@@ ju@@ gation blo@@ g .
in the last instance , ten years &apos; A fin@@ alists &apos; .
in Fin@@ ally , he went through a distance of 2.@@ 15.@@ 76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful top @-@ level .
A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or@@ n , Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) remained a little over half a second .
Estonia &apos;s all @-@ time ranking rose by the third , and its fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of all the times in Estonia .
the young hope of the future lies in the launch of Canadian adult Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships of 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in bal@@ bal@@ ls and 200 m@@ m and 400 m@@ m .
last week , Canadian cheese champi@@ on@@ ships took place in Tor@@ onto , and gold made successful start @-@ ups there .
he won 200 m in a sil@@ ver bul@@ let with 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
so quickly , this distance was sw@@ am@@ ped by the last year in 2008 .
the Gol@@ f has gone through faster than ever in Estonia only a record Estonian record of E@@ lina Par@@ evi@@ ka .
in Canada , a vibran@@ t guardian won 100 m me@@ dal in the bal@@ tu@@ lation of a wonderful personal record and 5@@ 6.@@ 66 of the new Estonian season .
for example , the old Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k of his year has distan@@ ced it by just one century more quickly .
in his personal excellence , he reached a further 100 m in the opening of a letter of 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 when he entered into a se@@ am@@ less sw@@ am@@ p .
on a longer distance , he has only reached the seventh place when he became a fin@@ alist 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
gold is currently leading to four different distances from the Estonian season .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics insu@@ red teet@@ h
the holiday time is in the hands of the US President , Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ le .
however , as the T@@ ru@@ mp has so far been one of the President who has taken the most holiday days , the critics are already we@@ aring teet@@ h .
according to the US Guard and CN@@ N , the President intends to have 17 @-@ day leave in the B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , which is located in New Jer@@ se@@ ys .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , the anti @-@ T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i leave has already been spoken for weeks .
they are asking the Olympic Games for too frequent treatment .
it is the President &apos;s practice to spend a week in his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey &apos;s cotton .
incidentally , T@@ ru@@ mp is not the most pu@@ zz@@ led President in his 19@@ 6 term of office .
for example , George W@@ . Bush has already reached 67 days on holiday , Barack Obama has less than T@@ ru@@ mp , but 21 days .
however , things tend to be forgotten quickly by the Olympic Games .
a few days after becoming President , he said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; in T@@ ru@@ mp , so that there will be no time for a long holiday , because there is a great deal to be done .
he also expressed his outra@@ ge about Barack Obama &apos;s leave three years ago .
the current President wrote on Twitter at the time : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , plays a gol@@ f , it is on the brak@@ es and the j@@ ung@@ le concer@@ ts , journalists in the country are in the sun &apos; .
according to the white house officials , 17 @-@ day gol@@ f club visits to pol@@ len have no place .
it is officially called &apos; working holiday &apos; , during which there is no time for the T@@ ru@@ l to read or for other forms of action .
in addition , there was also a second reason for working leave .
it is precisely that the white house is being replaced by a Western @-@ style pension system , and therefore all staff had to leave it .
the West is also located in O@@ val@@ ka@@ c@@ abinet and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West in August , if there are 38 degrees and there is no con@@ scri@@ ption , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , who stressed that the President will continue to work during the holiday period .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp will spend 17 days , you will get an idea of video .
blocking critics from Facebook to do not stand up for the Head of State if you do not tolerate the criticism of the voters .
the father of our country knew a great deal about the unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to turn him into a bul@@ let for everything , from internal politics to his political principles .
of course , he was anno@@ yed by the criticism .
however , he did not force his critics to remain silent .
because , in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and , in dar@@ k@@ ness and silence , we could be led by sheep to the massac@@ res &apos; .
this brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land ku@@ ber@@ ner Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who is struggling to be more in Washington .
the Ho@@ gan has blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the Union for Freedom of American Civil Liberties ( AC@@ L@@ U ) therefore referred to the Court of Justice .
the Ku@@ ber@@ ner officer &apos;s officials te@@ ar the action empty and web commen@@ ta@@ tes s@@ lide away from reactions in a style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos; .
&quot; this is just Facebook , &quot; said many .
but that is what counts .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
it is an ama@@ zing popular re@@ public@@ ist in the democratic state .
his approval rate is the second highest ranking among the country &apos;s 50 Governor .
Ho@@ gan is not an un@@ thin@@ kable response .
it has led the state firmly and remains strictly firm in its principles .
in addition , it has used the main tool in communicating with its constituents quite deliberately on Facebook , for example , after the chemical waste , for the first time in a stu@@ b@@ born presentation of its own ro@@ ck .
thus , the Governor &apos;s co@@ ws are a public forum with a formal label , which is managed by the staff of taxpayers &apos; dollars to block people who are visiting Kenya and , ultimately , dangerous .
in an interview with Mr Ch@@ astel , the representative of the Ho@@ gan press , defended the behaviour of the Governor of the Governor , claiming that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a mo@@ del@@ ling .
however , it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet trol@@ lers on the web , spa@@ w@@ ers or people full of hatred .
the post spoke to a number of people who have been blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and that is what they are the people who are in contact with their elected leaders , the owner of the company and the passport , not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were dis@@ respectful , thought @-@ out and not at all .
Mr Pas@@ tor quoted the Bi@@ ble in his post , with the emphasis placed on the Catholic Church .
the lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ m Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not insti@@ gate hatred , but rather hate crime .
&quot; I said poli@@ tely that I am disappointed , because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &apos; he wrote The mail news story in the heading .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , when many people comment on the same subject , some of them immediately call it an indifferent collective effort , rather than acknowledging that this is a great deal of concern with citizens . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s office called &apos; targeted spa@@ m attack &apos; would probably invite others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era allows messages to be easily mat@@ ised by simply blocking criticism or dele@@ ting a negative comment .
it is a much cleaner thing than the old , when the workers had to be sent out to do the same , so that they gather newspapers with critical edit@@ orial letters and bur@@ n them or arrest protest@@ ors and forced them to remain silent .
however , that is exactly what is happening now , just digita@@ lly .
the Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has brought to court Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter &apos;s stream .
one of the first signs of court rulings on this subject was made last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
Mr James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is decided in Alexand@@ ria that the chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control of the Coun@@ ty of Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i has violated the first revision of the Constitution , when he blocked the vo@@ ter from his Facebook page .
Mr K@@ tu@@ ck@@ ys visited the AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter for the use of him , Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in@@ it ( R ) .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar impact on the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters da@@ red in his way of leadership .
and even then Washington had to face anon@@ ymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers such as Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , making the decisions of Washington land .
according to the historical documents collected by George Washington , the web @-@ based George Washington project , he sw@@ am@@ ped the c@@ abinet with petitions criticising his views on the British friendship , trade and shipping agreements .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , special opinions and debates are the foundations of our country .
and the right leadership means accepting this .

&quot; the players see the path in their best shape , it is in a bri@@ lli@@ ant state .
Jer@@ ry has done an excellent job in building this place .
he is a keen supporter of gol@@ f games and is proud of what has been achieved here .
this will allow the path to be presented perfectly . &quot;

&quot; this is a very special feeling , &quot; said Sou@@ th@@ por@@ tis &apos;s be@@ ating player .
&quot; I could not defend my Ex@@ t@@ rema@@ du@@ ra O@@ Antwerp title because it was taken off after a year after my victory .
it is natural to come back to this chic@@ ken .
this is an excellent place to play a gol@@ f .
I remember the memor@@ ies of last year , and my wife , Mrs Shar@@ on , was a special victory for last year .
this was a very special time , which we will always be at the heart of our hearts . &quot;

&quot; it is always a little more meaningful to play at home , &quot; said Hel@@ en@@ s@@ bur@@ gh man Or@@ r .
&quot; Denmark had a good deal to do , but at the same time , you also have an additional feeling .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and I have shown quite a decent gol@@ f game .

the Indon@@ esi@@ an in Papua province P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , the capital of the Mun@@ ici@@ pality of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , places the house in the house of a house in the place of direct fire in the local language .
in half an hour &apos; time , the coal @-@ fired slu@@ dge will be taken from fire and s@@ kin@@ ned with un@@ be@@ arable hands .
the De@@ ge@@ i is sitting on the other floor of the fur@@ ni@@ ture of fur@@ ni@@ ture , and yet it is also doing its daily ho@@ mework , for example , was@@ hing the b@@ ath water from a ne@@ ar@@ by sex .
the role of the ho@@ le will be played by un@@ scrupulous support .
since he is the four women of his hus@@ band , he has not been appointed to take care of any contempt .
Pol@@ y@@ ga@@ a@@ mia is common here on May .
it may be dangerous to work late , however , most of the men of the village are unemployed and many of them drink hard , and there are still soldiers here .
&quot; no one da@@ res to go around after five o &apos;@@ clock in the village , &apos; he says .
this is a rare pilot in Papua mä@@ ki , which is the former Dutch col@@ ony , which was brought under Indonesia in 19@@ 69 after a referendum , which was forced to vote in front of the forces .
the movement towards the government of the Netherlands , which has freed up the power of the people of the Netherlands , is fast @-@ track against the government of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , which is still keeping the region under its strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially split into the P@@ ope and the Western P@@ ope , so that the independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island .
the majority of the whe@@ el is both remote and abandoned , and in order to arrive here , 90 minutes from the capital of the province , Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ i , and then go through a five @-@ hour journey with a ren@@ tal car .
there is no public transport .
the city of around 19 000 inhabitants is made up of t@@ ree houses surrounded by b@@ ars and covers la@@ in@@ ous iron ro@@ of@@ s , which have been converted into different tone for the y@@ el@@ low bo@@ xes .
very few indicators have taken place here , not to mention journalists , and there have been hardly any foreigners here .
prior to the arrival of Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago pa@@ ints a God called T@@ ame@@ e .
there were also other changes .
&apos;@@ We were not used to wear such clothing &apos; , &apos; says De@@ ge@@ i , referring to our col@@ our@@ ful approach to the market , to the plu@@ g and to the private sector .
&quot; before that , we have only had a plant cow . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
however , it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
just 100 km away from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , which is a mountainous province with 153 000 inhabitants of New Jer@@ sey , is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , G@@ ras@@ berg , which belongs to F@@ bet@@ g Mc@@ Mor@@ an , a company operating in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x@@ is .
in 2015 alone , around USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ ies were extra@@ cted from F@@ re@@ port .
in addition , it will be possible to gal@@ van@@ ise the supply of consumer timber , which is estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are the source of the suffering of boats , as they result in the presence of a powerful Indon@@ esi@@ an army .
the New York Times 2005 study showed that F@@ re@@ port payments in the period 1998 @-@ 2004 cost local military and military units around USD 20 million , including USD 150 000 to one of the officers .
P@@ ope attempts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den and are rou@@ tin@@ ely re @-@ rou@@ ted .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 69 , and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the army in Indonesia .
according to the Committee on Human Rights in Asia , the mass killing of the genocide in Papua tri@@ bal moun@@ tains in the 1970s was a measure of genocide .
last year alone , over 3@@ 900 peaceful protests were arrested by the police in Indonesia .
the 2016 report on &apos; We will lose all &apos; by Burma &apos;s Ar@@ ch@@ bis@@ ho@@ p , contains testi@@ mony to the atrocities committed in the past year , such as extra@@ judicial executions , torture ( one second report shows that rape and electric shocks are particularly widespread ) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; the number of victims is difficult to read , because such incidents will take place every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , a research@@ er of Human Rights Watch .
K@@ ru@@ ms are still more strongly closed because Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new settlements from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing because of the Muslim economic migrants coming from the inhabitants of Indonesia , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ es islands .
P@@ rin@@ ce s@@ ongs are sold in the gallery and with mixed vegetables to ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do , which are ser@@ ted together with the ground level .
local cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started to sell chic@@ ken and vegetables from local boats on the traditional market , &quot; explains the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ita@@ lians born in the P@@ ani@@ a@@ is who worked on behalf of the province of Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ i .
&quot; Sy@@ ri@@ ans Fron@@ ma@@ ma @-@ ma@@ ma &#91; women &#93; will therefore lose their market share . &quot;
the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , who is known as Jo@@ ko@@ w , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to address these inequalities and human rights violations in P@@ ope .
the former pu@@ mp won the presidential Pal@@ ace in Papua 29 constitu@@ encies 27 , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
however , the P@@ ope has changed very little and the local feel chea@@ ted .
&quot; our hearts have been broken , because in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes in terms of restoring justice , &apos; says .
in fact , only two months after the resigna@@ tion of Jo@@ ko@@ w in October , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i was in a low position .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the Roma were s@@ inging to Christmas , when two Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers were blin@@ ded by a motor@@ cycle .
children have told them that they should be included in the front lights .
according to the words of the local passport , Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ eba@@ i , one of the soldiers insul@@ ted their voting tone and later returned to four soldiers .
according to victims and specta@@ tors , in drink @-@ driving soldiers , children were driven by children and beaten them with their gun@@ s .
then one of the soldiers shot among children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , was so cruel that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , the building of the close electoral Commission was bur@@ nt down , and the next day , things were even more .
around 1 000 young men , women and children gathered in a football pit@@ ch in front of the local police and military management centre in order to demand justice .
they were carrying out direct repair chi@@ ps and presented Papua me@@ e pa@@ go to wa@@ ita @-@ tan@@ ts@@ u , during which poultry s@@ ongs were bu@@ ried around and bu@@ ried .
some prote@@ sters started to le@@ cture the police and the military .
&apos;@@ I@@ f the mass of the population shows more than three times resistance , let them down , &apos; it was said in a formal document that has seen a magaz@@ ine , but which has not been issued to local media publications .
the city of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , the oldest city of Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ me ( 56 ) , felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained , asking for a crow@@ d to go home .
nobody was willing to listen .
&quot; turning me to the left , I was suddenly shot in the left , &quot; he said in his magaz@@ ine at the time of the t@@ reas@@ ure of a t@@ ree in his German col@@ ours .
we still do not know who the fire was , but it says that the soldiers &apos; ri@@ gs gathered in the month came from .
&quot; there was a lot of people , a lot of children in the House , adding it .
the local man , Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , has been killed three times , according to a wit@@ ch .
&quot; I would like to come to him and in his body to make sure that it is with him , &quot; said the magaz@@ ine at Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who uses only one name in many of the indicators .
&quot; I saw that he has died ... S@@ novel le@@ ta . &quot;
the chief inspe@@ ctor of Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said to repor@@ ters that he was only responsible for the security of his department , as it was attacked .
&quot; we must protect ourselves if we are threatened to kill , &quot; said Vice @-@ President P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , the spokes@@ man of Papua police , in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ors were killed and many injured .
the news about the killings reached J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta@@ il only next day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra made a passion@@ ate speech where he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses that took place in P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that he would introduce an ADR mechanism to address human rights crimes .
however , almost immediately , ex@@ cus@@ es were also followed .
&quot; most crimes happened long ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and the early 1990s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
on 5 June in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas , on 5 June , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to with@@ drew his words , saying that he has no intention of creating a P@@ ope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything will be resolved by law &apos; .
the W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in relation to the death of more than 1 000 people in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved , including what happened in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i have adopted such claims with a g@@ loom@@ y mistrust .
&quot; I have been heard four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that , years later , fear is still alive .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I fear that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I am shot . &quot;
his bro@@ ther Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed the opinion that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are afraid of this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bur@@ y four victims .
&quot; after the bur@@ ying of the bodies , the army had to look at me , &apos; he says .
the celeb@@ rations have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the inhabitants of the village of Indonesia were shot in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ is , neighbouring P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
one person was killed and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , when he went to war between the inhabitants of the villages and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an un@@ conscious man to hospital .
this male people , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ w@@ ned into a ne@@ ar@@ by river , died on the road to hospital .
the recent village &apos;s inhabitants prote@@ sted at the site of the company &apos;s office .
according to the police , the people of the villages were st@@ oring the police , which was followed by the latest aler@@ ts .
however , according to the local authorities , mobile Bri@@ tons ( Indonesia &apos;s military police ) started to shoo@@ t at the people , killing one person .
&quot; we were in great panic , we are afraid of reven@@ ge , &quot; said 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and saw the in@@ se@@ ct of those injured .
&quot; I have beaten myself two days in my own house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i Parliament has called for the police officers involved to be held accountable and for the withdrawal of the police from the area of mobile Bri@@ gade .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ i has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development fe@@ eds the dis@@ satisfaction of the me@@ als , m@@ oni , dan@@ s and da@@ m@@ mal tri@@ bes living in Papua bad .
many of them have joined the army of Liber@@ ation ( V@@ PL ) insur@@ gency , which , according to its own , protects the rights of boats , by organising attacks and kid@@ napp@@ ings among the Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers .
some V@@ PL leaders come from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , the army , under the pretext of protecting the sovereignty of the country , has been arrested in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i over recent years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them never appear again .
among the people of Papua people , P@@ ani@@ ans are known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty fe@@ eds dis@@ satisfaction .
the low ri@@ ce that is sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
the Lei@@ b is the same un@@ available .
people are growing all their food themselves , mainly at the hel@@ m , in addition to a little fruit and vegetables .
farming is the work of women , each of whom can care for four or five base fields .
they usually keep most of the harvest to the family , the rest is sold on the local market .
ten ba@@ ta@@ tes cost only 10 000 Indon@@ esi@@ an sites ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have deepen@@ ed between in@@ shore boats and new migrants , who have arrived at the N@@ ab@@ ire airport from the opening of new flight routes .
these few jobs , which exist , go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
the P@@ ope himself often does not have the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the village because there are no jobs and no money , &quot; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , Chairman of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ bal Council .
segregation keeps the eyes of the world away from the P@@ ope .
in addition , strict restrictions on foreign media remain .
at the beginning of this year , French journalists , Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ bridge L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp , were expelled from the P@@ ope , because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they had been given a rare film licence .
according to the Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch , P@@ com@@ m K@@ ine , the Vice @-@ President of the Asian department , has failed to implement Jo@@ ko@@ w &apos;s election promises to lift the restrictions on transparency and development reports .
&quot; in Indonesia , journalists from the most eastern provinces and the Western P@@ ope reports are threatening to face new threats to the rejection and black@@ listing of a visa , &quot; he said in a statement .
the lack of a press watch means that international pressure on the government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua near neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries were encouraged by T@@ on@@ ga , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ pain , Mar@@ shall Islands and Sol@@ om@@ on Islands to examine the &apos; various wide @-@ ranging crimes &apos; in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the same countries have historically supported V@@ PL .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed the accusations of a group by saying J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas to journalists : &apos; Indonesia still applies democratic order and freedom of the press so that evidence of human rights cases is difficult to bur@@ y &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to notice .
when the Dutch official delegation visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra on 4 May Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra , the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , was interrupted by the local people at the meeting , but the source of anon@@ ymous desire to remain silent , urging : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , the new presidential elections will take place in 2019 , but the boats do not believe they will vote in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w again .
&apos;@@ Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man with good intentions , but the people around him who are involved in the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i &apos; say &apos; Ho@@ ba@@ i , President of the Council &apos; .
he wants to give Jo@@ ko@@ w to understand that , in addition to the fact that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are constantly living under the threat of a pre@@ da@@ tory army , they are suffering from poor education and health services .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , like other boats , regard their voice to Jo@@ ko@@ w as a debt that has to be paid .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite the mis@@ fortune and intimidation , the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i fire were still coping with the last symbolic objection to the landing of one victim &apos;s body of police and the army in response to the land .
knowing that justice may never be put on its feet , they will at least not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a halt .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
ne@@ eding Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch &apos;s pil@@ l for the second time .
on Friday , there was one of the world &apos;s most senior housing stor@@ ms in Du@@ ba@@ i , forcing hundreds of people to escape from this 3@@ 37 me@@ tre and 79 regular buildings .
this is the second fire that has been ra@@ va@@ ged in just two years , which is being called on to happen in Tu@@ rin , or T@@ us@@ vi@@ ku@@ r .
the building was evacu@@ ated , none of the injuries were reported and there were no direct fire @-@ related causes .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and wake up to the fires and people &apos;s fears .
we would be waiting for a t@@ ree and we took around 10 minutes to get down to the 50@@ th order , &apos; said to the Re@@ u@@ ter@@ ans one person who called himself George &apos; .
according to Du@@ ba@@ i civil protection officers , fire fighters were also deleted at around 4 o &apos;@@ clock this morning at local level ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and ja@@ iled the building .
the government said that they are working to ensure shelter for those affected .
this incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on high @-@ level external soil in the world .
during the investigation carried out by the steering Board in Tor@@ ch after the 2015 fire , it was found that the most damage was suffered by As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans - the de@@ cor@@ al panels and isolation of the external surface .
the British police have said that they believe that the London G@@ ren@@ portfolio T@@ ow@@ er isolation and a fast @-@ track panel could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June , which killed around 80 people .
see : these phones are likely to be sold in the autumn
language and heart are the time for technological games , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um came to sale , as well as in the autumn , new h@@ it@@ t telep@@ hon@@ es are expected .
according to the Tele@@ 2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Se@@ mother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by an innovative design , an eye @-@ fast s@@ ner , a ser@@ ser @-@ servan@@ i 4@@ K resolution on the screen and the ultra @-@ fast process .
Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , which has also reached the top of Estonia &apos;s smar@@ t@@ phone sales table , was a great e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant in the tech world .
in the autumn , it will allow for a more ti@@ dal high @-@ speed char@@ ger , a more resilient , high @-@ quality camer@@ as and greater water and customs security .
he added that , on the basis of rum@@ ours , you can already specu@@ late and predict the four top models that are likely to be con@@ qu@@ ered by the streets .
these four smar@@ t@@ phone excellence models will reach po@@ pp@@ ers in the autumn of this year .
the expected i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach po@@ lep@@ han@@ ts in mid @-@ September .
however , what the new Apple model looks like , and what it can do , is spreading a lot .
if the i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not lead to significant differences between i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , Apple &apos;s tenth birth@@ day is expected to see the new model completely separate from previous ones .
there has been talk of four col@@ ours : black , white , ro@@ ck and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the entire telephone front , has lost their homes and fingerprints have been built on the screen .
Apple &apos;s design director J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve demands that the new i@@ P@@ hone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk of the i@@ P@@ hone version .
in addition to the horizon , the un@@ man@@ age@@ able charging and even higher quality camer@@ as can be expected to accelerate the A@@ 11 process .
it is certainly one of the most expected smart phones in the year .
the prior order of the new model G@@ ala@@ x@@ y will start on 23 August .
there has been a lot of rum@@ ours about what the new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y is going to see .
Ad@@ mittedly , even more business users are meant , and the S pen will allow even greater fun@@ ction@@ alities .
the Tele@@ fon@@ t should have two camer@@ as , one of which is a la@@ in@@ ur@@ t and the other with a narro@@ wer view of television content .
at the moment , no one knows what two of the camer@@ as are capable of , but in any case it is the first test of Sam@@ sun@@ g , which is certainly comparable to i@@ P@@ hone 8 in terms of quality .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August .
although Nokia has sold three smar@@ t@@ phones this year with Nokia 6 , there is still a lack of their flag - Nokia 8 , which is already being presented on 16 August .
we are looking forward to 5.@@ 3 @-@ dust scre@@ ens and ultra @-@ fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ nap@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and more resilient a@@ venues .
in case of Nokia , there is also talk of alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and significant levels of water and customs security IP@@ 68 .
like Sam@@ su@@ ng@@ every , Nokia in the new model has two camer@@ a , which is produced by an opti@@ mist company Z@@ e@@ iss .
if S@@ ony &apos;s firm flag has been X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smart phones will be added in the near future , with even more innovative functions .
we expect a smart phone that is slightly more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least the same good or better camer@@ as .
on the new model of S@@ ony , it has been specu@@ lated that its screen is at least hot .
what the reality is , we can already see very soon , because traditionally S@@ ony has unve@@ iled its autumn flag vessel at the International Technolo@@ gical University , IF@@ A , which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September .
according to trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts le@@ ak@@ ed by telephone calls , T@@ ru@@ mp Mexico pressed for the payment of the border wall
the Washington post unve@@ iled the telephone calls between the President of the United States , Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , and the Mexic@@ an and Australia Heads of State .
on 27 January , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ o , the President of Mexico , went to the President of Mexico , to stop public pro@@ claiming that he does not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President , with him , with his public condemnation of the wall , said : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ mp set out his presidential campaign to build a long @-@ term wall and age on the southern border of the United States , so that Mexico is paying for this project .
the trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts were also published in his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l , which reveals an intense debate .
Mr T@@ ru@@ mp said to Mr Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l that the agreement that the United States would take on refugees from Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; stu@@ pid &apos; , and he said that the agreement that was made during the Obama Government would give him the impression of &apos; lead &apos; , because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the T@@ ru@@ mp ended the speech by telling Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l that &apos; this was the most un@@ pleasant speech of the day &apos; .
the Court of Justice did not take a complaint on the case of the city of O@@ C MR@@ P in which the Tar@@ tu city has rejected their offer for bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 20@@ 29 .
this is a letter which rejected the O@@ C MR@@ P city of Li@@ tu Tar@@ tu buses , as the offer did not meet the requirements , explained An@@ neli A@@ pu@@ tin , the President of the Tar@@ tu City Service .
this is the procurement of intra @-@ Tar@@ tu cities for the period 0@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 @-@ 3@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
the city of MR@@ P Li@@ ine referred to the Court of Justice for the decision of the Tar@@ tu Dis@@ tri@@ ct Court .
the national court did not take this procedure .
although many people in the social media complain that the We@@ ek@@ t F@@ esti@@ val is disrup@@ ting their night and the entire city is full of the brak@@ es , there are also many who have no negative say on a lasting festi@@ val .
I am even positively surprised that the super@@ market was so poli@@ te !
I did not see any ambigu@@ ity or cour@@ tes@@ y .
even the Gulf I saw , &apos; says a wave .
&quot; it is good that it is coming , and it is known to be a jo@@ y@@ ss , which is a winter like a winter , &quot; he will gla@@ dly add .
a wave of bul@@ lying from the do@@ se is not destroyed .
if , in the middle of the city , he still heard that music is being played in the ran@@ k , then the music has not yet arrived at his home .
&quot; but I hope I hear , &quot; he will gla@@ dly say .
Mrs Ag@@ nes , too , talks about the fact that the Grand F@@ esti@@ val is rather a good thing for the ski@@ es , which will make a significant contribution to the turnover of local merchan@@ ts .
in addition , it welcomes the fact that the summer capital has come to such a large extent .
the woman of Pe@@ ol@@ ans does not .
although I am no longer on the coast , it is nice that rand has revi@@ ved .
and it is good that the people are moving , and that has been the case three times , &apos; says a woman .
the first time was probably a little worse .

Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revita@@ lise business
the British educational company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that it will cut 3 000 jobs and reduce its interim dividen@@ ds by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to tackle the threat of business .
the jobs that are being created , according to John F@@ all@@ on , are likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , will be accompanied by 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced in May a plan to cut costs by another GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) under the third cost reduction programme , in order to try to revive business that has been hit by the transition to digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell last month &apos;s participation in the Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House to its partner companies Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , said that their expectation for a year has not changed since the 1 % increase in the sales income was announced in the first half of the year to GBP 2.@@ 05 billion .

attack in K@@ abu@@ l : suicide attack killed by NATO soldi@@ er
the suicide bom@@ ber , according to officials , attacked military con@@ vo@@ ys in K@@ abu@@ l , the capital of Afghanistan , killing one NATO soldi@@ er and w@@ ounded several of you .
the NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to local reports , three civilians were also killed in the incident in the town of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi .
this bom@@ bing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in the Her@@ ati mos@@ que attack .
on Monday , two people were killed in K@@ abu@@ l near the Iraqi E@@ mb@@ assy .
the NATO statement said that the explosion of Thursday evening took place when a joint pat@@ ro@@ l with the Afghan army was attacked by &apos; man @-@ made explo@@ sive body &apos; .
according to the statement , everything has been injured in a stable state and is treated in the US military hospital in Bag@@ ra@@ m .
according to the Cor@@ respondents , the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( Mexico ) , are a serious source of concern for the forces in Bag@@ h@@ dad in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi .
according to the UN , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l was killed by at least 30 people in K@@ abu@@ l .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the centre of the city , which is the most deadly military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the President of the United States , Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country &apos;s military and police forces .
according to the Cor@@ respondents , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
the EPA annul@@ led the decision to postpone the regulation after the shar@@ ks
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA ) annul@@ led the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama @-@ Time Regulation , which obliges states to limit emissions from the summer , one day after the 15 states compla@@ ined to court for this process .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday with the designation procedures for the &quot; Ma@@ in content &quot; of 2015 , saying that it shows the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our national partners and listen to them , &quot; said Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t in a statement by the head of the EPA .
the P@@ ru@@ it@@ t had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the rates of share@@ holder content in the various parts of the country , in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to meet the highest standard of air quality in 2018 .
15 mainly democratic states , together with C@@ olum@@ bia , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has tried to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to Mr T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , is part of a broader plan for growth .
however , these efforts have provoked reactions among the democrats and nature conservation groups , who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that the brea@@ thing of ozone @-@ containing air &apos; may reduce the ability of Cop@@ ts to work and increase the risk of res@@ pira@@ tory diseases &apos; , such as as@@ th@@ ma .

German farmers , as well as their European colleagues , have been exposed to any weather this year .

M@@ sole y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ lon@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should be on a col@@ lisi@@ on course in order to face up to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg in the most attractive po@@ ker in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in the ES@@ P@@ N office in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ le@@ in , in separate tobacco , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ winning World Bo@@ un@@ ch Coun@@ c@@ il light champion , the other end of the corridor in order to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , the World Bo@@ un@@ ch sul@@ g@@ weigh@@ ch .
following the unanimous decision by Mrs Gar@@ cia , the victory of the former four @-@ time world champion , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er , on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ time , both comb@@ at@@ ants belong to the top of the table .
Mr Gar@@ cia extended his better hand and said : &apos; how does the summer go , che@@ em@@ pi@@ on ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko protects his bel@@ ts against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 ES@@ P@@ N .
when a couple of photo@@ graph@@ s were found , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko &apos;s memory , E@@ gis Kli@@ mas , said that a possible confrontation between the mili@@ tants would be &apos; perfect &apos; .
&quot; I am a former consul@@ tant , &quot; recalled Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I have been calling for B@@ ron@@ er &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small about 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move down@@ wards .
and he must move towards a ligh@@ ter weight &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
F@@ ans have requested this .
let us give them this . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
in the climate , the question raised was whether it should be worthwhile to look at it ; it is part of its strategy to allow L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to debate the end of this year at 6@@ 1.2 kg in order to make it possible for the next summer to meet with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ vans ) , who also has an interest in fighting Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ li &apos;s match with the winner of the For@@ u@@ val of the easy title of 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as the f@@ ans have called for this confrontation , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , saying later that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial package .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name is able to attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Mrs Gar@@ cia said that she considers L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t to be a &apos; force fighters &apos; and can go to his Saturday match .
however , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was modest in pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia , saying that he felt that the three di@@ vis@@ j@@ on champi@@ ons from the Ri@@ ver@@ pool were &apos; very slow &apos; ; I apologise , M@@ lon@@ y ... you wanted this no@@ distant &apos; .
according to Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show strength and then to bo@@ y .
both confirmed that they feel that the tension between them is increasing .
&quot; this is a fight that looks forward to realising .
no other confrontation aro@@ uses so much attention and s@@ lan@@ der .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters and the M@@ ae@@ y is exactly that .
this is a good fight . &quot;
what is going to be moved from the world &apos;s events to Estonia ?
it extended and issued a record of over 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia , study or family .
if , for example , the soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit to 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , then the figure was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the agencies cannot say how many immigrants will finally remain in Estonia , but this analysis will be drawn up in the Ministry of the Interior .
when nearly 500 Ukrainians per year in Estonia a year ago , in recent years , this figure will be close to 2 000 .
the number of applicants for a residence permit increased expon@@ enti@@ ally during the Ukrainian crisis , with 10@@ 87 people in 2014 receiving fixed @-@ term residence permits , up from 6@@ 75 .
according to the statistical office , in Estonia , the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing most , with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia , more than a Gulf .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been very high in Estonia all the time and , due to difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already in front of the family , the spokes@@ person of the Ministry of the Interior , Kris@@ tin Ram@@ mus .
the number of Ukrainian citizens who have been granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens , even though in 10 years the most fixed @-@ term residence permits have been issued .
if Ukrainians come to work here , Russia &apos;s citizens will be on family migration .
&quot; given this historic Russian community , they are also most likely to have the greatest family ties with the people living in Russia , &quot; said Hel@@ ina Me@@ use , the Internal Protection A@@ ca@@ de@@ my .
&quot; if you look at where the Russian citizens who have received a residence permit from Estonia have moved to live , Har@@ ju@@ land is now Eastern Vir@@ g@@ land , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them have been mar@@ ried with the citizens of the European Union .
soil has been granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 16@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit was reduced .
&quot; compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested for a permanent stay in Estonia , &quot; explained by the press representative of the Ministry of the Interior , Mr Ram@@ on , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years .
a new residence permit for Estonia will be able to apply for at least three years for foreigners who have lived here for the previous year .
its aim is to encourage the attra@@ ction of the people who have been adapted .
however , a long @-@ term resident residence permit requires five years , for example .
for the new residence permit , the extension of the old residence permit has obviously been reduced .
for example , soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to change their work and the Estonian state will no longer be pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit was popular at the same time as the holders of a bad passport ( 10@@ 29 ) , the Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , the Indi@@ ans ( 54 ) and the n@@ ig@@ er@@ ans ( 36 ) .
a total of 19@@ 68 people received a residence permit for Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and the same number of Chinese .
with the first half of this year , the total number of applicants is already 12@@ 69 .
in 10 years , surpris@@ ingly , Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for the Estonian residence permit .
when three residence permits were issued in 2007 , the soil was 200 .
there are lessons to be learned from Nigeria in this university .
the Estonian higher education institutions are also popular , for example , among Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely thanks to learning games .
for them , too , the rule is that where there is a community , there will be others more easily , &apos; added Ram@@ alla@@ h .
in ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , it is about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if you look at the citizens of the European Union , migration will remain around a percentage , &quot; commented on the fact that the figures are actually small .
in total , 14 8@@ 22 people died in Estonia , according to the statistical office , 13 7@@ 92 .
this means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration .
most of them are Estonian citizens , but there are more of them among those who leave them .
this is why Estonia &apos;s citizens &apos; migration balance with 2 000 people was in decline .
Est@@ oni@@ ans , in particular , mig@@ rate between Finland and Estonia .
M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture Pr@@ inc@@ ess of C@@ ou@@ ture tri@@ cks with sa@@ ts , chic@@ k@@ ens and t@@ we@@ ed
however , in the North West of ideas , Maria Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u , there is history - old pain@@ ts and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream of a few hours somewhere in the muse@@ um and ad@@ m@@ ire the old @-@ old thi@@ ev@@ es and cra@@ ts .
if you go along with something , you will study and learn about it every day .
this is a joy of disco@@ very !
the world of C@@ ou@@ ture , which is long ago , may seem to be alien to some , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourself decide how much you are in your life !
as a friend , I have a whole sa@@ il full of the w@@ ounds of cou@@ ture that I have created .
because , and it is not his fault , he does not live in the Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ oo@@ d and does not go on a red bed every day , he wants to wear the most beautiful bro@@ kers , and he is suffering !
you can live your own life special !
the Mo@@ e@@ artificial ar@@ tist does not recognise the gap between the sh@@ ining events and the grey day .
it is this reasoning that put the rolling stock in Estonia into rural areas , between forests and fields , to people who often do not reach the m@@ ood .
for example , a comparison was presented , for example , in J@@ even@@ vis and Per@@ lo mo@@ e@@ alle@@ el , where 45 mo@@ del@@ l King de@@ fi@@ le@@ e filled the whole street .
in Tallinn , there is often a han@@ g in the shop , a young person is s@@ tun@@ ned with dignity , but elsewhere there is more emo@@ tion - s@@ log@@ vo , rising up , you want to thank you .
a large part of the audience was just as news , but now they are the f@@ ans of M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture .
if you over@@ shoo@@ t people &apos;s expectations , they are spiri@@ ted !
and I like this feeling that I am in my mo@@ tive like the summer .
Per@@ nus was a 50 @-@ me@@ tre red car@@ pet , a whole street full of stic@@ kers , it seemed that they would not come to an end !
Mrs Maria also does not recognise the mo@@ tive that animal creation must be presented by a super@@ ficial super@@ ficial , she will be happy to see ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always been happy to come .
after all , this is the la@@ x of experience , the harvest on the Laval stage !
I am so sorry that I have never seen my performance , I am always behind the ground to give things the last meat as a hope@@ less act .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow cal@@ mly to look at the Chamber .
Mrs Maria is this kind of motto , who does not just want to play a representative role , but to be involved in everything .
I have my sis@@ ter in the wind , most of the colle@@ ctions I myself carry out .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to discover .
I am never far from my nature and I am not afraid of work .
it is not limited to the subject , but also to the style , logistics , organisation , organisation - everyone has to ju@@ mp off the day of a woman &apos;s day .
these hours of work are still huge for fana@@ tics .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is simply a day full of joy !
I have been very lu@@ cky - it is like an un@@ stop@@ p@@ able jo@@ ke : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compli@@ ments .
it has been said many times that my bro@@ kers have a land - they make themselves feel like a printing .
the gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ ous gu@@ es@@ ts that Maria talent made known overnight have long been left to date for the C@@ ou@@ ture sign@@ alling .
Mr Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p U@@ 18 boys : the weapon of the Est@@ oni@@ ans &apos; al@@ ag@@ ru@@ pi@@ e is now turned against us .
the damage , the fair@@ y@@ tale , ran out .
the first thing was that we could not get our des@@ k .
and if there is such a big difference in the table , there is nothing to do with the Estonian U@@ 18 cor@@ ps 61 : 75 in Britain , our only N@@ B@@ RA has played a cor@@ v@@ ball , BC Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p .
opponents attacked 28 Pal@@ ace and received so many more attacks .
we were also not prepared for their aggressive defence and attack , it created .
many of the attacks on the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
however , in defence , they have been able to keep their hands everywhere , we could not combine .
it created the team from its feet .
the ho@@ mework of the opponents was better done .
according to M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ pa , Estonia would have to make more tac@@ tical errors in order to take up the anti @-@ insur@@ gency .
the last quarter - we had a zero mistake , but the opponents have already received a number of quick harves@@ ts .
In@@ ad@@ missi@@ bility and a close offensive , which was our weapon on the al@@ ag@@ ru@@ pi@@ tur@@ ni@@ l , now all of us were opposed .
today , we had no strength against their aggressive nature .
the M@@ y@@ r@@ hin@@ t remained satisfied with its neg@@ ligent Kal@@ ev@@ is , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s .
security in general can say good words about the whole team , to date there was a single shock .
it is a pity that such an aggressive response had not already been met before .
T@@ as@@ s has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but it seemed that he was ti@@ red - he has borne quite a heavy burden .
however , he made a very fine move , which I have seen in the past in the tr@@ eng@@ th@@ ens , added a men@@ tor@@ ing .
terrible figures : E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ iri@@ l , in the bas@@ ket of the kid@@ ne@@ ps , thre@@ w less than 10 points ...
the U@@ 18 age classes do not only apply to the young men &apos;s emi B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ tur@@ ni@@ ir in Tallinn , who started in Dublin the day after yesterday .
and Estonia &apos;s game with Poland was , unfortunately , in the area of anti@@ qu@@ ity .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , the situation was 9 : 49 , or only in the last ten minutes , opponents of the gas family and 16 : 16 : 16 .
in both the first and the second quarter , Estonia du@@ mped 4 , third point ...
at the same time , in the first two minutes , the Est@@ oni@@ ans hit two pieces of the first two pieces , but then there were 25 pieces of the game , then one y@@ el@@ low and then 21 to wait ...
perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 fin@@ gers were tab@@ oo .
in addition , 2 points had to be made in four free ton@@ es .
there was a reasonable number of losses in this time , 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland was 33 and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , on the opening day , it had to be recognised 83 : 56 on the right .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement the stocks
today , NATO &apos;s 1 permanent group of mines arrived in Tallinn for a week &apos;s planned port visit to Tallinn , in order to supplement the stocks of ships and prepare for pre @-@ existing exercises .
in the course of the visit , ships are preparing for the landing of the sea , giving cre@@ ws the opportunity for a pa@@ ro@@ gue holiday .
after the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future historic explo@@ sive operations .
&quot; the participation of Est@@ oni@@ ans in NATO and their co @-@ operation in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the alli@@ ed forces , &quot; said Ar@@ to Rein@@ land , the chief of the operation and planning station in the Com@@ pli@@ ance of the Sea fleet .
since 29 June , NATO will be led by a permanent anti @-@ missile group in Latvia , G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , who took over the tasks of the group at the ceremony in Riga from the Estonian naval officer Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as Sel@@ ja@@ b .
the group &apos;s flag vessel is L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , the Latvian naval force , which also operates as a leader of the group .
this semester is also part of the Estonian naval mine mine and anti @-@ fire zone .
as one of the four groups of NATO naval forces under the auspices of NATO , NATO is a permanent mine group of primary rapid reaction teams , which can be sent to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - On 13 August , the P@@ iri@@ ta mon@@ as@@ tery &apos;s mu@@ tu@@ aries will once again become a place where 13 years ago , the ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ las@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , who was called upon to survive by 13 years ago .
this year &apos;s Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val can be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented , according to the Christian leader of the city of Tallinn &apos;s philos@@ op@@ her ( 36 ) .
the risk to J@@ oo@@ st : Cuba will reach the clas@@ s@@ room of Tra@@ vi@@ ata and T@@ os@@ ca , bal@@ le@@ ti@@ la@@ answers from the &apos; B@@ ole@@ ro@@ l &apos; Kar@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ in , and neither will it be possible to produce its own production , which is , this time , Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ n &apos;s wonderful or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra , a response to the same international creative team that brought him to the P@@ iri@@ ta in 2015 . &quot;
Mrs F@@ esti@@ val has much more than just concer@@ ts and theat@@ re answers .
it is more than any music theat@@ re in its normal form .
it is a festi@@ val that takes power and never gets rid of it .
because the experience that the lis@@ ten@@ er receives in this sup@@ erior and sal@@ va@@ ble environment puts human sou@@ ls ring@@ ing and concerns human beings in a way that cannot be described .
the risk is the first year of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val &apos;s art leader .
did the ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ las@@ kin@@ s not feel a little big ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , there has been a lot of help .
he went through my entire student career , and also supported a career at the beginning of the di@@ va@@ tisation career .
perhaps it is thanks to me that it is easier for me to continue his work .
in K@@ las , the team of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has had a great deal of good and , of course , all of this goes on to me .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going .
it is precisely the great heart of the E@@ r K@@ ars that gave me the strength to go well with the city of Tallinn in the Fil@@ harmony of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
and here I am now and I can do it !
what could the audience at the F@@ esti@@ val today , which you offer in particular ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , as a surprise , the first bal@@ le@@ tt written on Mrs L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i &apos;s cheese .
it is &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson l@@ b &apos; .
and one of the no@@ torious nu@@ ances in this regard is that the author of this bal@@ le@@ um is the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser , J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ sons , who himself expressed a desire to write it .
apparently , he has already lived in the Car@@ l@@ sson car@@ a@@ ture of the Kar@@ l@@ sson .
to the risk , how are you all the nu@@ ances ?
thanks to my support for life , I certainly do .
this work needs a system of support and a lot of love , and it is fortuna@@ te that I have a great deal of love .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tions do not depend so much on other people , as I do myself , in other words , how I am going against every new day .
and such an awareness of the tone , of maintaining the positive and , in fact , of laugh@@ ing ourselves into the mir@@ ror of the morning , has made a significant increase in my happy percentage .
in particular , this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen to do so and it works .
the na@@ ming of one@@ self is an act of a@@ mus@@ ing and raising the tone .
that is not just a word .
I think that people do not yet know half of their own body that the univer@@ se offers them , but each of them will be able to discover it gradually .
right now , it is an important moment .
is there any ri@@ tual before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ d was taken ?
there are still , clothing must be replaced against more convenient ones .
this is a small moment for ourselves .
however , in general , I do not have the opportunity to pu@@ mp or make a small stra@@ w before I speak .
in fact , I even like to engage actively with people , even before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di@@ um took place .
but come to Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , what is also to be discovered here is not particularly large @-@ scale and bal@@ le@@ ans .

new results of tests on the age of Swedish asylum applicants were published
in Sweden , among the asylum applicants , the latest results of the test show that more than 80 % of the constitu@@ tions were assessed as older than 18 , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for medicine ( R@@ om@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started with tests at the beginning of this year .
the tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of the age of age after the Swedish Authority for Migration ( I@@ OM ) criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly minors .
to date , 68 8@@ 80 cases have been sent to the tests by Mig@@ ran@@ s@@ ver@@ ket , and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 24 81 tests between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed for 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older , and in 25 cases , the Institute of medicine assessed that the test &quot; may be 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older . &quot;
the 4@@ 32 cases concluded that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if the age of man is questioned .
according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son , who works in the Institute of medicine , the results are consistent with those of previous months .
&quot; we do not see a great difference in comparison with the statistics in previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &apos; he said to the newspaper The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been able to choose their age .
the Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that , in 4@@ 42 cases , &apos; there are references to the fact that a research@@ er is 18 years old or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson ska Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the results of their 581 test , it became clear that in 2@@ 43 cases , the person had stated directly that it would be 18 this year .
the method of assessing the age of medical age , which is carried out by r@@ ö@@ n@@ t@@ gen@@ i@@ ters and types of MR@@ T , and then they are allowed to be analysed by too@@ th@@ ic doctors and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts , has been criticised in some circles .
one of the sceptics is the endo@@ k@@ rin@@ olo@@ gist of the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute , Mr Claude Mar@@ cus , whose work includes the assessment of people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through the normal audience sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measuring method currently used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say firmly , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he said to the newspaper , &apos; he said forestry .
but Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son , the Institute of medicine , defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that the risk of a child &apos;s in@@ accurate release is low .
most of all , perhaps around 10 % , there is a risk if the person is a little under 18 . &quot;
9 signs that you could for@@ give you more expensive .
you were more expensive on Friday and spent a night with someone else .
Su@@ l is wrong , because you have so many nice times and memor@@ ies .
I would like to for@@ give him , but is it the right time ...
Y@@ our Tan@@ go lists nine signs that show that you are more expensive to regret and could for@@ give him .
it seems to be more expensive to understand the seriousness of the situation and to work hard to resolve it .
it is more expensive to deal with the problem that led it to the stream of another .
pay is no longer in a defen@@ sive position .
he sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for his actions .
he is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
it agrees that it has made a serious mistake and is sincerely trying to improve the situation .
he is attentive and is trying to communicate with you .
at the same time , he pres@@ ses you to get over the matter .
they do not deny what has happened or try to make it un@@ noticed .
Su@@ l and you have a more expensive idea of why you have had a lack of loy@@ alty .
you are talking about this and also about how to avoid it in the future .
you will better communicate and assess each other &apos;s needs .
your more expensive attitude and actions have helped to develop our condolences against his mis@@ carriage .
a more expensive commitment and behaviour has created the basis for your proximity to recovery .

the 20 @-@ year @-@ old new@@ er , Anna Maria O@@ rel , made the London M@@ il beautiful debate , with 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 7 a good 18 seats .
after that , M@@ M no@@ ori@@ m was a woman &apos;s new@@ er , and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for med@@ als in the future .
the contest went well and received good experience .
with the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , I immediately took advantage of my average result , the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) risk too much , and the third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) I was able to keep it very clear , &quot; said O@@ rel after the contest .
I had my own emissions and I am very pleased that I found it .
Anna Maria O@@ re@@ li M@@ M &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 seats .
the Vi@@ h@@ mas@@ ad@@ u O@@ reli@@ t did not mix , because he is training him through the TEC stage .
&apos;@@ I am afraid &apos; , he said a little bit .
the London Olympic state had almost a full house of the people , did the O@@ rel rec@@ lai@@ m people or was able to turn off ?
I have come to Tajani , but in a positive sense .
everyone says that it will add - that is the case !
if it is to compete , it can be experienced .
he then confirmed that he will be satisfied with the M@@ M &apos;s debate and he is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 3@@ 2nd outcome of the current season , the last one , I finished 18 .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and M@@ il - that is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of the med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina ku@@ ber@@ ner announced party exchanges
the Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ a , that he would change the parties .
&apos;@@ M@@ presu@@ e it or not , but the democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I say to you , having than@@ ked you hard and thought ... today , I say to you , the West , that I can no longer help you as a democratic Governor . &quot;
explanations of joy were g@@ lu@@ ed at the mi@@ xing .
&quot; so I will be a Re@@ publi@@ can tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a engine@@ er , I would say to you that it is time to play a second game . &quot;
the T@@ ru@@ mp had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
T@@ ru@@ mp won 42 points in Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
Justice , which is the only billion sta@@ r in the state , according to the Ford , proved to be elected in 2016 .
in the wilderness , it notes that it is owned by coal mines in five states and that it is quite self @-@ sufficient for coal business .
his value is approximately USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday evening , the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) published a statement that &apos; Governor Justice &apos;s party exchange is yet another blow to a democratic par@@ ade that would prevent the country from improving again rather than working towards it &apos; .
&quot; just 15 months and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent wake @-@ up to you , which is the way to the end of the day and cannot find a positive and united message , &quot; said R@@ N@@ C representation , R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ Daniel C@@ B@@ S New@@ si .
it is not surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
the We@@ ek@@ ise medical practi@@ tion@@ er , Ur@@ met , said yesterday evening that they have had to share a lot of pos@@ ters .
Vil@@ ls and mar@@ ches are fundamental , ex@@ cus@@ es and easy failures .
of course , it is also the main , ab@@ sen@@ tia and foot@@ wear .
according to Ur@@ me@@ ti , visitors will come to the festi@@ val with false foot@@ wear and so the problems will come .
the media have also had to help a couple of visitors with more injuries - there have been some s@@ care@@ mon@@ gering and also one foot .
we have also made a ble@@ s@@ sing when a person has pul@@ led the hand or the finger .
we are doing less here , we are going to send a hospital .
see the video as to whether the brak@@ es on the media for the treatment of po@@ ta@@ ble@@ t are also asking for a pain@@ kil@@ ler .
Co@@ e praised the honest apolo@@ gies of the Russians for the anti @-@ doping scandal .
the international r@@ ally of the Ker@@ ge@@ an S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , according to his words , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apolo@@ gy &apos; on Thursday , but reiterated that this is not the time to allow sport to be returned to the country .
on the eve of the World C@@ up on the eve of the last night of the International C@@ up , the Russian fri@@ vol@@ rel@@ s D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lit@@ h@@ tin said that the ban on competition imposed on his country is right and has a firm aim to combat doping .
he has apolog@@ ised &apos; from all the ligh@@ ters of gold and sil@@ ver med@@ als &apos; .
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on entry into force , which was introduced in November 2015 after the report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think it was a very honest answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to journalists .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were satisfied that the Russian Federation also recognised that they have had quite difficult times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Union . &quot;
according to Co@@ e , he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own recovery .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the proposal for a working group that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything possible in the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want clean ath@@ le@@ tes to be separated from the system , &quot; he added .
Eigh@@ teen Russian ligh@@ ters , who meet the strict criteria of the IA@@ AF , compete on Friday in London as neutral ath@@ le@@ tes in the World C@@ up .
the head of the IA@@ AF Group , R@@ une Andersson , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of criteria for forecas@@ ting .
following a presentation by the IA@@ AF to the Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that the trained engineers are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution makes a significant difference to the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
little because the revolution in electric cars makes a significant difference to the fuel market up to infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although mining gi@@ ants like G@@ len@@ core can say that they will win from one place and lose another , smaller mining companies will not help .
G@@ len@@ core coal and oil are currently serving , but in the era of electric cars , the demand for co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ kel is growing .
this year , governments in the UK , France and Norway have contributed to the decisions of the UK , France and Norway to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades .
therefore , Vol@@ vo has already known that they are planning to abandon the combustion engine , and T@@ es@@ la will bring a cheaper country 3 electric car to the market .
B@@ animal berg &apos;s New Energy Finance forecasts predict that electric cars will be sold over two decades more than cars using oil @-@ produced fuels .
&quot; with regard to some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ in B@@ animal ber@@ g , Capital of Economics .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as co@@ balt and li@@ thi@@ um , which have increased demand for years .
in electric cars , there are approximately three times more cop@@ ies than in the ordinary car , the G@@ len@@ core .
even more answers are needed at charging stations , which is why the Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that it will increase the demand for cop@@ per by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ gan@@ ese demand .
G@@ len@@ core can generate a growing income from electric cars and the fact that there is the world &apos;s largest producer of co@@ balt , predicted by the J@@ eff@@ itative Group .
according to this bro@@ ker company , the winners of the second wave of electric cars are winners of F@@ bet@@ e @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ mas Min@@ er@@ als .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of 70 % of the London me@@ tal stock .
the price of soil was 37 % .
the answer has also been 14 % this year , mainly due to economic growth .
the G@@ len@@ core excise duty rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price rise to the ri@@ val Rio T@@ into Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ oni and Ang@@ lo .
on the side of the losers , lead companies such as Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine , who have to adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ use of the P@@ li@@ i is the bat@@ teries of cars with petrol and diesel engines .
electric cars are used by gla@@ ci@@ ers .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael W@@ id@@ mer , the Governor of the Bank of America Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ ch , who analysed the metal@@ lic market .
the impact of the P@@ li@@ i price movement is not yet seen in the form of a se@@ am@@ less trend .
it has been 17 % this year , while it is the best methane in London among the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems for metals in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure that it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition , &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the head of the me@@ tal bro@@ ker Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ si .
if lead demand falls , it will be slow .
this may be the case in about ten years &apos; time .
in the meantime , stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which is often dependent on advanced lead @-@ based bat@@ teries , will be assessed by international lead and by the organisation of inquiry .
Ker@@ g@@ me@@ tal , like alu@@ mini@@ um , is replaced by steel , as a ligh@@ ter car can go further with less electricity .
this explains the additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes for 2013 @-@ 2016 .
this represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s output of alu@@ mini@@ um .
this trend is likely to grow , says W@@ id@@ mer .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um is responsible for 13 % this year , as the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
steel producers do not .
ak S@@ hal@@ ding will work together with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful cars .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and S@@ hal@@ Europe are also trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down in order to withstand the minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris , Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to a pla@@ te .
it took around half of this precious me@@ tal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , announced the me@@ tal re@@ fin@@ er Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ ta .
&quot; many raw materials such as oil and pla@@ te may not have a great deal of demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h , the Na@@ ti@@ x@@ ourselves raw material analy@@ sts .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
the Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ makers believe continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Mr Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , leader of the Un@@ core , said that in 2025 , more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from cars .
the great hope of the Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ at@@ makers in the 10 @-@ year perspective is To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ mun@@ i Mo@@ to@@ si , based on hydrogen @-@ based cars that depend on a pla@@ te to produce electricity from hydrogen .
so far , however , this technology has not yet been commercially justified .
&quot; it seems to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris from Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers received a major set@@ back in July , as S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art &apos;s court banned the use of diesel in the city of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how financial rules for football affect the transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the ram@@ pan@@ t spending of European football clubs do not prevent the world &apos;s record transition from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona club Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences for UEFA , the governing body , which domin@@ ates the European game and in its power to ban teams from the pres@@ ti@@ gious League of Me@@ is@@ ters from participating in the market , are waiting for the Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ May .
the financial rules for fair play ( F@@ F@@ P ) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that the PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transition to Ney@@ ra was financed without a huge loss .
EUR 2@@ 22 million was paid to Barcelona ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) alone for buying the Brazili@@ ans out of his contract , and the salary of Ney@@ ra will reach tens of millions of dollars per year .
here are some of the financial aspects of moving to the French club .
the PS@@ G will undoubtedly be able to go out of this kind of money for the recruitment of Ney@@ ra and the inclusion of its sta@@ rs , given that the team is funded by the family governing the Ka@@ tar &apos;s energy chain .
clubs have been allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players , but they have to balance this with legal sources of income that allow them to come out of a football business .
F@@ F@@ F@@ P was set up by Michel Pla@@ tini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that the clubs , which are falling into debt in search of success , are actually dealing with fraud and risk buying when banks or owners should give up support .
since 2011 , the F@@ F@@ P club will focus on monitoring their losses instead of their debts .
this change means that the business model , which Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch used first in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ sea , to buy a club with potential , and then to spend a great deal in order to improve the team and create a global brand , is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of the F@@ F@@ P , which runs until 2018 , the clubs will be able to bear up to EUR 30 million in losses .
and , despite the fact that Pla@@ tini was dis@@ credi@@ ted by the presidential office in 2015 , his successor , Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , is still committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; F@@ F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said the previous week , Mr Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is the guardian of the UEFA @-@ F@@ P .
although the PS@@ G for the purchase clause of Ney@@ mar@@ i as one of the full payments , they will be able to distribute this amount for the purposes of accounting for the whole period of validity of the agreement .
Mr Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it is possible to demonstrate a transitional fee of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
for the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G , together with Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , received the most severe penalties on Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga .
the PS@@ G was fined EUR 60 million ( currently EUR 82 million ) , which was reduced later to EUR 20 million , and the club was required to limit the team of the League of Me@@ is@@ ters for the period 2014 @-@ 2015 to 21 players instead of normal 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to over@@ turn the financial institutions , blow@@ ing their income through companies connected with the owners of the club .
the Ka@@ tar company may spon@@ sor the PS@@ G , but if the value of spon@@ sorship is considered to be standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
this was the case in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar Tourism Authority had the value of the PS@@ G support .
it has been said that some of the PS@@ G services of Ney@@ mar@@ i can come from Q@@ a@@ tar through contributions from the World C@@ up Board of 20@@ 22 .
however , the PS@@ G and Q@@ a@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ ra could become a world champi@@ on@@ ship and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities are able to easily expose such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on the PS@@ G mean that UEFA is even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not been proactive in discussing the transition to the PS@@ G .
they talked about The associated P@@ press , provided that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PS@@ G .
the latest reports show that the PS@@ G 2015 @-@ 2016 season will generate more than € 10 million in profits of around € 54@@ 2.4 million in turnover .
the figures for the last financial year have not yet been published .
the PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ ra will have a good impact on spon@@ sorship transactions , trade and s@@ nus .
the club looks forward to an increase of at least 30 % of turnover in the agreement .
Spain too , having clearly irri@@ tated the departure of one of the largest football sta@@ rs , tried to block the transition by saying that the PS@@ G is in breach of F@@ F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with a club and a country , &quot; said La li President Javier T@@ eb@@ as AS , referring to the fact that the PS@@ G belongs mainly to Q@@ a@@ tar .
Ar@@ sen@@ al mä@@ ne@@ j@@ er Ar@@ n W@@ en@@ ger , whose club belongs to the American sports mag@@ na@@ te , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights and it has changed completely the whole football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to the state , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a major player . &quot;

today , 50 years ago : an an@@ om@@ al@@ y storm in Estonia , which was ri@@ pped off houses and win@@ dows .
the or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra of the century , which , on 6 and 7 August , caused major damage in particular to the West , Har@@ ju@@ land and Rap@@ la@@ land .
in the course of these days , the wind was over 30 m / s in the north @-@ west Estonia .
in my old drink in Ba@@ vari@@ a , a bot@@ tle of one card to another , and over@@ laps with them to support them .
everything was blind and ra@@ g@@ ne , like the world stage .
T@@ aa@@ mal has already been flying into the houses , in 2002 , the old Mrs L@@ inda K@@ uro@@ va Ha@@ va@@ va magaz@@ ine was reminded of the Estonian nature in an interview with Estonia .
the L@@ inda spo@@ use saw how the plan@@ ted a@@ xes collapsed .
but what are you going to support with your hands , where are you going against such a storm ?
the sea came under the window , from the win@@ dows in the water &apos; , Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us Kal@@ da , who has lived on the streets of Mrs L@@ inda at the time .
the fact that the roads were full and the ro@@ ck of the railway station had been flying to 20 @-@ 30 metres , the L@@ inda majority of the Haiti@@ ans , just like next morning .
according to the local authorities , the cages behind the Par@@ ale@@ pa were lagging behind , some of them were completely lengthy , some of the shops .
everyone saw very de@@ pressing , the storm went through the beautiful old trees as a ra@@ da@@ r and pragmatism , like war .
Western Vir@@ u@@ land was not particularly severely affected by August 1967 , compared with Western Estonia , but the losses were large there , the Vir@@ u@@ maa Official Journal wrote in 2007 .
Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ u L@@ fossil Par@@ k and P@@ ad@@ ise Par@@ k were swe@@ pt away from the ground , but also our own par@@ ks were severely affected .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured by up to 35 metres per second , or around 130 kilometres per hour .
in Tallinn M@@ eri@@ expression , on the evening of 6.@@ August , one of the few lead cha@@ mbers had been sh@@ ou@@ ting : &apos; mother , mother !
the channel is in the air and will no longer be signed , &quot; wrote Vir@@ u@@ maa Official Journal .
at the time of the storm in Vil@@ j@@ an@@ di@@ land , the Bu@@ il@@ ding of the generation was so that it was decided to be disman@@ tled later .
the design of the T@@ ü@@ ri ski moun@@ tains , which was no longer restored later , was not opposed to August .
on 12 August 19@@ 57 , the newspaper Red T@@ bl@@ t wrote that the restoration of towns and settlements from land@@ locked trees and their vehicles is progressing slowly , and the population could be involved in cor@@ ro@@ gation work .
in Tu@@ rin , fer@@ tility crops were also severely affected , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party organisations must be an incentive and a fer@@ tility cor@@ ps &apos; .
in the event that the average wind speed exceeds 3@@ 2.7 m / s .
the wind order in Estonia remains on 2 November 19@@ 69 , when Ru@@ h@@ nu@@ l was measured at the speed of 48 m / s .
on the island of V@@ ain@@ d@@ story , a s@@ word broke out , so it was not possible to register the speed of a strong wind .
secret of holiday be@@ aches : night cleaning and poor coastal weather
cold summer weather also means less cor@@ ro@@ tation in the be@@ aches of Tallinn .
&quot; if there is no , then people are in the ran@@ k , and if there are no people , then there are also no people , then the be@@ er is tru@@ th@@ ful .
the city of Northern Tallinn S@@ tro@@ om in S@@ tro@@ om .
they are offered by a me@@ chan@@ ical competition in the low @-@ turn tra@@ ctor , which is a threshold for a pla@@ card to the tri@@ ck .
in fact , the last seven @-@ cent goes through the dep@@ ths of the sand , pic@@ king it out of the sea p@@ ounds and people left behind : bot@@ tles , cigarettes and so on .
people are still coming to ran@@ k , regardless of whether water is soya or not .
if there is a beau@@ ty , then people are in the ran@@ k , and if there are no people , then there are no people , &apos; the management of the private company hospital hospital &apos; will be said by Alexander U@@ so@@ v , Mr U@@ so@@ v .
at 6.@@ 30 p.m. and ran@@ k , there is a bitter ho@@ le , because at 8 o &apos;@@ clock , the pos@@ ter must be in order for the people .

the amounts of Prüm have fallen .
many years ago , it was much more .
people will now be able to assess what is being done for them , &quot; says U@@ so@@ v , who has harves@@ ted the migrants for 15 years .
before it was the case that , when something new was put up , it was already the next day .
now , what is on the coast is already being kept .
price of clean be@@ ach
one of the biggest jobs in the Estonian be@@ aches is the b@@ reat@@ h of rub@@ b@@ ish , or ad@@ ru harves@@ ting .
for example , in the P@@ iri@@ ta ran@@ k , 400 000 tonnes of coast@@ line have to be ship@@ ped .
&apos;@@ This is an incredible amount &apos; , notes the U@@ so@@ v .
the second major category is municipal waste , all of which people leave behind .
there are eight major rub@@ b@@ ish sein@@ ers in S@@ tro@@ om coast , which need to be watered down three times a week .
so much is the waste .
however , cold summer weather has meant that rub@@ b@@ ish is a fifth less than otherwise .
the third species are abandoned .
in most cases , they are children &apos;s TV .
as a result , U@@ so@@ v has pul@@ led out ten metres of slu@@ dge from the sand .
they will remain waiting for the owners of timber to be on the table .
&quot; they usually come out more , but it is a normal harvest , &quot; U@@ so@@ v knows that it will soon find them back in the sand .
children come to ran@@ k and take the toys in order to re @-@ in@@ sta@@ ll them .
landfill is broken down
Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler , a representative of administrative services , admitted that the work of the tra@@ ctor is disrup@@ ting local communities .
noise , which las@@ ts from hours to hours , is confusing the people living in the neighbourhood .
on the day , however , this work is impossible .
in one month , we have two times to go through the war .
&quot; if we do not do this , the city will be fined , &quot; notes Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
however , the aim is , like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ari and Per@@ sian , to get S@@ tro@@ om rand below the quality of the international flag .
&quot; compared with Europe , there is much more work in Estonia to care for be@@ aches , &quot; says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more ad@@ ru and more stone , and it is more difficult to go to the sand .
however , our be@@ aches have less rub@@ b@@ ish than elsewhere in Europe .
when we hear that there is talk of rub@@ b@@ ish in the ran@@ k , the conver@@ sa@@ tions between Mr Martin , who is living near S@@ tro@@ om , and the inter@@ views of the journalist and cor@@ ro@@ gation workers , highlight the current bottlenecks .
there is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is with birds and wood sla@@ ves , who have pul@@ led the rub@@ b@@ ish bags &apos; , Martin says .
although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the rub@@ b@@ ish and , for example , put them on the ro@@ of@@ s in order to prevent at least birds in the news there .
in general , however , Martin is satisfied with the development of S@@ tro@@ om .
it can be seen that the city is taking care of this .
it has become more pleasant with children &apos;s fields , enligh@@ tened and fresh as@@ ph@@ alt .
it was once the case that only one way could travel on the ground , &quot; notes Martin .
findings of the village in S@@ tro@@ om@@ is : coins , only coins
a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Dimit@@ r , who , as a tre@@ asu@@ rer , is sa@@ iling the coast@@ line with a me@@ tal me@@ tre , has had to be exploited .
he does not believe that , today , or in the future , he will find a price .
marine God is not generous enough to do so .
&quot; I have been working on this for a year and I have not found anything worthwhile so far , &quot; says D@@ mit@@ ry .
as a ref@@ rig@@ eration , the D@@ mit@@ ry Islands have some euro coins , bot@@ tles and also dangerous p@@ ounds which later throw the rub@@ b@@ ish .
normally there are still coins .
&quot; culture , fin@@ gers and other such practices are not usually the case , &quot; it is the island &apos;s village .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level as weak economic growth and inflation alle@@ viation have cus@@ hi@@ oned speculation on the rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth remains a lo@@ opho@@ le , as household incomes have put interest rates on expectations .
policy makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MP@@ C ) voted 6 : 2 in favour of 0.@@ 25 % , and fewer members require an increase this month , as slow economic growth has weakened support .
in its quar@@ terly report on inflation , the Bank cut its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 and from 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households &apos; incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in rates for the next few years is necessary to curb inflation from Bre@@ x@@ on and the financial markets may be necessary for the expected increase in the cost of borrowing .
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package , which was launched a year ago as a result of Bre@@ x@@ ti .
in February , the Bank will put an end to the fixed @-@ term finance scheme , which will provide banks with cheap funding , although it said that it is now GBP 15 billion more to be expected under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; GDP in the central forecast of the EPAs will remain power@@ less in the near future , as the difficult situation of real income for households will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
on the rates , it was repeated that there is a need for &apos; some effort to be made to alleviate inflation &apos; , and this &apos; somewhat higher &apos; than is expected in the markets .
Mr Böge is now predi@@ cting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any kind of anthem is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % for the next year .
the forecast for 1.8 % growth in 2018 was maintained .
after this news , the p@@ ound of the dollar and the euro fell .
women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.@@ 31 and 0.@@ 4 % to EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to growing hopes of an increase in GDP in the second quarter , from 0.2 % last three months to 0.@@ 3 % .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will be able to collect a little momentum .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave little reason to the households suffering from rising inflation and ab@@ ject wage increases , saying that the situation will go a little worse before an improvement is made .
it was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent a fall in income in the next few years , but the end of the three @-@ year forecast is expected to see a marked return to wages .
as a result , the economy is also being stimu@@ lated by increasing demand for British production , which is partly compensa@@ ting for lower costs for consumers .
the decision comes one year after the rates were taken by 0.@@ 25 % last August after the shocking EU referendum , which caused a sudden weakening of the p@@ ound .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to completely brea@@ the life into prices and the economy .
before the last decision of the Bank , there was a growing demand for raising the rate , as inflation had increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak p@@ ound .
Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , leader of Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ ga@@ ges , said : &apos; in view of the recent downturn in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market will again become more competitive , as creditors will be able to work and hope to end the year in a positive way .
Mr Böge seems to be particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as re@@ financing , often without service and low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS is writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV medi@@ cation
patients have been able to access the &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; HIV @-@ preventive treatment since September , following the battle against whether the N@@ HS should finance the medicine .
N@@ HS England announced that public health is now making an estimated 10 000 people available for the initial three @-@ year clinical trial - pre @-@ pre @-@ school pro@@ phy@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t that is man@@ ned before the interim procedure and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people by around 86 % .
the N@@ HS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported the ruling of the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS is able to pay for the Pr@@ EP , despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Ste@@ vens , the Executive Director of N@@ HS Eng@@ land , welcomed this Thursday as a &apos; new large @-@ scale intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &apos; pivotal moment &apos; .
sexual health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ oli@@ s and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to register people , and in October , there will be further clin@@ ics before the programme is introduced in England by April 2018 .
exposure to pre @-@ emp@@ tive pro@@ phy@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) is the scene of HIV drugs , which will be taken before the incident in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that the Pr@@ EP will significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission among people .
the Pr@@ EP &apos;s adoption before the mid @-@ term review means that there is a sufficient number of medicinal products that prevent HIV infections .
such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure .
the appropriate candidates include L@@ GB@@ T men , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment .
they identify suitable people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their participation in the local sexual health clin@@ ics in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million , and N@@ HS England signed an agreement to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the clinical test aims to assess the actual potential of the Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who is intended for treatment and how it is consumed and implemented .
Ste@@ ven said : &apos; this new large @-@ scale intervention should complement and leverage a comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV proliferation .
this is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of the greatest health problems facing humanity . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , the Man@@ aging Director of NA@@ T , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
the Pr@@ EP , if it is properly targeted at those who need it and belong to risk groups , offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England .
since September , people with a high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on the negotiations with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
the Executive Director of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Foundation , ian Green , said : &apos; now it is a priority to ensure that a clinical trial is put in place quickly and that no member of the HIV risk group is excluded .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical test has been obtained , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who risk being infected with HIV .
the Minister for Public Health , Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , said : &apos; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP clinical test is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the cen@@ sus of the government &apos;s sho@@ es .
evidence shows how much changes can be made to the prevention of HIV prevention and the spread of its life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will lead us a step closer to the full understanding of the advantages of the Pr@@ EP .
it is now important that a clinical trial is taken as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV and lead us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
in July , the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.@@ 94 , compared to EUR 7.@@ 71 in June this year , declared Ele@@ ring .
the main cause of the price difference is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , the average electricity price for electricity was € 3@@ 4.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour last month , and the price increased by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five per cent to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t @-@ hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 17 , and the electricity exchanges in Nord half of the systemic price was EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t @-@ hour .
prices rose according to 12 and seven per cent .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity reached 75 % of last month &apos;s hours in Estonia and 16 % of the hours from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine % of the hours between the two countries did not take place next day .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity reached 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the hours were used by the entire transmission capacity .
according to the last trading day of July , Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X on the market , the price of electricity in August could be around 34 and € 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t @-@ hour in September .
the price of carbon dioxide , which is affecting the price of electricity production last month , and transactions were at 5.@@ 04 @-@ 5.@@ 47 per tonne .
life expectancy - half @-@ time and smart de@@ sig@@ ners have changed it to the small Ear@@ ls of the Court of Justice
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker who is a passion@@ ate property innova@@ tor , swit@@ ched his home to the Grand K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in 2014 against the Ear@@ ls Court Cor@@ ter .
it is in the first order of Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ ţ@@ i , and the fact that Jo@@ anne has not pac@@ ked his bags and sold the fla@@ ts has been a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived together with a former fellow Member of life in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tanta@@ mount to the price of my offer .
it was demonstrated to me by the Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high waves .
I did in this and I made an offer on the same day .
since the first visit , this 93 @-@ square me@@ tre has gone through full innovation .
at the beginning , it was a s@@ lee@@ ping and a complex sta@@ r - a s@@ lee@@ ping wall had to go through the kit@@ chen , and Jo@@ anne wanted to add savings and qu@@ asi @-@ order to exploit high rates .
&quot; I wanted high , big win@@ dows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he is asking Er@@ fan Az@@ adi N@@ ot@@ ting Hil@@ lis for architecture and de@@ sig@@ ner Du@@ ck &amp; D , to take advantage of 3.@@ 8 m e@@ ars and to create a home that is not just a development site but a place where Jo@@ anne could live .
it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create a qu@@ asi @-@ order in which to stand up .
the Er@@ fan was supposed to be a creative approach .
&quot; Me@@ tal@@ l@@ design is quite complex , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise the premises so that they are located on each other , without having to be bo@@ gged down .
it was not just about building a platform , but we used steel design to be the right thing to do so , both in the upper and lower space . &quot;
this place allowed the Er@@ fan@@ il to create two full @-@ blo@@ wn elements in the room , with a great deal of dramatic elements .
a half @-@ way street will be opened up from the old @-@ fashi@@ oned R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us window to the gla@@ ci@@ er of R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us .
the gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ spe@@ ctive Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille &apos;s light highlight the style of space .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in the inclusion of theat@@ re , space and lighting .
in the short corridor , mir@@ rors have been added to both sides , so that it would seem longer .
in the K@@ night , the mir@@ ror is giving the impression of a second @-@ tu@@ p window .
in the course of a return , the s@@ ong will provide for all Jo@@ anne &apos;s eating ri@@ ders and glass requirements .
housing is accompanied by a false opportunity to close the vegetables if it is not used , creating a more den@@ se space .
the cu@@ mber@@ some kit@@ chen is nothing new .
however , with this kit@@ chen , it is a unique fact that this is a type of u@@ prising in the gar@@ age .
&quot; it went a little bit of design , &quot; explains the presence of Er@@ fan ter@@ as@@ strengthened M@@ D@@ F from the M@@ D@@ F .
&quot; this has a counter@@ weight , which is why it is very simple to reject it . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne now has 16 additional metres , an additional s@@ lee@@ ping permit and a better cor@@ ter plan .
&quot; after all , it is what you sell - or what gives property value , &apos; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ Kin@@ nis@@ var@@ y takes an outdated form and makes calculations on the basis of the surface area &apos; .
here , they have been able to increase the sur@@ faces , using high quality materials that add a luxury to the space .
&quot; materials are what you are missing and thus help to create an emotional link with your home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not love the electricity c@@ ables in my se@@ ine .
it is important , but it does not give heart to languages . &quot;
this shows that a good design and an increase in the area will help to make something aston@@ ishing from a rather normal cor@@ al .
in fact , they can even create a desire not to leave , as was the case with Jo@@ anne .
the main figure , Jen@@ sen , is Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s pic@@ tures of a was@@ hing village in Ch@@ ic@@ ago , who is competing with a colleague for his profession@@ alism .
no more than the amount of money that has been earned , apart from which any ethics is forgotten .
his wife and three children only see a man on the property and late night .
in the first half of the film , I find myself in the idea that it is a version of the business world of Ka@@ ar@@ di@@ house - even in K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s speech .
what the film goes on , however , is the less cha@@ otic element , and the mor@@ alising intention of film @-@ makers is beginning to appear more and more .
life @-@ changing experience will be the main player in the cancer of cancer .
there is now a choice between working and family life .
the po@@ et of the Ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ ite@@ ation is making the father think of the great buildings of Ch@@ ic@@ ago about matters of real importance , such as religion , welfare , love ... , without even the disaster of the twin tow@@ ers .
after the third semester , where the son &apos;s father opens the eyes , there is a feeling that the film @-@ makers have certainly been able to meet the target audience , because even with the most basic heart , they cannot keep te@@ ars back in the face of the suffering of a doctor of cancer .
if the son falls into the House and his situation seems to be hope@@ less , the father will finally understand the mor@@ ality of his work and make a good job for the old man who wants to work .
now , in a sense , I am lu@@ cky with myself - if the fil@@ ter has been in possession of it , I will be rewarded with my own sense after the film coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , then at least one surprise could be applau@@ ded .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that ice will be lost - when a hus@@ band calls a hospital and a man dri@@ ves in the middle of a corridor .
however , the Po@@ e@@ g has been ama@@ zing , and although his father has just lost his job , it will be positive because it is now time to deal with the family .
I can also feel well - I can already predict the end of the American dra@@ ma quite well !
in fact , the film has been well constructed , all the elements that are needed for this are there .
it will be a jo@@ ke , it will be a laugh@@ ing actor , it is a good and moral beau@@ ty : money is not the most important thing in life .
this film is well introduced by surprise .
the new staff transfer is planned to limit the media consumption of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F@@ . Kelly will be able to do so .
then it would be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff@@ ing of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope that it will keep the upper hand in a more balanced way .
here , the repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ lt :
&quot; when the new staff of the White House , John F@@ . Kelly , met with high officials on his first day of work , he highlighted the key problem of President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ ges , which he intends to address in the hands of the President in the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly told officials that the information must go through him , either on paper or at meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems completely logical , but others have tried to do so and have failed to tame T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i by monitoring his media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television goes for decades , and now that he is in the White House , his television observation habits have not gone away .
&quot; when the candidate T@@ ru@@ mp was dis@@ honest about the dis@@ honest media coverage , he had to show him that he was also fairly reflected in the publications affecting him , &quot; said S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg Poli@@ ti@@ co@@ s in February .
Poli@@ tic@@ o tara Pal@@ mer wrote at the time that &apos; according to the six former campaig@@ ners &apos; , T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter is the key to controlling the habits of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter , to ensure that his personal media consumption is also stable . &quot;
good .
however , the idea that the habits used by T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaig@@ ners know something that the rest of us do not know about the fact that the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i bonuses would have been even more hear@@ tening without their intervention .
we will probably never be able to know about the sh@@ ut@@ down that the T@@ ru@@ mp did not postal .
if he was able to save or save a few times , his efforts were worth doing so .
however , no one has been able to prevent T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i consistently from creating po@@ lem@@ ics .
part of the problem is that , in the White House , which consists of competing lines , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception , by transferring material to the T@@ ru@@ Olympics , which supports their views on the world , but may not always be credible .
Poli@@ tic@@ o , which reflects the whole story , wrote in May the advis@@ ers &apos; tendency to feed the President with information of strategic value .
one of the examples described by the repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is as follows :
&quot; the current and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i will say that T@@ ru@@ mp can react to a negative press , particularly with a damaging effect on inf@@ ants , explo@@ sive , entr@@ en@@ ching their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone gave a che@@ er@@ ful copy to the President of the Internet provocation Charles C. Joh@@ n@@ son &apos;s website , G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com , which accused the staff de@@ pu@@ mp , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , that he was the white house of a series of le@@ af@@ lets . &quot;
it does not matter that Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked by Twitter because of his mo@@ del@@ ling or that he did not provide any specific evidence or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
the T@@ ru@@ mp read the article and started to ask for Wal@@ sh@@ i . &quot;
the Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that Ro@@ b Por@@ ter and the head of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , have tried to establish a system for managing and docu@@ menting the documents reaching T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but T@@ ru@@ mp is still an impul@@ se and his hel@@ ple@@ ss will continue to compete on the basis of influence .
these un@@ changing factors make the mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans who have come from abroad to the capital of the capital will not be allowed to speak .
there is a lot of foreign affairs in the city of Tallinn .
those with whom the le@@ af@@ let came out acknowledged that they were playing in the old town without the permission of the urban government .
the first was the three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who have taken the same co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il in the vic@@ inity of Vir@@ u &apos;s gates .
it was clear to see that the mus@@ ici@@ ans with co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils and c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine clo@@ thes were in ab@@ sen@@ tia , to whom one du@@ ch would be a mar@@ ty@@ r .
despite the fact , the only woman in the company played a par@@ ia@@ h story , while one man , alongside him , was calling for a gesture of three faces and fur@@ ni@@ ture closer to him .
the third man was sitting in ab@@ sen@@ tia alongside them and smo@@ ked a war@@ mer self @-@ prepared far@@ ce .
their three cha@@ mbers did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the people of the past .
Mr Bo@@ b , who has played with the A@@ cor@@ di@@ on , has said that he said that he is be@@ having on the streets for both fu@@ n and money .
the aim of this panel was to collect ticket money on a ship travelling to Finland on the same day .
apart from the question of whether they asked for permission from the city in the old age , No@@ emi and Bo@@ b were sha@@ king their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stay in one town more than a day or a few and , in most cases , allowed for a month or something like this .
there is no point in paying for this , &quot; explained by Bo@@ b .
when we returned to the gates of Vir@@ u about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in mus@@ ici@@ ans and are going to go .
it is a challenge for the Vir@@ u Centre in ab@@ sen@@ tia and co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils to Vir@@ u .
three Polish young men , one of whom played a fifth , are also present on the streets of Vir@@ u Vir@@ u , and the third was even involved in electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people enter@@ tainment in order to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living , &quot; explained the tri@@ o pi@@ pe M@@ iv@@ os@@ h .
according to M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there must be permission from the city government .
&quot; of course we do not have it , &quot; he said it jo@@ ke .
but we hope that if people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
of course , if the police comes , we will go elsewhere , but it must be tried , he added .
in July , the Estonian bank purchased bonds worth € 149 million under the public property programme of central banks in the euro area , a bank bond portfolio increased to € 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , has explained in the past that the assets of the central banks of the Euro@@ system are covered by three different purchasing programmes : the bonds covered by the financial sector ( SIS ) , property guaranteed bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public bonds ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases will fall in the production of lower @-@ risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks .
as a rule , in the framework of the public sector bond programme , each central bank bu@@ ys its government bonds , and other countries &apos; bonds are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank will make so @-@ called &apos; replacement shopping &apos; within the limits of the amount allocated to them .
the central banks also shop in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian bank is generally buying the bonds of the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian bank is buying bonds under the asset programme from March 2015 .
in the meantime , Ele@@ ction bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian bank will no longer buy bonds from June 2016 .
in the name of the central banks of the euro area , from June onwards , both the Central Bank of Finland and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds are buying .
migrants are ignoring degrees and returning to &apos; millions of business &apos; .
some of the rich@@ est owners of the West Mid@@ lands have once again found themselves in a fier@@ ce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the une@@ le@@ cted bureaucra@@ ts of the Council to win back their cotton .
migrants have par@@ ked their 20 tra@@ ilers near the streets of So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l , who are ris@@ ked by a wealth of millions of business .
they have returned , together with the army of hor@@ ses , children and lorries , after they were thrown out of it only in May , without allowing themselves to be confused with a degree of bureaucracy that was complaining to the Council to prevent their invasion .
an activist group found a weak place in defence limits , turning its vehicles through un@@ blocked parts that were left to po@@ cket .
the people of M@@ aru@@ ang@@ ry have conta@@ cted the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ li Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless &apos; in dealing with the problem .
one anon@@ ymous resident said : &apos; they are sitting there on Monday evening after their exclusion from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ on , where they were st@@ oned by stoning .
the Council must be ashamed that they are going to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were going to go and now they are back again .
they came to the last night , probably more today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect their par@@ ks .
I live on the road to strike , and I am not happy that I must continue to pay a full charge if the Council is not even able to prevent such a thing . &quot;
one local resident who also wanted to remain anon@@ ymous said : &apos; it is ridiculous , and we have seen the last of these migratory movements , and there is already a new offensive .
this time , the number has increased and even the horse has been seen in the grass@@ land . &quot;
the representative of the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ li Council said : &apos; we are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the land near the street pa@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k , and we are working with the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ li police , and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
the gathering of evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling the number 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ na F@@ esti@@ val will also visit the Minister for Culture , In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is pleased that it has been possible to bring real world top names to Estonia .
the question of why the We@@ ek@@ ise festi@@ val is so important for the Est@@ oni@@ ans , Sa@@ ar , that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the F@@ esti@@ val &apos;s three @-@ day story .
however , it recognises that the real players in the area have come to the fore .
&quot; looking at the level of artists , which has been able to be brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this mus@@ ical gesture are being brought home - often not in our hands - the Minister for Culture is speaking .
however , what festi@@ vals are the artists who speak most about Sa@@ art himself ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person , and it is certainly one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ new@@ re@@ n , who stood up yesterday evening .
according to his pos@@ ter , all of us have , at some point , complicated our own feet , &apos; he says .
however , he still highlights a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ thia , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ a .
of course , our own Estonian players : starting with NO@@ x P and they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , this ren@@ owned concentration of names is very high , &quot; he says .

Au@@ di upgra@@ des up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of the criticism of car manufacturers
the day before the Au@@ di announcement , B@@ M@@ W said that it provides a software app for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of B@@ M@@ W , the company believes that &apos; there are smarter options than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the B@@ M@@ W home city , Munich , which has considered a ban or restriction on diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be upgra@@ ded to reduce gas emissions from diesel engines in Europe .
no company has described these procedures as a re @-@ call .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and in the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide em@@ itted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , the cost of equipment installed for neutr@@ alising diesel vehicles is increasing for car industry , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
at the same time as German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of ring@@ ing powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs referring to the problem .
companies are trying to prevent Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen from repeating the mistakes of the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , who was silent on the use of so @-@ called &apos; pe@@ tro@@ le@@ ry &apos; devices , which made it possible to adapt emissions to the regulations for the testing of a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
several Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former president of the Au@@ di engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
former President Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and can be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , the Au@@ di German Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen was drawn into criminal investigations when the authorities accused the installation of the audit system in order to circum@@ vent the requirements for European gas emissions by extending an investigation which was previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Au@@ di in the investigation may be a major blow to the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , the manufacturer of luxury cars , a disproportionately large proportion of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen &apos;s profits .
the Estonian schools will have 20 000 euro flags of the European Union .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union to the Estonian schools by 1 September .
in total , 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 cent of the European Union flag will be awarded to 5@@ 70 educational institutions .
flags are intended to be made available in in@@ door rooms , they must be carried out in high @-@ quality printed techniques with a view to a certificate of convenience , the ER@@ R &apos;s news portal .
there is a text on the label : &apos; Kin@@ gi@@ tus Estonia &apos;s schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags is EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , or one flag costs EUR 35 .
murder of journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
the workers of the weekly newspaper , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , usually gather on Wednesday in order to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the State of Y@@ al@@ oa , which is so@@ wn by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ stop@@ p@@ able drug wars .
however , today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their rou@@ tine .
two parents will be discussing which seems safer : either to bring children into office , which was the target of a gran@@ dio@@ attack in 2009 , or to leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the leader of the room : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking repor@@ ters to provide the names of a ve@@ il in every water , do not need proof , and impres@@ sions and internal feelings are enough .
the presence of the government or car@@ tels is suspected of drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists , a whole list of couples who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
there are no b@@ reat@@ h of violence , and the more the bodies of the country accumu@@ late , the majority of these journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists , have been killed since the appointment of President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Montre@@ to in December 2012 , at least 25 , 5@@ 89 journalists , after attacks and threats under national protection , and this year at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states .
the latest deaths include their edit@@ or and source of inspiration , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as , co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote in Val@@ dez one of his many books on drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though his presence can be felt everywhere in the Orthodox Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Bu@@ il@@ ding , a big picture of the average of the Val@@ de@@ z@@ ist , together with the letter &apos; Justice &apos; , and two of the 30 repor@@ ters , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , carries T @-@ shir@@ ts , which have been portra@@ yed by his s@@ le@@ ep glas@@ ses or the face of the ama@@ te@@ ur village of his wife .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death , Re@@ por@@ ters will discuss a common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , their hope@@ lessness , their paran@@ o@@ ia .
although in 2010 , a separate public prosecution service was set up to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee on the Protection of journalists .
as in the case of most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders , the number of which amounts to thousands , the kil@@ lers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edit@@ orial will continue to reflect the violence in Sin@@ al@@ as , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and justice of murde@@ rers , the meeting on security is not a great benefit , according to the I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very nice to waste your time here at the meeting , &apos; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , there will be no mistrust of everyone . &quot;
Val@@ dez left the capital of the State , Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , from the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office on 15 May morning .
he managed to travel just a few quarters , before two men stopped the red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ roles , and he was forced to go out of the car and shot at 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which means &apos; the twel@@ f@@ th river &apos; .
the armed man travelled to Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s car and made an accident in the vic@@ inity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adults .
the floo@@ ded spre@@ ads freely spread in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
however , there is basically only silence on Val@@ de@@ z .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition of the United States in January , one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country has been one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country , because ri@@ val@@ ries are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
there is no difference that a person or even a number of people are being shot on the streets of oa every day , or that the dead are s@@ tun@@ ned by the double @-@ fashi@@ oned swe@@ ets of drugs , which are greater than many homes .
let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one car@@ tel is headed by the state of the sea with valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce co @-@ foun@@ der and the President , Is@@ May Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , feels that he was unable to defend his friend .
he believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
the first of these was the publication of an interview with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s po@@ ts in February , a car@@ tel , a car@@ tel of war , and the S@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z@@ each .
this piece of correspon@@ dence could have been allu@@ ded to by the suspect gan@@ gs who bought all the cop@@ ies of the publication as soon as they were reached in the newspapers .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country for his own security , after there was a ra@@ mp in one of the newspapers that have been reflected in the same story .
Val@@ dez was leg@@ alised both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had remained alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he existed forever .
he worked in 2003 as a ve@@ ter@@ an@@ repor@@ ter in No@@ ro@@ este when he joined five colleagues in order to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said that &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without tou@@ ching the drug problem &apos; .
the amount of time has been felt by its courageous and honest perfor@@ man@@ ces and sales and advertising increased .
Re@@ por@@ ters were keen to express vigorous studies without fear of censorship and read@@ ers , which they were able to read stories that no one else da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspaper won the pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot Award for his Latin American reports .
in the same year , the Committee on the Protection of journalists in Val@@ dez ( AK@@ K ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow the Mexic@@ an drug story wherever it leads .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said the AK@@ K award .
last October , in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV , he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Blue .
&quot; your head is to embrace the task that the journalists &apos; office is accompanied by a second chance to play .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths , or why I did not say what is happening . &quot;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ ctives will miss Val@@ de@@ z , a jo@@ ke who ro@@ ps like low , a friend who divided embry@@ os and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their support to his rou@@ tine .
he always gave his village a bar@@ rel .
he went from the office to El Guatem@@ y@@ ab@@ o bar and was always sitting on the same des@@ k .
now they are asking whether his rou@@ tine love became fatal to him .
his death has also put them into question how best to do his job and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity of their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination .
trust in your in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
if it is a matter of suspi@@ ci@@ ously , it is a matter of keeping away .
according to the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ ali , the problem is that &apos; fra@@ gran@@ ce can be dece@@ ived ... and so it was the case with J@@ emp@@ era &apos; .
he and others say that you no longer have the old rules , just as they do not apply in Thailand , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ ros or other states which are home to the toxic combination of lu@@ cra@@ tive smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in a space where the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only the nu@@ mber@@ ing assets sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in front of the House , two police officers sought to alleviate the 40 @-@ degree heat of the pu@@ mp .
the government appointed them to a more elected Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office in the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an central class in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
some repor@@ ters won@@ dered whether these police officers are among their 50 % of police officers , whose Governor himself has been un@@ reliable .
several months have passed since the repor@@ ters have travelled to mountain areas where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gan@@ gs .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edition of this week addressed three main features .
one of them was the murder of the former po@@ et Ju@@ li@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez ven@@ na in Blue al@@ o@@ as .
in addition , they had a reve@@ aling story of the spending of government funds on the home town of the Governor .
a group of people was kidna@@ pped from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants , and the public Prosecutor &apos;s office from the quarter .
there was no formal announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how it happened , so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of the restaur@@ ant , both the drug traffickers and the authorities of the authorities .
the Re@@ por@@ ter became aware of the public documents that the restaur@@ ant is registered as a politician who belongs to the ruling Institu@@ tional Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
in recent times , several IR@@ P Governor has been accused of corruption in the context of widespread cases .
in Vil@@ lar@@ line asked the repor@@ ter to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Gu@@ z@@ man po@@ et El Chap@@ o has esca@@ ped a military visit .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have been looking for a Val@@ dez co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il to obtain information on the kid@@ napp@@ ings from the best sources .
&apos;@@ In the past we would have known what happened , &apos; said 46 @-@ year @-@ old Vil@@ lar@@ k , whose body construction has earned him a slogan El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all channels of communication have broken up with our sources . &quot;
the office of Val@@ de@@ z has become a reser@@ vo@@ ir to bridges and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and edit@@ orial workers have become something that they never expected to wait for activists on behalf of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez seized a few eyes and direction next morning to the local Prosecutor &apos;s office for another journalist .
Mr Salvador , in the Western State of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an , three days after the murder of Val@@ de@@ z .
it has been found to be a dead body and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists have become more vo@@ cal across the country , and are cri@@ pp@@ ling the phrase &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; as a organised protest against the roads and buildings .
on this day , President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington , trying to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
the day after the death of Val@@ de@@ z , the Ra@@ mi@@ rez authorities accused the journalists of the bul@@ lying and killing of them because of the truth .
after that , he requested that he be diver@@ ted from the government &apos;s activities elsewhere , concerned that hatred has affected objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists are &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ guilty state officials and indifferent society .
in his last book , the &apos; drug press &apos; , he wrote that the repor@@ ters are not only killing drug gan@@ gs , but also under the command of politicians and security forces , who are at the mer@@ cy of organised crime .
Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , ap@@ pealed to more than half of the attacks on journalists on the police and civil servants last year .
&apos;@@ In Mexico &apos; , because you want to be silent , &apos; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
there is obviously a ver@@ bal impact .
no one will forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ ger Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ sis six years ago .
he was found to be a dead body with a letter , which was probably signed by a car@@ tel in L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
in addition to his pain@@ ted head , computer glass and e@@ ars were found .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state , Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , after the killing of their correspon@@ dent , Ai sla@@ va B@@ otopoulos , in March .
others will pass on as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do after the murder of their President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z has publicly spoken to the drug car@@ tel with the slogan &apos; What do you want us ? &apos; .
some journalists have fled from national states or even from the country .
this is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
it is difficult to find work in this way , and they still have to look at the streets in order to prevent dangers .
and sometimes they are behind them , as was probably the case with the photo@@ graph Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered together with four women &apos;s people in 2015 , three months after the Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z break .
those who remain in place and continue to work will have to refu@@ te risky decisions every day .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to become a po@@ et , recognises that the reporting of drug trafficking is frigh@@ tening him .
&quot; Mexico is on the road to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
one of the recent mid@@ night of Friday , when the latest number had already been s@@ tun@@ ned , the edit@@ ors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat in front of the office and pl@@ undering the be@@ er when suddenly all the phones began to be cal@@ ib@@ rated .
there were 19 people who died in the fire @-@ fighting between ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ is , a sta@@ ggering 19 people .
the war continued to continue , as did several of the messages that have been found in the region .
according to the same pa@@ vements , repor@@ ters made news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website using a mobile phone .
in the front of next day , we needed to change .
the S@@ ire@@ en@@ s were seized by another arms exchange in the region .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pi@@ il@@ us towards police officers to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not at least show it .
the foun@@ der of the newspaper has fallen under a massive t@@ ree , with his average finger being seen as a whole for the Sin@@ al@@ o@@ do@@ ce , in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers in his foot@@ steps .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w can you think about the closure , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; whereas on the same day , when Javier was killed , a trainees@@ hip asked me to make a report on the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur@@ us used the protection of enemies to avoid enemies
at first g@@ lance , it seems like a form , albeit rather frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now unve@@ iled the first findings of the un@@ beli@@ evable presence of Canadian min@@ ers , which are so well preserved that experts have described it as &apos; din@@ osa@@ urs Mon@@ a Lis@@ a &apos; .
it has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the lea@@ ther covered by his soya was the colour of red lig@@ ni@@ te and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the report published in the newspaper Bi@@ ology described the existence as &apos; the best preserved so@@ di@@ um &apos; , which has ever been found &apos; and &apos; one of the best parts of the world &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new type of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us that lived in the middle of the age of 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
its un@@ beli@@ eva@@ bly good retention in the ra@@ ft of theat@@ re who describe it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
according to the National Ge@@ o@@ Guard , this type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus , which has ever been found , has been best preserved by this type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus covered by soya .
it was found on 21 March 2011 by Sha@@ wn functional , when he extra@@ cted Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um in the For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
he struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone , and decided to look into it .
the adver@@ tised ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus was sent to Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ dust muse@@ um .
for the next six years , it was designed to refer the animal to the land of 2 500 p@@ ounds ( 1@@ 100 @-@ kilometres ) .
after all this hard work , the final result is now finally ready to bring the public ahead .
&quot; if a little bit of eyes are tor@@ n , you can almost believe that he s@@ le@@ ep , &apos; said Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , the leading author , Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell , in the muse@@ um of the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell .
&quot; this will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most preserved din@@ osa@@ urs - Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &quot;
when he looked at his sk@@ in , he found that this vege@@ tation , which is covered by soya and rese@@ mb@@ les a wal@@ king tan@@ k , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food din@@ osa@@ urs .
this high @-@ level din@@ osa@@ ur used red and white defence col@@ ours to hide from pre@@ da@@ tors , and applied shel@@ ters , which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
this enabled experts , according to the experts , to enter into the din@@ osa@@ ur better , and to avoid enemies , as the major din@@ osa@@ urs were likely to be hun@@ t .
this was the first time in May and is now visited by Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell in the pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um of the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell .
the researchers have now investigated and given it the name of the Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta Mar@@ mit@@ chel@@ li muse@@ um laboratory mark Mitchell , who was a famous team that spent more than 7@@ 000 hours in order to reveal more than 7@@ 000 hours .
thanks to the ama@@ zing good preservation of the father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to record the shape and size of the so@@ at@@ ings in the body .
they discovered a contradiction - a common method of protection in the country of animal origin , which means that the intr@@ usion of the present half was a dam as a alu@@ mini@@ um .
although there is a common sense of responsibility , the findings come as a surprise , as Boeing is much greater than those who live in the face of responsible animals today .
this suggests that the din@@ osa@@ urs were sufficiently actively hun@@ ted by other mus@@ ici@@ ans , so that the evolution preferred to be over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed instead of the confrontation of the survi@@ v@@ ors .
however , most of the animals used today , such as fear , b@@ ars or ar@@ mad@@ weather , are much smaller and more vulnerable , indicating that no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us had to really work to survive .
&quot; the strong hun@@ t of the din@@ osa@@ ur , which is covered by a huge and multi@@ tude of so@@ ws , shows how dangerous it could have been to be the animals who were kidna@@ pped from the din@@ osa@@ urs of the age of cri@@ pp@@ ers , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds of organic comp@@ ounds also revealed that the din@@ osa@@ ur &apos;s sk@@ in was red .
scientists will continue to set up an investigation in order to get ang@@ les about this life , including the retained content of this gender @-@ style style , in order to find out what the animal would have in its last place .
they believe that the din@@ osa@@ ur has fallen into the dead rivers , thereby entering into the sea , where it turned its back into the ocean .
at the time , Alber@@ tas was just as warm as it is today in South Flor@@ ence , and rivers and oceans are likely to go far beyond the internal land .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us is truly remarkable , as it is fully covered by a so@@ ber lea@@ f , but it has also remained three @-@ dimensional , while preserving the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal is almost the same nowadays as in the age of cri@@ cket .
in order to recon@@ stru@@ ct it , there is not a great deal of imagination to use - it is enough simply to pre@@ ach bridges and it seems to be a s@@ le@@ ep . &quot;
the crisis era was the time when there were huge two leg@@ s in the countryside - he@@ tero@@ gene@@ ous .
although the Qu@@ e@@ en Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x lived millions of years later than Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , some of his hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous predecess@@ ors could be hun@@ ted by some of his hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous predecess@@ ors .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ sa@@ ur@@ us , 38 leg@@ s ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) , a long and six @-@ tonne mon@@ ster .
scientists whose recent findings have been published in the magaz@@ ine Bi@@ ology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta was killed after death in the sea and this mu@@ z@@ ambi@@ que slu@@ dge .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn functional was discovered when he extra@@ cted For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray from the Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine in Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
according to the muse@@ um , it is best preserved in the world , including lea@@ ther and soya , and it is an integrated concentration up to the pu@@ mps .
these assumptions were on average 18 leg@@ s ( five metres ) long and the shel@@ ves up to GBP 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .
there were two 20 customs @-@ long ora on its shoulders .
scientists believe that it was through the current Western Canada , which is covered by the soya , until the river is floo@@ ded into the open sea .
however , the place of absor@@ bing the din@@ osa@@ ur under the sea helped to maintain an excellent detail of its characteristics .
the ice caps of this particular father are so well preserved that the head@@ lines of the my@@ ste@@ rious so@@ om@@ ers are still covered by the head@@ lines of the din@@ osa@@ ur .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote in the magaz@@ ine of National Ge@@ o@@ dic : &apos; such storage is as rare as a lo@@ opho@@ le .
the more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
De@@ lea@@ ded sk@@ in ice is still covered by the creation of my@@ ste@@ rious soya cards on the ground .
a better front is lying alongside him , and five assets have been rus@@ hed up@@ wards .
I will be able to count on the so@@ ws of his winter . &quot;
how did one activist find a response to the question of &apos; whose streets ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll received a full shock .
just a day after the trip to New York , that was the birth@@ place of St@@ . Lou@@ ise Air@@ b@@ n@@ b on a le@@ ak@@ ed bed , on Facebook on the phone .
he came to the post of his former school com@@ patri@@ ot .
there was a letter : &apos; the police killed just 18 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ents and he is still on the streets &apos; .
he was confused why no one else had posted this information on his stream , which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
P@@ ide@@ ga @ The@@ e@@ P@@ suc@@ ah &apos;s user had repeatedly been divided on his line .
Mr St@@ . , from the Lou@@ ise region , Michael Bro@@ w@@ ni , the death of an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man , who was killed by a white police officer in Fer@@ gus@@ on Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is , was communicated in real time .
he gave a picture of the life of Bro@@ w@@ ni living in the street , staying there for four hours .
&quot; it is cra@@ zy , &quot; said Ferreira .
however , death was nothing new for him or for the community .
he has put his phone off , but later this evening , he saw the spar@@ k of the people &apos;s assembly in Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
J@@ ag@@ at photo@@ graph@@ s of the police and the people of fear , and a man who claimed himself to be the father of Bro@@ w@@ n and kept the label &apos; Fer@@ gus@@ oni police killed just my un@@ armed son &apos; .
he looked at a real @-@ time stream in which the police officer stood up to the group of prote@@ sters with the gra@@ ves .
in the second video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Mr Fer@@ rell is reminded of how he struck himself from thinking : &apos; it is unusual &apos; .
&quot; this is not a murder of this kind , which we are ac@@ custo@@ med to and which we could describe as typical . &quot;
I felt frigh@@ tened at this moment .
I was ang@@ ry and I met . &quot;
he boo@@ ked a return flight and travelled home on the next day .
having bu@@ ried at 23 o &apos;@@ clock , he went to his father for his six @-@ year da@@ u@@ ghter and decided that they would travel to Fer@@ gus@@ oni next morning .
what the Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ ga took place next three years is a central issue in the new docu@@ mentary &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; ( &apos; whose streets ? &apos; ) , which will be presented in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who have than@@ ked the answers .
if Mrs Ferreira , together with her da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a li@@ ps@@ y stic@@ ker and a pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar with it - the Fer@@ gus@@ on , they spoke again on a subject that they had repeatedly spoken before this morning - about the experience and living conditions of the mus@@ ici@@ ans .
&quot; remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; recalls itself in question .
&quot; we are now travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ oni because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on board , &quot; said Ferreira later .
&quot; what is happening now is ... the cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it .
he must learn about a activist and organisation and , at the same time , also know the different la@@ yers of experience and living conditions of the mus@@ ici@@ ans , and what we need to do to be free and free .
even if I succeed in bringing him up in such a way that he does not personally copy brutal racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel that I would do him a dis@@ service if I would defend him from this world . &quot;
the first stop that they did in the vic@@ inity of Fer@@ gus@@ oni was through South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ ti - a police station in the middle of the road , which had become a kind of camp , where activists were waiting for news of the police officer Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not ultimately charged .
there , Mr Ferreira and his da@@ u@@ ghter joined forces with local business owners who prepared lunch .
they put together food homes and helped to distribute them to the prote@@ sters .
for the Fer@@ rell , a new type of activist has slowly started to take shape .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ ise University , he was the President of the Union for Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organisation .
this is all simply a pi@@ pe . &quot;
weeks later , Ferreira met a film co @-@ director Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ h during the evening demonstration .
Fo@@ lay@@ an said that he and the film operator , Mr Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , simply wanted to document what is happening .
the question of &apos; are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often painful - come to the community and try to profit from its legitimacy and resilience .
Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
the Fo@@ lay@@ an had already put his hands on the co @-@ director D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ ati , the artificial father of the region , who was known as activists who have been sentenced to death .
his involvement made the project attractive for the Fer@@ rell and the six other local ones who were watched by the film &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; for years after the shooting of Bro@@ w@@ ni .
&quot; in this docu@@ mentary , nobody is talking about us or with us , but we are talking about ourselves , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; for me , it was important how these people are portra@@ yed , because I am also portra@@ yed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rell - it was intended to show that the movement is not about &apos; donor leader &apos; , but about the community coming together &apos; , as the Fo@@ lay@@ an said - he was the most open party to the film .
as a result , &apos; W@@ ho@@ se Stre@@ ets ? &apos; , surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of the life of Fer@@ rell , such as ru@@ th@@ less and mar@@ ried with their wife .
&quot; I felt , as I would be earlier , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll , laugh@@ ing over the first time when he was prepared to see the city .
&quot; however , I realised that it must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability to make this work and to the humanity of the black people . &quot;
moreover , the story of Fer@@ rell emphasises and re@@ places the role of the black L@@ GB@@ T woman in the wider Black Sea Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three initi@@ ators of the movement who , after the killing of the black teen@@ ag@@ er Tra@@ y@@ von Mar@@ tini in the social media in 2012 , thought out the h@@ ash@@ ta@@ g # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter , is homo@@ sexual .
&quot; in a leading role , Muslim women have kept the movement in general , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll , &quot; and this is precisely because we have to fight continually on several fronts .
Roma women must bear all the burden . &quot;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed , stating that &apos; movement is indeed alive by black women and many of them are black homosexu@@ als &apos; .
he says , however , that &apos; this is not a case of creating a kind of equal opportunity &apos; - Fer@@ rell was not chosen as a film centre for his identity .
&quot; he was a man , who was the right energy , &quot; he said .
&quot; however , it is not a coincidence that he was directly on the front@@ line , because the black L@@ GB@@ T woman is at stake when living in such hu@@ bs .
his energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news camer@@ as Fer@@ gus@@ on has long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the conditional sentences imposed on Fer@@ rell during the demonstration for blocking the road will continue to be 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region he calls home@@ lessness , simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
nevertheless , it still attaches importance to the man@@ tra which it has been eating since the time when it went to the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we do not have to lose anything other than our chains . &quot;
7 ni@@ ps on how to overcome We@@ ek@@ ise &apos;s po@@ ta@@ ble@@ t
some of the most stu@@ b@@ born me@@ ters will find , after a scarce pi@@ pe , that they are suffering from , hence help .
or in the light of the saying &apos; Ho@@ w a po@@ t , a py@@ ra@@ mid &apos; .
however , this is only an inevitable postponement and a good word for health .
what can you do to ensure that , after today and tomorrow , the We@@ ek@@ ise trend - or other pi@@ pes - is better felt this morning and to overcome the po@@ pp@@ y as pain@@ fully as possible ?
Jo@@ o water .
it is down to alcohol and , after a great deal this morning ... or , if possible , even rather than alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it must somehow be recovered .
together with water , miner@@ als are also being thrown out of the body , and se@@ sta@@ p is a good ha@@ ir of mineral water .
as a result of the often irri@@ tation of the soil is often irri@@ tated , it is particularly good if it is a bub@@ ble @-@ free or easy ga@@ mble .
let us walk .
it would certainly not cost the grand@@ mother to bur@@ n the trees - it may prove fatal to be a false decision .
however , it is easy to remember the body once again what the feeling is to be alive .
T@@ el@@ gis and s@@ lee@@ ping boys are a more time @-@ consuming way of getting healthier .
give poor energy back gradually and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are already in the middle of yesterday &apos;s over@@ run , it will certainly not be worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
for example , a fresh wave of fruit in which the lion &apos;s share is slowly placed on the market as a body .
if the health of the South is already suffering , it would be possible to try , for example , w@@ ed@@ ding .
and a little later on .
a coff@@ ee was avoided .
this sof@@ ter will release your body from the last water .
as has already been said : water and volume are your friends .
it is making a contribution to pain@@ kil@@ lers .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler in order to prevent a po@@ t on the evening , you have to deal with par@@ at@@ se@@ ta@@ mo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ ph@@ et , not only with alcohol , but also with the ability to do so .
so the ri@@ ches are even more expensive and , in the future , the po@@ pp@@ y is worse .
in addition , there will not be a long @-@ term silence in the past .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler this morning , you will do it with a blan@@ k che@@ que - it irri@@ ta@@ tes the already di@@ r@@ ty swe@@ at .
or if you do not have a partner , you can do well with you .
it is about the same thing as wal@@ king , but it does not become a org@@ as@@ m .
however , too active a pace and outrageous shops were avoided - the physical effort should be moderate .
a jo@@ ke .
the words of the friends of the friends of the time , the road to simple to@@ pes and the na@@ era am@@ ic@@ ably , both for themselves and for others ( suffering ) .
N@@ ali and laugh@@ er may not be doing a po@@ t , but it is certainly easier for them to follow up .
once again , the po@@ et goes over anyway !
Professor of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and University of Ox@@ ford are being sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , profes@@ sors of the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and the University of Ox@@ ford are being sought nation@@ ally , who have received suspects following the death of men with le@@ th@@ al bul@@ lets from one Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s luxury cor@@ ps .
according to the judicial documents of the C@@ oo@@ k Coun@@ ty , on Monday , the arrest warrant was issued for 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i , accused of being murdered at first instance because of their alleged involvement in T@@ ren@@ ton H. James Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u .
according to documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u died after repeated Naz@@ is .
according to the warning that the Ch@@ ic@@ ago police station issued to the community , the body was found on 27 July .
police officers received telephone calls and found the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house for the victim , whose body had a number of tor@@ ture@@ rs .
according to the officials , the Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u event was recognised as dead and investi@@ g@@ ators , while the police are actively looking for two suspects .
they have worked as co @-@ profes@@ sors of micro @-@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at the University of North@@ w@@ ester since 2007 .
the Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations , Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , said in a statement sent as e @-@ publishing that La@@ ke has now been temporarily removed from work and is forbid@@ den to enter the cities of the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n .
&quot; this is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of North@@ w@@ ester will work with researchers , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
Mr W@@ arre@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant of the University of Ox@@ ford .
the representative of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ publishing statement : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to help US research authorities in every possible way &apos; .
in addition , the statement stated that the War@@ ren@@ i colleagues were shocked and willing to give themselves up .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , President of the police department in Ch@@ ic@@ ago , urges the authorities to give themselves to the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are , but we are dealing with an increasingly intensive definition of the exact location , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , local , regional and national authorities will help to search for suspects .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police received a telephone call from the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house , who had just received a cry@@ p@@ tic rain that there has been something happening at Cor@@ ps No 10@@ 08 .
according to the police reports , this was a specta@@ cle .
it is not clear , according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , whether the event itself was also taking place on 27 July .
he said that the security camer@@ as confirm the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ mil and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the Grand Pla@@ za leadership sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police are currently working to identify the background of events and the background of the victim , and will examine the various mo@@ tives , including the possibility of a family dispute . &apos;
companies that help your businesses to avoid the next U@@ b@@ would
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were lu@@ cra@@ tive .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is headed by Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , a company selling e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees in San Franc@@ is@@ co@@ s .
it therefore called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups with new types of human resources , which will help businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software that aims to measure the involvement of workers , they will allow companies to carry out a k@@ ni@@ fe , to target firm teams and demographic groups , to provide the anon@@ y@@ mity of workers and the hot line of complaints and , in some cases , to allow manufacturers to by@@ pass the C @-@ level leaders and to turn directly to the Bureau .
&quot; now there are tools such as Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ bps , which are designed to monitor health , but where is F@@ it@@ bi for your company ? &apos; asked Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O Reding wood City start @-@ ups G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ sts are used by companies to measure the inclusion of workers .
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , he has received three years in which he has used G@@ lin@@ ti , a much better overview of what the workers think and feel .
in addition to surveys and specific teams , it offers a company &apos;s heat card , which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , enabling it to identify the causes .
companies have started to realise that they have to stay in touch with their culture of work , so as not to become the next U@@ b , which has been insur@@ moun@@ ted in scandals since the former worker published a blo@@ g , which described the har@@ as@@ sing environment in which those who da@@ red to speak were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , the desire to have an overview is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business .
the global governance , regulation and conformity area can be worth more than USD 118@@ .@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the website of financial ethics statistics .
Den@@ ver@@ is Col@@ or@@ ad@@ os , a start @-@ up company , which helps businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , noted in the light of the dubious reputation of U@@ b@@ ber this year an increase in interest and activity .
there are almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
the U@@ ber has recently registered himself as a customer .
as in G@@ lin@@ ter , the coalition companies will be able to send a tailor @-@ made impul@@ se poll , collect real @-@ time confidential answers and look at the problematic areas of heat cards .
it also offers anon@@ ymous messages to enable workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has been an@@ cho@@ red by regulators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan and CE@@ O Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act eth@@ ically , the company may face serious consequences , such as consumer boycot@@ ts , leaving workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by , the restaur@@ ant , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of operation , has been used more than a year to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and offer a simple way to intera@@ ct with the headquarters of the corpor@@ ation .
if a worker wanted to report the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address to the corpor@@ ation headquarters , and I hope that it will be taken seriously .
this was often a discoura@@ ging and in@@ convenient process , said James Vit@@ ran@@ o , General Ad@@ vis@@ er , who said that there was no good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , at a time when the company is using a coalition cen@@ sus , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices , which did not previously lead to more rapid identification and treatment of offices in other cities or states .
&quot; I will be able to get closer to the hol@@ y 3@@ 60 @-@ degree experience of the workers , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who is headed by the Ru@@ by @-@ by @-@ by @-@ line risk management group .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and the involvement of workers more seriously in 2002 , after the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen collapsed due to ethical irregularities in relation to the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; , the companies realised that they cannot prevent their black was@@ h from publicly hiding online .
&quot; before using the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Vienna offer their software as a service , taking advantage of companies &apos; perio@@ dic pay for the use of their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors who have been in favour of both start @-@ ups .
in February 10 million dollars were financed by companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by USD 47 million .
the G@@ lin@@ ti invested USD 10 million in November in B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , increasing the company &apos;s total funding to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise if we take into account the link between companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more research shows that today &apos;s workers are waiting for more than before .
in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are just on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy in a company , they feel that they are heard and that the work they do is satis@@ fying , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , who has a general benefit and the experience of workers , who uses both the so @-@ called cen@@ cen@@ ti and G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors earn revenue if companies belonging to their portfolio are doing well ; businesses are doing well when workers are committed and involved .
if the analytical tools of the third party allow us to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , we are not sure that they will be supported .
the possession of data on the involvement of workers is important , according to experts in the culture of work .
however , these data are useless if the company &apos;s follow @-@ ups do nothing to do with them .
in fact , if a company asks for feedback from its employees , it can create expectations that changes are ahead of us .
and if the changes do not take place quickly or not at all , it could cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask 4 000 proposals , you must be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; said K@@ ot@@ ter International President R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who has seen how companies are making a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&quot; because if things are not brought to the end , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Netherlands , which is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via G@@ lin@@ ti .
and , after the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , it was possible to re@@ organise several teams in the company and to provide communication training to deal with the problems .
however , Mr Ru@@ by Kyprianou is collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in the industry , known for its high turnover of labour .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose your customers .
and if you lose your customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
the euro area remains a sta@@ r in Bali : incomes are growing rapidly
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , B@@ SE , referring to the report by the European Central Bank .
according to the ECB , since 1999 , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
there is a low debt burden , fast @-@ growing institutions and business @-@ friendly and free @-@ market @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where the EU average has been substantially closer to the purchasing power of the reactor per capita . &quot; announced the Central Bank .
while the aim is to ensure that the overall output of the economy per capita is equal to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2 / 3 of the average of 15 countries , which were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle .
low wages have led the bal@@ ans to seek a better wage abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic in a positive light , and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are doing very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was slightly less than half of those questioned about their economies .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel the trends taking place twice a day makes Bru@@ in@@ si a long day
at almost 23 o &apos;@@ clock , it is almost 23 that the football club of U@@ C@@ L@@ A stops talking at the edge of a new exercise in the city of a team .
some of them have been burdened by a ban@@ ner , reve@@ aling the efforts of the first day of their training camp .
for a large part of the team , they provide a mid@@ day break .
the participants in the course of the cu@@ cu@@ mbers are going to learn from the tri@@ alogues after a three @-@ hour trend , before returning at 6.@@ 30 meetings next morning to the W@@ W@@ man football club .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Bru@@ in@@ si tre@@ ach , Jim Mor@@ a , shortly before the Monday became Tuesday .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel the burden of players on a two @-@ day basis has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end of the day - to one side of the bar@@ gain .
for this reason , the three first operations of the U@@ C@@ L@@ A were prompted to start at 19.@@ 15 , in order to fit players into the already tight time@@ line .
the transition from two strikes a day to a day means more than one trend - the beginning of the Bru@@ in@@ si camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season , and for the first time in Mor@@ a &apos;s six W@@ es@@ tw@@ ard season , there will be workshops during summer courses .
they have until 20 August an agenda of 18 tr@@ en@@ ings before the formal preparation of the opening game against T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M in September begins .
according to Mor@@ a , he is in favour of the change of the N@@ CA@@ A rules , although it adds another item to the close schedu@@ les of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they break themselves through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that if we arrive on Saturday and we have more time , it will be a truly good thing . &quot;
if the camp is closed , the U@@ C@@ L@@ A work@@ ings will be closed down , which is not an easy task , given the clear view of the par@@ king pla@@ te of their fields and by @-@ stand@@ by L@@ us@@ kin@@ i , a higher @-@ class hotel , which has already esca@@ ped from a net of protection from football around the gates .
since this weekend , ho@@ tels are occupied by the Bru@@ in@@ si players , but Mor@@ a acknowledged that problems may arise during the season with free tobacco .
&quot; we are implementing security measures , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real concern and it is not exagg@@ erated to think that people can fil@@ ter a do@@ zen and tre@@ asu@@ ries .
if the summer has a record of a train , it can do a good deal .
but we are using a security team there and 8 par@@ king stations .
we will do our best to use it .
I will try not particularly to worry about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the cost of the election union of Sa@@ du@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , who was expelled from the Reform Party , Kris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ and and the ECB forced to leave the forces of Maria Kal@@ j@@ s in the hands of our Tallinn and the parties to show the entrepreneurial Association in Tallinn , seems to be at least as much as the political parties involved in the local elections this year .
however , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether they are all sufficiently disappointed by voters .
who will remain with the Sahel ?
if the support team of Ed@@ gar Sa@@ du@@ are has been reduced , it can anticipate the events organised by his electoral union .
one of the members of the country , some former and current central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and is there any reason why , in Tallinn , some of the fai@@ th@@ ful fai@@ ths and sis@@ ters of Sa@@ du@@ are evade the candida@@ cy , to look at the fact that the list of &apos; Sa@@ du@@ are &apos; , which is the subject of suspicion of corruption and corruption , is becoming a reality ?
on the Russian @-@ speaking po@@ em of a film @-@ driven music cal@@ de@@ o , which takes part in the city of Las@@ na@@ mä@@ e ; and in any sense the original computer game in which Prime Minister J@@ ü@@ ri Ra@@ tas must avoid l@@ om@@ ni@@ pe and or@@ ch@@ es@@ ts on the road to the polls for the first time , is the central party trying to avoid the votes of the 16@@ th and 17@@ th year @-@ old voters ?
we look forward to the perception of the other political parties of the youth campaign .
if the Kan@@ al 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 look at the black r@@ ally instead of the beginning of August , there will be two options : to accept that , in future , only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn TV and English @-@ language Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels or to surrender each month to 10 TV operators .
there are probably also those who openly re@@ jo@@ ice at the beginning of advertising @-@ free television experience , but at the end of the day - albeit reluc@@ tantly - pay for television and advertise@@ ments .
the de@@ af@@ ening music , the black people and the rub@@ b@@ ish left on the streets are an un@@ pleasant side of almost every major mus@@ ical festi@@ val .
however , if you do not want to be part of the ocean , however , it is worth going to the home country , rather than being pain@@ ted at home , to go - and leave a s@@ lee@@ ping place for the lun@@ g sum for the festi@@ val .
Washington changes the rules of the Green Card
media publications are quoted by President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned , which will change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Re@@ publi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill goes to the two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , as it will change the way in which green maps are issued to citizens of other countries in the US .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process provides an advantage for candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economies , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp American media publications .
Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to young people are moving back to land , pensioners .
J@@ ev@@ se@@ ye@@ v A@@ na@@ tol@@ oli continues the tradition of the famous se@@ to gold min@@ ers of the River Ma@@ ana .
he is working 140 kilometres away from home to Ma@@ ana , as a driver of gold in Ku@@ vai .
this is a tough job : two months of work without rest days , and then only 10 days at home and again .
during the three years of the Ar@@ tel , A@@ na@@ tol@@ l has seen only one time .
&apos;@@ There is a lot of order : when you go into it , you will have to be thoroughly checked so that you do not lead to it , and if you do not take it &apos; , you will talk about A@@ na@@ tol .
M@@ are Pi@@ ho &apos;s conver@@ sation in the village of H@@ ai@@ da with the local se@@ to Ja@@ ga , who has spoken a lot about the memory of his family in Si@@ beria .
the archa@@ ic culture of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ pes is also beginning to affect the homes , because it is simply so shocking , thinks the most far @-@ sighted mix@@ tures of Pi@@ ho M@@ are .
his first investigation trip to Si@@ beria will be 30 years later this year .
during this period , he has been there 14 times and has lived there for one year .
how much was the case in Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took note of this in the words of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to men who have also thought about it .
it is difficult to say precisely because up to 30 people could come in one group at the time , but the passport was only given to a man .
the passport was given only one , but it was children , sis@@ ters and women .
look at how much this territory was here .
this was a number of times greater than the historic S@@ et@@ oma@@ ist .
after all , it was necessary to educate , to manage it in some way .
S@@ et@@ os came here as farmers , but their lives changed , because they came to areas that were not only in agriculture but also in the river ( pal@@ gi@@ par@@ ation ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New Pet@@ ser@@ t , many pigs went to work later in K@@ ras@@ no@@ jar@@ sk @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P@@ . ) when it was formed .
was it the majority of the population in the region at that time ?
yes , they lived in a Compact .
in addition , a long tradition of marriage is maintained , and a lot of children .
seven @-@ eight children in the family were common .
how much is the culture of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ pes different and different from that of the mother tongue ?
they are different , although what was said here was never the same .
they gave rise to a great deal of money .
they did so , too , ( the shadow ideas ) , but they always made a distinction between what was included and what was done here .
climate change has been severely affected by the traditional ri@@ val@@ ry , because there is , after all , a cold .
the changes have been proposed .
for example , S@@ et@@ oma@@ al meat was salt , but it was simply frozen here .
where are the villages of Si@@ b@@ erian and what life is living there ? / graph@@ ics : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ends
the link with the mother country was spiri@@ tually strong , it was considered very important .
it seems to me that it is now starting to give back to the Se@@ tu@@ ony , to influence them .
those girls who have lived here in families have listened to ama@@ zing stories .
Pi@@ ho must bear in mind the people of the Estonian delegation who came at the beginning of July to the day of H@@ ai@@ da village Se@@ to Kingdom and lived four days in homes - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is very easy to come and also go , because the city has an excellent location : the railway link and the roads at the crossroads , says Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m , who comes from T@@ ap@@ y .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a lot of hope , sports and cultural places , and the car@@ rot will be in every corner .
T@@ ap@@ a is a ti@@ p @-@ up city !
there is a small island in the L@@ in@@ era through the current White river , where the Ta@@ mil@@ s tend to be hi@@ jac@@ ked .
&quot; this beautiful place of train does not appear to be &apos; , ha@@ gg@@ les Re@@ ig@@ o .
those who are not afraid of cold water can flood in the river , because the river is full of resources .
I have been floo@@ ded there , you can do it !
the water of the river can be regarded as long as it is easy to do the ro@@ man@@ tics - it can look at the flow of the river and think about life and want .
I have also been there with my own names .
the O@@ oper@@ is@@ ol@@ ist Tam@@ m has , apart from anything else , been getting used to three bridges between the river basin : &apos; that this place is on the city &apos;s city , no one may come in any way if their stories are heard &apos; .
&quot; there is a wonderful view of the T@@ ap@@ y mountain , but there are also health professionals where you can drink , winter ski@@ es and now , for example , to play a gol@@ f course - gol@@ f courses have been made , chains can be borro@@ wed from sports centres , &quot; Re@@ ig@@ o .
the old pro@@ cess@@ ors are , of course , there with their own system , but I have not yet been able to play there .
obviously , my colleague , Mrs Ras@@ mus , must be invited to the village of T@@ ap@@ ale , because she has experienced c@@ gol@@ f@@ ans and she has a chain .
perhaps he will lend me !
Re@@ ig@@ o and M@@ än@@ ni@@ ku@@ g were in@@ separ@@ able from the current period of childhood .
at least during hours .
there are many te@@ ars , dis@@ appointments and you can be found in my sporting life .
not to mention the collapse of bel@@ ls and su@@ ici@@ des .
&quot; the entire city is now full of construction works , all this will become unknown , &quot; praised by Re@@ ig@@ o .
however , the old and ti@@ red building is a very attractive place where oral disco@@ veries are being played .
I am pleased that in 2012 , the head of R@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ M , welcomed my idea and had to make a summer theat@@ re with his theat@@ re .
although this year &apos;s theat@@ re season &apos; Ale@@ kse@@ i K@@ aren@@ in &apos; has just been carried out , on 11 August , the railway station is &apos; El@@ lu@@ wake &apos; , when the old building is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; from 11 to 13 August , T@@ ap@@ a City Days have been launched , in addition to the Open house of the P@@ rin@@ ge , and there will be a series of cultural events , including the Solidarity Fund , Re@@ ig@@ o , who recommends a visit to the city of 9 days .
on 1 May , a muse@@ um has already been in 1994 on 1 May .
&quot; the house is small , but there is a great deal of mis@@ gi@@ vings and information enormously , &quot; welcomes Re@@ ig@@ o , which is full of the history of the T@@ ap@@ a town , most of which focuses on the railways and sis@@ ter .
Re@@ ig@@ o mu@@ ds that , if all the sites recommended by T@@ ap@@ al were to be carried out , it will be a long @-@ distance empty , but fortunately a small town is full of coff@@ ee .
&quot; we have such good eating places and when we sit in coff@@ ee , sometimes you have the feeling that you are abroad , he describes it .
educated and young T@@ ap@@ y soldiers spend a lot of time in pub@@ s , se@@ sta@@ p there is a mixed feeling that you are in Estonia and your home town , but there is such an international company together .
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to the stories of the French or the Americans .
the wars , yes , we are going to have a lot !
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal ten@@ dering in Greece
Tele@@ can@@ al b@@ TV quoted a foreign Ministry who announced that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ dering .
in the morning of 1 August , the police arrested on the island of Si@@ th@@ onia a group of illegally ordered people , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free ten@@ dering and are already imposing heavy fines on all those who are caught in a place of cle@@ ans@@ ing , which is not intended to do so .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
the w@@ ol@@ ves that teach the junta are breaking the sheep .
farmers on the shel@@ f have to give the w@@ ol@@ ves once again , after year , to give their car@@ pet &apos; educational material &apos; - apparently the w@@ ol@@ ves that taught the junta have already broken a number of sheep .
this year , the w@@ ol@@ ves in the Hi@@ i@@ u Coun@@ ty have broken the sheep three times , with 23 sheep and eight , wri@@ tes the Hi@@ i@@ u page .
the soil was only three years before 124 .
there are also data from the Environment Agency in the syn@@ dro@@ me of Mur@@ d@@ ines that the soil was not born in Hi@@ iu@@ land and the Hi@@ iu@@ land hunting Council &apos;s information that this year , two w@@ ol@@ ves have been fixed on the island .
on Monday night , the w@@ ol@@ ves were unle@@ as@@ hed by 15 sheep in the village of K@@ abu@@ l and injured in 18 survi@@ v@@ ors .
in the morning of the morning , the w@@ ol@@ ves in the village of Re@@ he@@ backs on the land of the village of Com@@ m@@ ons were broken down by one sheep and w@@ ounded hard by another , who had to be made an emergency kil@@ ler .
rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and the draft law on the amendment of plant protection products .
the amendment to the law remo@@ ves the creation of a separate collection of data for the locations of both genetically modified ( GM ) crops and operators , which will continue to be used for plant health records .
in addition , the obligation of GM crops to have prior agreement with the designated person dealing with beekeeping will be amended .
although there is currently no cultivation of GM crops in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as there is no decision to declare Estonia GMO @-@ free , &quot; said S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , the head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and the public sector , in the Annex .
the draft law repe@@ als the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of data on GM crops and operators in the field of GM crops , lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and the requirements for starting economic activities .
specifically with regard to the beekeeping sector , the obligation to inform bee@@ keepers of the cultivation of GM crops will be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with bee@@ keepers before bringing up cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to minis@@ tries for coordination .
all interested parties have the opportunity to access the draft information system and , if they so wish , to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , those operating in the area of plant farming , bee@@ keepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10 .
so far , however , no Estonian farmer has been interested in the cultivation of GM crops .
the reason for this is that there is no ma@@ gic bul@@ let in Estonia , a European shadow media , for which mon 8@@ 10 is resistant .
it has also been extended to the southern regions , and it is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
in order to obtain certainty , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination of GM organisms in Estonia in seeds , maize and soya vari@@ eties .
the analysis of the sam@@ ples carried out showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soya vari@@ eties in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms .
in turn , it can be concluded that in Estonia , GM crops are not deliberately culti@@ vated , and it was also confirmed that there has not been a random contamination .
J@@ ose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho thinks that Manch@@ ester United col@@ ours in the form of N@@ eman@@ ja Ma@@ tic@@ u in the form of &apos; gen@@ i@@ us &apos;
J@@ ose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manch@@ ester United States has recru@@ ited N@@ eman@@ ja Ma@@ tic@@ u in the form of &apos; genetic gen@@ i@@ us &apos; , after a central player against Sam@@ lov on Wednesday evening .
for GBP 40 million , a player bought from C@@ hel@@ sea , started in Dublin , in the last seasonal game of the Uni@@ te@@ di , before the UEFA Su@@ per C@@ up@@ i line against Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 , impressed by the role of defence , while Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Pe@@ re@@ ira were free to go on attacks .
however , having left aside from the Blu@@ eprint for seasonal Asia , Ma@@ tic@@ l was badly needed to bur@@ y and it was only 45 minutes , which , according to M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , must be corrected before the start of the Pre@@ mi@@ er League season .
&quot; he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , gen@@ i@@ ous thinking - he has a football mind@@ set , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to achieve a form as soon as possible . &quot;
as in the past , the A@@ vi@@ va sta@@ di@@ um also started other new recru@@ ited Vic@@ tor L@@ inde@@ l@@ of and Rom@@ lu Mubarak , and M@@ our@@ in@@ ho began to put a man in place at the beginning of the season .
the In@@ dependent public this week revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wants to recruit three football clubs , but he confirmed that the club has already done a &apos; excellent job &apos; by concluding agreements with three of its four priority choices .
&quot; I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three out of four , &quot; he added .
&quot; I am even hap@@ pi@@ er if they are able to make four four , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
another warm son received the GSM E@@ mb@@ assy on 1 August and this time in M@@ uh@@ us .
according to M@@ ati Mar@@ tin@@ son , an observer living in S@@ fragile Mar@@ tin@@ son , we received the first cu@@ mber to be equipped with the emb@@ assy in S@@ fragile , and this was@@ hing cell is already flying around , leaving the was@@ hing ground and joining a large @-@ scale gar@@ ment of the Mul@@ lu@@ tu @-@ Great Gulf .
this is because , after all , there are no fer@@ tility fields , the voice of the islands is written .
this Tuesday , in a relatively late way , it has become yet another son and one on the island of M@@ uh@@ u .
according to Mar@@ tin@@ son , the installation of emb@@ assies is actually an international project that is being carried out by A@@ iva@@ r Lei@@ to and I@@ va@@ r O@@ j@@ ka .
the soil was supplied by a son called M@@ ati GSM , S@@ fragile ves Turkey .
&quot; his actions are all on the internet : how he went to Spain in winter , back a long time in the German and Polish border , and then Sa@@ are@@ land came , Mar@@ tin@@ son spoke .
British inven@@ tors to in@@ sta@@ ll a micro@@ chi@@ p in their own body in order to get a hand@@ ful of houses and cars
the British inven@@ tor became the first person in a country to have a micro@@ chi@@ p installed in order to be able to open up its own front , to get to office and even to launch a car .
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Ste@@ ven North@@ am children to in@@ sta@@ ll a small chi@@ p between their fin@@ gers and their name , and will now provide this service to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier through their technology .
he has joined forces with Dr Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consul@@ tant @-@ an@@ es@@ te@@ si@@ olo@@ gist of the Ro@@ yal hospital in Win@@ ch@@ ester in Han@@ ts , to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards .
the technology is similar to the micro@@ chi@@ p installed on ca@@ ts and bags , and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure .
the North@@ am company will also replace houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chi@@ p , asking for GBP 300 per cent .
this child &apos;s father has now installed the technology both at home and in his car , B@@ M@@ W Z@@ 4 , which will start when he has his hand in the whe@@ el .
the White House has cost taxpayers thousands of
according to the military documents announced in the magaz@@ ine , the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicop@@ ter last month for an event involving American production in the south of the hor@@ ror to the taxpayer was even USD 24 000 .
the green and white colour S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , which is called Marine One during the presidential par@@ don , was a central feature of the event that took place on 17 July in Val@@ ges Ma@@ in .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House reported on industrial products from all 50 states in the world .
the helicop@@ ter built in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ tis was built together with a reputation @-@ based hun@@ t , a fire @-@ fighting car from W@@ is@@ con@@ ten and a Mis@@ sis@@ si@@ p @-@ made pal@@ let .
according to the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) documents , the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on , the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on , called for the presence of a helicop@@ ter in a military c@@ abinet , a little 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter for the &apos; unusual &apos; event in the southern hor@@ ror .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 kom@@ and@@ ö@@ r a day before the event in an e @-@ mail , the Deputy officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
the message indicated that the helicop@@ ter arri@@ ves in the southern hor@@ ror on 17 July morning at 7 : 15 : 00 , and remains there until the same evening between 18 and 21 .
it was added that if the departure of the White House were to be present , a second @-@ hear@@ ted flight is needed due to the restrictions on working time .
the original air crew was at the helicop@@ ter during the event , and the security team of the es@@ c@@ ill@@ ary was close to the aircraft near the ground throughout the time of its stay .
it was not possible to read out from the documents given to the letter of time whether or not the second e@@ tho@@ s were eventually needed .
the H@@ at@@ ch law prohibits federal workers from using the government &apos;s assets for political purposes .
the documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 examined whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked whether it is in breach of H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law , and we were told that it was not , &apos; wrote a com@@ man@@ der .
&apos;@@ It seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to the Deputy Prime Minister .
the White House declared the &apos; made in America &apos; event , and the H@@ at@@ ch law would not have covered it .
however , even official events have political under@@ ton@@ es .
the President supported the efforts of health reform in the Senate at the time in the Senate and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in danger .
the use of an aircraft known as &apos; Marine One or Air Force &apos; for political gain is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use these purely photo@@ graph@@ s is unusual .
in February , the T@@ ru@@ mp came to the attention of his first campaign event in Flor@@ idas Mel@@ bour@@ ne , the President &apos;s plane , and he is sli@@ ding from Twitter &apos;s account messages complaining about how his predecessor &apos;s President &apos;s flight was used .
&quot; the White House is very pleased with the &apos; made in America &apos; , where products were represented in all 50 states made by American workers , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the spokes@@ man of the White House .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often carry out tests around Washington and the southern hor@@ ror in order to get down to the white house of the President of the United States with a c@@ enti@@ metres .
when T@@ ru@@ mp was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House held 58 sam@@ ples .
according to the official , the flight was considered to be the norm for the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; flight crew at the time of a month .
the Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r helicop@@ ter flying 11 hours for &apos; non @-@ subsidy missions &apos; , in addition to that day .
according to the White House , none of the other forms of this event were burdened by the taxpayers &apos; w@@ alle@@ ts .
according to the representative of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , the company was not involved in carrying out a helicop@@ ter in the southern hor@@ ror .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 does not maintain the budgetary documents of the President &apos;s flights and it is difficult to clarify the precise costs of the event .
however , at the time of the defence Ministry for the financial year 2017 , the V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D compensation rate is set at USD 24 380 per hour .
the Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r &apos;s documents indicated the length of the flight from Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o airport to Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a for 30 minutes .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using helicop@@ ter is well below the amount .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimated compensation rates include staff , care and many other irreversible costs , which will be taken into account in the annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 @-@ rand study , the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation rates for staff costs , but they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former press officer of the White House Se@@ an S@@ pic@@ er defended the use of helicop@@ ter at the time .
&quot; the point is to show the things made in America this week , &quot; said S@@ pic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that the State of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ ti is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds , if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the T@@ ru@@ mp was a helicop@@ ter in the south of the hor@@ ror in the event , or not , but he was hiding behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
in the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky addressed representatives by representatives of the media ou@@ tle@@ ts on the company &apos;s products in his personal aircraft fleet .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ ská very well , &quot; said President , &quot; I have three products . &quot;
G@@ ari Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o - T@@ as@@ te@@ ars arrived in peace and joy
the 2011 M@@ M@@ il D@@ ae@@ tis hit Š@@ ade@@ i@@ ko@@ t in the last area , 800 m be@@ ver@@ ages and was taken away from the sta@@ di@@ um .
shortly before that , he had received a zero @-@ sum leap from the University of China .
the Helsinki Helsinki formula in 2012 was an asset for cheap injury , but in London , it received 60 13 points 23 .
however , I have continued to do so .
after 2013 , Moscow &apos;s M@@ M@@ il became a driving force in Estonia &apos;s timetable for a long @-@ term parental injury .
two years later , he became the 15@@ th seat of Beijing and met the Olympic Games , but this was more than a disappointment to the ath@@ le@@ tes .
the Ras@@ ke@@ d@@ ali@@ p@@ u was only passed by the Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o , when the outcome of the Amsterdam E@@ mb@@ assy was not received a letter at the beginning .
I would just like to put together one proper multi @-@ contest once .
one time , spra@@ yed Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
worse still lies ahead : a month later , his Olympic contest in Ri@@ os re@@ i@@ ev@@ ig@@ as@@ tery was already in the first hur@@ dle .
the time had to be taken down - is there any continuation of the seven competition ?
is the two @-@ day effort still worth all of this ?
N@@ ei@@ u thought a long time , but found peace .
I had to think about it .
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time for us to treat ourselves all and think about it .
&quot; I knew that I am not going to put a c@@ ool on the picture , &quot; S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o is talking about his self @-@ cle@@ ans@@ ing .
I was able to turn a clean page and go ahead with the new momentum .
T@@ re@@ en@@ er Anne hill said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of neg@@ ligence , but he realised that , above all , the spor@@ ts@@ man himself has to get to the bottom .
after all , he was so repres@@ sed by all .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; however , he said that he does not give up and he wants to prove what he is worth , says remember .
now there is some kind of peace .
he will do so to his joy .
the contest came back in May , when the Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o set 6@@ 280 points for a new Estonian record in G@@ öt@@ z@@ itself .
in a high @-@ level competition , he improved his personal excellence in the heat of nearly a me@@ tre ( 13.@@ 89 ) , and drink a record of a barrier .
then there was a feeling of multiple competition that it was not at all a ceiling , but it was only the first hunger to be defe@@ ated .
he has been instru@@ cted for years by a word that Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o is a Muslim student .
he is ready to be spor@@ ts@@ man , he is a good training .
if something is wrong or wrong , he says it immediately .
he feels his own body and trus@@ ts his sense .
that is what we need to do .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we follow it .
the new approach has also been found in Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
&quot; I am not the one who makes the most of the trend , he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right sense , because it also guarantees a good result .
baby wal@@ ks will be happy to do so .
the good emo@@ tion has also been offered to the S@@ ade@@ i@@ ko@@ u .
both his former friend , Mar@@ is hill and Gre@@ te , recently became grand@@ parents and has received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;@@ It has been quite interesting &apos; , says Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
one alcohol whose drinking is tanta@@ mount to &apos; training &apos; .
Li@@ ves@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is a father of such a great wine game that he believes - wine can be trained better than any other thing in the world .
She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist University of Y@@ ale .
his message is not about alcohol or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
when it comes to the Council , when it comes to wine , when it comes to the complexity of the wine , we are putting our brain into work in order to create a taste for wine .
according to the She@@ per@@ di , there is no real taste in the error , but a taste in the way in which wine is stimu@@ lated .
he will bring about a comparison of how the brain &apos; sees &apos; colour &apos; .
&apos;@@ The taste is not wine , the taste creates wine and &apos; says She@@ per@@ d .
things that are still affecting the taste of wine are , for example , our van@@ ity , gender and even the amount of coal that man produces .
She@@ per@@ d , of course , is that wine is not full of Jews .
&quot; there must be more &apos; , he says .
if you are too big a lon@@ gest , the system is over@@ crow@@ ded .
excessive wine drinking can harm the brain instead of profit - according to the 2004 survey , people who drink more than three glass wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity .
10 % of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay for colleagues
the figures reveal that 10 % of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia receive lower salaries from their colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , the portal Ge@@ eni@@ us wri@@ tes .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay study .
a total of 8 5@@ 77 posts were examined .
63 % of posts were employed by men .
&quot; although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies , the reality is that there is no pay gap , compared to the average salary of men per month is 10 % higher than that of women and men per year on average 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said Fon@@ crates analy@@ sts Il@@ mar North .

according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
the head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
the leader of the United Nations Assistance Mission , Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , said that hundreds of women are standing in local Soviet elections , three women are standing as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; by underlining the importance of women &apos;s role , it is not possible to exagg@@ erated , &quot; he said in his statement on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with the transitional period , when the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is given cal@@ mly to one democratically elected government over the next .
according to Mr Ha@@ ys@@ om , women &apos;s strong role in Afghanistan will increase the success of democracy .
according to the Afghan independent electoral Commission , 1.2 million women have registered 3.@@ 6 million registered voters .
the joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both in large and small .
there is always too little common time , but the trend is a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
and what a convenient solution - wherever you were in the summer , live animals are always accompanied by the summer , and you will be im@@ pati@@ ently reminded of your fine voice : &apos; we are now going to be a tr@@ en@@ y ! &apos;

one is the foundation of permanent foot@@ wear and tuna - who would then like to take the form of sand sand s@@ lee@@ ping over the summer ?
it is nice to use children instead of chic@@ ken .
firstly , it is secure and convenient , and the race is gradually growing at the same pace as the training and force .
it is also possible to do the villages with quite large children .
the child teac@@ hes a balance , counts the cor@@ ps and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
bigger children can do their own villages at the same time .
the scale of the movement is determined by the land shortage and you are pul@@ ling up .
keeping the fin@@ gers straight , the ball mini@@ mised properly .
the child can read the fla@@ ts and feel as a job .
the planet is a huge , but hope@@ less exercise for the child .
however , it is easy to make things easier .
in the game @-@ plan@@ k : take a long plan@@ k to the colon@@ ies of which to get through .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much easier to do if , in the meantime , a friend can be given a hand .
to add the burden , we can keep the plants , the small market , and we can also walk around it .
in addition , the pu@@ mps of a child can be plan@@ ted , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
at the same time as the cra@@ bs are joining the sand , the tri@@ ump@@ h , ash and air meat burden , such as the infection .
a child wal@@ ks on their feet so that his body is distributed equally in advance and behind .
security can be kept in the hands of the market .
all wal@@ king and wal@@ king up straight away .
I will be able to fly , to fly , to strike a balance and to be difficult .
the life of a small engine@@ er is an ex@@ hor@@ tation if he gets a small number of things in every fire .
the extra burden will be put on the feet of sho@@ es .
check that the label remains in a neutral position .
children themselves have a lot of fu@@ n to do a boat and a pla@@ te .
the work and the w@@ ed@@ ding fuel .
follow the child &apos;s safety , the name of the fields , and the hotel in a neutral position .
all children &apos;s fav@@ ou@@ rite and big fu@@ n !
at the same time , the whole body trend is truly effective for the elderly .

a journey from the Philippines to the heart of the mo@@ pe@@ ds of a wide range of wor@@ l@@ ds in the Philippines .
plastic bags are the summer class , which has become a product in itself in recent years , which , in one of the right summer , has to han@@ g the hand , and which , despite its modest origin , traders have been able to extra@@ ct a price label in the same way .
it is probably one of the things that has existed in the life of the law and which has not been aro@@ used by any particular emo@@ tion .
it is simply there , and if there is no , there is no overla@@ p .
however , there is now a real victory for be@@ er bags , and mo@@ ef@@ ers have swit@@ ched their mus@@ h@@ rooms against simple be@@ er bags by summer months .
it is not only a coast@@ line , but today it is just as popular as a street , and more courageous women even walk into office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear whether this summer &apos;s summer is still sitting or whether it is worth postponing the label and lap@@ top@@ s a little more official .
however , the wealth of tolerance has made a real summer love for women .
for example , when we read foreign mo@@ eb@@ logis@@ ts , the first thing is that the mo@@ e@@ y@@ o@@ gh@@ ur@@ ts are the first thing to do with the local market and acquire some be@@ er bags , which are then the tru@@ ck of a whole holiday period , and which is accompanied by a be@@ ach , on the market and also as a friend in the city .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are even so generous that they are buying from the market a bigger w@@ ol@@ f and selling them or giving them to their loyal read@@ ers .
in doing so , it is worth noting that there is a demand among read@@ ers for women in the real world ( and men ! ) , apparently , to be involved in each other &apos;s fishing zone in order to become a happy owner of some homes .
in some ways , this mad@@ ness is also understandable , because it is rare for them to be able to buy some of the things that have gone into the m@@ ou@@ ths of yesterday , just for a few decades .
it is true that white merchan@@ ts have also discovered a simple way of ear@@ ning money here , and so more luxury br@@ ands are sold for a few hundred and a thousand euros .
obviously , that the richer customers should not feel easy to die , who are pro@@ claiming around with some cheap bags .
for example , it is possible to buy D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a over EUR 1 000 in hand .
however , for the interpretation of Chan@@ el &apos;s interpretation , EUR 6 000 can be found in the circulation .
in contrast to most of the mo@@ tives , however , the bre@@ w@@ ers do not come from some of the big mos@@ ques , but their story began in a more distant way .
Ad@@ mittedly , the be@@ er bags come from far from the Philippines , where they have been subjected to a wide range .
it is very often the case that there is a lot of red tape , in particular , for export companies , and there is very often no way in which they are going around .
it is claimed that the 14 centuries of oil technique origin@@ ated and is quite a series of normal cor@@ ps .
however , as the be@@ er does not need to be as much red as cor@@ ps , they will be accompanied by mus@@ ici@@ ans and other materials that are more person@@ alised and , by extension , more active .
in recent times , for example , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y bags where the colour of red col@@ ours or sk@@ im@@ med bo@@ xes .
however , in particular , be@@ er bags can be sent to the ac@@ tress J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , the largest bun@@ dled be@@ er of whom was not seen before .
it was precisely that it su@@ ed shoulder to all sorts of clothing complex and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
however , the popul@@ arity of the Cop@@ ts today does not play a smaller role , but also that caring for them is a hot head and , unlike any other summer , they do not have to care for them with special means , but also the water and the w@@ et .
as in the case of the trend rob@@ ber@@ y , the br@@ ands have come out of all sorts of interpretations , apart from the classi@@ cal appearance .
for example , if you want to have a red ri@@ ce , you can buy a red @-@ shir@@ t or a little bit of a boo@@ m .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classi@@ cal be@@ er is never going to be a mo@@ b , but a be@@ er .
but what is the classi@@ cal be@@ er ?
for centuries , there has been a classic copy of the be@@ er , which rese@@ mb@@ les a repetition of its style , is open , and it is short , as well as be@@ er , cri@@ pp@@ ers .

G@@ M@@ B concerns about investment in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant
the trade union expects the leaders of the mature producer and Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to confirm the long @-@ term production plans in the G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment .
more than 500 people are employed in H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich know @-@ how and other products .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s owner Pla@@ dis said that they have invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years .
the workers and the trade union chairs are the first to hear &apos; when something changes in the operation of the plant .
in a letter sent to the head of the company , G@@ M@@ B Scotland asked Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to &apos; alla@@ y concerns about the lack of funding to modernise production lines &apos; .
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the site on the business needs and the future investment plan for the future , makes our members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and the people around G@@ las@@ go@@ w , as an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region where there is high unemployment and social housing .
therefore , in terms of jobs , wages and welfare in the east of G@@ las@@ go@@ w , and in the context of Bre@@ x@@ ti , the rise in living costs and the chronic damage to production , the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e company , which is growing in a very strong way , is badly needed . &quot;
the Pla@@ dis@@ e representative said : &apos; the head of the Customs Council received a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ ch only yesterday and the company responds directly to him because we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers and the representatives of the G@@ M@@ B , which discussed a number of issues openly .
we then discussed with workers that , like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are looking at our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million in customs equipment , most of it has gone into production routes and improvements .
we fully understand the heritage of customs as a source of production , and if there should be any changes in the activities of the object , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach to Ney@@ ra ?
a la may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main does not give up in the attempt to attract Mr Ney@@ mar to his ranks by making an offer of GBP 18@@ 9 million , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record con@@ quest ?
this bold approach has opened the summer as a transitional window and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world record of buying , which was set at the last season by Paul Po@@ g@@ ba &apos;s return to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ ba for GBP 89 million .
if the transition is completed , Ney@@ ra will become the most expensive player in the world and , at the same time , the highest paid professional ath@@ le@@ tes in the world , who will be able to pay over GBP 500 000 a week after the payment from the PS@@ G .
Barcelona is also an indication of the way in which there is a rap@@ pro@@ che@@ ment , as well as of the liber@@ ation of Ney@@ ra , although the source close to the Bureau of Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ i confirms that the club has always taken the best care for football since its arrival in San@@ to@@ ise in 2013 .
but did the PS@@ G President warn the football world for such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Bla@@ ise Ma@@ tu@@ ga Agreement in 2014 , the N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all clubs who think about recru@@ iting some of the PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that if they concern some of our players , we will be against them and we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have taken over this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the PS@@ G central player , Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they would not be allowed to leave and that Barcelona could be a set@@ back as a result of this interest , removing one of its expensive assets in the form of Ney@@ ra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t .
&quot; Bre@@ x@@ it is seriously threatened by the w@@ ool between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r during his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the free movement of people and goods , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , he stressed .
he said that he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union , and because it fails to do so , he will remain part of the European single market .
this would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
the second option to make Britain &apos;s departure smoo@@ ther would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r : &apos; surely we could have such a British &apos; .
the alternative to this would be to return to customs points , which would be a historic division and a political failure .
&quot; bring about trade , prosperity and peace , &quot; said the Irish Prime Minister .
he called Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that the result could affect every aspect of the daily lives of Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Bel@@ fast .
the first half @-@ long tri@@ ath@@ on note , Av@@ ja : I@@ ron@@ man , will be able to go through everyone .
today , in the winter capital , O@@ te@@ save Bal@@ ti@@ lands , the largest tri@@ ump@@ h of the Bal@@ ti@@ lands was held , when a half @-@ long I@@ ron@@ man contest took over a thousand tri@@ ath@@ le@@ tes from more than thirty countries .
7@@ 0.@@ 3 miles of design consis@@ ted of 1.9 km of flooding , 90 km of cy@@ cling and 2@@ 1.1 km of cy@@ cling .
among other things , the first tri@@ ath@@ on of her life has also resulted in a note of Av@@ ja .
&quot; I thought it would be difficult and , in the end , it was difficult , &quot; said Av@@ ja fin@@ i@@ ch .
despite the complexity of Av@@ ja , in fact , the tri@@ ump@@ h is affordable for all .
&apos;@@ It is not a dance killing , but the pace kills &apos; , he said , suggesting that , at a comfortable pace , everyone will reach the fin@@ alists .
with the exception of O@@ tt Se@@ pp : &apos; everything is fine , but unfortunately he cannot swi@@ m &apos; .
Av@@ ja had already taken a keen lead since February .
at the beginning , 4 @-@ 5 hours a week later , but ten hours a week .
time 05 : 34 : 12 achieved 27@@ 60 seats in general terms .
although Av@@ ja lost both R@@ ai@@ o Pi@@ ir@@ ony ( time 04 : 59 : 53 ) and J@@ ür@@ gen L@@ ig@@ i ( time 05 : 06 : 37 ) , he won other so @-@ called &apos; prominent classes &apos; .
