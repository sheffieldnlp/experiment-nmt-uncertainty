Four members of the Cabinet Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Posselt , in Spain , the police detained the leader of the so @-@ called Coperrovo group , SpinGulevich , who is known as SpinKCape rovski , in the criminal world .
Gulevich arrested in Spain was arrested at the court &apos;s permission .
Yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
It is suspected that the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde &apos; criminal community is members of the so @-@ called &apos; 27 @-@ 57 &apos; criminal community , who commit mainly drug crimes .
In the province of Mala Mijas in Spain , the alleged head of criminal community was detained .
In Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of them collected according to data , as a leading figure in the criminal community , and two are members of the criminal community .
The data collected indicates that tasks and roles had been clearly divided in the criminal community .
The purpose of criminal activities was to commit drug crimes and thus to earn criminal proceeds , &quot; commented on the head of the criminal proceedings , Public Prosecutor Vaila Verte .
&quot; We do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; added the Prosecutor .
It is people who have previously been interested in law enforcement authorities , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; International cooperation has become commonplace for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; commented on the public Prosecutor Verte .
The head of the central police service , ago in Leis , said that detention was preceded by a pre @-@ trial of almost one and a half years .
&quot; In the first half of the week , we had a long history of work and were simultaneously suspected of committing crimes in Estonia and Spain , &quot; he said .
In Leis , the central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
For years now , we have a good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civil card .
These arrests are yet another message to criminals that we will get them from another European end , &quot; said Leis .
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that , when there is a doubt , the men who have been suspected of continuing to commit new crimes , which is why the prosecution service has requested their arrest and also approved by the court .
The man arrested in Spain expects him to be handed over to Estonia .
In this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash are being seized to ensure confiscation .
The criminal prosecution procedure is carried out by the central criminal police organised crime office and is led by the prosecution service .
The city of Tallinn Tribunal in 2005 convicted SpinGulevich of blackmail and punished him with a five @-@ year imprisonment .
In the middle of the last decade , Gulevit≈°it was held the second most important in Estonia &apos;s criminal world following the Marxomic Alliance , Nikolai Tarankov .
Gulevich , from Cape Verde , appeared in the Estonian allige at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Admittedly , he taxed taxi and prostitution on various hotels and ordered a monthly rotation tax on businessmen .
International joint operations , confiscation of proceeds of crime and the entry into force of court decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
For example , the latest judgments , the eight accused of a criminal offence in the so @-@ called Diky Community , who seized EUR 80 000 in criminal proceeds , or the verdict against nine persons , in 2006 , Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association aimed at illegal trafficking of illegal cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in Eastern Viruland and southern Estonia .
It has a total of around EUR 71 500 of recorded criminal profits .
In these criminal cases , it has been successful that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and , if necessary , that procedures are carried out in any European Union country .
Civil Liberties Group warns of Missourisse travel
The National Association for the Advanancient People of Colored People ( NANicaragua ) has warned the people of the Muslim Muslim people travelling to the Missoula for discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the State .
The Group &apos;s statement states , &apos; The NASR issued for the State of Missoura , valid until 28 August 2017 , calls on all American passengers , visitors and souls to be particularly attentive and very careful when moving around the country , given the suspicious racial events that have taken place recently and also been highlighted here &apos; .
According to NAUTS , the group urged both the recent Missouri law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that the country &apos;s regular police protection targets are , in large part , minorities .
&quot; Citizens &apos; rights are violated .
They are being dried because of their skin colour , beaten or killed , &quot; said Ros Chapel , President of NASR .
&quot; We have never received such complaints so closely before . &quot;
This is the first warning issued by the organisation of the State of the United States .
The group referred to events such as racist insults against musicians &apos; students at Missouri University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black Sandersi .
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , after he was beaten by the state in the petrol sector and the Missouri police arrested without being accused of a crime .
Furthermore , the report recently compiled by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri shows that the national flag state is likely to halt the cars of black drivers by 75 % more likely than white drivers .
&apos;A comment is designed to make people aware and to warn their families , friends and collaborators about what might happen in Missouris &apos; said Chapel .
&apos;People must be ready , be it to include remote money or to inform relatives that they cross the state &apos; .
The latest figures from FBI &apos;s hate crime programme were documented in 2015 in Missouris , which puts the state in the 16th national theatre of similar offences .
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law , which makes it difficult for the company to refer to court for reasons of discrimination in search of housing or work .
The American Civil Liberties Association ( American Civil Situation Union ) had previously issued travel barriers for Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws obliging local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences , because according to ACLU , this increases racial profiling .
Usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a counterreaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
Hepatitis : What could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
Hepatitis , or incinerator , may be caused by five different types of hepatitis A , B , C , D and E .
All these viruses highlight the acute burst of the liver &apos;s homes .
However , the average cost is chronic hepatitis B and C , which can develop further into the liver &apos;s circus , the liver corps and the liver .
The epidemiology of the health profession , Kuniliner , talks about the fact that acute hepatitis disease is the same for all types of skimmed infection - fever , fatigue , stunning , Easperation , oineration , air pain , grey emissions , horse mackerel , meat and asylum pain , and the collapse of swine and limasters .
The last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of the liver burnt @-@ up disease .
Children can undergo hepatitis without disease .
The various types of heat can only be determined on the basis of laboratory research data .
Allerhopatitis may turn into chronic hepatitis and run decades without disease phenomena , which means that man may not know anything about his or her dangerous illness .
Mr Kunilr highlights various forms of hepatitis and describes their culmination more closely .
Ehepatitis virus infections are spread from a disease to human consumption and are infected when we eat contaminated food or drink water , via seals , by infected person &apos;s emissions from hand and hand foodstuffs , soils , objects , contact and consumption of drugs .
People with chronic pay , sex people with infected infections , sex men , drug users , high @-@ hepatitis A countries , are among the family members and carers of the risk of infection .
Vaccination can be prevented , in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling a lot and at risk of hepatitis A .
Furthermore , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : To wash or disinfect hands , before eating food , to wash all fruit and vegetables .
Epatitis virus infections spread to the circulation of human blood , drugs incineration , therapeution , augmentation , blood @-@ contaminated fodder ( toothmeters , pregnancy tools ) , donating blood , sex with hepatitis @-@ hearty sufferers and infpatitis sufferers .
The Group of the hepatitis infection includes drugs , sex partners of infected person , sex men , newborn mothers of infected mother , family members and carers , health care , rescue workers and police officers , and people visiting countries with high @-@ hepatitis B diseases .
In order to prevent hepatitis , people can be vaccinated ; in particular , it recommends vaccination for people at risk and , in addition , for people suffering from chronic liabilities , HIV infections , sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes .
There is a hepatitis cure for other preventive measures : Prevention of the use of hygiene and manure , other sharp devices and needles , needles , prophytoisation and augmentation , and use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection or prevention of sexual risk .
Vaccination against hepatitis V is part of the National Immunisation Scheme and free of charge for children in Estonia .
Hepatitis virus infections spread into the circulation of human blood , drugs incineration , therapeution , augmentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated fodder , donor blood blood , hepatitis @-@ patient person in sex and hepatitis disease to animals / newborn babies .
The risk group of Hepatitis C infections includes therapeutic drugs , sex partners of infected person , sex men , infant infant mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , people with HIV infections and people with high hepatitis C visits .
The preventive measure of hepatitis C is : Non @-@ use of hospitality hygiene and manonysis , other sharp tools and systalstalgia , theratosanitary and augmentation , and condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infections .
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C .
The hepatitis virus is caused by the Dhepatitis virus , which is much more prevalent in the presence of the Bpatitis virus .
As a result , Dhepatitis Bhepatitis infections , together with hepatitis B or superinfant infections , occur on chronic hepatitis B sufferers .
Epatitis virus infections spread from exposure to verbal and other body liquid , contaminated systalles to needles , relatives and rarely infected animals .
The hepatitis @-@ surgery is chronic hepatitis B virus proteins and people who do not have immunity from hepatitis B .
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccines , which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus .
Ehepatitis virus infections spread by feudal means of drinking water and food , including low heat @-@ treated beef , fish and marine carrots , donor blood , psychips and more infected animals .
Passengers can be infected with high levels of E hepatitis disease in countries .
Ehepatitis preventive measures are compliance with hygiene requirements : To wash or disinfect hands after slaughter , before food production and eating , after care for the patient .
Fruits and vegetables are washing before consumption , avoiding eating little hot meat , fish and seafood , as a result of which only safe drinking water and preventing drug consumption .
Although , over the last few months , competitors tried to printing four times the Olympic winner , 34 years old Farah finally came to power and won 26.49.51 .
Farah did not think long , bringing the husband Tania and children to their own path after the finalist finch .
This was a special moment for me .
I am very much an advocate of my family .
Being with them was wonderful , &quot; said Farah to journalists .
Farah is focusing its fifth edition in London on the golden dump of 5 000 and 10 000 metres of the runway .
Everything is possible if it is believed .
Despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connorm in Daam gold , Gustav Klimti , Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri &apos;s portfolio has an extraordinary story of &apos; synonymous with one art works &apos; , much deeper than the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna .
But more deeply in history .
The anthem &apos;s inferrant gold , the sleep in the beach , the narrowly subject being put on the top of the title , would have been to have more influence on the extraordinary portfolio .
At the moment , a few books would be like two : Gustav Klimti and his painting of Daam gold , the story of Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer , and a much more extensive and comprehensive history of Honourable families and the German occupation , with its aftermath in Austria .
The first third of the book leads to a thriving cultural life in the middle of Vienna and who himself entered the Austrian capital , it can hardly imagine how life was going around Ringstrass more than a hundred years ago or how all its head was turned when the climate invaded .
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe &apos;s richest cities and the name familiar with in the book , as if you see it , it was more cultural to quote a gram .
However , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where the void arson and the highest level of suicide in Europe were not adding anything to development .
Or perhaps , however , every couple of honest terrain also adds a colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna .
Dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
Nearly one in ten people in Vienna had a Jewish one during the Sajandiral .
Parents were also newcomers in Vienna , but by the time the Arad relief was launched twice in the Czech sugar magnaad Ferdinja Bloch and Climate for his famous painting , his father had become the seventh largest bank in Habsbursts .
However , the whole of the glacious life to which he belonged did not lead .
If you look at the &apos; Daam gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end @-@ of @-@ life infection was more like a kind of crone of socialism and dreamt of travel to the Soviet Union .
For 1903rd , when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband &apos;s luggage from Climate Kong , the painting maker in Vienna was the last moment .
The Climate KIC paid at the time 4 000 kroons , a quarter of the price of a good @-@ place rural house .
The fact that some sports crews were suspected of a modelli of a master was not intimidated by sugar stunnatis .
As far as the delegate is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between modelli and the artist created during the work continued to reach the end of life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connor - &apos; Daam gold &apos; .
Gustav Klimti Cup , Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer Corporate Expo , &quot; &quot; The Varrak 2016 , the English translation Aldo Randland .
Shortly before the start of the work with Adeleja , the climate had been visited Ravenna San Vitale in basiberia and the investigators think that it was precisely there that the superb mosaic countries Eulna Theodort gave the artist the idea of making a golden portfolio called Adeledeledeledeler a a mosaic .
The climate presented by Daam in Vienna in 1908 and about the same time ( 1907 @-@ 1908 ) , one of the golden terrestrial land , was born .
Art historians were not left unnoticed by the similarities of two women .
How is Hitler connected with nature ?
&quot; I think I owe him a debt to make his hand publicly available , &quot; said Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer a few years after she left the artist ( Climate Day died in February 1918 ) to the Director of the Belvedere museum and wanted their family &apos;s Klimti to go to the museum .
Six years before the death , the customer had completed a succession of Adelest K√ºhga .
In his wills ( Adel fleeing in February 1925 ) , she also asked her husband to leave his two sports courses and four Gustav Klimti landscapes to Galeri in Austria .
His own works were marvellous to Mariana and Luda .
One year after the Climate Minister had finished the &apos; Austrian Mona &apos; annex , Viin Kacarriart de Akademine had attempted to get 17 @-@ year @-@ old Adolf Hitler , but fell through the drawing paper .
Although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ Semitism is considered to be the reason for the fact that Jewish professors did not accept him in the academine , none of his exiitors were actually Jewish .
In any case , the Austrian GalSpecial Rapporteur &apos;s mission for 1939 had changed considerably , as referred to in Mrs Galeria , which had become important for finding decent works for the Maciras of the rich Jewish Jewish arts in Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal artistic muscle was also home to some work for As , but not for the climate .
Sixty years after the night of the Nazi arts , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old trial dispute began between the Austrian Government and the heirs of the Bloch @-@ Bauots .
It should be noted here that if the &apos; novel &apos; is seen in Belvedere Castle in Vienna , the Daam gold , which is portrayed by Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer , must be seen as a trip to New York to Neue Galeri .
And before the Vienna Times , we will read the aforementioned book .
Even if you do not plan to look at the climate work , because at least my emotions came across more laughing and Jewish issues after the closure of the book than the mamal and modell Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer , sold for USD 135 million .
So not so much a sports tablet , rather a gay Embassy - and a very moving story .
The gender pumps of the Bauer people who were brought to the beginning of the book were considerably facilitated by events .
17 year old swimming in Canada was very close to Estonia &apos;s record
In eating , gold was very close to the personal record of the pig meat swamping of its 200 m ¬≤ , at 2.16.62 .
The Tippmark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ old pipes since the Canadian Jutuititititititship contest ran by 2.16.58 , the Priit Aavnik Ujugation block .
Gold last escaped a A @-@ finishing board , or a decade ago .
In Finally , she went through the period of 14.15.76 and achieved a good 7th seat with a new powerful peak .
Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.15.13 ) , which belongs to Alina Kendziorn , remained just over half a second .
The &quot; gold &quot; index , which went up all the time , and its fresh top @-@ level mark , is the fifth ever result of Estonia .
The young hope of the future lies in the launch of Canadian adult Championships of 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in balfire and 200 mmm and 400 mm in bundling .
Last week , Canada &apos;s jewellery championships took place in Tuonto and gold also took successful start there .
He won 200 m in balfire with a silver man &apos;s time of 2.03.22 .
This distance was swamped so quickly by a standby last year .
Estonia has only extended this distance more quickly than Estonia &apos;s record BSE .
A vibrant Canadian champion won a further 100 m voucher in baltulation with an excellent personal record and 56.66 in Estonia .
For example , her year &apos;s old mother , Kertu ly Alnek , has distanced it by just one century .
He reached a further 100 m wall of university pumping in the opening of the notification of the date 1.03.69 .
For half a long distance , he gained only 7th seats when he sleep in the final assembly of 2.17.31 .
Gold is currently leading the Estonian ferry tables at four distinct distance .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics insured teeth
The holiday season is in hand - that is , a break to the President of the United States , Donald Trul .
However , since the Trump has been one of the most holidaymakers , critics are already wearing teeth .
According to the US VIS and the CNN , the President intends to have 17 @-@ day leave in the cannabis in Bedminsteris , which is located in New Jerseys .
Although President leave began yesterday , the anti @-@ Trumpi has been speaking for weeks .
They are asking the Olympics for too much of a clean @-@ up .
The President is , in fact , entitled to spend a week in his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey in the cotton .
Incidentally , the Trump has not cleaned the President for its 196 working days .
For example , Mr Bush had to have 67 days on holiday for that period , with Barack Obama half as much as the Trump , but only 21 days .
But the Truel tends to forget things quickly .
The days after becoming President , Trump obtained said , &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , that there would be no time left for a long holiday for his engineer , because a great deal needs to be done .
He also expressed his outrage about Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
The current President wrote on Twitter : &apos; While Obama has a holiday , plays golf , the brakes and the j√§ssers are on the front , journalists in the country are pulling their heads off the wool &apos; .
According to the officials of the White House , 17 days of golf club visit to pollen is not a betrap .
It is officially called &apos; working leave &apos; , during which the Trul has no time to read or to take other pro @-@ sporting activities .
Furthermore , there was also a second reason for working leave .
It is precisely that the western canal system of the White House is changed , and therefore the whole staff had to leave it .
The West Bank is also based on Ovalkatsmanship and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not think that anyone else would like to be in the West in August , when there are 38 degrees and no conglomerates , said Lindsay Walters , the white house spokesperson , who stressed that the President would continue to work during his leave .
Where President Trump will spend 17 days , you will get an idea of video .
Blocking critics from Facebook to 07 do not stand for a state post if you do not tolerate the voices of the voters .
The father of our country knew so much about the unfavourable media coverage .
The Americans loved Mr Washington , but the newspapers did not go long to get bogged down for everything from internal politics to his political principles .
Of course , the criticism upset him .
But he did not make his critics quiet .
Because , in 1783 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and , in the dark and silent , we could be chaired by sheep on slaughterhouses &apos; .
This brings me to Mrs Hogan , the Governor of Maryland &apos;s kup , who has to be struggling to be more in Washington .
The organisers &apos; submissions have blocked and erased at least 450 people who expressed their views on their official Facebook page .
And at the beginning of the week , the American Civil Liberties Union ( American Civil Guard Union ) therefore complained to the courts .
The Kuberner official &apos;s office paved the action empty and web commentates slide from reactions in a style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos;
&apos;This is just Facebook , &apos; many people said .
But that counts .
And this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan .
It is an overwhelming democracy in the country of the popular Republican .
His approval percentage is the second highest ranking in the country &apos;s 50 months .
Hogan is not a reactive sight .
It has led the state firmly and remains strictly firm in its principles .
Furthermore , he has used his main tool to communicate with his constituents quite deliberately Facebook , presenting his own brick head , for the first time after the chemical waste .
Therefore , the website of the Governor , located on the official label , is a public forum managed by the staff who pay taxpayers &apos; dollars to the people who visit Kenya , is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
In an interview given to Washington Posselt , the Kafgan press representative , defended the behaviour of the Governor , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderecasting .
But it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet browsing online , cutting down internet browsers , or people full of hatred .
The post was interviewed with a number of people who were blocked by Hogan .
This is what they are , in fact , the people who are talking to their elected leaders : The user , the owner of the company and the passport , and not Internet controllers .
They all said that their comments were respectful , thought @-@ out and not ropaste .
Pastor quoted milk in his post , urging the Kafgan Catholic movement .
The lawyer from Marylan Bowie , Lakshmi Sarma Raman , did not incite hatred but rather hate crime .
&quot; I have politely commented that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; he wrote the editorial news story in his country .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , when many people comment on the same subject , some of them are now inextricably calling it a collective effort , rather than acknowledging that it is a great deal of concern for citizens . &quot;
What the Governor &apos;s official called &apos; targeted junk attack &apos; would probably be invited by others to &apos; public support &apos; .
The age of Facebook allows for easy matching of messages by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments .
It is much cleaner than the old one when it was necessary to send out workers to do the same , to collect and bury critical editorial newspapers and to hold them up or arrest the protesters and to force them to remain silent .
But that is exactly what is happening now , just digital .
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media toothless .
President Trumpi has brought Twitter users to court who have been blocked from Twitter &apos;s bed .
One of the first key decisions on this matter was taken last week in Virginia .
James C. Cacheris , the US civil servant , decided in Alexandria that the director of the Managing Board of Loudouni land violated the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the voter on Facebook page .
In Ktucky , the Governor Matt Bevinit ( R ) also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter for use .
This should not be so difficult .
In Washington , the cost of affordable postal services had similar effects on the Internet .
Between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers and anonymous writers were dispelled by his way of leadership .
Even then , Washington had to face anonymous controls .
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseudo @-@ unionms such as Juricola , Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , making the decisions of Washington painfully recouped .
According to historical documents compiled by the website George Washington magazine , he burned his cabinet in petitions criticising his views on the British brotherhood , trade and shipping agreements .
But he did not force them to remain silent .
Freedom of expression , opinions and debates are fundamental pillars of our country .
And proper management means acceptance of this .
Ronan Rafferty hopes of the comfort of Renaissance Cclub &apos;s home territory
The former European Chairwoman Ronan Rafferty hopes of comfort in the next three days of East LoER , Renaissance Clubi golf courses , 25 .
The Northern Ireland , which was on the Archerfield Linony routes in the neighbourhood last year , ahead of the last round of Mr Paul Ealsingle &apos;s resignation , has staged the new scene and is the operative and executive leader , Mr Jerry Srare , is playing the role of the security loser .
&quot; I saw Renaissance Club built and now we see the club blowing in full glory with this event , &quot; said Rafferty .
&quot; Players see the path in their best shape , it is in a perfect state .
Jerry has done an excellent job in setting up this place .
He is a keen supporter of golf games and proud of what has been achieved .
This will allow a wonderful presentation of the path . &quot;
Ingan ever looks forward to seeing him be able to defend the title for the first time , even though the man has won both European Touder and the European challenge in his 32 @-@ year career .
&apos;They sends a very special feeling , &apos; said Sethportis &apos;s beating player .
&quot; I could not defend my Extremadura Orange , because it was taken away from my competition calendar one year after my victory .
It is a mathematical matter to come back to this chicken .
This is an excellent place for golf playing .
I remember the memories of last year , for me and for my wife , Mrs Sharon , last year &apos;s victory was a special one .
It was a very special time that we will always be at the heart of our hearts . &quot;
Gary Orr , who joined the European Works Agency later this year when he received 50 , will return to the competition on the ground of the country .
It is his first event in Scotland since the participation of Aberdeen profitable Management Scottish Openil in 2013 .
&quot; It is always a little more significant to play at home , &quot; said Helensburgh &apos;s man Orr .
&quot; The Taks well , but also the extra feeling .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and quite rightly demonstrated golf games .
I am pleased to see things moving so far . &quot;
The former MasterCard Wall winner , ian Woosnam , and the Commoniorians &apos; masters Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , mark James and mark McNulty , join the Trio square .
Orr and former Ryder Captain Sam Tutsis are two of the six Scottish people , the rest being Andrew Oldcorn , Stephen McAllister , bill Longmuir and ross Drumond .

Poverty and death in the gold @-@ rich land of Indonesia
When Barina Degei is preparing dinner , he is not using lead .
He seldom uses even a boy .
The Indonesian authorities , in the capital of the Municipality of Papua POL , in the majority of the puppet , place household manta in the local language in the direct replacement of the bar calling for a &apos; nota &apos; .
In half an hour &apos; time , the fire will be taken from the dared sludge and skinned with unbeating hands .
Degei is sitting on another ancient city of flu , without Yemen , and yet it is also doing its daily household works , for example , washing the water of cradle from nearby @-@ nearby sex .
The ball plays a role in the uncovered room .
Since he is the four women noteurs of his wife , he has not been appointed to look after any skins .
Pol√ºgaamia is common here on May .
Late work may be dangerous , however , for most of the people of Somalis to be unemployed and many of them are eating hard , and there are still soldiers here .
&apos;nobody dares to go around after 5 o &apos;clock in the village &apos; , he says .
It is a rare pilok in Papua m√§ki , a former Dutch colony which was intercepted in Indonesia in 1969 following a referendum which only made 10 @-@ 26 older people vote in front of the forces .
The movement of Dutch people , who have apologised from the power of the Netherlands , is urging their rails quickly against the Jakarta Government , which is still holding the region under its strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into a Pope and western Pope , so independent Papua New Guinea remained eastern of the island .
The majority is both a remote and a backward seat , and to get here , 90 minutes from the capital of the province , Jayapuru , to Nabimel , and then a 5 @-@ hour journey to the rental car .
There is no public transport .
The city of approximately 19 000 inhabitants consists of cats surrounded by carmbs and covers laininous iron rocks , which have been transformed into different ruins .
Very few indicators have taken the road here , not to mention journalists , nor have there been almost any foreigners here .
Before the Christian missionaries came , Mee Pago paints jumping the God called Tamee .
There were other changes .

&quot; Before that , we only had a plant cow in the body . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the most poor province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
But it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
Just 100 km away from Paniao , a mountainous province of around 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey , the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world is Grasberg , which belongs to the company Fbetporana McMoran , which operates in Phoenixis .
In 2015 alone , Frereexport from this place amounted to about USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper .
Furthermore , Papua vie can be enriched with supplies of raw wood , worth an estimated USD 78 billion .
However , these riches are a source of suffering for paints , as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Iranian army .
The 2005 study by the New York Times showed that Frereexport paid about USD 20 million to local troops and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including USD 150 000 to one of the victims .
Pope efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden hall and are seamlessly betrayed .
Human rights activists say that more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1959 and thousands more have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the Iranian army .
According to the Asian Committee on Human Rights , the massacre in the mountains of the genocide in Papua arhus in the 1970s was a measure of genocide .
Last year alone , over 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Colombian police in the region .
The 2016 report of the Grand Prix of Birsbane District , entitled &apos; We shall lose all &apos; , contains testimony to the atrocities committed last year , such as extrajudicial executions , torture ( one second report shows that rape and power shocks are particularly widespread ) and the brutal repression of peaceful protests .
&quot; It is difficult to read the number of victims , as such incidents occur every week , &quot; says Andreas Harsono , a researcher of Human Rights Watch , Indonesia .
The corps are even more harshly closed , because Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demographics are changing because of the Muslim economic migrants coming from the Asian people , Jaava , Kalimantan , Sumatra and Sulawsi .

They cannot compete with them .
&quot; Migrants started selling heroes and vegetables more cheaply than local boats in the traditional market , &quot; &quot; says Androulla Andersson born in Paniai , 24 years old , who came to the capital of the province , Jayapura , for work .
&apos;The Latvian paint Mercedes Techmama @-@ Mama &#91; women &#93; is therefore losing its market share &apos; .
The President of Indonesia , Joko Widodo , who is known to the people as Jokow , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Pope .
The former pub won 27 constituencies , including Paniai , on his way to the presidential Palace of Jakarta .
But the Pope has changed very little and the local feel cheated .
&quot; Our hearts have been broken , because in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jokow in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes with regard to restoring justice , &quot; says apprenticeships .
In fact , only two months after the entry into office of Jokow in October , Paniai was barely affected .
On 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the Roma singing to strength when two Indonesian soldiers were stunned by blindness .
Children who came to justice told them they should include the front lights .
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai , one of the soldiers insulted their tone and returned later to four soldiers .
Victims and spectators say that in the &apos; drink @-@ driving &apos; soldiers were taking children away and hiding them with their guns .
Then one of the soldiers shot among children .
One child , 16 years old Yulianus Yeimot , was so brutally beaten that he fell into the home .
A few hours later , a close electoral Commission building was burnt down and things were still escorted next day .
Some 1 000 young people gathered in the football pitch in front of the local police and military command centre to claim justice .
They carried out mee pago tricks and offered a waita tantsu in Papua mee , which ran around and buried poultry songs .
Some protesters started to lecture the police and the military .
&apos;Even , if the crowd is more than three times resistance , let them down , &apos; they were told in a formal document , which has seen a magazine for time but has not been issued to local media publications .
The mother of the city of Kego Koto , Yeremias Kayme ( 56 ) , felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained , asking for a crowd to go home .
Nobody had the will to listen .
&quot; Turning around me , I was shot in the left , saying &apos; he said time at night in his private colours at the blood of a tree .
Kayam still does not know who the fire was , but says that the troops &apos; rigs gathered came in the month .
&apos;There was a lot of people , a lot of sweet , &apos; adds him .
The local man , Alfius Youw , was shot at his guns three times , according to a puppet .
&quot; I would expect him and I went through him as a body to make sure that he is a man , &quot; said the magazine holiday synnically in Yohanes , who , like many characters , use only one name .
&quot; I saw he dead ... Snovel lew . &quot;
The Chief Police officer Yotje Mende said to the reporters that he was only the security of his department because it was attacked .
&quot; We must defend ourselves when we are threatened with killing , &quot; said Vice @-@ President Pudjo Sulistiyo , the spokesman of the Police Service in Papua SI in 2015 .
&quot; This is a matter of life and death . &quot;
According to Human Rights Watch , five young protesters were killed and injured .
The news about the killings arrived in Jakartail only on the next day .
Three weeks later , Jokowi Jayapuras made a passionate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses to be dealt with in Pope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future , &quot; he said .
Security minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an alternative mechanism for dealing with human rights crimes .
But almost immediately the excuses were also followed .
&quot; Most crimes happened a long time ago .
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s .
The point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
However , when speaking at the moment at Christmas 5 June in Jakartas , Wiranto withdrew his words by saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Pope .
Instead , he said , &apos; everything is resolved by law &apos; .
The Wiranto , accused by the UN of crimes against human rights , of more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the 1999 bloody referendum on independence , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Pope , including what happened in Paniais .
The families of the victims of Paniai adopted such statements with a gloomy disregard .
&quot; I have been interrogated four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Yohanes .
&apos;I am tired &apos; .
He says that he is still living in fear for years later .
&apos;I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&quot; I am afraid that the army is arresting me , I am afraid I am shot . &quot;
He confirmed his view that the people of Paniai are afraid of this incident .
He said that he had beaten the army after helping to bury four victims .
&quot; After burying the bodies of the dead , I had to be looked at by the army , &apos; he says .
The celebrations have not stopped .
On Tuesday , the people of the Egyptian police were shot in the neighbouring Paniai in Deiyai .
One person was killed and 17 injured , including children , when he went to a war between the inhabitants of the villages and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an unconscious man to hospital .
This male people , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ravianus Douw , who drowned in a nearby sea , died on the way to hospital .
The recent inhabitants of villages protested on a construction site before the company office .
According to the police , the people of villages were lecturing police officers to be stoned , which was answered by warning children .
But local claims that mobile British people ( the Iranian military police ) started shooting at the people , killing one person .
&quot; We were very panic , we are afraid of revenge , &quot; said Assistant Royal Domingda Baden , who lives near the hospital and saw injured insecticides .
&quot; I have beaten myself in my house for two days . &quot;
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the police mobile British hybrid from the area .
Paniai has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
The lack of meaningful development is feeding the dissatisfaction of the meals , moni , dans and dammal tribes living in the central memory of Papua haljendaeva .
Many of them have joined the forces of the Liberation of Papua generously ( VPL ) insurgents , which , according to their own , defends the rights of paint tanks , by ordering attacks and abduction by Iranian soldiers .
Some of the VPL &apos;s leadership comes from Paniaia , including Tadius Yog and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
In response to this , over the last few years , under the pretext of defending national sovereignty , the army has arrested in Paniai and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
Some of them will never again appear .
Among the people of Papua Islands , Panians are known as &apos; tragic forgotten place &apos; .
Poverty is a source of dissatisfaction .
The little rice that is sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
The Leib is the same unavailable .
People themselves grow all their food , mainly from Bahrain , with a little more fruit and vegetables .
Farming is the work of women , each of whom can care for four or five of the Baha &apos;clock .
They usually keep most of the receipt of the family , the rest is sold on the local market .
Ten Bah√° &apos;s pay only 10 000 Indonesian premises ( 75 cents ) .
Over time , economic inequalities have intensified between the heavy paint trees and the new migrants who have arrived in a row since the opening of new routes at Nabire airport .
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
Pope operators themselves often do not have the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&quot; Young people are not interested in leaving the village because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gobai , President of the Council of Paniai tribal tribal Council .
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world out of the Pope .
Furthermore , there are tight restrictions on foreign media .
French journalists Franck Escudie and Babridge Longchamp were expelled earlier this year because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they had been given a rare film permit .
The Vice @-@ President of the Human Rights Watch Asian department , Pichm Kine , said that the election pledges made by Jokow have not been implemented to lift the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development .
&quot; Journalists who are trying to report from the most troubled provinces in Papua ang and Western Pope in Indonesia face new threats to the rejection and blacklist of Madagascar , &quot; said in his statement .
The lack of a satellite watch on the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to Papua San Suu Kyi .
In March , six Pacific countries , Bahrain , Nauru , Belau , Tupain , Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands , urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &apos; various large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in Paniai , including the shooting of Paniai .
The same countries have historically supported VPL .
Arrmanatha Nasir heitis the charges for the group by the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , saying to the press : &apos; In Indonesia , democracy and freedom of the press still exist so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bury &apos; .
The local people want more foreign governments to heed .
When the Dutch official delegation visited Jayapur , Kees , the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , on 4 May , the local people intercepted the meeting but wanted to be anonymous with the source , saying they were anxious to remain silent : &apos; We want freedom &apos; .
In Indonesia , there will be a new presidential election in 2019 , but the tanks do not believe they will vote again in favour of Jokow .
&quot; Jokow is a man with good intentions , but people around him who are involved in firing Paniai say Hobai , President of the Council of the tribal tribal people .
He wants to give Jokow a sense that , apart from the fact that the people of Paniai live under the threat posed by the army , they are suffering from poor education and health services .
According to Gobai , the people of Paniai , like other boats , regard their voice as debt to Jokow , which he has to pay .
&apos;You do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
Despite the theft and intimidation , families of the victims of the Paniai firing were coping with another symbolic reception , NEAFid , which swept one victim &apos;s body of police and military contention to the country in question .
Knowing that justice can never be put on its feet , they at least do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&apos;One of our family members was killed &apos; says a shot of Yacobus .
&apos;What else can we do ? &apos;
Negover the Trui Turin pill had already come under his hand for the second time .
On Friday , hundreds of people had to flee this 337 metre of buildings and 79 @-@ order buildings in the world .
This is the second fire that has been ravaged for just two years by a high level of radiation , which is called the Torch case , or the Thimvikur .
The building was evacuated , none of the injuries were reported and no direct fire @-@ related causes were submitted .
&quot; We sleep and threw out the fire sub @-@ prime and people &apos;s fears .
We would wait for a tour and we had about 10 minutes to fall to the 50 order , &apos; said to the Reuterds a single person who called himself George .
According to Dubai civil protection officials , fire fighters also deleted at around 4 : 00 GMT at local intervals and seized the building .
The government said that it was working to provide the victims with shelter .
This incident can once again raise questions about the safety of high @-@ level materials on foreign soil around the world .
The investigation carried out by the Turin Bureau following the fire in 2015 found that the most damage was suffered by steep fabrics - decoral panels and insulation of foreign space .
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenportfolio Tower and the garden panels could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that took place there in June , which killed almost 80 people .
See : These phones are likely to receive sales cards in the autumn
The time has come for the technology games to recover , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony Xperipheral a Premium came to sale in the spring , and new hitt telephones are expected for poelers in the autumn .
According to the Tele2 marketing and sales Director Christian Semother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by innovation , eye @-@ to @-@ eye shandnner , serser @-@ servani 4K resolution , a screen and a fast @-@ track process .
Samsung Galaxy S8 , which has also reached the top of the Estonian smart phone sales table , gave great visibility in the world of technology .
In autumn , smart hubs allow even more haste , more durable amusement , better camera and greater water and customs security .
He added that rumours can already lead to assumptions and predict four top @-@ level models that will probably conquer street sales tables .
These four smart phones top @-@ level models will reach potales in the autumn of this year .
The lonamed iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach poelers by mid @-@ September .
However , the rumours that the new Apple model looks like and what can be done are spreading a lot .
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences between iPhone 6s , Apple &apos;s 10th birthday is expected to fully separate the new model from previous ones .
There have been four colours : Black , White , Swedish cup and croreom .
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen covering the entire telephone front , a copy of the websites has been lost and a fingerprints server has been built in the back door .
The new iPhone model would look like a glass of Apple design .
This has also been the case with the iPhone version .
In addition to the head @-@ up , the unmanageable charging and the even higher quality camera , we can expect a faster A11 process .
This is certainly one of the most expected smart phones for the year .
The outsourcing of the new model Galaxy hood 8 will begin on 23 August .
Although many rumours have been made about what new Galaxy jet 8 will look like .
Admittedly , even more business users are meant , and S pen allows even greater functionalities .
The telephone fund should have two cameras , one of which is a lainurt and another one with a narrow view to teleobjects .
Nobody knows what two resurgerations are capable of , but in any case it is the first test of Samsung , which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8 for quality .
However , we are looking forward to 23 August .
Although Nokia has sold sales this year with three smart phones headed by Nokia 6 , their flagship vessel - Nokia 8 - is still missing , which is already presented on 16 August .
We expect a screen stretching from 5.3 to the bottom line and a fast @-@ cradle Qualcomm Sscarce dragon 835 processes and more resilient avenues .
Nokia also talks about aluminium corps and about significant levels of water and security , IP68 .
Like Samsungone , Nokia has two stunning camera , an optimist produced by Zeiss .
Once the Sony firm flagship has been XZ Premium so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smart phones will be added , with even more innovative functionalities .
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than XZ Premium , but at least as good or better with a camera .
There has been speculation about the new Sony model that its screen is at least hot .
What the reality is , we can already see the very soon , because traditionally Sony has made its autumn flag public at the International Technology Forum IFA , which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year .
According to transcripts leaked telephone calls , Trump sunt Mexico on the payment of the border wall
The Washington post unveiled the telephone calls between US President Donald Trumpi and Mexican and Australian heads of state .
On 27 January , Enrique Pena Nietole , the Mexican President , went to the Trump telephone call for the latter to stop public proclaiming that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
The American President strored with him for his public condemnation of the wall , saying : &apos; You must not say this to the press &apos; .
The Trump has set out its presidential campaign &apos;s promise to build a long wall and age on the southern border of the United States that Mexico will pay for this project .
The transcriptors were also published in his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turmes , which reveals a tense debate .
The Trump told Turunele that the agreement whereby the United States takes on refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; nervous &apos; and &apos; rum &apos; . He stated that the agreement that was made during the Obama Administration would give him the impression &apos; guide &apos; , because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
The Truker ended his speech by telling the Turunele that &apos; this was the day &apos;s most unpleasant speech &apos; .
The national court did not take a complaint against the city of OC MRP Liine in the event that the city of Tartu rejected their offer for bus and coach transport between July 2019 and 2029 .
This is a letter rejecting the supply of OC MRP to Tartu buses and buses , as the offer did not meet the requirements , Anneli Aputin , Head of the Tartu City Government , explained .
This is the procurement of public transport within the Tartu city for the period of 1 07.2019 @-@ 30.06.2029 .
MRP city Liine referred to the national courts for the decision of the Tartu Lcademy .
The national court did not act on this .
Although many people complain in the social media that the clip from the Weekise festival is disturbing their night and that the entire city is full of drink @-@ driving officers , there are also many who do not have any negative words to say about the ceremony that is going on in the coast .
I am even positively surprised that the brakes were so polite in the shop .
I saw no disapproval or courtesy .
Even when I saw the Gulf , I &apos;ll say a nice wave .
&quot; It is nice that the winds , the winds are and the joy of the Persian , which has been lost like winter , are adding joy . &quot;
A wave of flames in the cake of sheep is not destroyed .
If , when he was living in a city of central city , he was still listening to music being played on a beach , then now music is not yet up to his home ethos .
&quot; But I hope I hear , &quot; he says a happy thing .
The Agnes , who talked with a fire , also says that the Grand Festival is rather good for the Perter , which will make a significant contribution to the circulation of local merchants .
He also welcomes the fact that so many houses have come to the visitors &apos; capital in the summer .
The woman of Peollian melu does not .
Although I am no longer going to be on the coast , it is nice that rand has revived .
And it is good that the people are moving , and this has been the case three times , &apos; the woman says .
I think it was a little worse the first time .
&apos;They there were complaints &apos; , he will reflect .
However , what he said is the case with the capital cities in the summer .
&quot; This Weekise is a very good prophmo for our small city , &quot; says Harri , who is on the park .
Life and m√∂ll have not put his life in the m√∂ll .
But for it ?
We should all be united .
Think about how it would be better to communicate between nations .
After all , music is not a man of the public .
This does not happen , although I live close to the same .
&quot; Good people can save and there is no pause , &quot; he says .
Visitors coming to the Persian Republic are , he said , courtesy .
&apos;With the bottles they have joined a little , of course , but young people are young people and mothers of God - give you a hand , but be people and we can do it &apos; .
The people on the island have travelled to somewhere by then , whether to relatives or to acquaintances .
&quot; But , overall , the festival has a positive impact on people like this medal , talking to the University with the children of Persian .
His family &apos;s Festival , too , does not disturb , even though it was even further than it was last year .
Last summer , the ground was the second one , we heard more .
We live outside the city itself , that it actually goes a long way there from the River Persian , &apos; he talks .
Pearson cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revive business
On Friday , the British educational company Pearson said that he is cutting 3 000 more jobs and reducing his interim dividend by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with the threat of business pressures .
The jobs that are being sacrificed , according to John Fallon , are likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will be accompanied by the loss of 4 000 posts during the previous restructuring .
Pearson announced in May his intention to cut costs by another GBP 300 million ( USD 394 million ) under the third @-@ cost reduction programme in order to try to revive a business that has been hit by the transition to high @-@ speed digital learning .
A company that agreed to sell last month a company in the enterprise Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann said that their expectation for a year had not changed since the sales income increase was announced to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
On Sunday , the rainforest continues som .
In Estonia , the rainfall is sown with therapeutic bulbs on Sunday , and the wind outbreaks are sometimes very strong .

The attack in Kabul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
According to the Enesetatapuch bomber , military convoys were attacked by officials in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul , killing one NATO soldier and wounding several other .
In NATO &apos;s statement , five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
In the case of the city of Qarabaghi , three civilians were killed in a cell , despite the local reports .
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herati mosque attack on Tuesday .
On Monday , two people were killed by suicide bombers in Kabul near the Iraqi Embassy .
NATO &apos;s statement said that an explosion took place on Thursday evening when the Afghan army of Joint patrol was attacked with &apos; man @-@ made explosives &apos; .
The statement states that everything has been injured in a stable state and is treated on the US military hospital Bagram flight .
According to the Correspondents , the Taliban and group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( in Chad ) , are a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabagh , NATO , Bagram .
According to UN data , at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital city .
At the end of July , the car bomb in Kabul was killed mainly by at least 30 people in the Shi &apos;ite line .
According to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
On 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the city - the most deadly military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
This violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country &apos;s military forces and police forces .
According to the Correspondents , the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf .
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the regulation after sharks
The United States Environment Protection Agency ( United Nations Environmental Protection Agency ) annulled the decision to delay the adoption of the Obama regulation , which obliges states to limit emissions from flying , one day after 15 states referred the Agency to the courts for its conduct .
The EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday 2015 , saying that it demonstrates the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; We believe that we must engage in dialogue with our partners in our countries and listen to them , &quot; said the President of the EPA in his statement , Scott Pruitt .
The Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the level of ostility content in Peru , which measured pollution in the various parts of the country , in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year on to arrival in 2050 .
15 mainly democratic states , together with the Colombian community , submitted a complaint on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President Donald Trumpi &apos;s government has tried to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to the Trumpi , is part of a broader agenda for growth .
But these efforts have led to reactions among the groups of democrats and nature conservation who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
The EPA website states that the breathing of ozone @-@ containing air &apos; could reduce the ability of Copts to work and increase the risk of dying in respiratory diseases , such as asthma .
German cigarettes can come to pipe .
German pigs and cattle can come to the pipes , as heavy rain threatens the yields of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union , Banimal berg writes .
This year , it can be said that centuries of saturation before harvest may mean that fruit intended for bread production can only be fed into animals .
&quot; The quality of content is far worse than the price of the soil and the worse than in 2015 , &quot; said Mr Raphard Nepal , the analysis of Agravis Raiffeen .
This year , up to 40 % of German nomalies can go to animal feed , which is from feed to the usual one , in Agratis .
German farmers , like their European counterparts , have been exposed to any weather this year .
First of all , the winter was too dry .
Then came the cold spring , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
In July , Germany was hit by the German drama , which has continued in August .
Many eyes have been placed on northern Germany , where rain is an obstacle to harvesting .
So far , only five per cent of nicotine has been repeated .
Most of the regions have not yet started harvesting , notified the local buyer of catches in Ceravis .
&apos;There are quite difficult days &apos; , Mr Frank Deckert Rendsburg , senior trader in Ceravis , said .
Consistency in everything - the rock of the internal design of Finns
Nature plays a part in the internight of locals , because the mesh views of the Saimaa fish population are reached in many rooms through major windows ( life ) .
Every step will be marked by our attempts by our northern neighbours to create both shellfish and perfect ( energy @-@ saving ) homes .
Ihoney , and also compliance , deserve to be used as wood materials , furniture and beauty for Finns .
Virgised techniques and smart solutions are found in mesh houses both as a builder and ( home ) architects .
It highlights that the theft of black , white and grey links , if supplemented by wood rapes and topipes , can be very disturbing .
Good ideas can go on a week later , because the air will run until 13 August .
Tarvians and spices suggest that this kitchen is often copied .
The √ñ√∂l today &apos;s line was watered down to Weekise Festival Balticen , and Martin Garrido did all he can to remember the last speaker .
The people were truly turning at the time of Mr Simpson &apos;s speech - songs , hubs , tanks were stunned .
When lunch stopped , a common mastery of the Spanish city was dispersed .
We will bring together the photographs that attempted our photographs for three days in Weekise .
You are certainly also in your search for yourselves .
M√ºry Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
Mr Vasyl Lomachenko and Mr Garcia , who should be on a collision course to face up to 66.7 kg of boxing in the most attractive shop in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
They were in the ESPN office in LOS Angeleres , in particular rooms until Garcia , the unwinning World Boavian Council lightweight champion , walked out the other side of the corridor to welcome Lomachenkot , World Boseline Monitoring zationi sulgweight cheque .
Following a unanimous decision by Garcia , the victory achieved on Saturday in Showerial , the former four @-@ time world champion , Adrien Broner , both combatants belong to the top of the ranking .
Garcia extended its hand better and said : &apos; How does the summer go , the cheempiis ?
I wish you luck . &quot;
Lomachenko will defend his bells against Miguel Marriga on Saturday evening at 19 ESPN .
When a couple of photos were available , Lomachenko &apos;s memory jer Egis Klimas stated that there would be a &apos; perfect yardstick &apos; between the combatants .
&quot; I am former chaotic , &quot; said Garcia .
&quot; I called on Bronger &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 63.5 kg .
I want to move downwards .
And he must move up to half the easy weight &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
The F√§nds have asked for this .
Let us then get them to gripped . &quot;
Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; The world needs this fight . &quot;
In the climate , the question raised was whether it should be paid for this , which is part of his strategy of allowing Lomachenkol to debate the end of this year at 61.2 kg in the class to make it possible for a meeting with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 novans ) , which also has an interest in fighting Jorge Linarese Linarese and Luke Campbelli &apos;s match with the winner of the Embassy after the easy title of the ceremony on 23 September .
&quot; Looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as fans have asked for this opposition , &quot; said Garcia , later , that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial packages .
&quot; We are the main players .
No other name can get so much attention .
Whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Garcia said that she considers Lomachenkot a &apos; armed fighter &apos; and could go to his Saturday &apos;s match .
However , Lomachenko was modest in praising Garcia , saying that he thought that the three divisjon champions from Riverge were &apos; very slow ; sorry , Mseley ... you wanted it nodistant &apos; .
According to Garcia , the aim was to show the strength of the blows and then to boy .
Both confirmed that they felt how the tension to reach them is increasing .
&quot; This is a fight that is waiting for realisation .
No other confrontation arouses so much attention and slander .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Garcia .
Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters , and Maey is precisely that .
This will be a good fight . &quot;
What world events are being moved from Estonia ?
The soil was extended and issued by the police and border control authority ( PPA ) record more than 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to study , study or family .
When , for example , mullahs were decided to grant a fixed @-@ term residence permit to 6702 foreigners , Madagascar &apos;s number was 4928 .
The services cannot tell us how many migrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia , but such an analysis will be prepared by the Ministry of the Interior .
While nearly 500 Ukrainians were knocked to Estonia 10 years ago , in recent years this figure will reach 2 000 close .
The number of applicants for renewal rose dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis , with 1087 people receiving fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , up from 675 in the previous year .
In Estonia , the statistics office has the highest number of Ukrainian citizens , with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia in excess of their generosity .
&quot; The Ukrainian community has been big all the time in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already in front of the family , the journalist , Kristin Ramallah , was declared by the Ministry of the Interior .
Soil and Kabila had the number of Ukrainian people who had fixed @-@ term residence permits even higher than that of Russian citizens , even though in ten years the longest @-@ term residence permits have been issued to the last ones .
If Ukrainians come to work mostly here , Russian citizens will be able to work for family migration .
&quot; Given the historic Russian community here , they are more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said the Migration Consortium , Helina Mea .
&quot; Looking at the Russian citizens who have been admitted to live in Estonia , Harjumaa is now an Eastern Virgland , &quot; he added and pointed out that about 40 % of them have been married by EU citizens .
Soil was granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
At the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permits was reduced .
&quot; Compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending residence permits , a new residence permit has been requested for Estonia to be established permanently , &quot; the journalist &apos;s spokesperson at the Ministry of the Interior explained that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonian residence permits has remained rather stable for years .
A new residence permit for Estonia to reside permanently will allow foreigners who have lived here to apply for at least three years from the previous year .
Its aim is to encourage the Silk @-@ up of the people who have been adapted .
However , a long @-@ term resident &apos;s residence permit requires five years , for example .
The extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased since the new residence permit .
For example , soil was given such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years .
Now the Ukrainians can exchange their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
This residence permit became popular - applications were still made by holders of a grey passport ( 1029 ) , Russians ( 487 ) , Indians ( 54 ) and nigerans ( 36 ) .
A total of 1968 people were able to live in Estonia for their part , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese people .
With the first half of this year , the total number of such applications is already 1269 .
In 10 years , surprisingly Nigeria has become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residency .
When three residence permits were issued to Finns in 2007 , soil was 200 .
Nigeria is coming to learn from this university .
The Estonian higher education institutions are also popular , for example , among Georgians , the Chinese and the Turks .
The number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen mostly thanks to learning games .
They also have the rule that where the community has been set up , there will be more easily others , &quot; added Ramallah .
Over ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , just as much from Laos and Madagascar .
Ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four Uruguay .
If around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , this is about 0.46 % of the total population .
Even if you look at the citizens of the European Union , migration will remain around a percentage , &quot; the Main said that the figures are actually small .
A total of 14 822 people died in Estonia , according to statistics , 13 792 .
This means that immigration transcends the second year of emigration .
Most extraditions and movements are Estonian citizens , but more of them are among those who leave them .
Therefore , Estonian citizens had a migration secret of 2 000 people in the soil .
The Estonians are particularly travelling between Finland and Estonia .
Mlong Couture Princssimde with sats , weeds and tarrogance
However , in the northern wave of ideas , there is a history for Mrs Tammeoru - old paints and defendants : &apos; I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire the thieves and crats of the old era .
If you are going with something stone , you will be studying and learning about it every day .
This is a pleasure in finding out .
The modern world of MMMouture Couture may seem like some alien , but the designer does not think so .
You yourselves decide how much soul your life !
As a friend , I have a whole sail full of the wounds I have created , couture .
Because , and it is not his fault , he does not live in Hollywoos and does not go on a red whim every day ; he wants to wear these most beautiful brokers , and it is suffering !
You can live your own life special !
The Moeman does not recognise the gap between the shining events and the grey day .
That is the reasoning that put the rolling stock in Estonia into rural areas , between forests and fields , between people who often do not reach them .
For example , a joint collegiate was presented a long time ago , in comparison , in Jevening and in the Perlo moealleel , where 45 mosques were filled by Queen &apos;s Quefilee .
In Tallinn , there is often a hang , a dignified slogan , but there are more emotions elsewhere - slogans , bbavo , stand up , you want to thank you .
A large proportion of the audience had to be just news , but now they are the fans of Mammu Couture .
If you overshoot people &apos;s expectations , they are spirited !
And I like the feeling that I am with my motive like the summer .
Pernus had a 50 @-@ metre red carpet , a whole @-@ day lorry full of stickers , seemed to be unable to come to an end .
Mrs Maria also does not recognise the motive that nature must be presented by a superimperialist superb , she will be happy to bring ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always come with pleasure .
After all , it is so lax the experience , the island found a wonderful piece on the ice line !
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own play , I am always behind the ground to give the unhopeless mercy of things .
My nervous would not allow a calm watch on the floor .
Mrs Maria Maria is this kind of moelogy , who wants not only to play a representative role , but to be present in everything .
I have my sister in the core , most of the collections I myself carry out .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to discover .
I am never far from my own creation and I am not afraid of work .
It is not limited , it is also about caste , logistics , organisation , organisation - everything has to jump off the days of a woman of one temperment .
The fanatics still have a huge amount of work to do .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a happy day !
I am still very lucky - it is like an unstoppable happy joke : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compliments .
It has been said several times that my brokers have a land grace - they make themselves feel like a printing tag .
The guest , ultrullical , carcasses that made Mrs Ebadi known overnight have long since left the Couture as a signal to date .
Martin Myrsep U18 boys : The weapon of the Estonians &apos; alagropipipe is now turned against us .
The damage , the fairy tale , ran out .
The first thing was that we were not able to get our tables on our table .
And if so much difference comes in the table , then Estonia &apos;s U18 corvpallipos said 61 : 75 drop @-@ out to Britain , our only basketball , BC Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsep .
Opponents took 28 requests from the south @-@ west and were so much more attacks as a result .
We were also not prepared to protect them aggressively and not to attack them , which created it .
Many of the attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
In defence , however , they managed to keep their hands somewhere , we could not combine .
It created the team from the bottom .
The work of the opponents was better done .
According to Myrsepa , Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes to take the anti @-@ missile fire off .
The last quarter had a mistake - we had zero , but opponents have already received a number of quick records .
Atlessness and a heavy offensive , which was our weapon on the alagropiturnir , all now turned against us .
Today we did not have the power against their aggressive behaviour .
The finger remained stuck with its negligent Kalevis , Matthias Tass .
Security in general can say good words about the whole team , so far there was a single shock .
It is a pity that such aggressive reactions had not been met before .
Tass have always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but he seemed to have been tired - he has borne a huge burden .
But he made some of the fine gestures I have seen in the past , &apos; added a guide .
Horrendous figures : EM @-@ turnir , in the corvpallilip of neps , threw three less than 10 points of derogation ...
The U18 age class does not only apply to the young men &apos;s A divisjon corvpallitinir in Tallinn , she started in Dublin on the day after yesterday .
And , unfortunately , the game with Poland lacked in the area of anti @-@ queues .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but after the third quarter , 9 : 49 , or only in the last ten minutes , opponents took their feet from the gas beet and 16 were left in the same period : 16 .
Estonia , the third quarter , in the first and second quarter , threw Estonia 4 , the third point ...
In doing so , in the first two minutes , they caught two pieces of four , from the first few , but then from playing 25 pieces , then one yellow in the back door and then another 21 tales .
Perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 fingers were found to be caught one .
In addition , 2 points came from four open rocks .
The loss of many was a reasonable figure of this time , 12 .
At the end of the game , Poland &apos;s surface hit 33 and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , with 83 out of 56 of Portugal on the opening day .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement supplies
Today , NATO arrived at a permanent &quot; no @-@ fly &quot; group for a weekend in Tallinn to complement the vessels &apos; reserves and prepare for the pre @-@ existing exercise .
Ships are preparing for landing on the sea during the course of the visit , thereby giving crews the opportunity to holiday on a paternal basis .
Following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonia &apos;s waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations to search historic explosive remnants .
&quot; The participation of indigenous people in the NATO unit and the coding they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the alliances , &quot; said the chief captain Arto Reinland , the overseas fleet &apos;s top office .
As of 29 June , NATO will chair the Latvian Navy Captain Captain , Gvido Laudups , a permanent mine @-@ based captain of the Latvian Navy , who took over the team &apos;s duties from the Estonian capter Johan @-@ Elias Seljab at the ceremony in Riga .
The group &apos;s flagship vessel is LVNS Virsaitis , a Latvian naval force which also has a group leader .
This semester , the Estonian Navy Museum Museum , is also part of the international unit .
As one of the four vessels under the NATO naval board , NATO is the first permanent mine group of primary responsiveness units to be sent to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - Not 13 August , the Pirita kooter &apos;s refresh will once again become a place where Burma , called by Maestro Er Kans , will be held down 13 years ago .
This year , Mrs Festival , the city of Tallinn , the artistic leader of the philosopharonia , is called the Christian , Jootis ( 36 ) , to be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented .
The risk of hearing from Joost : &apos; Traviita &apos; and &apos; Tosca &apos; , balletilalaanswers from the Bolerost &apos; , as a &apos; Karlssonin &apos; , is also missing from the scheme &apos;s own production , which is the &apos; Aastage &apos; of Joseph Haydni &apos;s wonderful Orchestra , the same international team that brought him to Pirilavine in 2015 .
Mrs Festival has much more than just concerts and theatre replies .
This is higher than any music theatre in its usual form .
It is a festival that takes power and never gets rid of .
Because the experience that the listener receives in this superior and salvable environment puts human mind ringing and touches on human beings in a way that cannot be described .
Risk to you , you are the first year leader of Birgitta Festival art .
Did the Maestro Eri Klaskins not feel a little big ?
Of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been helpful .
I was pushed through a whole student career and also supported by the start of my diosote career .
Perhaps it is thanks to this that I will be easier to continue his work .
In Klas , so much charity has been stunned by the Festival team of Birgitta and , of course , all this goes to me .
It was excellent to join a team who knows how things are going to go .
It was Mr Klaska &apos;s great heart that gave me the power to move ahead very well with Mrs Festival in Tallinn .
And here I am , and I can , !
What could the public at this ceremony today , what special offer do you offer ?
We have the names of artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , surprisingly , the first baller , written on the speech by Mrs Lindgreni , is coming to presentation .
This is &apos; Karlsson lb &apos; .
And one criminal nuance in this regard is that the author of this ballel is the Latvian composer , Juris Karlinning , who himself declared a wish to write it .
Apparently she has already been living in the breath of Karlsson .
At the risk , how are you all the nuances ?
My life @-@ sponsored compass is certainly thanks .
Such work requires a system of support and a lot of love , and I am luckily cured of it .
And I have noticed that my personal emotion is not so much dependent on people as I myself , that is , how do I oppose every new day ?
And so I was greatly surprised by my happy percentage of being aware of the tone , the keeping of the positive and actually laughing ourselves into the mirror of the morning .
Especially now this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen on this and it is working .
To laugh itself is hurting the brain and raising the tone .
That is simply not a word .
I think that people do not yet know half the things of their own body that the universe offers them , but it would be gradually accepted by everyone .
Now , it is an important moment .
Is there a ritual before the dirigend was taken ?
There is still a need to change clothing against more convenient ones .
This is a small moment for ourselves .
But , generally speaking , I have no chance of pumping or making a little wool before I speak .
In fact , I even like to talk actively to people , even before they take dirigendium .
But come all to Birgitta Festival , here , too , what is to be detected is not a very big manager and a ballet friend .
See a stark video with the risk of Joostiga !
New results of tests for assessing the age of Swedish asthyotine applicants were published
In Sweden , the latest results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the houses were assessed as older than 18 , but not all believe in the accuracy of the results .
The Swedish National Institute for Pharmacovigilance ( Rasytspreferably inalvert ) started tests earlier this year .
The tests were set up to assess the age more accurately during the application of the asthma , after criticism of the Swedish Authority for Migration ( IPPC ) for failing to correctly determine the age of many allegedly minors .
To date , Jordan has sent 680 cases of testing and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 24 81 tests between March 2017 and 31 July 2017 .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) was assessed for 18 years or over , and in 25 more cases the Institute for Legal medicine estimated that the &apos; testing &apos; could be 18 years old .
In 432 cases , it came to the conclusion that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
The tests will only be used if the age of the person is questioned .
According to Johan G√∂ransson , who works in the Institute of Justice , the results are consistent compared with those of previous months .
&quot; We see no big difference compared to the statistics of previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &quot; he said to the newspaper The Local .
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been elected for their age .
In May , the EIT issued the results of the 581 test and said that in 442 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person examining is 18 years old or older &apos; .
But when the newspaper Svensson ska Dagblad investigated the results of their 581 test , it became clear that , in 243 cases , man had stated directly that he would be 18 this year .
This medical age assessment method , whereby HL @-@ toothmeters and swine @-@ type MRT are carried out , has been criticised in some circles .
One of the sceptics is the endokrinology of the Karolinska Institute , Mr RadMarcus , whose task is to assess people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they were going through the audience sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the method of measuring what is currently being used should be used .
The designation of biological age in this way is very precarious .
If we cannot say firmly , we should not pretend that we get , &apos; said to the newspaper , he said forestry .
But Johan G√∂ransson of the Institutional Institute for medicine defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; In general , it can be said that the risk of pumping the baby inadequately into adulthood is low .
Perhaps the biggest risk , at around 10 % , is if you are in a little under 18 . &quot;
9 sign that you could forgive you for more expensive .
You were more expensive on Friday and spent a night with someone else .
It is painful because you have so many nice times and memories together .
I would like to reassure him , but is it time ...
Your Tango lists nine signs which show that the cost of your action is twofold and could be forgiven .
It seems more expensive to understand the seriousness of the situation and to work hard to resolve it .
Your more expensive deal deals with the problem of bringing him into the bed with another compass .
Pay is no longer a more expensive defensive .
He sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for his actions .
He is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
He agrees that he has made a serious mistake and that he sincerely seeks to improve the situation .
He is attentive and he is trying to communicate with you in a pleasant way .
However , he is forcing you to get over the matter in haste .
They are not denying what has happened , nor are they trying to make it unnoticed .
It is more expensive for you and for you to understand why intransigence arose .
You talk about this , and also about how to avoid it in the future .
You need to communicate better and assess each other &apos;s needs .
Your more expensive attitude and action have helped you to develop our condolences against his miscarriage .
Your more expensive commitment and behaviour have created the basis for your proximity to return .
As a couple of you have made progress to believe again in your unity and relationship .
The 20 @-@ year @-@ old newer , Anna Maria Orel , made a nice debate in London , receiving 67.37 places of good 18 .
After that , MM noorim was a female jungle and a joyist woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for medals in the future .
The contest went well and has had a good experience .
With the first test ( 64.80 ) , I immediately took away my average result , the second ( 62.80 ) risk too much and the third one ( 67.37 ) I was able to keep it very clear . &quot;
I was able to have my own emissions , and I am very pleased that I found it .
Ms Maria Oreli MM &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 seats .
Vihmasadu Orelit did not mix , as he is training the winter through the TEC stage .
&apos;I am afraid &apos; , he said a little bit of muddle .
The London Olympic Assembly had almost a full house of people , did Oreafter have people got around themselves or were able to turn off ?
I have been to Tajani , but in a positive sense .
Everyone says that this will add - that is the case .
If you compete on your own , you can experience it .
After that , he confirmed that he would be satisfied with the MM debate and he is still waiting for a lot of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 32nd outcome of the current season , the last one , I ended in 18 places .
This is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and More - that is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and I want to compete on behalf of the medals some days .
Western Virgina kuberner announced party change
The Western Virginia @-@ Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President Trumpa , that he would change political parties .
&apos;Whilst it or not , the democrats walked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; Today I say to you , having pushed a lot and thought for it ... today I say to you , the Western peaches , that I cannot help you any longer as a democratic Governor . &quot;
The rubber was applauded .
&apos;Thereafter , I will be a Republican , &apos; added Justice .
&quot; As a engineers , I would say to you that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
The Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Virginia .
Truary won a quarter in Western Virginia on 42 points and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats , Hillary Clinton .
Justice , which is the only billion state @-@ owned state , according to Forterai , was elected in 2016 .
Forticent states that it has coal mines in five states and coal business quite from its own father .
It has a value of approximately USD 1.59 billion .
At the same time , on Thursday night , the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) published a declaration that &apos; the party exchange of Governor Justice is yet another blow to the democratic party park , which would rather prevent the country from being improved again rather than working for it &apos; .
&apos;Over 15 months of enquiry and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent wake @-@ up to the parking that is out of the beginning and cannot find a positive and united message , &apos; said RNC representation , Ronna McDaniel CS Newsi .
It is hardly surprising that , where there are many people , there are many injured .
Urmet , who is in the medical hotel on Weekise , told the girl yesterday that posters had had to be distributed quite a lot .
The mountains and brands are fundamental , excuses and easy failures .
Of course , the main , left and foot @-@ and @-@ mouth .
According to Urmeti , visitors to the festival come with false footwear , and so the problems come .
Media have also had to help those who have suffered a few major injuries - there have been some panic and also one foot @-@ out .
We have also made blessing when a person has put his hand or the finger at the head .
We are doing less seals here , we are sending more to hospital .
See the videos as to whether the brakes on the media would also be able to treat the boy .
Coe praised the Russians for their fair apologies for the Dingushall .
The international rallies of the Kergean Sebastian Coe praised , according to his words , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apology from Thursday &apos; for the horror of doping , but repeated that now is not the time to allow the country to return to sport .
The Russian frivolous Emperor , Dmitry Shycehtin , said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup that the competition ban imposed on his country was the right one and has a firm aim to combat doping .
He apologised &apos; for all light @-@ entry groups who have been cut off in competitions by golden and silver medals &apos; .
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on competition in force in November 2015 , following the report by the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) , which found evidence of state @-@ sponsored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think today it was a very honest presentation , a very honest presentation , saying to the press the President of IAAF .
&quot; The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognised that they had had had had quite difficult times and that they would do their utmost to reform the alunion . &quot;
He also welcomed Russia &apos;s acceptance of the criteria for self @-@ anticipation , according to Coe .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the proposal of the working group that now is not the time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; We must do everything possible over the next few months to normalise the situation .
We have always come to the principle that we want to separate clean sportspeople from the system that was broken , &apos; in his annex .
One hundred Russian bona fide who meet the strict criteria of IAAF will compete with the lighter entry into force in London on Friday as neutral athletes .
On Monday , Rune Andersson , head of the IAAF working group , said that Russia is still not meeting several criteria for reinstatement .
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that lecturers who have been banned are still operating freely .
The electric car revolution will substantially change the demand for metals .
Who are the winners and losers ?
Little because the electric car revolution makes a significant difference to the fuel market until infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market .
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that they win from one place and lose another , smaller mining firms do not help .
Glencore coal and oil are currently serving , but in the era of electric cars , the demand for cobalt , lithium , copper , aluminium and nickel will increase .
This year , the votes by the UK , France and Norway on the spread of electric cars have been increased by the governments of the United Kingdom , France and Norway , which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades .
Therefore , Volvo has already announced that he is planning to withdraw the combustion engine and Tesla will bring to the market a cheaper blue 3 electric car .
Banimal berg &apos;s New Energy Finance Facility estimates that over two decades electric cars will be sold more than those using oil @-@ fired fuels .
&quot; For some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Simona Gambranin Banimal , the raw materials analyst of Capital Economics .
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium , which have been growing demand for years .
Electricity cars have approximately three times more copies than the conventional car , publishing Glencore .
An even bigger response is needed at the charging stations , which is why the Exane BNP Paris estimates that it will increase demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
The increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for lithium , cobalt , graphite and humanans .
Glencore will gain the income of electric cars from the rise in copper prices and the fact that there is the biggest cobaltier producer in the world , predicted by Jeffila &apos;s group .
This broker company estimates that Fbetporter @-@ McMoRan and First Quanma Minerals are winners of the race for electric cars .
The market is reacting to a changing trend .
This year , 70 % of the London metal stock exchange line has been mixed .
The price of the soil was 37 % .
The reply has also dropped by 14 % this year , mainly due to economic growth .
Glencore shares rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price rise to rival Rio Tonipa Group , BHP Billitoni and Anglo Stream .
On the side of the losers , lead companies such as Recyhtx and Campine are companies who have to adapt to a new era .
The main end @-@ use of the Plic is the batteries supplying the start @-@ up of cars with a diesel engine .
Electric cars use liitiumines .
&quot; This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael Widmer , the Bank of America Merrill Lynch &apos;s metal market analysis .
The impact of the split in the pricing of the Plian has not yet been seen .
The Plic has been fishing 17 % this year , with the best methane in London among the main industrial metals .
Investors will see problems for metals in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive , &quot; said Herwig Schmidt , a metal company Triland Metalia .
If lead demand falls , it will be slow .
Perhaps this will happen in about 10 years &apos; time .
Meanwhile , stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which are more frequent dependent on advanced lead @-@ based batteries , will be assessed by international lead and by the investigative body .
Lagons like aluminium replacement are a steel , as a lighter car can drive less electricity .
This explains an additional 1.6 million tonnes of closed minimum demand between 2013 and 2016 .
This represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s output of aluminium .
This trend is likely to grow , says Widmer .
Aluminium has reached 13 % this year , as the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market shortages .
Steel manufacturers do not .
The holding of ak Slashing works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce wonderful car lights .
ArcelorMittal and Slanta Europe are also trying to develop a lighter meltdown from steel to oppose the minimum .
&quot; The strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris analysis , Sylvain Brunet .
We see some progress in Europe .
The end of the oil era can also lead to suffering for plaice .
Soil took about half of this precious metal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , and was announced by the metal finer Johnson Matteries .
&quot; Many of the raw materials that are currently demanding , such as oil and plate , may not have a high demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard Dahdah , the Natixan raw materials analyst .
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
Plaatinatatatine producers believe in the continued demand for diesel hybrid subsidies .
Marc Grynberg , leader of Uncore power , said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 .
The great hope of Plaatinatatatine manufacturers in the 10 @-@ year perspective is for cars based on hydrogen cells developed by Toyota Motors and Hymuni Motos , which depend on a plate to produce electricity from hydrogen .
Until now , however , this technology has not yet commercially justified itself .
&quot; The Diet appears to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris from Brussels .
German car manufacturers were severely affected in July , as the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the cities of Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche .
How the monetary rules for football affect the shift of Neyra to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing the uncontrolled spending of European football clubs will not prevent the world @-@ wide shift of Neyra from the Spanish football club to the Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
Any consequences for UEFA , the governing body , which dominates the European game and which has the power to ban teams from participating in the security of the prestigious League of Ministers , are still awaiting Paris &apos;s participation in Saint @-@ GerMay .
The financial rules for fair play ( FFP ) , established by UEFA in 2011 , mean that the PSG must prove at some point that the Neyra transition was financed without huge losses .
EUR 222 million were paid to Barcelona ( USD 262 million ) for the fact that the Brazilians were able to buy out of its contract , and Neyra &apos;s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year .
Here there are some aspects of Neyra &apos;s transfer to the French club .
PSG will undoubtedly be able to spend such money on recruiting Neyra and adding its stars to the cloak , given that the team is funded by the family governing the Katar energy pipeline .
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players , but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that enable them to come up with them in football .
The FFP was set up by Michel Platini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
This former French player believed that clubs , which are falling into debt in search of success , are actually engaged in fraud and risk swamping if the banks or owners were to give up support .
From 2011 , the FFP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of their debts .
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 in Chelsea - buying a club with potential and then spending heavily to improve the team and to create a global brand - is more difficult to implement .
During this three @-@ year evaluation period , which runs until 2018 , the FFFP can bear up to ‚Ç¨ 30 million in losses .
And despite the fact that Platini was dismissed in 2015 by the presidential Office , his successor , Alexander Ceferin , remains committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; FFFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said last week The negotiator , Andrea Traverso , who is UEFA &apos;s FP Supervisor .
Although PSG tachored for the &apos; buy @-@ in &apos; clause for Neyra as one full payment , they will be able to allocate this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the contract .
Mrs Neymar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , so it is possible to indicate a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years .
In 2014 , in the first wave of FFP sanctions , the PSG , together with Manchester Cityga , was the hardest hit by the Abu Dhabi .
The PSG was fined 60 million euros ( USD 82 million at this point ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million , and the club required to limit the team of the League of Meists to 21 players during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of the usual 25 .
UEFA seeks clubs which can try to override financial institutions by exposing their revenues through companies linked to owners of clubs .
The Katar company may sponsor the PSG , but if the value of sponsorship is considered to be over @-@ standard market levels , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Qatar &apos;s VAT Authority &apos;s PSG support was inextricably displayed .
It has been said that a certain part of the Kirimari PSG service could come from Qatar through contributions from the 2022 World Cup Management Committee .
However , the PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neyra could become a world championship and say that UEFA regulators would easily be able to quash such a manoeuvre .
The penalties previously imposed on GPS mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules .
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition pro @-@ actively with PSG .
They spoke to the press on the condition that their anonymity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PSG .
Latest reports show that the PSG made a profit of over ‚Ç¨ 10 million in the 2015 @-@ 2016 season at around ‚Ç¨ 542.4 million .
The figures for the last financial year have not yet been published .
The PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have a positive impact on sponsorship transactions , trade and snus .
The club expects a minimum of 30 % increase in turnover in relation to the conclusion of the contract .
Spain , too , having clearly upset one of the biggest football stars , sought to block the move by saying that the PSG is violating FP .
&quot; This is a clear case of &quot; financial doping &quot; with a club and a country , &quot; said President Javier Tebas , in La vie , AS , to the Spanish newspaper , indicating that the PSG belongs mainly to the Katarias .
Arsenal m√§nejer Ar≈£Wenger , who belongs to the American sports magnage , shares the view of La Scotland that the state finances the club .
&quot; This is the result of property rights and has changed the whole football landscape completely over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger on Thursday .
&quot; If the club belongs to the state , then it will be possible .
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player . &quot;

Today 50 years ago : The Orchopian storm in Estonia , which was knocking on houses and windows .
The orchestra , which was designated as the stormy of the century , raging on 6 and 7 August caused major damage , particularly to the West , Harjuria and the Black Sea .
In the north @-@ west of Estonia , during these days , the wind was over 30 m / s .
My old ametric in Bavaria ran from one charting pub to another and lacked hands to support them .
All was blind and ragne , like the world stage .
The mother has already cut off the house , recalled in 2002 the old Mrs Linda Kurova hospital magazine Estonian nature in this interview .
The wife of Linda &apos;s wife saw his own planted tour collapsed .
But what are you going to be supporting you with your hands , where you are coming up against such a storm ?
The sea came under the window , the windows were stunned , &quot; said Haapsalus Kalda , Mrs Linda tone , who lived on the streets .
The fact that the roads were full and the cabin coverage of the railway station had been flying 20 to 30 metres , Linda most shark stores , just like next morning .
According to local authorities , the trees behind Paralepa were behind the sun , some were completely lengths , some boys .
Everyone saw it very frustrating , the storm went through the beautiful old trees as ragby and pragmatism as a war .
Western Viruland was not particularly badly affected by August 1967 compared to Western Estonia , but the losses were also high there , the Virumaa theatre wrote in 2007 .
The Batsalu Lfossil Park and the Padise Park were wiped out from the ground , but our achers were also severely affected .
In Tallinn , the wind was measured by up to 35 metres a second , or approximately 130 kilometres a hour .
In Tallinn , Meriane , a few lead chambers had swords on the evening of 6.August : &apos; Mother , mother !
The Canaries are in the air and no longer get the buried ! &apos; , wrote Virumaa Official .
The generation &apos;s natural building in Viljandiland was so destroyed during the storm that it was decided to be dismantled later .
The August storr was not opposed to the design of the T√ºr Empire , which was later not restored .
On 12 August 1957 , the newspaper Red Turot wrote that the restoration of towns and cities and settlements from the trees that have been hit and their vehicles is progressing slowly , and the population could be involved in corrotation works .
Grains also suffered greatly in Turin , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party organisations must be both on corps and on fertility corps as an incentive and guidance &apos; .
Orkaans can be spoken when average wind speeds exceed 32.7 m / s .
The watertight wind in Estonia will remain at the age of 2 November 1959 , when Ruhnul was measured as a speed 48 m / s .
The island of the Vaindstory was broken by a measure , so the strong wind speed measured in it could not be recorded accurately .
Secret of holiday areas : Night corrotation and poor coastal waters
Sameters in the summer will also mean smaller corroments in the beaches of Tallinn .
&quot; If there is no , people are on the ground , and if there are no people , then there are no people , &apos; the runner will be a corn .
The Hebom in the city of Northern Tallinn in Stroom is being torn up .
They are offered meoloous competition by a pigic tractor on low turns , which is devoid of platitudes triipe .
In fact , the last seven @-@ cent of the deep @-@ sea litter is travelling through the sea pit and the people &apos;s shelved shelters : Bottles , cigarettes and so on .
People are still coming to rank , whether they are warm or not .
If it is beautiful , people are on the ground and , if not , there are no people , &apos; the management of the private company hospital hospital as a beacon is said by Alexander Usov .
There are 6.30 p.m. and there is a bitter corrotation on the coast , because at 8 : 8 , the poster must be in order for people .
The job placement is already at four o &apos;clock .
Apart from Stroom , he is still watching on the coast of Pirita , Harta Lake , Kakum√§e and Palaraare Pikakari .
Landfill amounts have fallen .
Years ago , it was much more .
People are now entitled to assess what is being done for them , &quot; the Usov who has been raging the migrants for 15 years .
It was the case that , when something new had been stood up , it was already a test next day .
Now it is kept to what is on the ground .
Price of clean beach
One of the biggest jobs on the Estonian coast is the repetition of the rubbish , the adru .
For example , in the Carta coast , it must be transported by 400 000 tonnes of coastline .
&apos;This is an incredible amount &apos; , marks Usov .
Another large category is municipal waste , or all that people are leaving behind .
There are eight large rubbish lines in Stroom coastal zones at one and a half kilometres , which need to be emptied three times a week .
So much is done about rubbish .
However , cold summer weather has meant that rubbish is five per cent less than otherwise .
The third species is abandoned .
These are mostly children &apos;s TV spots .
This time , the Usov Embassy has pulled out ten towns and villages from the sand .
These owners are left waiting for a floating wood route .
&apos;normally they will be more out of them , but it is normal harvests &apos; : He knows that he will soon find them again from the sand .
Children come to rank and take toys to bury them again .
Landfill is broken down
Erika Scholler , the administrative services representative , admitted that the tractor &apos;s screening work is disrupting local communities .
Noise , which lasts from night to night , is mixed up by people living in the neighbourhood .
On the day , however , this work is impossible .
In one month , the rand has to travel twice .
&quot; If we do not do that , then we will be fined by the city , &quot; Scholler will mark .
However , like Pirita , Pikakka and Savary , the aim is to get Stroom rand below the international flag of siniqu√© .
&quot; Compared to Europe , Estonia has much more work to do to care for beaches , &quot; says Scholler .
We have more administer and more stone and more difficult to get a friend into the sand .
But there is less rubbish in our beaches than elsewhere in Europe .
Listening to the talk of rubbish , the conversations between the journalist and corrogation staff living near Stroom are taking place inexorably , highlighting current bottlenecks .
There is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
The problem is birds and puppil slaves who have pulled the rubbish bags down &apos; , Martin says .
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the city Government will do something with the bars and , for example , put them on the rocks to prevent birds from being on the spot .
In general , however , Martin Stroom &apos;s beaches is satisfied with developments .
We can see that the city is taking care of this .
It has become more pleasant with children &apos;s fields , enlightened and newly asphalt roads .
It was once the case that only one way could be taken in the event of a launch , &quot; Martin notes .
Findings of the Aardescent in Stroomis : Coins , only coins
A metre of homophobia has had to be exploited by a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Dimitri who , as a ardescent , is sailing on the coastline with metallic depression .
He does not believe that , today and in the future , something is found to be worth .
Marine angles are not generous enough to do so .
&quot; I have been working on this for one year and has not found anything worthwhile so far , &quot; says Dmitry .
As a refrigeration , the Dmitry is a few euro coins , bottles and also dangerous pounds that later throw in the dustbin .
Normally , there are still coins .
&quot; Culture , the finger and the rest of this is usually not the case , &quot; they are the armies .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level as unprofitable economic growth and the easing of inflation have cushioned speculation in relation to the increase .
Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain a loophole , as household incomes have put interest rates on standby .
The decision @-@ makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MPC ) have voted 6 : 2 for 0.25 % retention and fewer Members this month are calling for an increase , as slow growth has weakened support for the upsurge .
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank cut its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
However , the Bank also signalled that the increase in rates is necessary to contain inflation from Brexon over the next few years and that a expected increase in lending costs could be necessary in financial markets .
Members also voted to partially withdraw the mammoth package which was launched a year ago following Brexti &apos;s economic recovery .
The Bank will terminate its fixed @-@ term cash scheme in February , which offers banks cheap funding , although it said that it is now GBP 15 billion more than the scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
In the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; The average forecast of MPC will remain gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the near future , as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
On the rates , it was reiterated that &apos; fiscal policy efforts &apos; are needed to alleviate inflation , and this &apos; somewhat higher &apos; than expected in the markets .
The Eurostars is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
However , the Bank stressed that any jump is gradual and limited .
The Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecasts in May .
The forecast for growth of 1.8 % in 2018 remained .
Since that new , the pound fell into the dollar and the euro .
Women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.31 and 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .
The decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to a rise in expectations for the second quarter of the year , from 0.2 % to 0.3 % .
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will start to boost a little by the end of the year .
The Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice households with rising inflation and a pitiful wage increase , saying that the situation would go a little worse before the recovery was improved .
It was added that monetary policy cannot avoid a blow to income in the next few years , but a significant recovery is expected towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
The pound sterling also encourages the economy to increase demand for British produce , which will partially compensate consumers for lower costs .
The decision comes one year after the rate was taken in August last year by 0.25 % following the shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the pound .
The Bank is likely to take four years to fully inject life into prices and economies .
Before the Bank &apos;s last decision , there was a growing demand for higher rates , as inflation had increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers called for a 0.5 % increase .
Inflation fell by 2.6 % last month compared to 2.9 % in June , although the Bank &apos;s message was expected and is expected to rise again in the coming months .
The Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak pound .
Andrew Montlake , head of Coreco mortgage brokers , said : &apos; In the light of the recent downturn in exchange rates , the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again , as creditors are losing their jobs and hoping to finish the year in a positive way .
The B√∂ge exchange appears to be particularly favourable for those whose current transactions are due to the fact that refinancing , often without service and low rate , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
NHS writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV
Patients have since September had access to &apos; transformative &apos; treatment for HIV prevention after the battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the drug .
NHS England announced that public health will now make it available to 10 000 people during the initial three @-@ year clinical trial to pre @-@ catachographs ( PrEP ) - a tablet that is manned before the interim procedure and has shown a reduction of approximately 86 % in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people .
The NHS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal backed the ruling last year that the NHS is able to pay the bill for PrEP , despite its own claims that the drug should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Simon Ste186 , Executive Director of NHS England , welcomed this on Thursday as a &apos; sweeping new intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NAT ) described it as &apos; momentous moment &apos; .
Sexual health clinics in London , Bright ton , Manchester , Liverpol and Sheffield are among the first to register people , and in October , further clinics will be added before the programme is introduced anywhere in England by April 2018 .
The PrEP is a hotchpotch of HIV drugs that is taken before the incident to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
Clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people with a risk of infection .
PrEP before taking the interim procedure means that there are sufficient quantities of medicines in the human body that prevent HIV infection .
Such medicines can take place on a daily basis or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure .
The right candidates include LGBT men , transgender people and people whose partners are HIV @-@ infected and do not receive treatment .
The minors identify suitable people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , transgender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment .
People who live in England and have chosen to have their family doctor in their own country will also be able to register their willingness to participate in the local sex health clinics that participate in the programme .
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed the contract to get medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
The clinical test aims to assess the true potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who is treated and how it is consumed and implemented in a large cloud .
Ste186 said : &apos; This new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and enhance the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
This is another milestone in the fight for more than three decades against one of mankind &apos;s biggest health problems . &quot;
Deborah gold , the chief executive of NAT , said : &apos; This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
PrEP , if properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk level , offers the opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic .
Since September , people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool , individually managed and not dependent on a partner , thereby improving many lives , through this clinical trial funded by the NHS .
We warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Executive Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation , said : &apos; Now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is launched quickly across the country and that no person in the HIV risk group is excluded .
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been received , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
The Minister for Public Health , Sharon Hodgson , said : &apos; The beginning of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the census of government shoes .
Evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
This clinical attempt will lead us a step closer to a complete understanding of the benefits of PrEP .
It is now important that a clinical trial is introduced as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV and to move us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
Electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
In July , the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.94 , compared with EUR 7.71 in June this year , Elering .
The main reason for the price gap is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
In Estonia , the average electricity exchange rate was set at EUR 34.33 per megavage hour last month and the price rose by 12 % compared to June .
In Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five percent to EUR 36.27 per megavage hour .
In Finland , the price was EUR 34.17 , while the electricity exchange rate was EUR 26.37 per megavavage hour .
Prices rose by 12 and 7 % respectively .
Between Estonia and Finland , electricity was mobile by 75 % last month in Estonia and 16 % in the hours of Estonia and Finland .
The remaining nine % of the two @-@ hour transactions between the two countries did not take place next day .
Between Estonia and Latvia , electricity was mobile from Estonia to Latvia at 99 % and 73 % of hours had full transmission capacity .
According to transactions in the Nasdaq OMX market on July &apos;s latest trading day , the electricity exchange price could reach around ‚Ç¨ 34 and ‚Ç¨ 37 per megavage hour in August .
The carbon price affecting electricity production prices came up last month and transactions were worth 5.04 @-@ 5.47 ‚Ç¨ / 5.47 per tonne .
Living a higher life - half @-@ time and smart design schemes have made it a hole for small Earls Court of Justice
Joanne Leigh , a former banker who is a passionate building innovator , changed his home of Knightsbridge in 2014 against the Earls Court &apos;s koruna .
It is in the first order of Queen Anne Ter≈£i , and the fact that Joanne has not brought his bags together and sold the flats has been a tribute to the new design .
&quot; Before that , I lived with a former life @-@ rich compass in Knightsbridge , &quot; said Joanne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tantamount to the price I have offered .
I was shown by the Earls Court of Justice , which had the same high waves .
I thought it was and I made a bid on the same day . &quot;
Since the first visit , this 93 @-@ metre corps have passed a complete innovation gap .
At the beginning , it was a sleeping and complex fix - a sleeping wall had to be walked through kitchen , and Joanne wanted to add cage and quasi @-@ order to exploit high levels of talent .
&quot; I wanted high , big windows , a lot of light .
These were my demands , &apos; he said .
He is asking Erfan Azad Notting , a design and design centre , Duck &amp; Order , to take advantage of the 3.8 m deserts and to create a home that is not just a development site but a place where Joanne can live .
It was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a quasi @-@ order where to stand .
The Erfan had to approach things in a creative way .
&quot; Aquaculture is rather complex , &quot; he explains .
&quot; We had to reorganise the premises so that they were located on one another without having to be bogged down .
It was not just about building a platform , but using steel design to make sure that the upper and lower space is right . &quot;
This emphasis allowed Mrs Erfans to create two pieces of flambles with complete arrogance alongside each other in the space , with a lot of dramatic elements .
One @-@ off is the old @-@ day light for the glaciers under the Retrouvius window .
The gold furniture , silver details and retronoblegne Serge Mouille &apos;s lighting highlight the style of space .
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light courses .
Both sides of the short corridor have been included in the corridors so that it appears longer .
In the night , the mirror is giving the impression of a second @-@ step window .
In the course of the exercise , the census provides a reflection of the deposit for all the eating disorders and glass requirements of Joanne .
The debt for housing is added to the possibility of closing the vegetables if they are not used , creating a more dense space for the cycling .
The cumbersome kitchen cucumbers are nothing new .
However , with this kitchen , it is unique that it is a sandboard of uprisings of garage .
&quot; It did a little bit of design , &quot; explains the image of the MDF , which has been spoiled with Erfan terasasastronomy .
&quot; This has a counterweight , so it is very simply going to be put up with it . &quot;
Thanks to the smart use of space and maintenance , Joanne now has 16 additional computers , additional sleeping rooms and better harvesting .
After all , the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to property - &apos; says Erfan .
&apos;Kinnismineral land kler takes an outdated form of tup and makes calculations based on the area of land &apos; .
Here they have been able to increase the surgery , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to the space .
&quot; Materials are what you have to do and thus help to create emotional links with your home , &quot; says Erfan .
&apos;You do not love the electricity cables in my sein .
It is important , but it does not put heart languages ringing . &quot;
This shows that a good design and an increased area of land helps to make something astonishing from a rather normal corps .
In fact , they may even be a desire not to leave , as was the case with Joanne .
The chief figure , Jensen , is Chicago &apos;s pill @-@ fired petroleum , who is competing with my colleague for his professionalism .
No more than the amount of money that has been earned , which is not forgotten by any ethics .
His wife and three children only see his husband on his property and on the late hour .
In the first part of the film , I find myself in the idea that it is a version of the business world of the &apos; steel house &apos; - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler &apos;s speech .
What film goes on , the less the cabinet element remains , and the moralising intention of film makers is beginning to appear more and more .
A life @-@ changing experience is the main driver &apos;s disease of poppy .
Now there is a need for choice between work and family life .
The poet dressing the doctor at the ruins of Chicago &apos;s great buildings is putting his father into thinking about matters of real importance such as religion , welfare , love ... without even touching on the disaster of the twin sectors .
After the third stomach , where the son opens the eyes of father , there is a feeling that film makers are certainly driven to the target of getting their audiences heard , because even the most neediest heart @-@ oriented viewer is unable to keep tears back when it comes to the suffering of the cule cancer @-@ sick boys .
If a son falls into the House and his situation seems to be almost hopeless , father will finally understand the moral nature of his work and do a good job for the elderly .
Now I am lucky in my own sense - if the film has its own , I reward my sense of vision after the film coffee , if I am wrong , then the standle may be congratulated for at least one surprise .
For a moment , there is a suspicion that the ice coffee will be lost - when the husband calls a sick man and a man drives a sickery along the road to the slow @-@ line .
However , the Poeg has been amazing , and although his father has lost his job , it is even positive , because now it is time to deal with the family .
I can also feel very well - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well .
In truth , film is well constructed , all the elements needed to do so are in place .
You get a button , you get a laughing , the players are a good and moral beauty : Money is not the most important thing in life .
This film is well introduced by surprise .
The new Staff Commander of the Trumpm intends to limit President &apos;s media consumption .
Others have tried and failed .
Perhaps Mr Kelly will actually manage this .
In that case , it would be the first .
Politico writes that the new staff chief of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President Trumpin , including news , in the hope that it will keep the excess in a more balanced way .
There is a full report from Josh Dawseyan here :
&quot; When John F. Kelly met high officials on his first day of work , the White House revealed a key problem with President Donald Trumpi Valges Main , which he plans to solve the poor flow of information into President Assad &apos;s hands .
Mr Kelly told officials that information must be channelled through him , either on paper or at meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried to do so and have failed to tame Trumpi by monitoring its media consumption .
President Trumpi &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades and , even now that he is in White Main , his television observation habits have not gone anywhere .
&quot; When the candidate Trump was a pause for unfair media coverage , he had the flexibility to show him that he was also fairly reflected in the statements affecting him , &quot; said Sam Nunberg Politicos in February .
Politico StarPalmer wrote at the time that , &apos; according to six former campaigners , Trumpi Twitter is a key to controlling the behaviour of the ter @-@ habits , to ensure that his individual media consumption also contains a stable piece of praise . &apos;
Good .
But the idea that the habits of using Trumpi Twitter have once been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
Perhaps those campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know that the Trumpi tag would have been even more heartening without these interventions .
We will probably never be able to know about the allowances that the Trump did not disclose .
If she was helpless able to save the wounded a few times , his efforts were worth doing so .
But no one has been able to prevent Trumpi from constantly creating controversy .
Part of the problem is that , in White Main , which consists of competing tactics between the two , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception , by transferring materials to the Truel that support their world views but which may not always be reliable .
The Policy tico , which reflects the whole story , wrote in May the tendency of advisers to provide strategic information to the President on feed .
One of the examples of the report , Mr Goldmacher , is as follows :
&quot; The current and former Trumpi are subject to the Trub saying that Trump can react to negative press pressures , particularly harmful information spots , exploding as a obsession with identifying their source of origin .
This was also the case at the end of February , when someone gave the President a cheerfully copy of the Internet provocation , Charles C. The website of GotNews.com , which belongs to Johnson , accused the chief officer , Katie Walshi , of being a white house &apos; source of multiple leaks &apos; .
It is no different that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of his mouse , or that he did not provide any specific evidence or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
The Trump read the article and started asking the subordinate Walshi . &quot;
Goldmacher added that the then staff chief of Reince Priebus and the head of the White House &apos;s office , Rob Porter , had tried to establish a system for managing and documentation documents reaching Trumpin . &quot;
How did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective than he is in the head of Priebuss , but the Trump is still an impulse and his assistant will still compete for influence .
These unchanging factors make the mission very difficult .
Street musicians from abroad will not be allowed to get to grips with the capital .
There is a lot of foreign affairs in the city of Tallinn .
Those with whom the girl came to the fire recognised that he played in the old city without the permission of the city government .
The first thing we found was the three street musicians who had participated in the same number of houses near Viru gates .
It was clear to see that the scenes of rubbish and broken hardliners were ruins of the abattoirs to which one du≈° marches would be taken away .
Despite the humiliation , the only woman in the company played a ladial desecration in the apartment , while one man , alongside him , called the three faces and the successors closer .
The third man had sat on his back to one of them and was herself smoking a cordial wagons .
Their three chambers did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people who have passed .
Mr Bob , who has been ≈æmulected with his Noemi and the palliates , said that he is wearing the streets for both fun and money .
The purpose of the event was to collect ticket costs for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day .
As to whether they asked for permission from the city for rotation , Noemi and Bob were shaking their heads .
Firstly , we did not know .
Secondly , we never have more than a day or a few towns and , in most cases , permits for a month or something like this .
It makes no sense to pay for this , &quot; explained by Bob .
When we returned to the gates of Viru some 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in musicians and are going to go .
The jury came to grips with the Viru crossing of the Web with its bags and bags in absentia .
Three Polish young men , one of whom played a fifth , were also present on the street of Viru , and the third had even been able to carry out electronic glass .
&quot; We are here to offer people entertainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and life , &quot; trio from the pipe Mivosh explained .
According to Mivoshi , they are aware that there must be permission from the City Government .
&apos;We do not have it &apos; , of course , he said it joke .
But we hope that , when people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
Of course , when police comes , we go elsewhere , but try and try , &apos; he added .
The Estonian bank purchased bonds worth EUR 149 million in the public sector programme of central banks in the euro area , with a bank bond portfolio of EUR 4.36 billion .
The Central Bank does not provide more detailed information on purchases .
The President of the Bank of Estonia , Hardo Hansson , has made it clear in the past that the Central Bank of the Eurosystem &apos;s central banks &apos; assets buy @-@ up plans cover three different purchasing programmes : Covered bonds ( SIS II ) , asset @-@ backed bonds ( ABS ) and public debt ( PSPP ) .
The Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
The impact of purchases reduces the production of lower @-@ risk assets and encourages investors to take greater risks .
As a rule , under the public sector bond buy each Central Bank &apos;s own government bonds , other countries &apos; bonds are not purchased .
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is making &apos; substitute purchases &apos; within the amount allocated to them .
Central Banks also shop in those countries where the offer of bonds to the purchase scheme is limited .
The Estonian bank , confirmed by Hansson , generally buys bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank bonds .
The Estonian bank will purchase bonds under the asset buy @-@ up scheme as of March 2015 .
Meanwhile , Elempire bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian bank no longer bought up Election bonds in June 2016 .
On behalf of the central banks in the euro area , both Eletches and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds will be bought by the Bank of Finland from June .
Migrants ignore degrees and return to the &apos; millions of business building &apos;
Some of the West Midlands &apos;s most prosperous home owners have once again found themselves in fierce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the cradle of the council to win back their walls .
Migrants have parked their 20 trailers at the edge of a wealthy &apos; mild &apos; of millions of businesses on the streets of Someat .
They have returned , together with the army of horses , children and lorries , after they were snatched out of the wall only in May , without being thrown away from the cradle of the bureaucracies that the Council was complaining about to block their invasion .
The group found a weak place in the protection limits , turning its vehicles through the unblocked part that had been left to pop .
The people of the City Council have been surrendering the City of District , saying that the Council is &apos; useless in dealing with the problem &apos; .
A anonymous person said : &apos; They copied there on Monday evening after they were expelled from Bentley Heathy , where they refused to stoning .
The Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
The migrants were there in May , they were delayed and now they are back again .
They came to more yesterday evening , probably more today . &quot;
He added : &apos; Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect his parks .
I live on the road of street etsbrook and I am not happy that I must continue to pay a total of authorisations if the Council cannot even block such a thing . &quot;
A local resident who also wanted to be anonymous said : &apos; It is ridiculous ; we have only seen the last of these migrants leave , and a new offensive is already under way .
This time , the number has increased and even the horror has been seen in ruminence . &quot;
The Someat Council representative said , &apos; we are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the land near the street etsbrook road and we are working with the Someat ulli police , and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
The gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by phone number 101 .
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
The Weekna festival also visits the Minister for Culture , Indrek Saar , who is pleased that he has been able to bring real world top names .
The question of why so important for the Estonians at the Weekise festival is Saar that this should be asked of all those who enjoy three days at the festival .
However , he will admit that the real players in his area have come to the Persian region .
&quot; Looking at the level of artists that has been able to bring home to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music director - often not in our query - are spoken of a Minister for Culture .
However , which festival are the artists who are most telling themselves ?
I consider myself to be relatively old and , for some of the elderly , one of the most experienced doctors , Armin van Bnewren , who stood up last night .
He says that all of us have also complicated our own feet at some point , &apos; he says .
However , he also highlights a number of names , such as ChainRoure i , Deadmau5 , Knifebels .
Of course , our own Estonian players : Starting from NOavian , and they can be read in a whole series .
In reality , this concentration of known names is very high , &quot; he says .
See the lessons learned from the video .
Audi upgrades up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the light of criticism by car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement , BMW said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles .
According to the Chairman of BMW , the company believes that &apos; there are smarter alternatives than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the BMW home city of Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be upgraded to reduce emissions of diesel engines .
No company described these operations as a &apos; provocation &apos; .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
However , nitrogen oxide , which drives from diesel engines , is considered to be carcinogenic and could lead to asthma .
The cost of equipment installed for neutralising emissions from diesel vehicles will also increase for car manufacturers , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
While German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of ringing powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem .
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , who was silent about the use of &apos; petrolery &apos; that allowed emissions fares to be adapted to regulations when testing a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
Last month , a former head of the Audi engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore is not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
At the beginning of this year , Audi in Germany was sent to a criminal investigation into Volkswagen when the authorities accused the installation of the Audit System to evade European emission performance requirements , thereby extending the investigation that had previously been focused on the United States .
The inclusion of the Audi in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen , a producer of luxury cars Frontiously generates the profits of a large proportion of Volkswagen .
Estonian schools are expected to have 20 000 euro of EU flags .
The Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags for the purpose of marking the Presidency to Estonian schools by 1 September .
A total of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union &apos;s flag will be 570 education institutions .
Flags are intended to be used to inject invoices , they must be carried out in high quality printed material with a sense of attestation , and the ERR news portal is facilitated .
The flag bank has a text : &apos; Kingitus to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education , with a flag costing EUR 35 .
Murder of journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
The workers of the weekly newspaper , Riodoce , usually gather on Wednesday to review plans for the most recent chaos in the state of Blue authorisation , which is sown by organised crime , corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars .
But today they have gathered in the shadow of their personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
They are told that it is important to change their routine .
Two parent journalists will be discussing which looks safer : Whether to bring children into a office that was the target of a granchattack in 2009 or leave them home .
Security experts have written three words to the leader of the space : &apos; Enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
They ask reporters to provide the names of each water in every country with evidence that is not needed , they are sufficient to give impressions and inner feelings .
The presence of government or cartels is suspected of being drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists alike , of a whole list of paperwork who makes it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
Violence is not a stunt and the more dead people are accumulating across the country , the majority of which are journalists from Yemen , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists , since the election of President Enrique Pena ≈ûto at least 25 in December 2012 , 589 journalists have been killed in at least seven journalists in seven States since the attacks and threats were launched .
The most recent deaths include their editor and source of inspiration , Javier Valdez Cardenas , co @-@ founder of Riodoce .
&quot; The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Valdez wrote in one of his many reports on drug @-@ related violence .
His absence makes it felt deeply , even though his presence can be felt everywhere on the scene of the BirRiodoce building , a big picture of the Valdezest , which shows an average finger , with the &apos; Justice &apos; and the &apos; two 30nines reporters , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez &apos; , carries T snus , which is portrayed by his wife @-@ private glasses or the face of his petroleum fatty .
The meeting will take place less than two months after death ; the Reporters will discuss a common trauma , their nightmare , their hopelessness , their paranoia .
Although a separate public Prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
Like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders , which amount to thousands , the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
The editorial action of Riodoce will continue to reflect the violence in your own country , even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
Without the data and justice of murderers , the meeting on security will not be of much use , as Ibarra said .
&apos;It is very nice to waste time here at the meeting , &apos; he says .
&quot; As long as the reason is not known , you will have a lot of trust . &quot;
Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital of the State , Culiacan , on 15 May morning .
He managed to drive just a few quarters before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla , forcing him to exit the car and shot him 12 times , which is expected to mean &apos; twelfth river &apos; in translation .
The armed man went to the Valdez car and made an accident near it .
Valdez was 50 years old .
She was left behind by a woman and two adult children .
The bookings are spreading freely in Culiacan .
However , Valdez is mainly dominated by silence .
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of the United States in January , the Blue Card has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country , as rival fers are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
It is no different that people are thrown down every day on the streets of your licence , or even several , or that the dead are snatched from the gruesome two @-@ time sweets of drug art , which are more than many homes .
Let us forget for a moment that the time of peace indicates how valuable ports and the sea state with drug routes to the United States only leads one cartel .
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Riodoce is feeling the co @-@ founder and President , IsMay Bojorquez ( 60 ) , who was not able to defend his friend .
He believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
The first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Guzman &apos;s sons in the face of the Sikamehe Damaso Lopez pocket .
This piece of correspondence could have been alluded to by the supposedly suspect gang members , all copies of the publications were bought as soon as they were reached in the newspapers .
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security , after the ravage took place in another newspaper that was equally respected .
Valdez was legally in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
He had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to be present forever .
He served as a veteranreporter in the Noroeste newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce , sold 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bojorquez said that in your blue &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without touching on the drug problem &apos; .
The newspaper took time to see its courageous and honest labels and sales and advertising increased .
The reporters were keen to publish vigorous studies without fear of censorship and readers sleep in a print they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect .
Eight years after Riodoce was established , the newspaper won the prestigious award of Maria Moors Caboti for his reports in Latin America .
In the same year , Valdez &apos;s Committee for the Protection of journalists ( AKK ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow Mexican drug creation wherever it takes .
He admitted openly that he was afraid .
&apos;I want to live on , &apos; he said that when he received the AKK Prize .
Last October , he said in an interview given to the television channel Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Your country .
&apos;He to accept the task of assuming a second chance of playing a fool with the media office .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not talk about what is going on . &quot;
Riodoce collelovas longes Valdez , a joke who roppered like madrus , a friend who divided embryos and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
They gave their support to his routine .
He always weed his own village .
He went across the office to El Salvador baari and was always on the same desk .
Now they ask whether his stubbornness was fatal .
His death has also cast them in doubt about how best to do his job and to stay alive .
&quot; They do not like the arrogance of their women , their children , their legitimate businesses , their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&apos;These things should not have been touched , &apos; said Bojorquez .
The result is strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination even in the best times .
Trusted in your instincts .
If it is a matter of suspiciously framing , it is a hole away .
Riodoce editor Andres Villarres said that the problem is that &apos; odality can be deceived ... and so it was Javierga &apos; .
He and others say that you no longer have old rules , just as they do not apply in Tamaulik , Veracruz , Guerreros or other states , which are home to the toxic composition of profitable smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
The landscape is constantly changing .
In the space where Riodoce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only the pupil sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
Two police officers were seeking a relaxation of 40 degrees in front of the house , hiding behind the pumps .
They have appointed a more elected Riodoce office in the Culiacan central class in the Culiacan building .
Some of the reporters were half joke to wonder whether these police officers were among the 50 % of police officers who have themselves been discredited by the Governor .
Several months have passed since reports have been travelling to mountainous rural areas where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gangs .
Riodoce &apos;s publication this week dealt with three main features .
One of them was the murder of former poxomallego Julio Cesar Chavez venna in Sinalo .
They also had an exorbitant story of spending government funds on the city of the Governor &apos;s home city .
And a group of people was kidnapped from Culiacan , one of the most expensive restaurants , which is a quarter of the public office .
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened , so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of flu is a place of interest for drug traffickers and public authorities alike .
Reporter learned from public documents that a restaurant was registered as a politician who belongs to the ruling institutional Revolutionary Party ( IRP ) , which dominated all policy levels almost throughout the last century .
Recently , several IRP Governor has been accused of widespread coverage of cases of corruption .
In Villarline , the reporter asked her to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Guzman , who wear the name of El Chapo , escaped military betration .
Just a few months earlier , readers would have sought the Quaesty of Valdez to obtain information about kidnapping from the best sources .
&quot; In the past , we would have known what happened , &apos; said 46 years old in Villarline , whose clouds have earned him a banner of El Flaco .
&apos;All channels of communication have now broken down with our sources &apos; .
The Valdez office has become a reservoid of bridges and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists and the editorial workers have become something they never expected to wait for activists on behalf of the press .
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few eyes and direction next morning to the local Prosecutor &apos;s office for another journalist .
Mr Salvador Ava disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the killing of Valdez .
It has been found to be a dead body and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
Journalists have become more popular across the country and are crippling the phrase &apos; SOS press &apos; to the pavements and buildings as organised protest .
On that day , President Bojorquez will have an international contribution to make justice in the Valdez case .
A day after the death of Valdez , when he met with the Your licence Governor , Ramirez accused the authorities of crying out journalists and killing them for telling the truth .
After that , he asked for his or her to be diverted from the government &apos;s activities elsewhere , concerned that hatred had affected objectivity .
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ culpable state officials and indifferent society .
In his last book &apos; drug media &apos; , he wrote that the reporters are not only killing drugs gangs , but also under the command of politicians and security forces who are at the mercy of organised crime .
Articulo 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , issued more than half of the attacks on the police and public officials last year .
&apos;In Mexico you happen , because you want to keep quiet , &apos; Ramirez said .
Obviously , the effects are bloody .
No one will forget the death of the blogger , Mrs Elizabeth Macias , in the northern border state of Tamaulik six years ago .
He was found dead with a letter which I think had been signed by the cartel LOS Zetas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
His beloved head was found by computer glass and ears .
Some publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the northern border state of El Norte , Chihuahuahua , after their correspondent missile killings in March .
Others will continue to do as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their president in 2004 .
In 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with the editorial &apos; What do you want ? &apos;
Some journalists have fled their home states or even their country .
This is a nervous decision .
It is difficult to find work in this case and they still have to find out today in order to avoid dangers .
And sometimes they are being persecuted , as probably happened with the photograph Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered three months after the Veracruz break in 2015 with four women in one of the cities in 2015 .
Those who remain in the ground and continue to work must be tangled every day around risky decisions .
The Ibarra , who once wanted to become a poet , recognises that the reporting of drug trafficking is frightening him .
&quot; Mexico is on the way to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
At a recent midnight of Friday , when the latest number had already been snatched , the editor of Riodoce was walked up and beating to the office when suddenly all telephone lines began to be calibrated .
In the exceptionally cumbersome city of Mazatlanis , 19 people died in fire @-@ rival gangs and security forces , according to confirmed deaths .
The war escorted the war , as did a number of messages left by cartels found in the area .
According to the same pavements , reporters made news on the Riodoce site using mobile phones .
A change was needed in the front of next day .
The scenes seized another fire @-@ fighting in the region .
Bojorquez piilla was on the guard to see whether they are vigilant .
If they were afraid , they did not at least show it .
The desert @-@ down founder , under a massive banknote , where his average finger is visible to the whole blue , was carried out by the workers of Riodoce in his footsteps .
&apos;How could you think about closure , &apos; said Bojorquez , &apos; on the same day that Javier Javier Jia was killed , a practical interface asked me to send a report to the streets ? &apos;
Dinosaurus used a protective colour to avoid enemies
At first glance , it looks like a form , albeit rather frightening .
Scientists have now made public the first findings of the incredible rubbish @-@ rate size discovered by Canadian miners , which has so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; dinosaur Mona Lisa &apos; .
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to establish that the skin covered by his sooms was a red @-@ boy coloured colour and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
In a magazine published by Health Biology , the report on status was described as &apos; the best preserved soomomalment that has ever been found &apos; and &apos; one of the best Curriculum readings worldwide &apos; .
In the case of fossil fuels , it is a new type of nodosaxist that lived in the middle of the seasonage , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
Its incredibly good retention in Raba was carried out by theatres describing it as &apos; truly significant &apos; .
This sorely covered vegetarian plant feed has , according to national Geosian , remained the best preserved type of phosphorus ever found .
On 21 March 2011 , Shawn functional was found when he extracted Suncor Millenium in Fort McMurray near Northern Albertas in Canada .
He has caught something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into it .
The advertised phosphate was sent to the Royal Tyrrell paleontology museum .
The next six years were designed to extricate the animal from the land unit of 2 500 pounds ( 1100 kilometres ) .
After all this hard work , the end result is now finally ready to bring the public to the table .
&apos;Even to pardon a little eyes , you can almost believe he sleep , &apos; said Caleb Brown , the editor Royal Tyrrell museum where he is being stunned .
&quot; This goes down to one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaur circles in scientific history - dinosaur Mona Lisana .
When he studied his skin , he found that this vegetation , although covered by sodium and resembling divisive tank , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food dinosaences .
This high @-@ level dinosaur used a red and white sense of protection to hide from predators and applied sheltering techniques , which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
This allowed experts to enter the dinosaur better , and the enemies to be prevented , as they were told by the experts , because they were likely to be hunted by major dinosaences .
This figure of 110 million old @-@ year @-@ old family of nodosaic urbs first reached news in May and is now visited in the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology museum .
The theatres have now investigated the existence and given it the name of the Borealopelta Marmitchelli museum mark Mitchell , who was a team that spent more than 7 000 hours to reveal the suffering .
Thanks to his amazing good survival , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the sooms .
They found disapproval - the method of protection in animal species , which means that the title of existence was the harshest as the lower .
Although the disapproval is common , the findings come as a surprise , since Borealopelta is much greater than those of those with responsibility today .
This suggests that dinosaur pressure was sufficiently actively hunted by other meat additives , that the evolution preferred sheltering rather than confrontation as a survivous policy .
However , most of the animals used today , such as fear , seals or armadweather , are far smaller and more vulnerable as a harvest , indicating that nodosaurus had to really work to survive .
&quot; The strong megalling of the dinosaur , which is covered by huge and abundant soaps , shows how dangerous the endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered dinosaences could have been , &quot; Brown said .
The chemical analysis of organic compounds of Soomorganic compounds also revealed that the compound &apos;s skin was red .
Scientists will continue to investigate the effects of this life , including the retained content of this salt style , in order to find out what the animal would last their sister .
They believe that the dinosaur has fallen into the dead rivers , thereby entering the sea , where it was sunk in the ocean .
At the time , Albertas was just as soccable as it was today in South Florence and rivers and oceans were probably far beyond the internal land .
&quot; This nodosasaurus is truly significant , as it has fully preserved soustic skin , while remaining three dimensions , maintaining the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; As a result , the animal today sees almost the same thing as in the candage .
It does not have to be built with a great deal of imagination - it is enough simply to put bridges on the table and it seems he would be like sleeping . &quot;
The crisis era was the time when huge sweets of meat feed - heterostores - were stunned in the countryside .
Although their Queen Tyrannosauru rex lived millions years later than Borealopelta , this sorely cherished dinosaur could have been wet by some of his daunting predecessors .
These include Acrocanthosaurus , a long and six @-@ tonne monster with 38 legs ( 11.5 metres ) .
Scientists whose recent findings are published in the Journal of Health Biology believe that Borealopelta uhuta was stunned after death in the sea and this muzine was muzzled .
On 21 March 2011 , Shawn functional , when he extracted from the factory of Millenium in Fort McMurray near Northern Albertas in Canada .
By the way , it has best preserved soomomalsis in the world , including skin and sooms , and it is comprehensive from concentration to pumps .
These assumptions were on average 18 legs ( five metres ) long and up to GBP 3 000 ( 1 300 kg ) .
Two 20 customs miles were invaded by this .
Scientists believe that this beautiful monastery , which was covered by soaps , was through the current Western Canada until the river flooded in its opening sea was proud .
But the landing site of the dinosaur was instrumental in maintaining its soyings in an excellent detail .
The ice of this particular father , coal , has so well preserved that mygarchical soomnis surgery blocks still cover skin glaciers .
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geosian magazine , &apos; such statehood is as rare as lotovictory .
The more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
The burnt skin bears still cover the mysterious sodium @-@ based .
A better front is lying alongside him and the five stomaches are silenced .
I can count the soyings at his winter . &quot;
How did one activist find a response to the question of &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was completely shocked .
Just a day after the trip to New York , this was the birthplace of St. Louka Airbnb , who was rented in a boom , on Facebook .
He was left to the post of his former schoolmaster .
There was a saying : &apos; The police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old adolescents and still hang on the streets &apos; .
He was confused as to why nobody else had outsourced this information from his bed , so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
Pidega @ TheePMilah &apos;s user had repeatedly been handed over on his line of time .
St. Synchronchronous Schollin , from the Louana region , sent a real @-@ time tag to Michael Brown , the death of an unarmed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson Missouris .
He gave an image of the life of Brown , a body that was found in the street , living there for four hours .
&apos;It is crazy , &apos; said Ferreira &apos;s modification .
However , death was nothing new for him or for the community .
He put his phone off but later this evening he saw the tag that announced the people &apos;s arrival in Canfield Drive .
The Jagati photographs of the police and the people who were afraid , and a man who claimed to be the father of Brown and kept the letter &apos; Ferguson police killed just my unarmed son ! &apos;
He watched a real @-@ time flow where the police officer stood before a group of protesters with a graves dozen .
Another police officer in the second video , he said , &apos; I kill all ... animals &apos; .
To Ferrell , he has come to mind how he has caught himself from the thought : &apos; It is unusual &apos; .
&apos;This is not a murder of this kind that we are accustomed to and which we could describe as typical &apos; .
I felt frightened at that point .
I was angry and I have asked . &apos;
He booked a return flight and then went home next day .
Having buried at 23 : 00 , he went on his father for his six @-@ year daughter and decided that they would travel to Ferguson next morning .
What took place with Ferrell and Fergusonga over the next three years is the central issue of the new documentary &apos; Whose street &apos; . ( &apos; Whose thanks ? &apos; ) , which will be present in cinemas on 11 August .
It is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who have thanked the way they asked for answers .
When Mrs Ferreira , with her daughter - who had a lipsy sticker and a chat with it - was travelling to Ferguson , they spoke again about the experiences and living conditions of black men before this morning .
&quot; Remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &quot;
&quot; We are now travelling to Ferguson because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that is not right . &quot;
&apos;I could not take him on board , &apos; said Ferrell later .
&apos;What is happening now is the culmination of ... what happened in the past .
It must know and see this and grow in the middle of it .
It must learn about the organisation of a activists and , at the same time , feel different layers of experience and living conditions for the Muslim people , and what we must do to be free and free .
Even if I manage to raise him in such a way that he does not personally copy brutal racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel I would be doing him a disservice if I would protect him from this world . &quot;
The first stop they did in the vicinity of Fergusoni was by South Florissanti - the police station in the remaining place , which had become a kind of camp camp maker , where activists were waiting for news about the police officer Darren Wilson , who was not ultimately charged with charges .
There , Mr Ferreira and his daughter joined the local business owner who prepared lunch .
They brought together food homes and helped to divide them to the protesters .
For Ferrell , a new type of activist was slowly started to take shape .
&quot; My activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at Missouri @-@ St. Louad University , he was the President of the Alliance of Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organisation .
All this was just a fiasco . &quot;
Weeks later , during the Ferreira evening demonstration , a film co @-@ director , Sabaah Folayani , met with a film .
Folayan said that he and the film operator , Mr Alvarado @-@ Farrar , simply wanted to document what is happening .
The question that came to the head of Ferrell was &apos; are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
Such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to take advantage of its protein and resilience .
Folayan explained in a recent interview : &apos; We had heard that the voice of people born and growing in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Folayan had already put his hand in hand with the co @-@ director Damon Davati , the artificial father of the region , who was well known for activists in connection with prisoners sentenced to death .
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and the other six local cities who were watched for years following the shooting of Brown .
&quot; Nobody is talking for us or for us in this documentary , but we are speaking to ourselves , &apos; said Davis .
&quot; It was important for me how these people are portrayed , because that is how I am portrayed . &quot;
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell - the intention was to show that the Movement is not a &apos; donor leader , but a community bringing together &apos; , as outlined by Folayan - he was the most open to the film .
As a result , the &apos; Whose street &apos; ? &apos; Peculiar personal aspects of the life of Ferrell , such as ruthless and married with their wife .
&apos;I felt as if I were , &apos; said Ferreira , snaming the first time that he saw the city .
&quot; But I realised that the human vulnerability of this work and of the black people must be accompanied by a certain amount of vulnerability . &quot;
Moreover , the Ferrell affair underlines and puts the role of black LGBT women in the wider Black Sea Lives Matter movement at the centre again .
Two of the three initiators who thought in the social media about the killing of Hurricane Trayvon Martin in 2012 , following the killing of the Hurricane Trayvon Martin , are the subject words # BlackLivesMatter .
&quot; Women who have black homosexuals play a leading role have kept the movement in general , &quot; said Ferreira , and this is precisely because we must fight on a number of fronts .
Roma women must bear all the burden . &quot;
Folayan agreed , saying that &apos; movement is indeed alive for black women , and many of them black homosexuals &apos; .
He says , however , that &apos; this is not a kind of &apos; equal opportunities &apos; - Ferrell was not chosen as a film centre for his identity .
&quot; He was someone who evening the right energy , &quot; said .
&quot; But it is no coincidence that he was on the frontline , because the black LGBT woman is at stake when living in such hubs .
His energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
At the same time , news cameras Fergusonto have long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
The conditional sentences imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the road will last 2.5 years .
He describes the social policy atmosphere in the region he calls home , simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
Nonetheless , it still considers the mantra it has eaten up since it took the streets of Ferguson a whole three years ago .
&quot; It is our duty to fight for our freedom .
It is our duty to win .
We must love and support each other .
We have nothing but to lose our chains . &quot;
7 : How to overcome Weekise &apos;s potaclone after the Weekise
Some of the most frequent measles are found to be affected , including help , after a little bit of hot air .
Or the term &apos; Beyond potall &apos; , the pyramid of the stick .
But this is only inevitable postponement and a decent blessing for health .
What can you do to make sure that , after today and tomorrow , Mrs Weekise &apos;s line - or whatever - she knows better this morning and to overcome poppy as painfully as possible ?
Joo Water .
To alcohol , after a great deal of pipe in the morning ... or possibly even alcohol .
As the body loses a lot of liquids when using alcohol , it must somehow be recovered .
Mineral materials are also thrown out of the body , with water , and sestap is a good hair to mineral water .
Since the sweetener has often been annoyed after the metal , it is particularly good if it is bubble or only lightly gambled .
Let us walk .
It would certainly not cost a boy to split trees into the grandmother - it could prove fatal to be a wrong decision .
But a simple walk @-@ out helps the body to recall once again what sense it is in life .
Counselling in Telgis and sleeping poppy is a more time @-@ consuming way to get a full .
Give poor energy back gradually and cautiously .
If you are on the verge of overdrinking yesterday , then it is certainly not worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
She , for example , has a fresh volume containing fruit fans as a body to quietly market .
If health is already suffering from the South , then the wedding could be attempted , for example .
And a little later , the Panorama .
Extradition was avoided .
This diure tag will free the body from the last water .
As has already been said , water and volume are your friends .
Reparing painkillers .
If you can take a painkiller to prevent potaclone on the evening , you must not only deal with alcohol , but also with paratsetal or ibuproproprov , and so you lose so much .
So many more hits and , in the future , boys will be worse .
In addition , the cake does not remain in the coffee for a long time .
If you take a painkiller morning , you will do it with a bottle of thick air - it irrives your already tired sweet sweat .
Or if the partner is not to take it , then it will be well with itself .
It is about doing the same thing as walking , but it does not get a orgary when it comes to doing it .
However , too active a pace and an outrageous bet were avoided - the physical effort should be moderating during the boashone .
A joke .
The words of friends of time with friends of friends of friends of friends of the past , the easy hand of the carpet and the Nazis friendly about both himself and others ( suffering ) .
The lungs and navier may not be discharged , but they certainly have resulted in a more indiscriminate form of violence .
Once again , the boy goes over anyway !
University of Northwester and Oxford , a person who is being sought as suspects in murder
The police say that a professor of the University of Northwester and Oxford are sought nationally and that suspects have been sought after deadly petty petty wrapping wings have been found as a single Chiicago luxury .
According to the Cook County papers , on Monday , arrests were issued without a distance of opportunity for the arrest of the 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni accused of death for the first @-@ instance murder of Trenton H. Cornell @-@ Duranhanu .
According to the documents , 26 years of Cornell @-@ Durantagu died after repeated nails .
According to a warning , the Chicago police station issued to the community , the body was found to be dead on 27 July .
Police officers received telephone calls and found a victim with several storms in the Grand Plaza Corterhouse .
According to the officials , Cornell @-@ Durantagy was admitted to death and investigators are treating rape as a murder , while the police are actively seeking two suspects .
Lavid has been working as co @-@ professors of micro @-@ biology and immunology at the University of Northwester since 2007 .
In a statement sent as an e @-@ mail , Alan K. Cubbage , Vice @-@ President of University , said that Lavid has now been temporarily removed from the workplace and is forbidden to enter the towns of the University of Northwester .
&quot; This is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of Northwester will work with the investigators , &quot; said Cubbage .
Warren is a senior assistant in the financial department at the University of Oxford .
The representative of the University of Somerville College said in an e @-@ mail statement : &apos; We have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist US research authorities in every way possible &apos; .
Furthermore , the statement stated that Warreni colleagues were shocked and wish to be extradited .
Anthony Guglielm , Head of the Communications Department of Chicago , urges , on suspicion , to give himself to the authorities .
&quot; The police have an idea where they are , but we are increasingly intensively defining the exact location , &quot; said Guglielm .
According to Guglielm , suspects are helped by local , regional and national authorities .
Guglielm said that the police received telephone calls from the chief of the Grand Prix Corterhouse , who had just received a kryptic hint that something had happened in Corps No 1008 .
According to the police , this was a spectacular spectacle .
It is not clear , according to the Guglielm , whether the event was also taking place on 27 July .
He said that the security cameras confirm the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building .
&quot; We believe that Professor Lathares and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
The Grand Chilean leadership sent a letter to the people : &apos; The police is currently working to find a background to events and victims , and will examine various motives , including the possibility of a family dispute . &apos;
Firms that help your businesses avoid getting next UbB
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ up company , but the surveys were unprofitable .
The answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
And even if he promised anonymous , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; This system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Errett , who is running the Madison Reed Company , which sells e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees in San Francisco .
So he called on external actors to help .
Start @-@ ups with new types of human resources are emerging to help businesses to find out what their workers feel .
By developing and licensing software that aims to measure the involvement of workers , they enable companies to carry out flash surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , provide anonymity and complaint @-@ raising for workers and , in some cases , allow insurers to bypass the C level management and address the Bureau directly .
&apos;There are now tools such as Strava and Fitler , which are meant to monitor health , but where is Fitbi for your company ? &apos; Asked Jim Barnett , co @-@ founder and CEO , Redwood City start @-@ up Glint , whose software analysts use companies to measure employee inclusion .
According to Erretti , he has received a much better overview of what he thinks and knows about in three years when he has used Glinti .
In addition to the investigation and the study for specific teams , it provides a company &apos;s heating card , which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , enabling them to identify the causes .
Companies have started to understand that they have to stay in touch with their culture of work , so as not to become the next Ubbar , which has been rife in scandals since the former worker published a bloggerpostal , which described the harassment of those who dared to speak .
For start @-@ ups like Glint , the desire to have an overview is a profitable business option .
Global governance , regulation and conformity can be worth more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020 , according to the Financial ethics Statistics website Let &apos;s talk translations .
The new company operating in Denveris Colorado , which helps companies to prevent and identify inappropriate behaviour , noted this year interest and an increase in activity against the background of the dubious reputation of Uberia .
FIFcentil has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
Uber recently registered himself as a customer .
Like Glinles , FIF7.5 companies will be allowed to send tailor @-@ made impulse polls , collect confidential answers in real time and look at the problematic areas of heat cards .
It also offers a anonymous message @-@ sheet which allows workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
And when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; Public opinion has anchored regulators , &quot; said Integration centi &apos;s founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan .
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act unethically , it could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts , the departure of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ruby flu , restaurant , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of business , has used modulation for more than a year to ensure workers &apos; awareness of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way of communicating with the corporation headquarters .
When a worker wanted to announce the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address at the company headquarters , he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously .
This was often a damning and inconvenient process , and Mr Vitrano , a general adviser , said Ruby Yemen , who said that there was no good way of monitoring workers &apos; complaints .
However , now that the company uses ops , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices , which did not have previously reached management managers operating in other cities or states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I can get away to the hollow experience of the workers 360 degrees , &quot; said Vitrano , who chairs Ruby hood &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; And we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and employee involvement more seriously in 2002 , after the collapse of the audit company Arthur Andersson , due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal .
However , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they cannot prevent their black washing from being hijacked online .
&quot; Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; said .
Both Glint and Acccent offer their software as a service , taking companies periodically paid for the use of their products .
This is a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors , which have been supported by both start @-@ ups .
3.4 centi financed USD 10 million in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and the Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by EUR 47 million .
USD 10 million was invested in Glinti Venture partners in November , increasing the company &apos;s total funding to USD 60 million .
Such investments will not come as a surprise if we take into account the interconnectedness of companies , culture and venture capital .
More and more research shows that today &apos;s workers expect more jobs than before .
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high wages and interesting projects are just on the table .
Workers want to feel they are accepted and valued and devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; If people are happy in the company , they feel they are listening to them and the work they do is satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said Nina McQueen , Vice @-@ President Linkedin , who has a general benefit and experience of workers , both Integration cenpti and Glinti .
Investors will earn revenue if companies in their portfolio do well ; businesses are well off when workers are committed and involved .
If analytical tools from the third party allow workers to be more committed and involved , we are not sure they will be supported .
Data on worker inclusion is important , according to experts in the professional culture .
However , these data will be useless if the company &apos;s supervisors do not follow up with them .
In fact , when a company asks its employees for feedback , it can create expectations that change will come .
And if changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all , they could cause disappointment and decrease the involvement of workers .
&quot; When you ask 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conversations , &quot; said President Russell Raath , the consultancy and business administration , who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&apos;because if things do not stop , then workers will think : &apos; Did you actually listen to me ?
Do you care ?
And if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
According to Erretti , the Madison Reeval , which is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via Glinti .
And , after receiving feedback from workers disappointed by the pace of decision making and the quality of communication , he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems .
However , Ruby Portuguille is collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will result in a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in industry known for its large turnover .
&quot; If you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vitrano .
&quot; And if you lose people , you lose customers .
And if you lose customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
Euro area bench is Baltic : Revenues grow rapidly
Although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe , Banimal berg , with reference to the ECB report .
According to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
There is a low debt burden , fast @-@ growing institutions and business @-@ friendly and free market @-@ friendly policies behind the success .
&quot; The Baltic States , in one of Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where the EU average has been substantially closer to the purchasing power of the reactor per capita . &quot;
Although the aim is that the overall output of the economy per capita would be equivalent to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2 / 3 / 15 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
Low wages have led the balloers to seek a better wage abroad .
Although the European Central Bank sees Baltic in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic .
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only one quarter of Latvia and Lithuania &apos;s population estimated that their economies are going very well or rather well .
In the Czech Republic and Poland , this was just as much as half the respondents who thought about their own economies .
NCAA &apos;s decision to cancel the double @-@ day trends makes the Bruinsi days long
It is almost 23 : When the football club of the trochiond UCLA stops talking at the end of a new exercise in the city of the team .
Some of them have been burdened by the company &apos;s sleep , revealing their efforts for the first day of the training camp .
For a large part of the team , these Christmas Days offer midday couples .
The players on the courses will go back to the collective life endless , after three hours , before returning to the Wandarman football front next morning .
&quot; The next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mora , the Bruinsi Treaster , shortly before Monday was Tuesday .
The NCAA decision to cancel the trends that take place twice a day to reduce the burden of players has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end of the day - to one side of the final examinations on Friday .
For this reason , the three first operations of UCLA were prompted to start at 19.15 in order to fit players into an already tight timeline .
Moving from two to two strikes a day means more one day - the beginning of the Bruinsi training camp was increased almost a week ahead compared to the previous season , and for the first time Mora &apos;s six Westwood season is taking place during summer courses .
They have a scheme of 18 to 20 August before starting formal preparations for the opening game against Texas A &amp; M in September .
According to Mora , he is in favour of a change in the NCAA rule , although it adds another item to the close schedules of players .
&quot; They have a huge burden three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; And they break through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are a wonderful young person .
I believe that when we arrive on Saturday and we have more time , it will be a real pleasure . &quot;
When the camp is closed , UCLA &apos;s tour operations will be closed , which is not an easy task , however , given the clear view of the parking record and the by @-@ the @-@ side Luskini centre , a higher class hotel that has already escaped football from the net around the gates .
Since this weekend , hotel Bruinsi players are occupying , but Mora recognised that there could be problems with free tobacco during the season .
&apos;We are implementing security measures , &apos; said Mora .
&quot; This is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can get a mob and a filter from there .
If you have a record of a train , you can do a good deal .
But we use the security team there and the 8 parking stations .
We will do our best to use our existing ones .
I will try not to be very concerned about this .
We have a plan in place . &quot;
The section on the election union of Saduare @-@ Ivanova , the reformist party , the campaign for the expulsion of Kristiina Ojuland and the ECB , which was born to the Central Party , on the association of the forces of Maria Kaljete , in our capital city and political parties , appeared to be taking part in local elections at least as much as political parties this year .
However , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether there are enough frustrated voters .
Who is staying on the island ?
If the support office of Edgar Salevare reduced , events may be expected to honour his electoral union .
One member of the national assembly , some former and present central parties and many unknown faces - will such a date be the composition of the electoral union ?
And why are some of the Saduare bystanders and sisters prevented from standing in Tallinn , perhaps the reason why the &apos; Saduare list &apos; of companies , which are governed by corruption and suspected of corruption , becoming a reality ?
A civic government @-@ based music cameras , film @-@ made music cameras , to a Russian poem in which the urban part of the Lasnam√§e is more elderly ; and , in all ways , a priest in which the votes of the 1616 and 17 year @-@ old voters , Prime Minister Y√ºri Rata , must avoid leaking on his way when driving , are the central parties trying to try to avoid the votes of the electors for the first time ?
We look forward to seeing other parties see their vision of a youth @-@ based election campaign .
If the channel 2 or TV3 viewers are confronted with black hall from the beginning of August , there will be two options : To accept that in future , only ETV , ETV2 + , Tallinn TV and English France24 channels or to donate 10 @-@ month TV operators .
There are probably also those who openly rejoice about advertising @-@ free television experience at the beginning , but ultimately - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and advertisements .
Innumerical music , folding people and rubbish left on the streets are unpleasant by almost every major music filter .
If you do not want to be part of the measles , however , you have to leave the country to the festival for the Coptic amount of sleeping at home instead of painting .
Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
Media publications are quoted by President Donald Trumpi , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card .
The plan provides for a 50 000 @-@ year reduction in the number of legal immigrants , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
The new rules have been proposed by Republican and supported by the President .
The bill goes to the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; This law reduces poverty , increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , because it changes the way in which green cards are issued to US citizens .
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
The new application process will give priority to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and to the skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Trump in the US media publications .
Siberia seto young people move to the city , pensioners back to the land .
Jevseyev Anatol continues the famous seto gold miners along the River Maana .
She works 140 kilometres from home to Maana additional words at Kuvai as a motor driver .
This is a tough job : Two months and months after rest , 12 hours of work , and then only 10 days at home and again .
During the three years of the Archtel , Anatol has seen gold only once .
&apos;There is a resounding procedure : When we go in , you will check thoroughly that you do not lead to a viral , and if you go out that you do not take it &apos; , you will speak Anatol .
Mare Piho , speaking in the village of Haida , to the local seto Jaga , who has spoken a great deal to him about the memory of his family in Siberia .
The archaic culture of Siberian setoses is also beginning to affect home seals , because it is just so shocking , is of the most detail thinking of Piho Mare , who studied the setos .
His first investigation trip to Siberia will be 30 years later this year .
During that time , he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year .
How much was still missing out to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here ?
This is a unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took this into account in the words of Siberian seto men who have thought about it themselves .
It is difficult to say precisely that , because at that time up to 30 people could come to one group , but only a man was given a passport .
The passport was given only one thing , but was children , sisters and others Nazi children .
Look at how much the territory was here .
It was many times greater than that of the historian .
After all , it was necessary to educate , to manage it in some way .
Setinos came here as farmers , but their lives changed because they came to areas that were not only involved in agriculture but also in rivers ( palgiparation ) , gold mines , industry .
For example , in New @-@ Petseris , many pigs later entered the city of Krasnojarsk @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P. ) when it was formed .
Did the setos form the majority of the population in this region at that time ?
Yes , they lived in a compacket .
In addition , it maintained a long tradition of marriage and child pornography .
Seven to eight children in the family were common .
How much does Siberian setopes have a different culture and different from that of mother land ?
They are different , although what was said here was once the same .
They brought a great many popular ideas .
They then made a difference ( ideas of the people ) , but they always made the difference that had been brought about and what had been done here .
Climate change has been severely affected by the traditional rivalry of seals , because there is a cold cold here .
The proposed changes were made .
For example , Setomaal meat was skinned , but here it was simply frozen .
Where are the villages of Siberian setopes and what life is living there ? / graphics : Alari Paluends
The link with mother countries was spiritually strong , it was considered very important .
It seems to me that now this Setuony is going to return to it , it will affect them .
Those girls who have lived in families have listened to amazing stories .
Piho is thinking of the people of the Estonian delegation , who came to the Queen of Haida in early July and lived in homes for four days - J. P .
What is still here is shocking .
&quot; It is very easy to come and go , too , because the city has a wonderful location : Railway hubs and road crossing point , &quot; says Reigo Tamm , from Tapy to operan .
The city is no longer just a military capital , we have a lot of nature , sports and cultural places , and the carpet is available on every square .
The city is the tip @-@ pop !
The Linera through the White River is a small island where the Tamils tend to be hijacking .
&apos;This beautiful place does not appear on the train window &apos; , hails Reigo .
Anyone who does not fear cold water can flood in the river , because the river is full of resources .
I have been there , you can do it !
The river &apos;s water can keep a long time and just do a romantic - it can look at the river and think about life and behind it .
I have also been there with my own abilities .
Ooperisolist Tampere has , after everything else , been carried out along the river between three bridges , to get used to his aarians : &apos; That place is on the city &apos;s doorstep , no one can come to answer if I say my own stories &apos; .
&quot; The football mountains a wonderful view of the Tapy , but there are also health private players where you can drink , skip and play , for example , Sgolf playing - golf tracks have been made , chains can borrow from sports centres , &quot; Reigo is leading .
Old people are , of course , there with their own system , but I have not yet been able to play there .
Obviously , Mrs Rasmus Goll Tapale must be invited , as she has experienced a discgolfenthr and she has the chains .
Perhaps he will lend me credit .
Reigo and M√§nnikull were inextricably inseparable from the current age of self @-@ operisism .
At least during hours .
There are many tears , disappointments and you can have my sport .
Not to mention the belts and sleeping bells that have broken .
&quot; The city of the city is full of construction works , all of which is becoming unknown , &quot; says Reigo .
However , the old and tired building is a very attractive place to play oral discoveries .
I am pleased that in 2012 , the head of R.A.A.A.A.M welcomed my idea and had to make a summer theatre with his theatre .
Although this year &apos;s theatre &apos; AleCredit to Karenin &apos; has just passed , on 11 August , the railway station &apos; Ellu√§rda &apos; is in the railway station when the old building is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; From 11 to 13 August , Tapa City Days have been held , which has opened up the doors of the press building and clothes of cultural activities , including the crowd , will be the Reigo , who recommends visits to the city of 9 days .
In a tiny three @-@ house , 1 May , the museum is already a museum since 1994 .
&quot; The house is small , but there is a lot of fiddle and information , &quot; says Reigo &apos;s , which is full of the history of the city of Tapa , most of which focuses on railways and sisters .
Reigo muds that if you go through all the recommended sites in Tapal , you will be cut off a long distance , but fortunately the young city will be full of coffee .
&quot; When we sit in cats and caf√©s , we sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad , he describes him .
Educated and young soldiers coming to Tapy spend a lot of time in bottle caf√©s , sestap there is a curious feeling that you are in Estonia and your home city , but that is the interlocutor together .
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or American people .
The wars , yes , we are going a lot .
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering
Television canal bTV quoted a foreign minister who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering .
In the morning of 1 August , the police arrested people who illegally ordered a group on the Sithonia Peninsula , including two Bulgarians .
They were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulgarians were later released .
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone who is caught in a place where there is no provision for it .
Checks will continue throughout the season .
According to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
The wolves that teach the people are breaking the sheep .
Finn farmers will have to give their carpet &apos; educational material &apos; again to the wolves after year - the wolves that apparently teach the wolves have already broken a number of sheep .
This year , sheep in the Hiiu county have broken sheep three times , 23 sheep and eight have been injured , signing the Hiiu page .
Soil was only three , one year earlier , 124 .
There are also data from the Environment Agency at birth with the redundancies that the Soil junta washing sites were not born and the Hishell Council information that two wolves were fixed on the island this year .
The EESC rejected Monday &apos;s wolves in Emtens Kabina , who opened 15 sheep in the village of Kishena , and injured the 18 survivors .
In the early morning , the wolves in the village of Rehebasla were broken down as one sheep in the pasture of the country and the other , who had to be made an emergency .
Rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and a law amending plant protection products .
The amendment to the law removes the creation of a separate data collection for both GM and GM crops , using plant health records in the future .
In addition , the GM crop manager will be made obliged to have prior agreement with the designated radio @-@ based beekeeping .
Although no GM crops are cultivated in Estonia at the moment , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
This is at least as long as there are no decisions to declare the Estonian GMO @-@ free , &quot; Sigmar Suu Kyi , President of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs , said .
&quot; However , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors , in the Annex .
The draft law repeals provisions relating to the collection and treatment of GM crops and operators , introduces requirements for the management of GM crops and for the start of economic activities .
Specifically , as regards beekeeping , the GM crop growers are replaced by the obligation so far to inform beekeepers of the start of cultivation of GM crops with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeepers before starting cultivation .
The draft law has been sent to Ministries to coordinate .
All interested parties will have the opportunity to find out about this in the draft information system and , if they so wish , to present their views to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
The proposed changes will affect , in particular , the people working in the plant farming sector , beekeepers and the agricultural profession .
In the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 810 - has been authorised to grow .
However , so far no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops .
The reason is that there is no magic talk in Estonia , no European media Observatory , with a maize line mon 810 resistant .
The birds of this magic line are also being extended to the southern regions , and this is not appropriate in May to our climate conditions .
In order to be secure , the Ministry of Rural Affairs ordered research into possible contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various surapes , maize and soybean varieties grown in Estonia in 2015 and 2016 .
The samples carried out showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soybean varieties in Estonia were not included in genetically modified organisms .
The above may , in turn , conclude that in Estonia GM crops are not deliberately cultivated and that there was no accident contamination .
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United in the form of Nemanja Maticu , &quot; genius &quot;
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has paved in the form of Nemanja Maticu , &apos; genius &apos; , after having given his debate against the central player , Samlov , on Wednesday evening .
A player bought over GBP 40 million from Chell in Dublin started a last seasonal game in the UEFA Super Cupi line against Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 in the chief row , while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on attack camps .
However , having been left behind the White Year of Asia , Maticl was badly needed to bury and only have adopted 45 minutes , which , according to Mourinho , must be corrected by a firm before the Premier League season .
&quot; He needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genious nonsense - he has the courtesy of football , &quot; said Mourinho .
&quot; We will help him to get a shape as soon as possible . &quot;
Like SolSolesian , other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romeva lu Diamandouros were also inaugurated at the Aviva stage and Mourinho suddenly started to put his novel man in place at the start of the season .
The Independent public this week said that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football clubs , but he confirmed that the club had already done a &apos; excellent job &apos; by concluding contracts with three of its four priority languages .
&quot; I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four , &quot; he added .
&quot; I am even more happy if they can deliver four of the four , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
Another warm poet was delivered on the GSM Embassy on 1 August and this time in Muhus .
The honeyeside Mati Martinson , who is living in Shuves , received the first battery in SCarves , and this washing cell is flying around , leaving the washing ground and joining the Grand Use of Mullutu .
This is because SCarves does not have fruit crops , the island &apos;s voice is written .
This Tuesday , to scorn the Kurds , was a relatively late , another cucup on the fate of the accompanying person , and that was on the island of Muhu .
According to Martinson , the installation of the embassies is , in fact , an international project carried out by Aundr Leito and Ivar Ojete .
Solu was supplied by a cutshell called Mati GSM embassy in Shuves Turkey .
&quot; His activities are all on the internet : How he went to Spain in winter , back in the German @-@ Polish border fleet for a long time , and then Saaremaa came , Martinson spoke .
British inventor &apos;s ability to install microchips in his own body to get access to handing @-@ hand houses and cars
The British inventor received the first person in a country to be installed microchip so that he can only open his own edge , get to office and even launch a car .
33 @-@ year @-@ old Steven Northam children are tempted to install a small chip between their fingers and their chargers and now offer this service to businesses and private individuals who wish to make their lives easier through their own company , through BioTeq .
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson , the Queestesics of the Royal hospital of Hampshire in Hants , who is a county of Winchester , to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards .
Technology resembles the microchip installed on cats and cogs , and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure .
The Northam company will also replace the songs of houses and cars so that they can be compatible with the chip , asking for one snow GBP 300 .
This child &apos;s father has been installed in his marriage , both at home and in his car BMW Z4 , which will start when he has his hand in the rol .
The White House &apos;s audit cost to taxpayers of thousands
According to military documents printed in the magazine , the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicopter last month to the southern American production event cost taxpayers as much as USD 24 000 .
The green and white colour Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , termed Marine One , during President &apos;s office , was the central figure of the event in the American construction programmes in White Main on 17 July .
President Donald Trump , senior officials of the White House , said industrial products from all 50 countries during his movement .
The helicopter built in Connecticutis was sponsored with a banner , a fire @-@ fighting car from Wisconten and a pallet made in Miscellub .
According to the documents of Mrs Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX @-@ 1 ) , the chief cabinet responsible for the operation of HeliCopter , asked the HeliCopter to have a military helicopter presence at a little 36 hours before the helicopter for the &apos; extraordinary &apos; event in the southern Council .
&apos;I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high @-@ profile event , &apos; said HX @-@ 1 komand√∂r a day before the event was launched in an e @-@ mail , a Deputy officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the southern horror on 17 July morning at 7 : 00 , and will remain , the 15.00 event until the same night , between 18 and 21 .
It was included that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed , a second epathy is needed because of the restrictions on working time .
The original flight team was at helicopter during the event and the chief armier security team remained close to the aircraft throughout the period of stay on the ground .
The documents provided by the magazine were not possible to read whether or not the second eyearpathy was ultimately needed .
The Hatch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political ends .
The documents show that HMX @-@ 1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; We asked whether this would violate Hatch &apos;s law and we were told that &apos; the commander wrote &apos; .
&apos;You seem to have no choice , &apos; answered the Deputy Minister for the lead officers .
The White House declared the &apos; American &apos; event to be a formal event and the Hatch law would not have covered it .
But even official events have political undertones .
The President backed the efforts of the Health Reform at the time in the Senate and praised attempts to keep government regulations in check .
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force for political gain is not a new phenomenon .
The Presidents must use them to travel .
However , the requirement to use them purely photographic is unusual .
The Trump was brought to the attention in February when , at his first campaign event in Floridas Melbourne , he was a president flight to the background , and he spends Twitter &apos;s account on messages that complain about how his predecessor used his flight .
&quot; White l Mal is very pleased with the exhibition &quot; made in America , where products were represented in all 50 countries made up of American workers from American materials , &quot; said conscientiously , Lindsay Walters , the spokesman of the White House .
HMX @-@ 1 teams often carry out tests around Washington and the southern horror to get the United States President &apos;s White house off with a centimetres .
When the Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , the HMX @-@ 1 White House ordered 58 samples .
According to the Commissioner , the flight flight flight to the &apos; American &apos; flight crew was considered to be the norm for the monthly study flights .
The first armier helicopter flying for &apos; non @-@ President &apos; missions , in addition to 11 hours later .
According to the White House , no other actor in this event was slashing the taxpayers &apos; wallets .
According to Sikorsky , the company was not involved in carrying out filtering on the southern horror .
HMX @-@ 1 will not maintain the budgetary documents of President flights and it will be difficult to identify the exact costs of the event .
However , the Ministry of Defence , at the hourly prices for the financial year 2017 , has the VH @-@ 3D compensatory rate of USD 24 380 per hour .
The primary documents referred to the flight extension of its base from the seafood de Quantico airport Virginia to 30 minutes in both directions .
The White House claims that the actual cost of using helicopter is well below that amount .
&quot; It is very misleading to calculate taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated reimbursement rates , &quot; said Walters .
&quot; These estimates of compensation include staff , maintenance and many other irrevocable expenditure , which will be taken into account for annual appropriations . &quot;
According to the 2015 Pebei study , the Ministry of Defence does not include cost of staff , but it covers fuel , maintenance and contract costs .
Sean Sharier , former journalist of the White House , defended the use of helicopter at that time at the event .
&apos;The point is to show things made in America this week , &apos; Sstoper said .
&quot; And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticuti are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds , if not even thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
And I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on .
So it is right , of course , to highlight this . &quot;
It is not clear whether the Trump was involved in the deployment of a helicopter in the southern horror , or not , but he was hiding behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
In White Main , the Trump Sikorsky was addressing representatives by handing out media publications on company products in his personal aircraft fleet .
&apos;I know Sikorskis very well , &apos; said the President , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .
Gari ≈†adeiko - Both arrived in peace and joy
In 2011 , MMil Daetis hit Sadeikot in the last area , 800 m drinks were booked by footwear and a stadium was taken away with a weed .
Just before that , he had received zero on China &apos;s limbo @-@ jumping .
The Helsinki Helsinki System in 2012 was the victim of cheap injuries , but he received 1013 items 23 in London .
However , I have continued to do so .
After the opening day 2013 , Moscow MF received a &quot; grandfather &quot; injury in Estonia on a long @-@ distance basis .
Two years later , he became the 15th seat of Beijing and was in the Olympic Games , but that was more than what he wanted to see the athletes disappointed .
Sadeiko was only a bubble through the most heavy cab , when the outcome of the Amsterdam Embassy was not recorded at the beginning .
I would just like to put together one proper multilogue once .
Once &apos; , sprayed Sadeiko .
Worse still lies ahead : A month later , his Olympic contest in Rios was broken down by the first obstacle to the Duos Duma .
Time had to be taken down - was it necessary to continue with the seven competition at all ?
Is it all worth the effort of two days ?
You thought a long time , but found peace .
I had to think twice !
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
Fortunately , there was time to treat ourselves all and to think about it head on .
&apos;You know that I am not putting a candle on the picture &apos; , ≈†adeiko is talking about his self @-@ cleansing .
I was able to turn a clean page and move on with a new momentum .
Treener Anne hill said it was very difficult to look at the suffering of negligence , but he realised that , above all , the sportsman himself had to get to the bottom .
After all , he had been so repressed by everyone .
It was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; The Gard said that he is not giving up and he wants to prove what he is worth , says remember .
Now it is going to have some kind of peace .
It is doing so to joy .
The contest came back in May when the ≈†adeiko set 6280 points at the GFjellzitself &apos;s multi @-@ competition .
In a high level competition , he improved his personal top class with almost a metre ( 13.89 ) and drinks a record @-@ close @-@ time barrier .
Then there was a multicompetitive feeling that it was not at all a sleep of ability , but only a hunger in the first competition .
She has been instructed for years by Nagorno @-@ Dess that Sadeiko is a Muslim student .
She is ready to be sportsman ; she is well trained .
If something does a problem or is wrong , then he says it immediately .
He feels his own body and he is confident in his sense .
That is what we must do .
I cannot say what exactly must and will follow .
The new approach has also been found in the ≈†adeiko .
&apos;I am not the one who makes the best of the trend &apos; , he says and says that it is most important to have the right sense , because it also provides a good result .
Baby walkers of young children are happy to do so .
The good emotion has also offered the words of close relatives to the ≈†adesian Chamber .
Both his former teacher , Maris hill and sister Grete , recently became grandparents and has received support from new citizens of weather .
&apos;It has been rather interesting &apos; , says Sadeiko .
One alcohol whose drinking equals the brain &apos; training &apos; .
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is a suisa of such a great wine game that he believes that wine can teach the brain better than any other thing in the world .
Sheperd is a neuroscientist of Yale University .
His message is not about alcohol , or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
When we sleep , wine was complicated by tailing , enjoying it and perceived the aftertaste , we are putting our brain on work to create a taste for wine .
In the words of Sheperd , the bovine olecules do not actually contain taste , but taste arises from the way wine stimulates amuscles .
He will set out how the brain &apos; sees &apos; colours &apos; .
&quot; Taste is not wine ; taste creates wine as a sweet , &quot; says Sheperd .
Things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , the number of our age , our summer and even the coal produced by man .
Sheperd , of course , manes that wine is not a full Jewish .
&apos;There must be more &apos; , he says .
If you are too big a longer , the system will be overloaded .
Excess wine drinking can do no harm to the brain , but rather to the brain - according to a study in 2004 , people who drink more than three glass products with wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity .
10 % less pay for ICT workers in Estonia than colleagues
Figures from the staff search company fund reveal that 10 % of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive lower salaries than colleagues .
The 10 % pay gap is between men and women , writes the portal Geenius .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector &apos;s recruitment study .
A total of 8 577 posts was examined .
63 % of posts were employed by men .
&quot; Although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and that the rest of businesses considered that there is no pay gap , in reality , the average annual salary of men is 10 % higher than that of women and men aged 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said Foncrates analysts Ilmar Nordic .
&quot; Narcos &quot; 3rd season advertising clip : Now that Pablo Escobar has gone , Netflix hittsars is at the heart of Cali cartel .
Despite the fact that the killer of Pablo Escobari was exposed in the second season of the &apos; Narcos &apos; , the &apos; Netflix &apos; sari is far from over .
The third and fourth season has been confirmed by the quota @-@ handling service and the first has already been produced by a clip of advertising that is stranglehold the sardines .
In the third season , DEA will turn its attention to the most rich drug trafficking organisation in the world - the Cali cartel .
They are acting under the leadership of four powerful Christian fathers , such as Foroul 500 companies , simply with more bribery to the government and more violent acts .
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is a leader of the cartel , with Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) its brain , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) , leading links with Mexico and Chepe Santa≈Ñski London ( Pepe Rapazote ) in New York .
The advertised advertising clip sees Pedro Pascali return to Javier Penana as a person recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement assistance in the war against drugs .
Other new players include Matias Varela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt Whell , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .
The third season of the &apos; Narcos &apos; will be the beginning of a &apos; open &apos; on 1 September .
According to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
On Wednesday , the head of the UN mission for Afghanistan said that elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
Nicholas Haysom , head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , said that hundreds of women stand for election to local councils , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; It is not possible to overstate the importance of women &apos;s role , &quot; he said in his statement on Wednesday .
Elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
The local council elections in Afghanistan and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
The Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coincides with the transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
This year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is given calmly to one democratically elected government to the next .
According to Mr Haysom , women &apos;s strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan is increasing .
According to the independent Election Commission in Afghanistan , 1.2 million people registered in 3.6 million registered voters are women .
The joy of sharing is making every thing more acute , both for large and small .
There is always too little common time , but the trend with the paste is a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
And what a convenient solution - wherever you were sleep in the summer , live animals are always on the ball and come out with your fine voice with an impatient reminder : &apos; Let us now also move to a trenchment &apos; .
Aelta insulation - It is a very good thing to have a normal gold game or a flag on the coast .
A piece is the foundation for persisting in the shape of footwear and tuna - who would then like to take the form of a sandbelt stunned over the summer ?
It is wonderful to use children instead of a chicken !
Firstly , it is secure and convenient , and the weight is gradually increasing at the same pace as the training staff .
The arrived can also make villages with quite a large number of children .
The child is training a balance , counts the flames and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
Larger children can , at the same time , make their own villages .
The extent of the movement lies in the scarcity of land and in the wolling of hands .
The finger at the fingers directly , the miniabally of the ball , is being properly detained .
A child can read the flames and feel like a lecturer .
The planet is an extremely exciting but hopeless exercise for the child .
But it is easy to do it .
Play @-@ plank : Take a long planguColonn to nip through .
In fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much more amusing to do when , in the meantime , a friend can hand his hand .
If you add the burden , you can keep a planade , you can keep a little on the market , and you can walk around it .
More importantly , a parent can be planted on the hip of a child , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
While the crabs join the sand , the rock , the ash and the cane meat burden , such as the infection , are becoming trickians .
The child walks to the shoes so that his body is distributed equally and out of hand .
For security , you can keep your hands closed .
All the legs and the wool walks up directly .
The pump can fly , bury , strike a balance and be a matter of urgency .
A little lecturer &apos;s life is an exhortation if he gets little in every fire .
The extra burden is being put before the feet .
Check that the back door would remain in a neutral position .
Children themselves have a lot more to do with choppressed meat in a couple and a plate .
A bull with a hand and a wedding .
After the child &apos;s safety , the burst , and the hotel in a neutral position .
The favourite and big fun of all children !
The elderly , meanwhile , have a truly effective whole body trend .
The sports tools were Ott ( 10 ) , S√§de ( 8 ) , luck ( 4 ) .
From the Philippines to the heart of mopeds
The workshops that have been bundled from the tour are the summer class , which has become a lump product in recent years , even though one in the right summer hitor has had to hang the hand and which traders have been able to display a price label , despite its modest origin .
A piece of rubbish @-@ red cows is probably one of the things that has existed once in the life of the law and which has not been aroused with particular emotion .
That is simply there and , if there is no , there is nothing at all .
Now , however , the beer bags are going to be making a real victory , and mopedestrian planters have replaced their mushrooms by summer months against simple copies of red bags .
This is not only a coastal colony , but today it is just as popular as a street , and older women are even filling it in office .
However , it is worth making it clear here before the overruns are sitting in the summer or whether it is worth postponing the stamp and the laptops to a little more official .
However , the wealth of tolerance has made the headlines a real love of women in the summer .
For example , when we read foreign momotives , the first thing is that moeghurers are bringing their holidays to the local market as the first thing , and buying some beer bags , then wearing the truck of whole holiday time , and this is in a place of coastline , in the market and also as a friend on the city .
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a bigger wolf and sell or give them to their loyal readers .
It is worth noting , however , that there is a demand among readers for women ( and men ! ) in the real world to be able to attract a fisherman to each other in order to become a happy owner of some homes .
In some ways , this madness is also understandable , because the rare are the times when , in the fashionable yesterday , some of the things brought into the lurch have been able to buy for just a few tens of euros .
It is true that white traders have also discovered a simple way of earning money here , and so more luxury brands sell them for a few hundred or a dozen or a thousand euros .
Obviously , in order to prevent richer customers from feeling easy to die , who proclaim with some cheap bags .
For example , it is possible to buy a hand hand over EUR 1 000 in Dolce &amp; Gabon .
However , for the interpretation of Changel bregkot , a sum of EUR 6 000 could be found in the circulation .
Unlike most motives , however , the lotteries do not inherit at all with some great mosques , but their story began in a far more distant way .
It is that the beer bags are allegedly coming far from the Philippines , where they have been wearing them wide .
The bunch of rubbish bags is there , particularly export trading and local relocations are very often not seen anywhere .
Admittedly , the therapeutic technique dates back to the 14th century and is relatively sardous with normal corps .
However , as the beer does not need to be as hard red as corps , they will be accompanied by muscles and other materials that make the copper more personalised and , by extension , more reactive .
For example , recently , there are particularly trendy dogs , where paints or skin ckers have been laid in .
However , the full print can be sent by the addicts , in particular , to the actor , Jane Birkini , the biggest bundled hand @-@ to @-@ shoulder game , which had not been seen before .
It was precisely that she sued the House of Translation with all sorts of clothing packages and not even had to go to the Cannes Film Festival a great deal .
However , today &apos;s popularity of the applicants does not play a smaller role in ensuring them is a hot head and , unlike all other summer productions , does not have to care for them with special funds , but it also deprives water and wet .
As is still the case with the &apos; trendy robbery &apos; initiatives , apart from classical navy , the brands have come out with all possible interpretations .
For example , if they want to be able to obtain a hardliner @-@ red clothing injection or a little bit of a boom .
It is worth remembering , however , that the classic beer will never be a mosque , but a beer @-@ flu .
But what is the classical beer , then ?
For centuries now , a cocktail of beer has been classified as &apos; closed &apos; , which resembles a flat from its style , is on the ice and is short , as are beers , cripounds .

GMB concerns the investment at McVitie &apos;s Glasgow plant
The company expects the managers of the mature producer and McVitie to confirm long @-@ term production plans at the company &apos;s Glasgow plant .
According to GMB Scotland , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment .
More than 500 people are employed in Hobnobsi and rich knowledge of the mature and other products .
McVitie &apos;s owner Plas said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years .
There were workers and trade union leaders who were paid there &apos; are the first to hear &apos; when something changes in the operation of the factory change .
In a letter sent to the company &apos;s host , GMB Scotland company McVitie called on to &apos; allay the concerns about the lack of funding for modernising production lines &apos; .
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said : &apos; The fact that we do not get clarity from the chief executive on the customs / VIS business needs and the future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned .
Several generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is largely made up of people from the local community and the Glasgow surrounding the community , which is an essential pillar for ensuring proper employment in a region with high unemployment and social housing .
Therefore , in the interests of jobs , wages and welfare in the eastern part of Glasgow , Brexti , the rise in living costs and the constant fall in production , a thriving production company in McVitie needs . &quot;
The Pladise representative said : &apos; The site of the customs was only written from the GMB Scott yesterday and the company responds directly to him because we value active engagement with workers and trade union representatives .
Two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers in Rabat and the representatives of the GMB , which openly discussed a number of issues .
We then discussed with workers that , like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are reviewing our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness .
He added : &apos; In recent years we have invested over GBP 5 million on the site of Customs , most of which went to production lines and to improve procedures .
We fully understand the heritage of customs as a production object and , if there were any changes to the activities of the object , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach to Neyra ?
La li can regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not give up in its efforts to attract Neymar to his ranks by offering an offer of GBP 189 million to be stolen , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquest ?
This bold approach has opened summer as a transitional window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of buying over the last season with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester Unitetle for GBP 89 million .
Once the transition is completed , Neyra will become the world &apos;s most expensive player and also the most paid professional sportsman in the world who will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from GPS .
Barcelona is also a source of concern , both because of the approach and the breaking down of Neyra , although the source close to the Caelic leadership confirms that the club has always been the best care for football since its arrival in Santoise in 2013 .
But did the PSG President warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago ?
When Manchester City showed interest in the conclusion of the Blair Matutis Agreement in 2014 , the Nasser Al @-@ Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who think about recruiting some of the best players in the PSG .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they are concerned about some of our players , we are going to accept them and contact them , &quot; said Al @-@ Khelaif .
&quot; We respect all clubs .
But if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appears to have moved beyond this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the PSG central player , Marco Verratti .
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow an Italian to leave , under any circumstances , and that Barcelona could be a setback as a result of this interest , removing one of its precious assets in the form of Neyra .

&quot; It is our vision for the future : Building bridges , not borders , &quot; she stressed .
According to Varadkari , Britain would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as this cannot be achieved , it will remain part of the European single market .
It would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
Another way to make Britain &apos;s departure smoother would be to create a European Union @-@ United Kingdom Customs Union , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
Noting that there was such an agreement with Turkey , Varadkar said : &apos; We could certainly have this with Britain . &apos;
The alternative to this would be a return to customs points , which would declare historical division and political failure .
&apos;To bring about trade , prosperity and peace &apos; said the Irish Prime Minister .
He called Brexitit a &apos; challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that the result could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland .
The Irish Prime Minister met leaders of the main Irish parties when visiting Belfast .
