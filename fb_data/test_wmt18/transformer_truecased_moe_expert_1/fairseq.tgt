four members of the Group of Cape Verde were detained in Estonia and Spain .
according to Mr Posselt , in Spain , the police detained the so @-@ called leader of the group of Cape Verde , in charge of the Estonian alliance , S@@ lava Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ n , who is known in the criminal world as S@@ lava K@@ eme@@ ro@@ v@@ ski .
in Spain , Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch was arrested by a court .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects who were detained in Estonia .
it is suspected that these are the criminal members of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde &apos; Community aged between 27 and 57 years old , who are committing mainly drug crimes .
in the province of M@@ alaga in Spain , Mi@@ ja@@ v , the alleged head of the criminal organisation was detained .
in Estonia , three men were held as suspects , one of which is collected according to data and the two are members of the criminal organisation .
the data collected indicates that there were clearly assigned tasks and roles in the criminal community .
the criminal organisation of the criminal organisation was aimed at committing drug crimes and thereby generating criminal proceeds , &quot; commented the head of the pre @-@ trial proceedings in criminal matters , the Public Prosecutor , Va@@ hur Ver@@ te .
&quot; we shall not rule out that the circle of suspects in this criminal case will increase &quot; added to the Prosecutor &apos;s .
these are people who have previously become interested in law enforcement agencies , and some of them have been punished for the crime of nar@@ co@@ tics .
Mrs Ver@@ te stressed that cooperation with my Spanish counterparts has been high on the agenda throughout the course of the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of the cooperation , &quot;
the head of the General Criminal Police Service , ago Le@@ is , said that the de@@ ten@@ tions were preceded by a preliminary investigation of almost one and a half years .
&quot; in the first half of the week , a long @-@ standing job was realised and , at the same time , we observed the suspi@@ cious crimes in Estonia and Spain , &quot;
in the Le@@ is , the central criminal police officers were instrumental in the detention of Spain .
for years now , we have had good contact and understanding from one another with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are yet another message to the perpetrators that we can also get them from the other side of Europe . &quot;
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that , in the free stay , those suspected of a suspect can continue to commit new crimes , and the prosecution office requested their arrest and approved by the court .
a man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
in order to ensure that confiscation is carried out , there are seiz@@ ures of property , vehicles and cash .
the preliminary proceedings of the Criminal Court are conducted by the Office of the Police for organised crimes of the Central Criminal Police and are led by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the City Court in Tallinn sentenced S@@ lava Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch in 2005 to blackmail and punished him by five years in prison .
in the mid @-@ last decade , the Al@@ le@@ vit@@ v Al@@ sa@@ r , Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v , was considered the second most important man in the world , following the then Man@@ or of the K@@ aval@@ or .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch from Cape Verde has highlighted the Estonian alliance in the early 1990s , when he began to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
it is claimed that he taxed tax@@ i drivers and prostitu@@ tes operating in different ho@@ tels and ordered a monthly ro@@ of tax on business@@ men .
international joint operations , confiscation of proceeds of crime and the court judgments that have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest court decisions , the eight indic@@ tees of the so @-@ called &apos; D@@ ik@@ activist &apos; criminal association , who were confis@@ cated on the proceeds of crime by â‚¬ 80 000 , or the sentence against nine individuals in 2006 , were created by Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v , a criminal organisation aimed at illegal trade in illegal cigarettes and committing crimes against human trafficking in East Vir@@ g@@ land and southern Estonia .
the proceeds from the collected crime amount to almost EUR 71 500 .
in these criminal cases , progress has been made by the police officers to exchange information and prosecutors on a daily basis with their colleagues in the field of external affairs , and , if necessary , to carry out proceedings in any European Union country .
civil Rights group war@@ ns against travelling to MSY
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ cement of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ ACP ) has warned the people of Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ tic appeal against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state .
the group statement states : &apos; the NA@@ ACP travel link issued for the State of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ c shall apply until 28 August 2017 , calls on all non @-@ American travellers , visitors and sou@@ ls to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the whole state , given the whole range of no@@ vel@@ ty @-@ based racial events that have been occurring in the state and are also pointed out at the recent state of state at the time . &apos;
in the NA@@ ACP , the group was urged to issue a travel warning both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it more difficult to obtain court cases involving discrimination , and also the fact that the objectives of the state &apos;s law enforcement are , in large measure , unequal in nature .
&quot; the rights of citizens are being violated .
they are caught for their colour of their ba@@ it , beaten or killed , &quot; said R@@ od Cha@@ pel , President of NA@@ ACP Mis@@ s@@ our , to The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&quot; we have never been so compla@@ cent . &quot;
this is the first warning to be issued by an organisation for a US state .
the group referred to events such as racial insul@@ ts against black students in the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of S@@ and@@ ers , a 28 @-@ year @-@ old black bo@@ y from T@@ en@@ nes@@ see .
S@@ and@@ ers died in suspi@@ cious circumstances at the beginning of this year after having been able to cross through the state in a flight from ben@@ kel and the Mis@@ s@@ our police took him to arrest without being charged with a crime .
in addition , a note refers to a recent report compiled by the Chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our , which shows that in the state , the cars of black drivers are less likely to be stopped than pri@@ es@@ ts .
&quot; the comment is intended to make people aware and to warn their families , friends and collabor@@ ators of what can happen in Mis@@ s@@ our , &quot; said Mr Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people must be prepared , whether this means taking money away from the top of the day or informing their relatives that they are passing through the state . &quot;
on the basis of the latest information from the programme for information on hate crime by F@@ B@@ I , 100 hate crime cases were recorded in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ a in 2015 , which places the state in a cross @-@ section 16@@ th place in the number of offences similar to the state .
the travel warning is also a response to the new Mis@@ s@@ our law , which makes it difficult to su@@ e the company against the discrimination in the search for housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( EC@@ EC ) , Mexico , had previously issued travel concerns for T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona , after these states adopted immigration laws that obliged local authorities to arrest people for infringements of immigration , as the AC@@ L@@ U says that it will increase the racial profiling .
normally , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs against other countries , but recently , interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or a li@@ ver bur@@ ner , may be caused by five different diseases ranging from A , B , C , D and E he@@ pati@@ tis .
all these vir@@ uses are a cause of acute fla@@ x .
however , with a bad cost , the he@@ pati@@ tis B and C are chronic , which can continue to develop the li@@ p , that is to say , the li@@ ver and the pay cancer .
the epidemi@@ ology ap@@ ples of health advis@@ or , Ku@@ cro@@ wn , tells us that the acute he@@ pati@@ tis disease phenomenon is the same for all types of vegetable species - p@@ ound disease , fa@@ ti@@ gue , ti@@ gue , birth , o@@ es@@ tation , s@@ oul , de@@ fa@@ mation , mal@@ al emissions , black horse mackerel , meat and pas@@ ta , and meat and pig@@ meat , and meat and mass stra@@ h .
the last disease is also the result of the fol@@ k name of the li@@ ver &apos;s disease .
children can undergo he@@ pati@@ tis without any disease .
different types of organic combustion can only be identified on the basis of data from a laboratory study .
B@@ esi@@ ver he@@ pati@@ tis can pass on to chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and run for decades without symptoms , which means that a person may not know anything about a disease that is harmful to his or her harmful li@@ ver .
the audi@@ o Ku@@ tsa@@ r highlights various forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their course of action in detail .
one he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread from a sick to human and infec@@ t us when eating contaminated food or drinking water or drinking water , via pigs , from be@@ ach , from infected humans to be@@ aches , from farm to food , from trees , from farm to maize , from di@@ r@@ ty to wood , from di@@ r@@ ty to per@@ me@@ ation and from drug consumption .
a he@@ pati@@ tis was a risk of infection - that is to say , the family and carers of the disease , people suffering from chronic li@@ ver diseases , sex with an infection , sex men with men , drug addi@@ cts , travellers with he@@ pati@@ tis high @-@ quality countries visiting travellers .
F@@ ever can be prevented by vaccination , in particular , by recommending vaccination for people travelling to a great extent and for those at He@@ pati@@ tis A .
in addition , it is important to meet the hygiene requirements on a daily basis : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands before using food to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading to the patient when she comes into contact with blood , to in@@ ject drugs , to bathing pa@@ tho@@ gen , to h@@ ire , to use blood @-@ contaminated di@@ ch@@ ot@@ ins ( too@@ th@@ p@@ aste , tu@@ als ) , to the blood of the donor , to treat he@@ pati@@ tis ac@@ he@@ pati@@ tis ac@@ he@@ pati@@ tis ac@@ e@@ tal and to sex fo@@ e@@ tal fo@@ e@@ tal fo@@ e@@ tal fo@@ e@@ tal fo@@ e@@ tal / inf@@ ant mor@@ ant fo@@ e@@ tal .
the he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ in@@ age group includes in@@ ject drug addi@@ cts , sexual partners of infected people , sex men with honey sex women , new born babies of infected mother , family members and carers , health care , workers and police officers , and travellers visiting countries with he@@ pati@@ tis B with high diseases .
in order to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis b , people can be vacc@@ inated ; in particular , it is advisable to vacc@@ in@@ ate people at risk , as well as persons suffering from chronic diseases , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
other preventive measures for he@@ pati@@ tis are : avoiding the use of alien and man@@ y@@ ro@@ y@@ l devices , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ gic @-@ ch@@ ro@@ sis , ab@@ y@@ tation and honour donation , and using con@@ do@@ es@@ c@@ oma in dangerous sex of infections or avoiding sexual risk @-@ taking .
vaccination against pati@@ tis b is part of the National immun@@ isation Scheme in Estonia and is free of charge for children .
He@@ pati@@ tis C mix@@ tures are spreading to a patient when she comes into contact with the blood , to in@@ ject drugs , to bathing , to h@@ ire h@@ our@@ ly , to use blood @-@ contaminated di@@ ch@@ es@@ hal@@ tation , to sex with an he@@ pati@@ tis agent and to a he@@ pati@@ tis suff@@ e@@ rer &apos;s syn@@ ch@@ bis@@ ine / inf@@ anti@@ qu@@ er .
the he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ in@@ age group includes in@@ ject drug addi@@ cts , sexual partners of infected people , sex men with honey sex sex , new HIV syn@@ di@@ cate honey , family and carers of infected mother , health and other body flu@@ ids , health care , workers and rescu@@ ers , HIV @-@ infected persons and high @-@ health @-@ borne travellers and travellers visiting countries with high levels of he@@ pati@@ tis C .
a measure to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis C is : avoiding the use of alien and man@@ tic tools , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ gic @-@ ch@@ ro@@ sis , ab@@ y@@ tation and honour donation , and using con@@ dom in cases of hazardous mix@@ tures of infection .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
he@@ pati@@ tis D is causing a he@@ pati@@ tis virus which is ac@@ u@@ tely contained in the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
as a result , there is a D he@@ pati@@ tis F@@ e@@ ar in the form of he@@ pati@@ tis B or super@@ inf@@ er he@@ pati@@ tis B on chronic he@@ pati@@ tis .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses are spreading in exposure to blood and other body flu@@ ids , contaminated with sy@@ no@@ ses , sexu@@ ally and rarely infected animals .
He@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis at risk is the result of chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B virus and people who do not contain he@@ pati@@ tis B .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination with a he@@ pati@@ tis V vaccine , which also protects people from infection with he@@ pati@@ tis D .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading fe@@ eds on the ver@@ se sl@@ ur@@ ry of drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , donation with blood , open @-@ hand heart stal@@ ls and more infected animals .
passengers may be infected with the high levels of he@@ pati@@ tis E in the countries .
the measures to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis are compliance with the hygiene requirements : was@@ hing or dis@@ infec@@ ting hands after coping in the ro@@ d , before eating and c@@ oo@@ king , after care for the sick .
fruit and vegetables are for@@ given before consumption , and to avoid eating little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , to drink only safe drinking water and to avoid drug consumption .
although at the last round , competitors were testing four @-@ fold Olympic winners to go out of the way , the F@@ ara@@ h , 34 years old , found power at the end row and won 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
the F@@ ara@@ h did not think long enough to take the lion &apos;s path after the fin@@ i@@ ler along the road to his wife , T@@ ania , and children .
this was a particular moment for me .
I am very much giving my family my own initiative .
they were on a wonderful course , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h for journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h is targeting the fifth edition of the prize in London , with an increasing budget of 5 000 and 10 000 metres of the current gold heading .
everything is possible if there is faith in it .
despite the title , Mrs O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor@@ i is summer in &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , the remarkable story of the G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t &apos;s mas@@ ter@@ piece , the book of A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer , is tri@@ ggering a work of art from scra@@ tch to much deeper into the 20th century and the early 20th century in Vienna .
but in more depth , in history .
a le@@ th@@ al information on the car would have the effect of a cut in the North stra@@ w , a narro@@ wer wh@@ im , would have a cli@@ ent on an exceptional portfolio allowed in the title .
at present , there are two books between the cha@@ mbers of the G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t and his pain@@ ting , the story of A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , and a much larger and more comprehensive newspaper book from the distinguished Jewish families and the German occupation , with its follow @-@ up effects in Austria .
the first third of the book in the middle of a dra@@ con@@ ian Vienna , who has become a cultural life in the middle of a w@@ ed@@ ding trial and who himself has been in the capital city of Austria , can hardly imagine how , over a hundred years ago , she went around life in R@@ us@@ st@@ ras@@ s or how , in the Cen@@ tr@@ ali ca@@ ke , all the heads fell when the customer was in .
the concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the rich@@ est cities of Europe and , seeing the name that we know in the book , seemed to have felt more cul@@ turally .
however , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a town where he pul@@ led in an inde@@ termin@@ ate piece of guilt and was the highest level of su@@ ici@@ des in Europe is , as if nothing else , conducive to the development of the story .
or perhaps , however , every couple of couples also take a fair line adds colour to the life of culture in Vienna at the start of the 20th century .
the dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna has explo@@ ded , turning into the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
the timing exchange was almost one in ten people in Vienna .
visitors were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time the hel@@ ple@@ ss for A@@ dele was the tw@@ et of two times the Czech Republic sugar mag@@ na@@ di Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch and the Kli@@ m@@ t were represented for his famous pain@@ ting , his father has already become the seventh @-@ largest bank bank in the H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg E@@ mp@@ ire .
however , the whole life of the gla@@ ci@@ er , where he was famous , was not drawn .
if you look at &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; , you cannot believe that , at the end of life , this great anti@@ qu@@ ated anti @-@ nationalism and dre@@ am@@ t of a journey from the air to the Soviet Union .
in 19@@ 0@@ 3 , when Mr B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his wife &apos;s portfolio from Kli@@ m@@ book , the last moment &apos;s bul@@ l @-@ man@@ ner in Vienna was a ma@@ ge@@ y@@ el@@ der .
the cli@@ m@@ t ordered the price at the time of USD 4 000 per li@@ tre , a quarter of the price of a good house of house .
the fact that , in some of the portfolio cases , a master &apos;s mo@@ del@@ le was suspected , did not discourage sugar mag@@ na@@ te .
as far as the brain is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship that has been established in the course of the work with the ar@@ tist continued to work until the end of life .
Ms Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - &apos; in Da@@ am gold .
G@@ usta@@ m@@ t &apos;s mas@@ ter@@ piece , A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri port@@ m , a special story &quot; , Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , Al@@ do R@@ and@@ maa translated from English .
just before the start of the work with A@@ dele@@ ga , the Kli@@ m@@ t had been in San V@@ ita@@ le , and the researchers believe that it was there that the g@@ ul@@ ty mo@@ sa@@ ic countries from the spring The@@ o@@ dor@@ a gave the arts the idea of making a gol@@ den portfolio from A@@ dele@@ ree a a pa@@ tho@@ red mo@@ sa@@ i@@ lic .
the customer was presented in his &quot; Da@@ ami gold &quot; in Vienna in 19@@ 08 and at around the same time ( between 19@@ 07 and 19@@ 08 ) , was born in another gol@@ den land , &quot; The S@@ vel@@ lus &quot; .
the artists did not notice the simil@@ arity of two women .
what about the story of Hitler ?
&quot; I think I owe him to remember my friend Kli@@ m@@ t to make his hand to the public , &quot; wrote to him B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer a few years after leaving a man ( Kli@@ m@@ t died in February 19@@ 18 ) to the Director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere M@@ use@@ um and he wanted to see their family Kli@@ m@@ mu@@ ti go to M@@ use@@ um and he wanted to see their cli@@ m@@ our .
six years before the death of , the customer was a mar@@ ath@@ on from A@@ dele@@ st .
in his testa@@ ment ( A@@ dele left in February 19@@ 25 ) , he also asked that her wife leave two sports courses and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t birds to the Austrian city of Gal@@ way .
he gave his true testi@@ monies to Mari@@ ana and Lu@@ ves .
one year after the customer had finished the &apos; Austrian Mon@@ a lisa &apos; , Vi@@ in Ka@@ ath had attempted access to A@@ ka@@ de@@ mine by Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , 17 years old , but failed the drawing period .
although sometimes the reason for Hitler &apos;s late anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is that the Jewish profes@@ sors did not accept him in the A@@ ca@@ de@@ my , no one of his ex@@ cus@@ ers was actually a ha@@ bit .
in any case , the task of Austrian Gal@@ er , referred to in Maria testa@@ ment , had changed considerably by 19@@ 39 , had become important in finding work for the benefit of the women in the G@@ os@@ p@@ here in the rich Jewish arts in Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal wealth of art was also a match for some of the work he has been at home , but not for the Kli@@ m@@ t .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the kidna@@ pping of the arts of the Naz@@ is , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute began between the he@@ ir from the Austrian Government and B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ mi@@ r .
all that remains is that , if the &apos; S@@ no@@ vel@@ anism &apos; sees &apos; in Vienna in Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle , the &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; described by A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer must be viewed in New York &apos;s Ne@@ ue Gal@@ way .
and before Vienna , it was also possible to read through the aforementioned book .
even if you do not intend to look at the Kli@@ m@@ t &apos;s work , because my emo@@ tion , at least , after the closure of the book , was more the subject of na@@ ir and ha@@ ir than the bu@@ cket and the mode@@ ll of A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer , sold for USD 135 million .
so , not so much a portfolio , but rather a very moving story of a marriage - a family .
in a significant way , events facilitated the orientation of the relatives of the Bauer who was brought into the book at the beginning .
the 17 @-@ year @-@ old sw@@ im@@ mer in Canada was very close to Estonia &apos;s record
in their quest for life , gold was the personal record of 200 m por@@ k sw@@ im@@ ming in the sw@@ im@@ ming areas of 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 .
the label comes from a 17 @-@ year @-@ old pi@@ pe time , when the Canadian Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship was awarded a maximum of 16.@@ 58 , the Pri@@ it A@@ av@@ iku &apos;s U@@ ju@@ mis@@ ki@@ o bloc .
gold ended , in other words , by the end of the calendar , &apos; A &apos; .
in the chair , he passed the distance from 2.@@ 68 to 2.@@ 76 , and achieved a good seventh position with a new powerful top @-@ level mark .
A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or@@ is of the Estonian record ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) in the Gulf of Co@@ sta@@ g left a little over half a second .
in Estonia &apos;s ranking of all history gold rose third and its fresh personal top @-@ down is the fifth outcome of all the times in Estonia .
the young hope for the future is to start a further 100 m , 200 m and 400 m@@ igh@@ ty in the Canadian football champi@@ on@@ ships , and to wage 200 m@@ and 400 more k@@ ings .
last week in Tor@@ onto , the Canadian Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship , the Ven@@ ice champi@@ on@@ ship , was held and gold was able to make a successful start there .
he won 200 m in pi@@ pe oil with the sil@@ ver me@@ dal time 2.@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ 22 .
so quickly , this was sw@@ am@@ ped by the last quarter of the year in 2008 .
the Gol@@ den site has been through the time @-@ out in Estonia only had the record Estonian E@@ lina Par@@ k distance .
in Canada , the leader of the new Canadian city won a further sc@@ ol@@ ley in a fa@@ int of 100 m @-@ al@@ kal@@ i , with excellent personal sam@@ ples and 5@@ 6.@@ 66 new Estonian season mar@@ ches .
for example , his year old Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k has distan@@ ced this distance from being just one century .
he reached the top @-@ profile circle by finding a further 100 m in the sw@@ im@@ ming boo@@ m in the opening of the theat@@ re of the correspon@@ dence at 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 .
for half , he only gained a seat from the 7th distance when he s@@ tun@@ ned in the final figure 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
gold is currently running a ranking of four distinct distan@@ ced from the Estonian season .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics che@@ er ahead
the time for the holidays has come - that is to say a tic@@ k back to US President , Donald T@@ ru@@ mpi@@ n .
however , as T@@ ru@@ mp has so far been one of the Presidents who has removed one of the most holidays , the critics are already ham@@ mer .
according to the US &apos;s current and CN@@ N reports , the President &apos;s plan is for 17 days &apos; leave in the liquid gol@@ f clubs in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster in New Jer@@ sey .
even though the President began yesterday , the President &apos;s leave has spoken for a week on the subject of the irregular leave of T@@ ru@@ p .
they are throwing ahead too often , in the form of a wh@@ im .
indeed , the President has the standard practice of having a period of weekend in his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey cotton .
incidentally , Mr T@@ ru@@ mp has not been the President who has pu@@ mped the most into his 19@@ 6 term of office .
for example , on a holiday holiday at the time , George W@@ . Bush had already reached 67 days , Barack Obama , but hal@@ ves less than T@@ ru@@ mp , just 21 days .
what the Olympic Games are doing is to quickly fail .
the days before becoming President , in the case of Mr T@@ ru@@ mp , &apos; in the sending &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , it was said that , for long periods of leave , his man would not be in time because a great deal has to be done .
he also expressed his outra@@ ge three years ago to Barack Obama &apos;s leave .
the current President wrote on Twitter then : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , gol@@ f is playing , the brak@@ es and the gentlemen &apos;s groups , in Thailand , journalists are wal@@ king their heads from the horse &apos; .
according to the information of the white house officials , the 17 @-@ day gol@@ f club visit to the pol@@ len is not a cut @-@ off .
this is officially called &apos; working time &apos; , instead , during which the T@@ ir@@ ker has no time to read or any other act of intent .
in addition , there had to be another reason for working time .
indeed , the western housing system of the White House is replaced by a special system for the private storage of accounts , which is why the whole staff had to leave .
the West Bank also has a presence in the O@@ vaal@@ pe@@ k@@ y@@ c@@ abinet and other places of work of the President .
&quot; I do not think anybody would like to be in the West in August if you have 38 degrees and no balance pensions there , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the spokes@@ person of the White House , who stressed that the President would continue to work during his leave .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp will spend 17 days &apos; time , you will get a s@@ ounding spot .
blocking critics of the critics on Facebook , excluding candidates from a national office if you do not tolerate criticism from the voters
our father knew a great deal about the unfavourable media reports .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take much to start cha@@ tting him on everything from internal politics to his political principles .
the criticism , of course , has anno@@ yed him .
however , he did not have to keep his critics alive .
because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression could be taken from us and , more strongly and in silence , we could be led by fire on the slaugh@@ ter@@ house of sheep &apos; .
this brings me to Mrs Ho@@ gan , Governor of Mar@@ y@@ land , who has to struggle to be more in Washington .
under Ho@@ gan , the de@@ ten@@ tions of at least 450 people have blocked and era@@ ted , and have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the Alliance for Freedom of Citizens of America ( American Citizens ) was therefore taking it to court .
the Si@@ x@@ ist officers were investigating an action as empty and web comments were broken up by &apos; who ca@@ res ? &apos; .
&apos;@@ Th@@ ese is just Facebook , &apos; many people said .
but this matters .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
this is an aston@@ ishing popular gu@@ est of govern@@ ors in an overwhelming democratic state .
his percentage of discharge is the second highest in the country among the 50 govern@@ ors .
the Ho@@ gan is not a reac@@ tive head of view .
he has led the state in a firm manner and has remained firm in his principles .
in addition , he has used his or her Facebook relatively wisely as the main instrument in communicating with voters , for example , by presenting his own ro@@ stru@@ m head after che@@ mo@@ ther@@ ly .
so the writer &apos;s body Mercedes Bresso is a public forum with a formal mark , managed by a staff who is paid on taxpayers &apos; dollars and who are in need and end up being unsafe .
in an interview with the Director of the Ho@@ gan press , Ame@@ lia Ch@@ asse , in defence of the conduct of the Governor in The Washington Martin , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moder@@ ation .
but it is all too easy to pa@@ int a picture of online screening , of spa@@ m@@ mers or of people full of hatred .
the post was held by a number of people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
this is what they are , and this is what they are , quite what the agenda is , namely , people who are communicating with their elected leaders , the teacher , the owner of the company and the pas@@ tor , not online controls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , considered and not at all rose .
in his mail , the Pas@@ tor quoted milk in the form of a call to the Catholic traffic of Ho@@ gan .
a lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan@@ d in Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ m Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , not encouraged hatred , but rather a hate crime .
&quot; I have put it poli@@ tely that I am disappointed that I have not reacted to hate crime or to other recent news reports , &quot; he wrote a comment in the coun@@ t@@ down of The mail news story .
&apos;@@ I also do not like the idea that , if many people are commen@@ ting on the same subject , some of them will suddenly be called a di@@ li@@ m@@ pe@@ zy collective effort , instead of acknowledging that it is a great deal of concern for citizens &apos; .
what the Governor &apos;s officer called &apos; the targeted jun@@ k fire attack &apos; would probably be invited by others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the age of Facebook allows messages to be easily matched by blocking or dele@@ ting a negative comment .
it is a much cleaner thing than in the past , when it was necessary to send out staff to do the same , so that they can gather newspapers with critical edit@@ orial lists and bur@@ n them or arrest them and make them keep them quiet .
but this is exactly what is happening now , just digital .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media hy@@ per@@ se@@ less .

it is a rare sight in the history of the book in Papua K@@ hal@@ i@@ but , a former Dutch col@@ ony that was added to Indonesia in 19@@ 69 , after the referendum that created po@@ lem@@ ics , where only 1 0@@ 26 people who had to vote , under the very eyes of the forces , to vote .
the move , which has been released from the power of the Dutch people , is being quickly insti@@ gated by its outra@@ ge against the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta government , which is still holding the region under its tight control , away from foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province of P@@ ope was officially distributed to the West P@@ ope , so that Papua New Guinea , independent , remained in the east of the island .
the majority is a similarly remote and brow@@ n@@ field , and here , it is necessary to fly from the capital of the province of Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ b to the N@@ abi@@ da 90 minutes and then pass a five @-@ hour journey with a le@@ ase car .

Papua Indonesia is the poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty threshold , and the statistics on inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy are one of the worst in Asia .
but this is also a gold @-@ rich country for Indonesia .
just 100 km from P@@ ani@@ a@@ as , which is the tune of New Jer@@ sey , a mountain province with a population of 153 000 inhabitants , is the largest and most lu@@ cra@@ tive gold mine in the world , G@@ ras@@ berg , a company in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x , F@@ ree@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an .
in 2015 alone , F@@ ree@@ port from here was extra@@ cted some USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ h .
in addition , Papua can be smugg@@ led with consumer timber stocks , which are estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are a source of suffering for pa@@ tho@@ gens , as they are the cause of the suff@@ oc@@ ating presence of the powerful Indon@@ esi@@ an army .
a study carried out in 2005 by the New York Times showed that F@@ ree@@ port paid approximately USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including around USD 150 000 per victim .
the attempts by the Paa@@ ts to ensure greater autonomy threatens this gol@@ den h@@ all and is ru@@ th@@ lessly re@@ treated .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 kil@@ lers have been killed since 19@@ 69 , and another thousands of the Indon@@ esi@@ an army have ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned .
according to the Committee on Human Rights of Asia , the massive killing of the genocide in the hil@@ ls of the 1970s in the memor@@ ies belonging to the certificates of Papua tri@@ bal pride was an in@@ measurable measure .
last year alone , over 3 900 peaceful protest@@ ors were arrested in the region of Indonesia .
the 2016 report of the Sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me Z@@ ho@@ p of Burma contains testi@@ monies of atrocities committed in the previous year , such as extra@@ judicial executions , torture ( another report says that rape and the delivery of electric s@@ lash are particularly widespread ) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to read the figure , because there are incidents like this every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , the journalist of the Organisation &apos;s Human Rights Watch .
the concessions are even more strongly shut down , because the natural assets of Papua M@@ oun@@ tains have caused the influx of new settlements from elsewhere in Indonesia .
Eigh@@ ty @-@ five per cent of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing , because there are economic migrants coming from the jun@@ k of the Indon@@ esi@@ an people , Jaa@@ va , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and the S@@ ula@@ w@@ es islands .

&apos;@@ Children &apos;s paa@@ f Veld , the Al@@ ple@@ per of the poor people , Papua ma@@ ma &#91; Women &#93; , therefore loses their market share &apos; .
the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , who is known to the population as Jo@@ ko@@ wi , promised to address in his election campaign in 2014 these inequalities and human rights violations in the P@@ ope .
the former pu@@ rest won on its way from the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta presidential Pal@@ ace to the 27 of Papua 29 constitu@@ encies , including the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
but the P@@ ope has changed very little , and the local feel chea@@ ted .
&quot; our hearts are broken because in 2014 , we voted for Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he would live up to our hopes of restoring justice , &quot; said You will say .
in fact , Mr P@@ ani@@ a@@ i only had two months after he took office in October .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the Mo@@ ro@@ ta@@ li s@@ ongs on a Christmas Christmas , when two Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers were we@@ aring the dar@@ k@@ ness of the motor@@ cycle .
the children who met said to them that they should include the front lights .
after talking about a local pas@@ tor Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ eba@@ i , one of the soldiers was sentenced to one of their voices and subsequently returned to four troops .
according to victims and witnesses , soldiers in the Co@@ b were using children and be@@ having them with their own devices .
then one of the soldiers was shot among children .
one child , one of the 16 years old , Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , was so cru@@ el@@ ly beaten that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , the building in the close electoral Commission was bur@@ nt down and , the next day , the es@@ tu@@ ary was still further .
around 1 000 young Pa@@ men , women and children gathered to demand justice at the football pit@@ ch of the local police office and the military command centre .
they carried out cere@@ r buses and presented a pa@@ go in Papua me@@ e &apos;s clothing without a wa@@ ving tan@@ ker , where a drink was running round and a mon@@ g was bu@@ ried .
some of the prote@@ sters started to w@@ rap@@ ping up against the police and the military .
&apos;@@ W@@ he@@ w , when the scre@@ w of anger was carried on to soldiers via an internal calendar , &apos; if the crow@@ ds show resistance more than three times , go down , &apos; was said in a formal document what has been seen by the time limit but which has not been issued to local media ex@@ hi@@ b@@ itors .
the parent Mayor of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ ame ( 56 ) , was feeling a threatening threat and called for the maintenance of peace by asking for the crow@@ d to go home .
no one wanted to hear .
&quot; all round , I was shot at the extreme left , &quot; he said time for a magaz@@ ine in his private colour , on the ver@@ b of the ca@@ ve .
Ka@@ y@@ ame still does not know who the shoo@@ t was , but says that in the month , the ranks of the soldiers gathered came .
&quot; there was a lot of people , a lot of ab@@ ject , in the gar@@ den . &quot;
Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , a local man , was arrested three times after he had been shot , say the ket@@ tle .
&quot; I would like to come back to him and inqu@@ ire through his body to make sure that it was with him , &quot; said the magaz@@ ine time in Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who , like many Indi@@ ans , use only one name .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I was novel to him . &quot;
the chief inspe@@ ctor of the Pa@@ ki@@ an police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that he was only responsible for ensuring the security of his own Parish , because it was attacked .
&quot; we must protect ourselves if threats are to be made , &quot; said P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , the spokes@@ man for the Pa@@ ki@@ an police .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ors were killed and there were many injured people .
the news of the killings reached J@@ ak@@ ara only the day after .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra held a passion@@ ate speech , in which he expressed his condolences to the victims &apos; families and allowed the impro@@ pri@@ ety of the P@@ ope to be dealt with .
&quot; I want to resolve this incident immediately so that it will never be repeated in the future , &quot; he said .
in October 2016 , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , the security minister , said that he would set up an alternative mechanism for resolving the human rights crimes .
however , almost immediately followed the ex@@ cus@@ es .
&quot; most of the crimes happened a long time ago .
some of these were in the 1990s and in the early 200@@ 0s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we must follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
however , speaking at the time of the time on 5 June in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to took his words back , saying that he had no intention of setting up a P@@ ope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything is resolved according to the law &apos; .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been accused by the UN of committing crimes against human rights in relation to the death of more than 1 000 people in East Timor in the course of the bloody referendum in 1999 , said that 11 human rights crime had already been solved in P@@ ope , including what happened in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i took such arguments with a g@@ loom@@ y belief .
&quot; I have been inter@@ ro@@ gated four times in the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that , years later , there is still fear .
&apos;@@ I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&quot; I am afraid that the army is ar@@ resting me , I am afraid I am being shot . &quot;
he gave a clean assurance to M@@ s. Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us that the people of P@@ ani@@ an are afraid to s@@ lan@@ der this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bur@@ y four victims .
&quot; after bur@@ ying the bodies , the army had to look at me , &apos; he says .
the arrests have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Mayor of the Indon@@ esi@@ an police , in the neighbouring S@@ ili@@ ary , in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ is , was shot .
one person was killed and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , when it went on to go on to talk between the head of the village and the building company , who refused to carry an unknown man to hospital .
this man , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ wn into ne@@ ar@@ by rivers in an attempt to fish , died on the road to hospital .
the inhabitants of the villages of the country were protesting against the office of the company on the construction site .
according to the police , the people in the villages were st@@ oring police st@@ oned , with the latter responding with warning bul@@ lets .
however , local would argue that mobile British people ( the Indon@@ esi@@ an police ) started to fire on the population , killing a single person .
&quot; we were in a great panic , we are afraid of reven@@ ge , &quot; said a letter of time number 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near hospital and saw the in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating of the injured .
&quot; I have been dece@@ iving myself in my own house for two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ i Parliament has called for the police to be held responsible and for the re @-@ drawing of a mobile Bri@@ ton from the region .
the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i has always been a problem for the Indon@@ esi@@ an Government .
the lack of meaningful development will feed the dis@@ satisfaction of the honey , the m@@ one , the dan@@ cing and the da@@ m@@ mal tri@@ bes in Papua B@@ hal@@ i@@ c land .
many of these have joined the army of free Paapua ani re@@ bels ( V@@ PL ) , which , in its own words , protects the rights of boats by carrying out casu@@ al attacks and abduc@@ tions among Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers .
some of the leaders of V@@ PL come from P@@ ani@@ ya , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , in the name of defending &apos; the sovereignty of the state &apos; , the army has in recent years arrested in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them will never emerge again .
among the people of Papua , the P@@ ani@@ i is known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty is fuel@@ ling dis@@ satisfaction .
the little ri@@ p that is sold in the majority is too costly to buy for local people .
the figure is as un@@ achievable .
people are growing mainly on the basis of the fabric of their entire food , plus a little fruit and food .
farming is the job of women , who can each manage to maintain four or five of the objects of the ba@@ seline .
they usually keep most of the harves@@ ts to their families , and the remainder is sold on the local market .
ten b@@ ars pay only 10@@ ,000 premises in Indonesia ( 75 cents ) .
in time , economic disparities between the in@@ competent boats and the new migrants who have come to a great deal since the opening of new flight routes at N@@ ab@@ ire airport have deepen@@ ed .
the few jobs that exist are going to go to more educated and more wealthy migrants .
the matches themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving a fri@@ dge because there is no jobs or no money , &quot; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , Chairman of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ bal Council .
the isolation will keep the eyes of the world from the P@@ ope .
in addition , there are severe restrictions on the external media .
at the beginning of this year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ th L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were expelled from the P@@ ope because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they had been given a rare film authorisation .
according to Mr K@@ ine , Deputy head of the Asia Division for Human Rights Watch , the commitments made by Mr Jo@@ ko@@ w to remove the restrictions placed on reports to promote transparency and development have not been implemented .
&quot; in Indonesia , journalists trying to report on the most turbul@@ ent provinces of peace in Papua Pa@@ pu@@ tan and West P@@ ope are facing new threats to the rejection of the Sakharov visa and black@@ list , &quot; he said in a statement .
the absence of a g@@ lance into the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to the closest neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries were encouraged by jaotatakse ts , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ valu , Mar@@ shall Islands and the Sol@@ om@@ on Islands to investigate &apos; a series of large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in the Paa@@ pu@@ a , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the same countries have historically supported V@@ PL .
the journalist , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , the spokes@@ person for the Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed the accusations of a group &apos;s be@@ er by stating to the press : &apos; in Indonesia democracy and freedom of the press , so that proof of cases against human rights is hard to bur@@ y &apos; .
the people who are there want more of the foreign governments to be taken into consideration .
when the delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , K@@ ees Van B@@ aar@@ i , visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ rat on 4 May , the local people interrupted the meeting , but anon@@ ymous with the source of their silence , urging us to &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , there will be new presidential elections in 2019 , but the pa@@ ci@@ f@@ s will not believe that they will be voting again for Jo@@ ko@@ w .
&quot; Jo@@ ko@@ wi is a man with good intentions , but the people around him who are involved in shooting P@@ ani@@ a@@ i say &quot; he , President of the tri@@ bal Council , Ho@@ ba@@ i .
he wants to give Jo@@ ko@@ w the impression that , apart from the fact that the people of P@@ ani@@ i are constantly living under the threat of a pre@@ da@@ tory army , they are suffering from the scourge of misery of education and health services .
according to Mr Bloom , people in the P@@ ani@@ an , like other boats , regard their vote in the debt that they have to pay to Jo@@ ko@@ w .
&apos;@@ The@@ y do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite the theft and intimidation , the families of the victims of P@@ ani@@ an were able to cope with the latest symbolic reaction , pirates , which have served the body of the victim , the police stations and the army bases in the country .
knowing that justice may never be done , they will at least not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&apos;@@ One of our family members was killed &apos; says the main message that has been fel@@ led in Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us .
&apos;@@ What else can we do ? &apos;
the ne@@ il came in the H@@ or@@ y@@ cle of Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch , the second time in the room .
on Friday , one of the greatest residential blocks in the world san@@ k in Du@@ ba@@ i , forced hundreds of residents to escape from this 3@@ 37 @-@ me@@ tre of de@@ ser@@ t and 79 @-@ ti@@ ll @-@ based buildings .
this is the second fire that has devastated in just two years from the High H@@ all , which is , incidentally , called the Tor@@ ch , the T@@ Ãµr@@ vi@@ k .
the building was evacu@@ ated , no injury was reported and no direct cause of fire was presented .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and wo@@ ke up the fire camp and the c@@ rying out of the people .
we would be getting under the co@@ ws and we needed about 10 minutes to get down to the bottom of the 50@@ th , &apos; Re@@ u@@ ter@@ na was a single man who called himself George &apos; .
according to the civil protection officers of Du@@ ba@@ i , fire@@ men were also out of kil@@ ler at around 4 a.m. in the morning at local time ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and ja@@ iled in the building .
the government said that it was working to ensure shelter for the victims .
this incident may once again raise questions around the world about the safety of materials used on the external surface of high @-@ ranking sources .
a study carried out at the end of the storm in the Tor@@ ch Bureau in 2015 found that the most damage was caused by fas@@ sa@@ si@@ c tests , the de@@ cor@@ on@@ ised panels and isolation of external soil .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of G@@ ren@@ fell T@@ ow@@ er in London and the fas@@ ten@@ ers could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June , with nearly 80 deaths .
see : from these phones , sales claims will probably be available in the autumn
Ke@@ y and autumn is a time for technical sports , because then telephone manufacturers will be making their new models of excellence public .
in the spring , the sales of Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peri@@ a Pre@@ mi@@ um came to be sold , and in the autumn , too , new h@@ it@@ t @-@ phones for bo@@ e@@ lep@@ h@@ ire trees are expected .
according to the leader of the television markets and sales , Sir Christian Se@@ ema , street ships are characterised by an innovative design , a mo@@ use @-@ ray of eyes , a ser@@ se @-@ servan@@ i resolution 4@@ K screen and an ultra @-@ fast process .
the great ex@@ ci@@ tement of the technology world , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , has also been shown to be in the top ranking of the Estonian smar@@ t@@ phone League .
in autumn , the latter will allow even more advanced radiation to be charged to the use of smar@@ t@@ b@@ ent products , a more robust t@@ read@@ ers , and a higher water and dust resistance .
he added that , on the basis of rum@@ ours , he can already specu@@ late and predict the four top models that will probably commemorate the sales tables .
these four top @-@ edge model for smar@@ t@@ phones will reach the super@@ market operators in the autumn of this year .
the long @-@ awaited i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone Plus should reach the boys as early as mid @-@ September .
the images of what the new Apple model sees and can do about it are much .
if the i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not bring significant differences between the i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , it is expected that the new model will be completely distinct from the previous one for Apple &apos;s 10th birth@@ day .
four col@@ ours have been mentioned : black , white , white , white and white gold and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one element of the new design is obviously the screen , which covers the entire phone panel , has been lost in the home and the fingerprints are built on the screen .
the new model of the Apple design , J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve , requires that a new i@@ P@@ hone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk about a cer@@ a@@ mic version of an i@@ P@@ hone .
in addition to the &apos; catch the eye &apos; , the &apos; wireless &apos; and the even higher @-@ quality &apos; camer@@ a , speed A@@ 11 can be expected .
this is certainly one of the most expected smart phones for the year .
the launch of the optional G@@ ala@@ x@@ y note 8 of the brand brand brand will begin on 23 August .
there are a lot of rum@@ ours of what the new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y note 8 will look like .
it is worth noting that even more is intended for the business@@ men and that the S pen will allow even more fun@@ ction@@ ality .
the telephone should have two camer@@ as , one being a s@@ lan@@ der and the other a television item with a narrow view .
nobody is yet aware of what two dro@@ w@@ ning stic@@ ks are capable of , but in any case this is the first test of the same same , which is surely of the same level in terms of quality as the i@@ P@@ hone 8 .
however , we are awaiting intense August 23 .
although Nokia has brought sales this year with three smart phones , led by Nokia 6 , there is still a shortage of their flagship ship , Nokia 8 , which is already to be presented on 16 August .
we are awaiting a scre@@ w from well to 5.@@ 3 @-@ dust @-@ gu@@ zz@@ ling and a very fast @-@ tra@@ il of Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ nap@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and a more robust a@@ g .
Nokia is also talking about lower alu@@ mini@@ um fla@@ ts and significant levels of water and customs security IP@@ 68 .
like the code , Nokia &apos;s new model has two nur@@ tures of the camer@@ a , the op@@ tics of which is produced by the Z@@ e@@ iss company .
if the S@@ ony @-@ proof flagship ship has been in the run @-@ up to X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , the producer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smart phones will have even more innovative functions .
we are awaiting a smart phone which is a little more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least with the same good or the better camer@@ a .
there has been speculation about the new model for S@@ ony that it is on a screen that is at least hot air .
what is the reality , we can see the very soon , because traditionally at the International Technology F@@ air ( IF@@ A ) , which is due to be published at the S@@ ony &apos;s autumn flagship International Technology F@@ air , this year , this year , from 1 to 6 September .

the Washington post revealed trans@@ cri@@ ptions of telephone calls between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ p and Mexic@@ an Heads of State .
on 27 January , the telephone word for T@@ ru@@ mp pressed the Mexic@@ an President , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ o , went to the effect that the latter would stop declaring that he would not be able to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President was in ab@@ h@@ or with him for denoun@@ cing the wall , saying &apos; You must not say this to the press &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ mp has placed a commitment in its presidential campaign to build a tra@@ il of the United States &apos; southern border walls and the old age , to make Mexico pay for this project .
Trans@@ cri@@ p@@ tors were also published from his first speech with the Prime Minister of Australia , Malcolm Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l , which reveals an intense debate .
Mr President , Mr Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l said that the agreement that the United States would take on the refugees who are heading to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; fo@@ ol@@ ish &apos; ; he said that an agreement that was made during the Obama Government would leave him with the &apos; head &apos; impression , because he has proposed a ban on refugees from the United States .
the tax@@ i finished the speech by stating to Mrs Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l that &apos; this was the most un@@ pleasant speech of the day &apos; .
the Supreme Court did not take up a complaint in the City of O@@ range MR@@ P in the case where the city of Tar@@ tu rejected their offer of bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 20@@ 29 .
this is a hand@@ book rejecting the offer of the city of O@@ Ãœ MR@@ P to the Tar@@ tu bus , because the offer was not compliant , An@@ neli A@@ puh@@ tin , Director @-@ General of the Tar@@ tu City Service .
this is a public bus and coach transport procurement for the period from 1.@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 to 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .

although many in the social media complain that the web @-@ s@@ ounding session from the festi@@ val is disrup@@ ting their night and that the entire town is full of b@@ read@@ ers in the drink , there are many who do not have a single word to say a bad about the festi@@ val that is going on in the field .
I am even positively surprised that the brak@@ es were so poli@@ te in the super@@ market !
I have not seen any dis@@ gust or any lack of cour@@ tes@@ y .
even the fla@@ me saw , &apos; there is a nice wave .
&quot; it is good that you are coming , you are caught and you are happy to see what has been a winter gra@@ de , &quot; she is happy to add .
the wave of a wave of rub@@ ber @-@ ju@@ mping is not a shame .
while living in a central town , he is still hearing music being played on the floor , now the music has not reached his home rate .
&quot; but I hope that I hear , &quot; he will be happy to say .
also , in the conver@@ sation about the evening , Ag@@ nes says that the &apos; Grand festi@@ val &apos; is good for the record &apos; , which is a major contribution to the turnover of local merchan@@ ts .
furthermore , he is pleased that the capital city of the summer has come so many out@@ breaks .
no woman of the family &apos;s me@@ tal .
although I am no longer on the coast , it is good that the rand has recovered .
and it is good that the people are moving and that has already been the case three times &apos; , says a woman .
I think that the first time round was a little worse .
&apos;@@ Per@@ haps there were complaints &apos; , he will reflect on .
what is common for the people of Ireland , he said , is the normal thing for the summer capital .
&quot; this We@@ ek@@ end is a very good pro@@ f for our small town , &quot; says Har@@ ri , who is be@@ ating in the park .
neither does he or she have bo@@ gged down in his life and mouth .
well , for what ?
we should all make savings .
think how this communication between nations would be better .
after all , the man of music is not kis@@ sing .
this does not happen , although I live near there .
&quot; the good people can make savings and there is no trouble at all , &quot; he is speaking .
visitors coming to the Se@@ als are , according to him , visa @-@ free .
&quot; with the Alliance , they have , of course , also joined a bit , but young people are young people and iss@@ ance - give God , go , but be people and we can do it ! &quot;
the people on the ground have travelled away somewhere by then , whether to their relatives or to those who know .
&quot; but in general , the festi@@ val has a positive effect on life - people like this me@@ tre , &quot; says Ti@@ ina , the Ti@@ ina , a man who has wal@@ ked with children from Vienna .
his family , too , is not bo@@ thered by the festi@@ vals , although last year , it was even more than this year &apos;s .
last summer , the scene was different , then we heard more .
we live outside the city that , in fact , it is quite well lit there from the Se@@ als of Heritage . &apos;
Beijing is cutting another 3 000 jobs and reducing dividen@@ ds to revive the business
the British educational firm Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that he would cut another 3 000 jobs and reduce his interim dividend by 72 % , thus launching another restructuring programme to deal with the men@@ tor@@ ing burden of business .
the jobs that will be covered , which will most likely be concentrated according to the CE@@ O , John F@@ all@@ oni , at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will add to the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring .
Beijing announced in May the intention to cut expenditure under the third cost @-@ cutting programme by another GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) to try and revive the business that has been hit by the move to fast digital learning .
a company that agreed to sell its participation in the company , Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House , to its partner company , Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , last month said that their expectation of a year in connection with the situation has not changed since the sales revenue increase of 1 % was announced at EUR 2.@@ 05 billion was declared in the first half of the year .

K@@ abu@@ l attack : in a suicide bom@@ bar@@ d , NATO soldi@@ er lost his death
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked the army con@@ vo@@ ys in the Afghan capital , K@@ abu@@ l , to death a single NATO soldi@@ er and w@@ ounded several others .
the NATO statement stated that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
without verification of local reports , three civilians were killed in an incident in the town of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi .
this bom@@ bing is the last acts of violence to have hit Afghanistan this month , with more than 30 people killed this day in the Her@@ ati mos@@ to attack .
on Monday , the suicide bom@@ ber killed two people in K@@ abu@@ l near the emb@@ assy in Iraq .
the NATO statement stated that an explosion on Thursday was carried out when , with the Afghan army united by pat@@ ro@@ l , &apos; a man @-@ made explosives &apos; was attacked .
the statement states that everything is injured in a stable state and is treated in an US military hospital on the flight of Bag@@ ra@@ m .
according to the cor@@ respondents , the Taliban and the group known as the &apos; Islamic state &apos; ( in Denmark ) are the growing forces in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ h as a serious source of concern to the forces in Bag@@ ra@@ ge in NATO .
according to the UN , in the first half of 2017 , at least 1 6@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan , of which nearly 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l killed at least 30 people , mainly in the line of S@@ hi &apos;@@ ite ra@@ ys .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , a major bomb attack in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people , which has resulted in the greatest deaths in a military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant to carry out the Taliban &apos;s power in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp is considering whether to increase the number of US troops and the number of US forces that will help the country &apos;s army and the police .
according to the cor@@ respondents , the suicide attacks in recent weeks in K@@ abu@@ l have also led to a public confidence crisis in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
the EPA repealed the decision to postpone the regulation after the actions
the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( UN@@ States Environmental Protection Agency Garrido ) repealed the decision to delay the establishment of a regulation at the end of the Obama , which requires states to limit emissions of emissions from the summer , one day after 15 states were su@@ ed by this move .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed with &quot; the decision to decide on the content of the BONUS &quot; on Wednesday , saying that it would demonstrate the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperating with the states .
&quot; we believe that we need to have a dialogue and take heed of our national partners , &quot; said Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t , the leader of the EPA , in a statement .
the ball had announced in June &apos;s intention to reject the declaration of the June EPA &apos;s levels of ozone in Mehhiko tern , which measure pollution in various parts of the country in order to determine where it should be reduced to compliance with the more stringent air quality standard by one year from February to 2018 .
in conjunction with the Colom@@ bian community , 15 main democratic states lodged a fi@@ x@@ ture of proceedings on Tuesday , saying that this decision was unlawful .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has tried to bring back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President , Barack Obama , and I think that is part of the broader plan for boosting growth .
however , these efforts have led to reactions among the groups of democrats and nature protection who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that an in@@ hal@@ ing of the ozone layer &apos; may reduce the ability of lun@@ g to work and increase the risk of disease to res@@ pira@@ tory diseases &apos; , for instance in as@@ th@@ ma .
German pigs can come from a dead end .
German pigs and cattle can have a ticket , since heavy ra@@ ins are a threat to the harves@@ ting of the EU &apos;s second @-@ biggest wheat producer , which is to be signed by B@@ loom@@ berg .
this year , it may be the case that the weekend of preci@@ pita@@ tions before harves@@ ting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry would only be ea@@ ten to animals .
&quot; the quality of content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said A@@ gra@@ vis R@@ ai@@ ff@@ e@@ is@@ en analy@@ tics , Bern@@ hard Chil@@ la .
this year , up to 40 % of German wheat can be fed , which is double the normal , in A@@ gra@@ vis .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have been exposed to any beau@@ ty this year .
first of all , the winter was too dry .
then came the cold ro@@ ck , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
in July , the German Council of Ministers hit the event , which has continued in August .
many eyes have been turned on to northern Germany , where rain hin@@ ders the harves@@ ting .
so far , only five per cent of the wheat has been cleared .
most areas in the region have not even started harves@@ ting , and the local bu@@ yer of the harvest in C@@ era@@ vis has stated .
&quot; this is a very difficult day , &quot; said Frank Dec@@ ker@@ t R@@ end@@ s@@ burg , the parent trader of C@@ era@@ vis .

M@@ ike@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss the possible confrontation .
Mr L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and Ms Gar@@ cia , who should be on the course of a col@@ lisi@@ on to face the most attractive po@@ xing pla@@ gue in the near future , up to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in L@@ ge@@ le@@ f , in their special rooms in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ les , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ won World Bo@@ xing Coun@@ c@@ ili ligh@@ t@@ weight champion , wal@@ ked to the other side of the corridor to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , the World Bo@@ xing Times tably consulting the sul@@ g@@ ras@@ ra@@ m .
following the unanimous decision by Gar@@ cia , the victory of the former four @-@ fold world champion , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er , in S@@ ho@@ w@@ time on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ time , both comb@@ at@@ ants will be part of the top @-@ table format .
the Gar@@ cia extended its better hand and said : &apos; how will you go , the champion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko is defending his bel@@ ts , Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga , on Saturday evening , 19 in the ES@@ P@@ N .
when a few photo@@ graph@@ ers were able to pose a po@@ tas@@ h , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko &apos;s mountain j@@ er E@@ gis Kli@@ ma pointed out that it would be a &apos; perfect exercise &apos; between opposing fighters .
&quot; I am a former sul@@ tative , &quot; reminded Mr Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I have been calling for B@@ ron@@ er &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move below the ligh@@ ter .
and he must move up the tra@@ il &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the fana@@ tics have asked for this .
let &apos;s put this on our feet . &quot;
Mrs L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko has agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
the question that he asked was whether he should be paid for this review , and that is part of his strategy of wanting to allow L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko to book the final half of this year in the 6@@ 1.2 kg class to make it possible for next summer to meet with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 months ) , who also has an interest in combating Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ k@@ k@@ ich , following the celebration of the celebration of the pri@@ m@@ and the celebration of the pri@@ m@@ our celebration at the For@@ u@@ ence of the commemor@@ ation on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , because the f@@ ans have asked for it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , later saying that it was open to fighting any channel providing the best financial package .
&quot; we are the main actors .
no other name can deserve so much attention .
whenever they are prepared ... &apos;
Mrs Gar@@ cia said that she was considering L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t as a &apos; for@@ ceful figh@@ ter &apos; and could go on to stand by her Saturday .
however , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was modest in pra@@ ising the Gar@@ cia , saying that he thought that the champion of the three di@@ vis@@ h@@ ons from Ri@@ ver@@ side saw it &apos; very slow ; I am sorry , M@@ ike@@ y ... you wanted it a no@@ se &apos; .
according to Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show strength and then to bo@@ w down .
both have confirmed that they will feel that the tension is increasing to try out between them .
&quot; this is a struggle that is awaiting realisation .
no other confrontation is causing so much attention and a lack of talent .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been on the waiting lists of the best fighters , and M@@ ike@@ y is just that .
this will be a good struggle . &quot;
what sort of world ra@@ ids will be relocated to Estonia ?
the soil was extended and issued by the police and border surveillance agency ( PP@@ A ) in record time over 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work , study or family .
for example , if , for example , the soil was chosen to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit to 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , then Laval was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the agencies cannot tell us how many migrants will eventually be sta@@ yed in Estonia , but such an analysis will be carried out in the Ministry of the Interior .
if , ten years ago , there were almost 500 Ukrainians in the region of Estonia per year , in recent years this figure will reach 2 000 .
the number of applicants for the residence permit so@@ ared during the Ukrainian crisis , with 1 0@@ 75 people in 2014 as a result of the fixed @-@ term residence permit .
according to the statistics of the office , the highest number of Ukrainian citizens is increasing in Estonia - the cost of the past arrived in Estonia on more than a l@@ ot@@ tery for 850 Ukrainian citizens .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been very busy in Estonia all the time , and it is natural because of the difficult circumstances in the country that work and learning opportunities are being sought in the country where the community and many families already had to be represented , Kris@@ tin Ram@@ mus , the spokes@@ person for the Home Department .
soil and Monac@@ d had a greater number of Ukrainians granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit , even with a number of citizens of Russia , although in 10 years total , the most fixed @-@ term residence permits have been granted to them .
if Ukrainians come here largely to work , then the citizens of Russia will be able to mig@@ rate .
&quot; given the historical community here , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties in relation to people living in Russia , &quot; said Hel@@ ina Me@@ use , the chief theat@@ re of the Interior Security A@@ ca@@ de@@ my .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you look at where the Russian citizens who have been granted a residence permit to Estonia have moved , then , after Har@@ ju@@ no , there is an East F@@ es@@ ten &apos;@@ ll , &apos; he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them are mar@@ ried to a European Union citizen .
soil was granted to 1.@@ 6@@ 96 Russian citizens for fixed @-@ term residence , which is also a record figure .
at the same time , the residence permit for extending the number of Russians that wanted to enjoy was actually reduced .
&quot; &quot; the stick is the result of requests for a new residence permit to be permanently located in Estonia , &quot; wrote a press representative in the Ministry of the Interior , Ram@@ mus , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years .
the new residence permit for Estonia to settle on a permanent basis can be applied for foreigners who have been living here for at least three years from the previous year .
its aim is to encourage the sincere saving of the people who have adapted .
however , a residence permit for a long @-@ term resident will require , for example , five years .
the new residence permit has apparently also resulted in a reduction in the old enti@@ tlement to reside .
for example , soil was given such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
now the Ukrainians can exchange their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be able to point the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit became popular in the cour@@ ty@@ ard - the holders of the pi@@ tiful passports ( 10@@ 29 ) , the Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , the Indi@@ ans ( 54 ) and the Fin@@ ns ( 36 ) .
in total , 19@@ 68 people were granted a residence permit to reside in Estonia , including , for example , 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and equally many Chinese .
this year , the total number of applicants is already 12.@@ 69 .
in 10 years , Nigeria has become a country with citizens who are among the most active candidates for residence permits in Estonia .
when three residence permits were issued for the Fin@@ ns in 2007 , the soil was 200 .
from Nigeria , lessons are learned to these universities .
in addition , higher education institutions in Estonia are popular , for example among Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to the search game .
for these too , the rule applies that there is a community @-@ led rule , with more clarity to others , &apos; will add to the Ram@@ mus .
in ten years , two people have moved to Estonia , for example from North Korea , as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 from South Korea , 40 from Indonesia and four from U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit per year , this is about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if you include the citizens of the European Union , the migration will remain around a percentage , &apos; , commen@@ ded on the Me@@ use , that the figures are actually small .
in total , according to data offices in Estonia , 14 8@@ 22 people were able to mig@@ rate to Estonia , and 13 7@@ 92 people were able to come out of it .
this means that immigration has gone beyond emigration for a second year .
the majority of those who move to and move are Estonian citizens , but more are among the ex@@ o@@ dus .
therefore , the Estonian citizens &apos; migratory secrecy with 2 000 people was in the red .
the Est@@ oni@@ ans are particularly going to be divided between Finland and Estonia .
M@@ ammu @-@ long C@@ ou@@ ture g@@ lu@@ e g@@ lu@@ e with sa@@ usage , we@@ ed and dis@@ gust
however , in the wake of the North @-@ West of ideas , there is history for Maria Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u - old pa@@ int@@ ings and ser@@ ro@@ ls : &apos; I can dream somewhere for hours in the muse@@ um and old thi@@ ef and ad@@ m@@ ire .
if you are going to find a way , then you will study and learn a little every day about it .
this is a joy of disco@@ very !
the world of M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture gla@@ mo@@ rous may seem like some of its fai@@ ths , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourself decide how much you are in your life !
I have a friend who has full g@@ all full of the bat@@ tery of the bat@@ teries that I have created , the cou@@ ture bro@@ kers .
because it is not his fault , nor is he living in Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ oo@@ d and not on a red horse every day , he also wants to carry on these most beautiful bro@@ kers and he will suffer !
you can live yourself in a special way for your life !
the Mo@@ e@@ ar@@ tist does not recognise the divisions between sh@@ ining events and the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day .
it was this reasoning that led to the plan to move higher gra@@ des to the land centres , between forests and fields in Estonia , between people who are often not reached by the fashion .
M@@ ammu ago , the colle@@ ctions were presented on the basis of comparison , J@@ Ãµh@@ vi and LT mo@@ e@@ alle@@ el , for example , where a King H@@ all , a 45 mo@@ del@@ led , carried out a house of the street .
in Tallinn , the super@@ market is often imported , a dignified no@@ d is no@@ d@@ ding , but there is more emo@@ tion elsewhere - the cry is b@@ vo rising , you want to thank you , including .
a large proportion of the audience had to be down@@ loaded , but now they are the f@@ ans of M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture .
if you exceed the expectations of the people , they will be admi@@ red !
and I like the feeling that I am with my mo@@ mo@@ mo@@ mo@@ is@@ y like the spring of the summer .
in the past , we had a 50 @-@ me@@ tre red car@@ pet , full of rub@@ ber @-@ stamp across the streets , it seemed they would not end !
Mrs Maria does not recognise the fashi@@ on@@ able fact that creation must be presented by a super@@ super@@ model , which she will be happy to bring to the mer@@ cy of ordinary women .
I often invite my own customers - they have always come with pleasure .
this is the very cus@@ hi@@ on experience , the sa@@ ga of the as@@ hes in the wonderful ho@@ le on the the@@ or@@ ies !
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen what I have been doing , I am always behind the scen@@ es to give the last piece of hope in the w@@ ings of a bo@@ i@@ le .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow a calm watch from the Chamber .
Mrs mo@@ el@@ oo@@ mer of this kind , who not only wants to play a representative role , but has to be involved in everything .
I have a s@@ oul of my own b@@ read@@ cru@@ mb@@ o , and I myself carry out most of the colle@@ ctions .
I like the whole process in which you have been playing with the details .
I am never far from my own crea@@ ture and I am not afraid of work .
the issue with the substance is not limited , nor is it the organisation of the pu@@ ri@@ fication , logistics , organisation , organisation - everything must reach the day of one tem@@ per@@ ate woman .
well , these hours of work are still hugely coming from fana@@ tics .
I cannot say when my day of work will end , but for me , it is simply full of joy .
I have always been very lu@@ cky - it is like the inc@@ es@@ s@@ ant happy chain : I am doing something fine , man gets something beau@@ ty and , moreover , compli@@ ments .
it has been said many times that I have a c@@ oo@@ k@@ ness in my stic@@ kers - they make themselves feel like a pr@@ inc@@ ely .
the ab@@ er@@ rant specta@@ cular quo@@ tations that Maria talent made to the book overnight have remained a wake @-@ up call for M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ tu@@ pp of U@@ 18 boys : the weapon of al@@ ag@@ pi@@ tur@@ Ã© of the Est@@ oni@@ ans was turned into our oppon@@ ent now
I am sorry , I am afraid I am missing .
the first thing that has come out of the w@@ oods is that we could not get our s@@ ongs .
and , if such a difference is in the table , &apos; no action is taken , Estonia commented U@@ 18 cor@@ v@@ ball bo@@ xes 61 : 75 dis@@ lep@@ h@@ ors in Britain have played our only cor@@ v@@ ball role in the N@@ are , the only one in the UK , the C@@ hal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ ab@@ it@@ re@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ er .
opponents took the p@@ ound of attack from 28 p@@ ounds and , as a result , received so many more attacks .
we were also not prepared to protect them agg@@ ressi@@ vely and not to attack them , it was created .
many attacks by English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build up protection .
however , in defence , they have been able to keep their hands everywhere , we could not combine .
this has led the team to make a clean ride .
the work of the oppon@@ ent was done better .
the che@@ f estimates that Estonia should have made more tac@@ tical errors to remove the momentum of the opponents in the b@@ ud .
last , in the last quarter , we had a zero error , but we had already had a few quick records of opponents .
In@@ stan@@ ce@@ fulness and intense insistence , which was the be@@ ac@@ on of the al@@ bin@@ d weapon , have now turned against us all .
today , we had no power against their agg@@ ressi@@ veness .
the y@@ m@@ ou@@ th@@ est remained satisfied with his lack of care in Kal@@ ev@@ i , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s .
in general terms , a whole team can be said to be well @-@ wor@@ n , so far in a united shock .
it is a pity that this aggressive oppon@@ ent had not been met before .
the ball has been sound all the time and has played out today , but it seemed to have been ti@@ red - he has borne quite a lot of the burden .
but he made some quite nice moves that I have seen in the past in the tr@@ en@@ ches &apos; , added a men@@ tor .
terrible numbers : the flat @-@ ball concentration of ne@@ fresh fish trees was vis@@ hed by the E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ al with three fewer than 10 exceptions ...

and the Estonian game with Poland has unfortunately stra@@ ined into the area of anti@@ rec@@ ts .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , the figure was 9 : 49 , or only in the last 10 minutes , the opponents took the floor from the gas family , and the period remained at the rate of 16 : 16 .
in both the first and the second quarter , Estonia set out 4 , point 1 , point 1 ...
then , at the beginning , two bits of the four first iron crea@@ tures were caught by the Est@@ oni@@ ans , and then 25 pieces were kno@@ cking down the ga@@ mble , then one of the three , then another 21 are to be ignored ...
perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 crea@@ tures were caught out of a single .
in addition , 2 points came from four free @-@ ton@@ es .
the loss of many people was a reasonable figure with this time , 12 .
the game was eventually followed by a 35 % ray of vis@@ u@@ ality in Poland and 13 % in Estonia ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , and on the inaugu@@ ral day , Portugal had to recognise the 83 : 56 disadvantages .
NATO vessels came to the office to supplement stocks .
today NATO has arrived for 1 permanent group of land@@ ers for the weekend to visit Tallinn to prepare for the stock of ships and for the forthcoming exercises .
during the visit , ships are preparing for na@@ ming the sea , giving cre@@ ws the possibility to take a couple of days &apos; leave .
following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in the waters of Estonia to carry out a series of exercises and to prepare for future , historic explosives @-@ searching operations .
&quot; the participation of the Est@@ oni@@ ans in the NATO entity and the co @-@ existence of local waters is a good illustration of our integration into the alli@@ ed forces , &quot; said Cap@@ ten@@ ore Ar@@ to Rein@@ maa , the chief executive of the overseas military and planning station .
since 29 June , NATO has been holding a permanent mine steering group in Latvia &apos;s Na@@ vy Cap@@ tain G@@ vi@@ le@@ it@@ na@@ i@@ um Lau@@ du@@ ps , who has taken over from the Estonian na@@ vy officer , Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as Sel@@ ja@@ a , at a ceremony in Riga .
the group &apos;s flagship ship is the L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis naval support vessel in Latvia , which also operates on a group &apos;s steering period .
this semester includes the cre@@ do of the Estonian Na@@ vy and the Sak@@ alas .
as one of the four groups of ships subject to the NATO sea@@ side management , NATO is the permanent anti @-@ missile group 1 of primary emergency advis@@ ers , which could be sent to different places in the world within five days .
4 @-@ 13 August , the fa@@ ti@@ gue series of P@@ iri@@ ta mon@@ as@@ tery turns into another place where the Al@@ es@@ tro E@@ tat , or@@ ch@@ es@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , was de@@ pic@@ ted 13 years ago .
this year &apos;s Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val will be awarded the artistic leader of the Char@@ le@@ onia , to J@@ oo@@ sti ( 36 ) , a beautiful , powerful and unprecedented venture .
at the risk of the F@@ ive : &apos; Go@@ th@@ ic &apos; and &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; in the clas@@ s@@ room of the World &apos; , bal@@ le@@ ti@@ la@@ la@@ la@@ us &apos; , &apos; Bal@@ sel@@ l@@ ti@@ la@@ us &apos; , the B@@ ole@@ ro@@ st &apos; Cas@@ tle &apos; Kar@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ in &apos; , and neither the pro@@ gram &apos;s own production , this time Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ni &apos;s ma@@ gic or@@ it@@ or@@ ies &apos; , &apos; A@@ asta@@ ajad &apos; , responding by the same international team of Lo@@ vel@@ s who brought to P@@ iri@@ y@@ ni hospital in 2015 , even &apos; creation of the organisation of a pa@@ w@@ ne@@ y works &apos; .
Burma , F@@ esti@@ val , has much more than simply concer@@ ts and theat@@ re replies .
this is greater than any mus@@ ical theat@@ res in their normal form .
this is a festi@@ val whose s@@ now is gaining ground and will never get off the ground .
because the experience that the audience can gain in this unjust and my@@ ste@@ rious environment is a more vibran@@ t place for human beings and for human beings in a way that cannot be described .
at the risk , you are the first year in which Burma is a splendid art leader .
did the sho@@ es of the ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ k not feel a little like a bit like a bit ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been a great help .
he went through a whole of my student careers and supported the di@@ gis@@ ts careers at the beginning .
perhaps this is because I am making it easier for me to carry on with her work .
in K@@ las , the team of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has been so hear@@ tened by its goodwill and , of course , all of this also spil@@ ls me over .
it was excellent to join a team who knows how things are going .
it was the great heart of E@@ ri K@@ ese who also gave me the strength to thri@@ ve on Burma with the Tal@@ li@@ o Fil@@ tu F@@ esti@@ val@@ d .
and here I am , and I can !
what could be the audience for this year &apos;s festi@@ val , what are you offering in particular ?
we have the first bal@@ le@@ um to be presented to the perfor@@ mer of the artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and surprise , by the way , to the demonstrations in the first place , written to the speech by Astrid L@@ ind@@ gren .
to this end , &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson will fly &apos; .
and one no@@ torious nu@@ ance in this respect is that the author of this bal@@ le@@ um is the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ sons , who himself expressed a desire to write on this work .
apparently , he has already had a car@@ ak@@ r in the heart of his child .
at the risk , how are you all fat this ?
thanks to my life partner , which is my supporter , I am sure .
this work requires a lot of love and support , and I have the gre@@ est of it .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tion is not as dependent on so many other people as I myself , in other words , how I will go against every new day .
and this is a conscious awareness of the tone , of maintaining a positive spirit and actually s@@ mil@@ ing on ourselves into the mir@@ ror this morning , considerably increased my percentage of happ@@ iness .
especially now , this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen to practise this and it works .
to lau@@ gh is to Strip the brain and to raise the tone .
this is not just a fine word .
I think that people do not yet know about the body that they have to offer in the univer@@ se , but perhaps everyone is gradually diagno@@ sing it .
right now , the important moment has come .
also , is there any ri@@ tual before the pul@@ se of di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di ?
it is time that clothing must be exchanged against more comfortable people .
this is a small moment for itself .
but generally , yes , I do not have the opportunity to c@@ ool up before a great deal of speech or to make a little s@@ mile .
in fact , I even like to actively communicate with the people , even before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di@@ dra@@ g is taken .
but come to Burma , and there is also a lot of evidence here to find for the war@@ ring friend of the non @-@ particularly great o@@ O@@ C and the bal@@ le@@ t !

new results of the assessment of the age of Swedish as@@ y@@ lene applicants have been published
in Sweden , as@@ hes were made among as@@ th@@ y@@ lene seekers , which evaluated their age @-@ old novel approach in medicine , and the latest results of the test show that more than 80 % of the@@ istic minorities were considered to be older than 18 , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for medicine ( R@@ Ã¤t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ t ) started with the tests earlier this year .
the tests were set up to improve the accuracy of the age in the application for as@@ th@@ ma testing , after the Swedish Authority for Migration ( Mig@@ ration@@ s@@ ver@@ ket ) was criticised for failing to correctly establish the age of several of the ad@@ mittedly minors .
to date , the Mig@@ ration@@ s@@ ver@@ ket has sent 68 cases to the test , and the Institute for Justice has issued a total of 24@@ 81 test results between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) was assessed as 18 or over and another 25 cases were assessed by the Institute for Justice ( C@@ EN ) that the &quot; trial period &quot; could be 18 years old or older .
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that a person was &apos; perhaps younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if the age of the person is under question .
according to Joseph GÃ¶@@ rans@@ son , the performance of the Institute for Justice ( PL ) is consistent with those in the past months .
&quot; we do not see any major differences in comparison with the statistics of the past months , and the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; he said to The Local Journal .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were judged to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that applicants for asylum have been mis@@ guided by their age .
in May , the institute issued the results of the 581 test and said that in 4@@ 42 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person being examined is 18 or more &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Sven@@ ska Dag@@ det studied the results of the 581 test , it turned out that in 2@@ 43 cases , the person had directly claimed that he would be able to receive 18 this year .
this method of evaluating medical age , whereby wisdom is carried out through X @-@ ray of ne@@ x@@ gen@@ i@@ images and MR@@ T from fields , has been used to analyse them in some quarters , and then in some quarters , they are allowed to be used by den@@ tists and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts .
one of the sceptics is the endo@@ k@@ rin@@ olo@@ gist of the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute , Claude Mar@@ cus , whose tasks include evaluating human biological maturity , in order to find out whether they went through the usual audience in the past or beyond .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the method of measu@@ re@@ ments that we are using now should be used .
the designation of a biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say so strongly , then we should not pretend to have a taste , &apos; he said &apos; to the record &apos; in Met@@ ro &apos; .
but , in defence of the accuracy of the tests , Joh@@ an GÃ¶@@ rans@@ son of the Institute for Justice : &apos; generally speaking , the risk of leaving the child in@@ accurate adul@@ th@@ ood is small .
perhaps the biggest figure at around 10 % is the risk of a person under the age of 18 . &quot;

Y@@ our Tan@@ g@@ go lists nine indicators indicating that the price of your action is tw@@ o@@ fold and could be for@@ given to her .
the more expensive thing seems to be worth understanding and hard to resolve .
the price is more expensive dealt with a problem that he has led to her being moved to bed by another fellow passenger .
the cost of your own is no longer in a defen@@ sive position .
he sincerely regrets and takes on responsibility for his actions .
he is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
he agrees that he has made a serious mistake and that he genuinely is trying to improve the situation .
he is attentive and he is trying to communicate with you in a pleasant way .
however , he is pressing for your h@@ aste to get through the matter .
they are not denying what has happened and are trying to make it un@@ noticed .
you and your cost is more of the understanding why the in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ence with you arose .
you talk about this and about how we will prevent it in the future .
you must better communicate and assess each other &apos;s needs .
the more expensive attitude and actions have helped you to develop your own sympathy with his or her error .
more expensive commitment and behaviour have created the basis for your proximity to recovery .
as a couple , you have made progress in re@@ trus@@ ting your unity and your relationship .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old vas@@ s@@ er , Anna Maria O@@ rel , has done a nice dis@@ course on the part of the City of London , with 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 6.@@ a good 18 seats .
the leader was the youn@@ gest female champion of M@@ M and a happy woman has confirmed that she hopes to fight for the med@@ als in the future .
the contest was successful and I gained a good deal of experience .
with the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , I immediately paid out my average performance , the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) , I took the risk of being too high , and the third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) I could almost keep it clear , &quot; said O@@ rel after the contest .
I have been thinking about my emissions , and I am very pleased that I have found them .
Anna Maria O@@ re@@ li M@@ M has lost her po@@ cket , which has ended in a good 18 @-@ fold period .

at the London Olympic stage , almost a full House had a population , did they not get round the people or was they able to put themselves off ?
I have returned , but in a positive sense .
everyone says that this will give in - that is true !
if you are competing yourself , then you can experience it .
after all , he confirmed that he would be pleased with the abuse of MSY and that he still has many good competitions : &apos; I came here with the 3@@ 2nd , the last outcome , of this season , to the end of my 18@@ th .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years and I am on the other side - that is the only thing that counts .
I will take on board a good deal of experience and , in a few days , I want to compete on behalf of the med@@ als .
the govern@@ or of West Vir@@ g@@ ina announced a party change .
the govern@@ or of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a Democrat , Jim Justice , announced at the gathering of Thursday evening with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i that he would change the parties .
&apos;@@ W@@ h@@ y it or not , the democrats wal@@ ked out of me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today , having been a great deal of hot air and thinking about it ... today , I say to you , the west must , that I can no longer help you as a democratic govern@@ or . &quot;

&quot; so I will be Re@@ publi@@ can tomorrow , &quot; in the Annex Justice .
&quot; as a co@@ ke , I would say to you that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
the T@@ ru@@ mp had previously allowed a major announcement to be made at the gathering of West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
T@@ ru@@ mp won the west of Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ as on 42 points and Justice did not support the candidate for Democratic Democrats , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
the justice case , which is the only one billion ban@@ ners of the state according to For@@ mal state , was elected in 2016 .
in the For@@ bes , it states that it has coal mines in five states and that it has coal trading in quite its own right .
it has a value of approximately USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday evening , the National Council of Re@@ publi@@ can People ( R@@ N@@ C ) published an announcement that &apos; the party change of the Governor , Justice , is yet another blow to the democratic family that would prevent the country from getting better , rather than working for it &apos; .
&quot; just 15 sta@@ rs and controls on the lowest number of states in history - the Governor , Justice , &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent expression of a par@@ ade to tell the par@@ ks that is in a hur@@ dle and unable to find a positive and united message , &quot; said Daniel B@@ r@@ on@@ na R@@ N@@ C , R@@ on@@ na , a leader , in R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ B@@ S .
it is hardly surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured people .

Co@@ e praised the honest apolo@@ gies of the Russians for the scandal of doping
the international black@@ er , S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , was praised by him for &apos; Russia &apos;s &apos; F@@ air excuse &apos; for the D@@ oping scandal , but repeated that this is not the time to allow sport back .
in the wake of the Russian ath@@ le@@ tes &apos; D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lak@@ h@@ tin , the IA@@ AF Congress , which had previously held the ath@@ le@@ tes &apos; World C@@ up , said that the order of conduct imposed on his country was right and had a clear objective of combating doping .
he has apolog@@ ised to &apos; all the fri@@ vol@@ ous people who are stranded at the matches in the gol@@ den and sil@@ ver med@@ als &apos; .
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the ban on the contest , which was introduced in November 2015 , following the report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) , which found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I believe that today was a very fair response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said the President of the IAEA to the press in Co@@ e .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that Russia itself admitted that they had had had had quite difficult times and that they would do everything possible to re@@ organise the U@@ U . &quot;
in addition , Co@@ e said that it was pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own forecas@@ ting .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and that progress is being made , but the Congress supports the proposal from the working group that this is not the time for Russia to re@@ sign , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything we can in the next few months to bring about norm@@ alisation of the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate honest spor@@ ts@@ men from the system , &apos; he added .
N@@ in@@ teen Russian fri@@ vol@@ ous sta@@ ffs meeting the strict criteria of IA@@ AF will compete as neutral spor@@ ts@@ men and women in the World C@@ up matches to be launched in London on Friday .
the head of the IA@@ AF working group , R@@ une Andersson , said on Monday that Russia is not yet meeting a number of criteria for rein@@ statement .
following a presentation by the IA@@ AF Council , he told the press in London that doping controls were still insufficient and that the training officers who have banned were still operating freely .
the electric car revolution is making a significant difference to the demand for honey .
who are the winners and the losers ?
not least because the revolution in electric cars will make a significant difference from the fuel market to the infrastructure , it will also create new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although mining gi@@ ants like G@@ len@@ core can say that they can win from one place and lose the other , this will not help the smaller mining companies .
today , G@@ len@@ core is being served by coal and oil , but in the era of electric cars , co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ ity demand will increase .
this year , in the area of the spread of electric cars , contributions have been made by the governments of the United Kingdom , France and Norway , which will in the coming decades allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned .
this is why Vol@@ vo has already knew that it is intended to abandon the combustion engine and that T@@ es@@ la will bring a cheaper 3 electric car on the market .
according to B@@ loom@@ berg New Energy Finance estimates , over two decades , electric cars will be sold more than cars used for oil @-@ generated fuels .
&quot; for some metals this will change everything , &quot; the capital economics stock@@ taking exercise of raw materials was said to Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ ini B@@ loom@@ berg .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as code and the li@@ thi@@ um , which has increased demand for years .
in the electric cars there are about three times more than in the normal car , G@@ len@@ core has announced .
even more is needed at charging stations , which is why Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that this will increase demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for bat@@ teries in electric cars will mean additional demand for li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ gan@@ ese .
G@@ len@@ core will be able to raise the income from the growing trend in electric cars from the price hik@@ es and from being the world &apos;s largest co@@ balt producer , predi@@ cting the J@@ eff@@ eries Group .
this bro@@ ker company estimates that other winners of the victory of electric cars are F@@ ree@@ port @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ tum Min@@ er@@ als .
the market is reacting to a trend that is already changing .
this year , 70 % of the surface of the EU &apos;s me@@ tal code in London has gone .
the increase in the bub@@ ble was 37 % .
the wheat has also risen to 14 % this year , mainly because of economic growth .
as a share@@ holder of G@@ len@@ core , London increased 20 % , exceeding the price increase for ri@@ val Rio T@@ to Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ on and Ang@@ lo Americ@@ an .
on the side of the b@@ os@@ ses , there are lead companies like Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine , which have to adapt to the new era .
the main end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ day use of the phone is the supply of the bat@@ teries of cars with a petrol and diesel engine .
electric cars use s@@ cle@@ ro@@ ps .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said the Bank of America Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ chi , the analytical leader of the market , Michael W@@ id@@ mer .
the price shift has not yet shown the effect of the dri@@ f@@ ting trend .
cotton has risen by 17 % this year , with prices rising in London for the main industrial metals being the best me@@ tre .
investors can only see the problems on metals in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure that is so bad for lead because it is low @-@ cost oil that keeps the normal cars on the market &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the ven@@ dor Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ s ,
if demand falls , then it will slow .
this can be the case in around ten years .
in the meantime , stricter emission standards will mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which are more frequent in the process of setting up engines based on lead @-@ based bat@@ teries , will be assessed by the international lead and the Ku@@ wait research organisation .
L@@ igh@@ ten metals like alu@@ mini@@ um substitute steel , as a simpler car can drive further away with less electricity .
this can explain as early as 2013 @-@ 2016 an additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes .
this represents 2.7 % of the world production of alu@@ mini@@ um .
this trend is likely to intensify , Mr W@@ id@@ mer said .
the A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um has risen by 13 % this year , as the growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a shortage in the market .
the steel industry is not .
the holding of the ak S@@ by will work with General Motors to use nano@@ technologies to produce mi@@ rac@@ les .
also , Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and the Europe S@@ tro@@ b are trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down in order to withstand the minimum .
&quot; a very strong message should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Pari@@ b@@ asi analy@@ st Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
we in Europe can see some progress .
the end of the oil era may also bring to an end the suffering pla@@ gue .
the cost of soil was about half of this lu@@ mp diesel engine for cars , as cataly@@ sts for the me@@ mo@@ sa@@ ic@@ a , Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ they were .
&quot; many of the raw materials that are now so high @-@ demand , such as oil and pla@@ tin@@ um , may not have any great demand in the future , &quot; said the Na@@ ti@@ x@@ ise raw materials analy@@ sts Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important , but will change in importance in the course of 15 years .
the Pla@@ in@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ y@@ makers believe in continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars .
the leader of Un@@ core , Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , said that in 2025 more hybrid cars would continue to be sold in a b@@ reat@@ h of light cars .
the great hope of the Pla@@ in@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ nes manufacturers in the 10 @-@ year perspective is that of cars based on a hydrogen element developed by To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Mot@@ ori and Hy@@ unda@@ i Mo@@ to@@ sis , which are dependent on pos@@ turing to produce a hydrogen @-@ based electricity .
however , so far , this technology has not yet proved commercial .
&quot; on the road to the electric car , a clear lo@@ opho@@ le seems to be there , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Pari@@ bas@@ i from Br@@ bas@@ et .
the German car manufacturers were also hit very hard in July , as the S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art Court prohibited the use of diesel in the city of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how the financial rules of football affect the transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the exces@@ ses of European football clubs do not prevent the record transfer of the Ney@@ ge World football clubs from the Spanish club of Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main in Barcelona .
any consequences from UEFA , the governing body that domin@@ ates the European game and which has the power to prevent teams from taking part in the tur@@ ni@@ val of the Group of Me@@ is@@ ters ( ME@@ As ) , are expected to wait until after Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ May .
the Financial Rules for the fair play of UEFA in 2011 ( F@@ F@@ F@@ F@@ F@@ F@@ P ) mean that the PS@@ G must at some point prove that the tak@@ e@@ over was funded without massive losses .
EUR 2@@ 22 million was paid to Barcelona ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) for the sole purpose of buying an Austrian who would be out of his contract , and the wages of Ney@@ mark would reach tens of tens of millions of dollars per year .
there are some financial aspects of the integration of the Ney@@ mar into the French club .
PS@@ G will undoubtedly be able to pay the Ney@@ mark and to put its sta@@ ple ri@@ ce on the table such as this money , given that the team is funded by the family in the cell of Q@@ a@@ tar .
C@@ lu@@ mb is allowed to spend a lot of money on recru@@ iting players , but they must balance it with the legal sources of income that will enable them to come out with them in a football business .
F@@ F@@ P was set up by Michel Pla@@ tini , after he was elected as President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that the clubs that would be successful in finding a way into massive debt would actually be doing the wrong thing to de@@ fraud and risk ruin if banks or owners had to give up support .
from 2011 onwards , F@@ P will focus on monitoring their losses instead of being a sports debt .
this amendment means that the model of business used by Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch first in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ sea - to buy a club with potential and then to make a major contribution to improving the team and creating a global brand - will be harder to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of F@@ F@@ F@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can bear the costs of up to EUR 30 million .
and despite the dis@@ repu@@ te of the presidential office of Pla@@ tini in 2015 , his successor to UEFA , Alexander ander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , remains committed to preventing excessive waste .
&quot; F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to reinforce these rules further , &quot; said The associated P@@ C Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , the chief of the UEFA @-@ F@@ P Quartet .
although , in return for the over@@ purchase clause for the EEA , they can allocate this amount to a single payment , for the purpose of accounting , they can allocate it to the full extent of the duration of the agreement .
Mr Ney@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it will be possible to show the transitional charge in the next five years as a sum of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million .
in the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G , together with Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ i in Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , received the most severe sanctions .
the PS was fined â‚¬ 60 million ( at this moment at a rate of $ 82 million ) , which was subsequently reduced to â‚¬ 20 million , and was required to limit the team of Me@@ ici@@ ans during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season to 21 players instead of business as usual 25 .
UEFA is seeking clubs that can try to ro@@ ck over the regulatory institutions by ex@@ tri@@ cating their income through companies connected to the owners of the club .
while the Q@@ a@@ tar company may spon@@ sor the PS@@ G , if the value of spon@@ sorship is deemed to be above standard market rates , UEFA would not accept this as an official income .
this was the case in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of the PS support for the Q@@ a@@ tar Tourism Authority was s@@ tun@@ ed .
it has been said that a certain proportion of the Ney@@ mar &apos;s PS@@ G services could come from Ka@@ infrastructure through payments by the World C@@ up Board of 20 May .
however , the PS@@ G and Ka@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ ra could become a world champi@@ on@@ ship and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulators could easily reveal such an manoeuvre .
the penalties imposed on the PS@@ G in the past mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation on Thursday said that UEFA had not discussed the transition from the PS@@ G to Ney@@ mark pro@@ actively .
they have stated with The &apos; The City Guard &apos; , provided that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PS@@ G .
reports published recently show that , during the 2015 @-@ 2016 season , more than â‚¬ 10 million in profits for the total amount of around â‚¬ 54@@ 2.4 million .
the data from the last financial year have not yet been published .
the PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ mark will have a positive effect on spon@@ sorship transactions , on trade in goods and on sales of s@@ nus .
the shield is looking forward to an increase of at least 30 % in the order of business as regards the conclusion of the agreement .
too , as Spain is clearly anno@@ yed about leaving one of the largest football sta@@ rs , it tried to prevent the transition , claiming that the PS@@ G is in breach of F@@ P .
&apos;@@ This is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with the club and with the State , &apos; said President Javier T@@ eb@@ as , Spain &apos;s newspaper , with the exception of Ka@@ ent .
Ar@@ pol W@@ rian , a re@@ mit@@ ne@@ de@@ rous , a lawyer whose club belongs to the American sporting mag@@ net , shares the attitude of La with the latter that the state is financing the club .
&quot; this is the result of ownership and has completely changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; if the club forms part of the country , then everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the country can have other ways or interests to represent such a major player . &quot;
the Norwegian low @-@ cost airline has a nice tradition of putting on board the pic@@ tures of those who have moved borders in the more o@@ iling area and have been inspired by others , and they are writing tri@@ p@@ p@@ .e@@ e

Fif@@ ty years ago today : the g@@ loom@@ y storm of the hur@@ ric@@ ane in Estonia , which was fo@@ ol@@ ish in ro@@ of@@ s and win@@ dows .
the hur@@ ric@@ ane , which was mentioned as a stor@@ my for the century , which was ra@@ ging on 6 and 7 August , resulted in major damage , particularly to the West , the Car@@ the@@ d@@ onian and the Rap@@ id countries .
in the north @-@ west Estonia , over 30 m / s was at the wind during these days .
in my old me@@ dal , a single @-@ seat in the gar@@ den was running from the be@@ ach to the other side and it was a f@@ us@@ s to support them .
everything was blind and sophisticated , as was the world lesson .
the beneficiary had already been flying from houses , and in 2002 , an old woman , L@@ inda K@@ uro@@ va , reminded the magaz@@ ine in an interview with Estonian Nature .
the wife of L@@ inda saw how the t@@ ree he was sitting in .
what , though , are you going to be able to give a hand of support in which you are suffering such stor@@ ms ?
the sea came under the window , from win@@ dows in glas@@ ses , &apos; she spoke about the Hel@@ las , Mrs L@@ inda , who lived on the streets of Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us Kal@@ da .
the fact that roads were full of trees and the ro@@ of of of the railway station had flo@@ wn 20 @-@ 30 metres away was only next morning .
local people said that behind the Par@@ ale@@ pa there was a bar@@ ge of hope , some were a little bit too long , some han@@ ging .
everyone saw the very frustra@@ ting , the storm went through a ra@@ g@@ ish and pragmatic circle from beautiful old to proud trees like a war .
Western Vir@@ u@@ maa did not suffer particularly badly in the 196@@ 0s compared with Western Estonia in August , but the damage was still severe there , as Vir@@ u@@ maa Official Journal wrote in 2007 .
the De@@ ar Par@@ k and the P@@ ad@@ ise Par@@ k were pain@@ ted in a pain@@ s@@ by fashion , but our para@@ tus par@@ ks too were severely damaged .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured at 35 metres per second , that is to say , 130 km per hour .
on the evening of August , on M@@ eri@@ vÃ¤lj@@ al , a small series of c@@ r@@ ings of lead had said : &quot; mother , mother !
&apos;@@ Can@@ es are in the air and no longer can be signed ! &apos; , Vir@@ u@@ maa Re@@ Journal wrote .
the concept of the Bu@@ il@@ ding in the land of Vil@@ j@@ an@@ di@@ ary was so deci@@ de@@ dly destroyed during the storm that it was decided to be disman@@ tled afterwards .
the Au@@ tor@@ i was not opposed by the designs of the ski h@@ ire of T@@ y@@ r , which was not subsequently restored .
on 12 August 19@@ 62 the newspaper , Pun@@ ane T@@ Ã¤h@@ t , wrote that the cleaning up of towns and settlements from de@@ pressed trees and their ox@@ y@@ gen would slow , and that the population would be free to make a correction to the repair work .
what also hit fer@@ tility crops hard , and the newspaper announced that &apos; party organisations must be an incentive for both maintenance and fer@@ tility stations &apos; .
one can talk about cy@@ an@@ ides if the average speed at wind is over 3@@ 2.7 m / s .
the situation at the ner@@ ve of Estonia will last from 2 November 19@@ 69 , when the Ru@@ h@@ nu@@ l measured at the wind speed of the wind at the rate of 48 m / s .
the only story in the island was broken by a measure , so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be recorded precisely .
secret of bo@@ w@@ y be@@ aches : night @-@ to @-@ site work and poor coastal face
the gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ las of summer will also mean less duplication in the can@@ non areas of Tallinn .
&apos;@@ I@@ f there are , people are on the coast , and if not , there are no people , &apos; , the be@@ er is tru@@ rer of the be@@ ach .
the c@@ and@@ om be@@ ach in the area of S@@ tro@@ om in Northern Tallinn .
they are offered a se@@ am@@ less dri@@ ft by a wi@@ el@@ ding ri@@ pe of sa@@ tu@@ ou@@ ting , which is pl@@ undering the pla@@ te .
in fact , the last one is going through a seven @-@ me@@ tre period in the sand , pul@@ ling out of it a sea ba@@ g and leaving a cross left by the people : bot@@ tom@@ less s@@ ands , cigarette con@@ sole@@ s and so on .
people are still coming on the coast , whether or not the water is so@@ ber .
if it is nice , then people are on the coast , and if not , there are no people , &quot; says Alexand@@ r U@@ so@@ v , the head of the administration of the Pri@@ vate Company , the head of the Cor@@ ps .
there is a bitter duplication at 6.@@ 30 p.m. and there is a ho@@ le in the be@@ ach , because at 8 o &apos;@@ clock , the record must be in order .
the new job is already at four o &apos;@@ clock .
in addition to S@@ tro@@ om , he is still keeping a close eye on the be@@ ach of P@@ iri@@ ta , Har@@ ku La@@ ke , Ka@@ ku@@ mÃ¤@@ e and Pal@@ jas@@ a@@ is P@@ ik@@ ak@@ r .
the amounts of waste have fallen .
years ago , there were many more of this .
people can now already assess what is being done for them , &apos; the U@@ so@@ v who has harves@@ ted the boat for 15 years is telling us .
before it was that , when something new came to a stand@@ still , it was already over the next day .
now , what is in the position is kept on the coast .
price of a clean be@@ arer
one of the greatest entries on the Estonian be@@ aches is the clean @-@ up of a seab@@ ed , or an ad@@ ru .
for example , in the P@@ iri@@ ta coast , it must be transported 400 000 tonnes of coast@@ line time .
&apos;@@ This is an incredible amount &apos; , &apos; notes the U@@ so@@ va .
the second big category is that of municipal lit@@ ter , or all that people leave .
one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ a @-@ half kilometre at the coast of S@@ tro@@ om eight major waste b@@ ent sein@@ ers , which need to be disposed of three times a week .
so much is generated by waste .
however , the cold weather of summer has meant that waste is five times less than it was .
the third type forms part of the abandoned business .
these are mostly bulk products .
as a result , the wave of ten high@@ s out of the sand has gra@@ pp@@ led the slu@@ dge .
these holders will wait for the timber route leading to the be@@ ach .
&quot; normally , they will come out more , but it is normal to catch , &quot; and it is already a disco@@ very that they will soon find them again in the sand .
children are coming on to shores and taking toys to get them in the sand again .
the landfill is being spread
the representative of hospital administrative services Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler conce@@ des that the driving activity of the tra@@ ctor is disrup@@ ted by local authorities .
noise , which runs from night to night to time , is interrupted by the in@@ tra@@ c@@ tured breeding of those living in the vic@@ inity .
however , on a day , this work is impossible .
one month , the ro@@ ck has to be driven twice .
&apos;@@ I@@ f we do not , the city section will fine us &apos; , Mr Sch@@ ol@@ ler will note .
however , like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ r and Per@@ sia , the aim is to get S@@ tro@@ omi rand below the international s@@ ini@@ mon@@ g quality mark .
&quot; there is much more work in Estonia to keep the be@@ aches &apos; , says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more ana@@ the@@ ses and more difficulty in talking about sand .
what is more , there is less rub@@ b@@ ish on our be@@ aches than there is in Europe .
when I hear that there is talk of waste in the floor , Martin , who lives near S@@ tro@@ om &apos;s be@@ ach , is suddenly playing around with a journalist and a team of cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ating staff , highlighting the current bottlenecks .
Hom@@ mi@@ min@@ t is a sight everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is with birds and pu@@ mps who have pul@@ led rub@@ b@@ ish bags in the b@@ ath , &quot;
although it is difficult to assume that people can change the behaviour they have hitherto pursued , Martin hopes that the city &apos;s government will take action with the b@@ read@@ ers and , for example , will impose on them a car@@ ve to stop at least birds from af@@ oo@@ t .
however , in general , Martin is satisfied with the development of S@@ tro@@ omi &apos;s ran@@ k .
we can see that the city is taking care of this .
with the roads that are nur@@ tured , lit and fresh as@@ ph@@ or@@ ised , it has become more pleasant .
it was never the case that only one way was to go on on the subject &apos; , Mr Martin notes .
A@@ ar@@ de@@ mic findings in S@@ tro@@ om@@ is : coins , only coins
a period of measu@@ re@@ ments of morning has had to be used by a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Dimit@@ r who , as a prox@@ y fuel , ha@@ mp@@ ers a me@@ tal @-@ type reactor along the coast@@ line .
he does not believe that he will find anything in the price , today or in the future .
marine gas@@ ol@@ y is not enough to be generous enough to this .
&quot; I have been working on this year and have not found anything of value so far , &quot; says D@@ mit@@ ry .
as a ca@@ mp@@ us , there are some euro coins , bot@@ tles and also hazardous p@@ ounds in the D@@ mit@@ ry T@@ and@@ y T@@ rap@@ ping , which will subsequently du@@ mp in the b@@ read@@ th .
normally , there are still coins .
&apos;@@ The@@ y , finger and so on are normally not the same thing &apos; , &apos; says &apos; .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level as weak growth and the easing of inflation have cus@@ hi@@ oned speculation in relation to the rise .
Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish , since the tight incomes of households have set their interest rates on hold .
the decision @-@ makers of the Bank &apos;s monetary policy committee ( MP@@ C ) have voted in favour of keeping the rate at 6.@@ 25 % below the rate of 0.@@ 25 % , and fewer members will require an increase this month , as slow growth has weakened support for the up@@ turn .
in its quar@@ terly report on inflation , the Bank has cut the growth forecast for 2017 from 1.7 % and 2018 to its 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on households &apos; incomes would remain , as in the autumn , inflation is expected to rise to 3 % .
however , the bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in rates is necessary to contain inflation from Bre@@ x over the next few years and that financial markets could be the necessary rise in the expected cost of borrowing .
Members also voted a year ago in favour of partially re@@ integrating the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package that was introduced as a result of the Bre@@ x@@ t economy .
the bank will close its fixed @-@ term financing scheme in February , which will provide cheap funding to banks , although it said that it is now expected to offer an increase of GBP 15 billion , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the bank says , &apos; In the M@@ C central forecast gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain power@@ less in the near future , as the difficult situation in real income in households will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
on the subject of rates , it was repeated that in order to mitigate inflation , &apos; some effort is needed in fiscal policy &apos; , and this &apos; somewhat higher &apos; , if the markets are expected .
the BÃ¶ge margin is currently predi@@ cting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second in the year 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any leap would be gradual and limited .
the bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this purpose and for next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
the forecast of 1.8 % growth in 2018 remained .
after this news , the p@@ ound fell the course against the dollar and the euro .
women have fallen by 0.5 % to USD 1.@@ 31 and by 0.@@ 4 % to EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have s@@ pur@@ red on increasing hopes of an increase in GDP in the second quarter of last three months , from 0.2 % to 0.@@ 3 % .
the bank says that the growth is likely to stay at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year , this will start to gain some momentum .
the latest inflation report by the Bank provided little reason to re@@ jo@@ ice in rising inflation and the w@@ ret@@ ched household suffering from an out@@ cry , saying that the situation would go a little further before it could .
it was added that monetary policy cannot prevent an income from striking blow@@ s in the next few years , but a significant recovery is expected for the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
the plu@@ g of the euro also encourages the economy to demand growth in British production , which partly compensa@@ tes for lower costs for consumers .
the decision comes one year after the rate was reached 0.@@ 25 % last August after the shocking EU referendum , which caused a sudden weakening of the p@@ ound .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years to brea@@ the life into the price and the economy in full .
before the bank &apos;s final decision , there was a growing demand for raising the rate , as inflation had increased the pressure on households in the stra@@ its ; in July , three policy @-@ makers were demanding an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell from 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the message from the bank was that it was expected and that there is a return to the rise in the coming months .
the bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was due to a completely weak p@@ ound .
the head of Co@@ rec@@ o mortgage bro@@ kers , Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , said : &apos; in the light of the recent decline in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive again , as len@@ ders are ye@@ arning for work and hoping to complete the year &apos;s positive outcome .
the BÃ¶ge dividend seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are about to come to an end , as re@@ financing , often ear@@ ning a service and low @-@ rate comparison have become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS is writing a drug to tackle 10 000 people , a drug that has led to a contradiction
since September patients have had access to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tional &apos; HIV treatment following a battle held in court after the United Nations on whether or not the N@@ HS should finance the medicine .
N@@ HS announced that public healthcare would now make an initial three @-@ year clinical trial available to 10@@ ,000 people during an estimated 3 @-@ year clinical trial - a ta@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) of pre @-@ exposure to a pre @-@ trial system , which has shown a reduction of approximately 86 % in the risk of infection in cases of high @-@ risk people .
the HS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the Supreme Court supported last year &apos;s decision by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS is capable of paying for Pr@@ EP , despite the authority &apos;s own asser@@ tions that it should finance the medicine itself .
the executive director of N@@ HS Eng@@ land , Simon Ste@@ vens , welcomed the release of this petition as &apos; major new med@@ dling &apos; on Thursday , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as &apos; turning moments &apos; .
the clinical trials in London , B@@ righ@@ ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ l and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to register people , and in October , additional clin@@ ics will be added before the programme is introduced throughout England by April 2018 .
the pre @-@ HIV infection ( Pr@@ EP ) is a hot@@ line for HIV medicines , which is to be taken up before the mid @-@ term , in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV to the risk of infection amongst people .
the adoption of Pr@@ EP before the break means that there are a sufficient number of medicines in the body of the person that prevent HIV infection .
these medicines can be taken on a daily basis or at the latest two hours before the divorce procedure .
eligible candidates for treatment include men of homo@@ sexual or bis@@ ex@@ ual origin , trans@@ gender people and people with partners that are infected with HIV and cannot receive treatment .
the clinical persons will find suitable people willing to participate in a clinical trial , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those who do not receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment as a partner with an HIV treatment .
people who live in England and who have elected a family doctor in the UK can also register their wish to participate in a local hospital clin@@ ic in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and N@@ HS England signed the Treaty in order to obtain medicines this week , following an international procurement procedure .
the purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of the Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who is destined for the medicine , and how it is consumed and implemented in a big picture .
Ste@@ vens said : &apos; this new massive intervention should complement and boost the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV .
this is another milestone in the struggle for more than three decades with one of the greatest health problems in humanity . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , CE@@ O of NA@@ T , said : &quot; this is a turning point in the fight against HIV .
the Pr@@ EP , if targeted correctly at those who need it and are in the risk class , offers an opportunity to transform Britain into an HIV epidemic .
since September , through this clinical attempt , funded by the N@@ HS , people with high risks of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool which is individually managed and is not dependent on dialogue with the partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian Green , Executive Director of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Foundation , said : &apos; now the priority is to ensure that the clinical trial is quickly pushed through the country and that no section of the HIV @-@ related HIV @-@ related group is excluded .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected by HIV .
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , the Minister of Public Health , said : &apos; the start of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delay and the permission of the government &apos;s feet .
evidence shows how much this medicine can bring about in terms of preventing HIV and ending the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will take us one step further towards fully understanding the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
it is now important that a clinical attempt is taken across the country as soon as possible to protect people with HIV exposure and to take us one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the price of electricity in Estonia has risen by 12 % , whereas in Latvia and Lithuania it has decreased .
in July , the difference in the price differ@@ ential between the next day &apos;s stock exchange rate between Latvia and Lithuania fell to 1.@@ 94 euros , compared to â‚¬ 7.@@ 71 in June this year , was announced in Ele@@ ring .
the main reason for this difference is the wealth of the association between Lithuania and Sweden .
in Estonia , the average electricity exchange rate last month was EUR 34.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour , and the price increased by 12 % from June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by 5 % to 3@@ 6.@@ 27 euros per me@@ ga@@ tt .
in Finland the price was EUR 34.@@ 17 and the Nord half of the electricity exchanges had a cost of the system at the same time as EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour .
the prices rose by 12 % and 7 % respectively .
in the 75 % last month , an electricity between Estonia and Finland moved from the last hours towards Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
the other nine % of hours in the next two days were not transactions between the two countries .
in the course of the period , an electricity between Estonia and Latvia was mobile from 99 % of the time to Latvia to 90 % at the Estonian level , with a total capacity for transmission .
according to transactions on the last trading day in July on the Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X market , the wholesale electricity exchange rate in August could reach approximately â‚¬ 34 and â‚¬ 37 in September from the me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour .
the price of carbon dioxide that would affect electricity production last month went up and transactions were made at a price of between 5.@@ 04 and 5.@@ 47 â‚¬ per tonne .
living in higher education - half @-@ hear@@ ted de@@ sig@@ ners and cle@@ ver de@@ sig@@ ners have made it a house for the little Ear@@ ls Court cor@@ k cor@@ k
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker with passion for a building re@@ va@@ ker , replaced her great town of K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in 2014 against the Ear@@ ls Court cor@@ ti in the City of London .
this is in the first order of Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ race and the fact that Jo@@ anne has not combined his bags and has sold on to her house is an honour to a new design .
&quot; before that , I lived together with a former life @-@ co in K@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge on a much larger ground , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I had something that would be equal to the price I have offered .
I was shown this by the Ear@@ ls Court of Justice and it had the same high sco@@ res .
I have spent a head on this and made a deal on the same day . &quot;
since the first visit , this 93 @-@ square me@@ tre cor@@ ps has passed through a full innovation ap@@ para@@ tus .
at the beginning , it was a piece of s@@ lee@@ ping and complex sta@@ ple cor@@ ps : in order to get a s@@ lee@@ ping ball , it had to walk through the kit@@ chen ; Jo@@ anne wanted to add housing and qu@@ asi order to exploit the high levels .
&quot; I wanted to see a lot of light from the top , the big win@@ dows .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
she has nominated the archite@@ ctural and de@@ sig@@ ner of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi , who operates in the hill , Du@@ ck &amp; shed to exploit a home of 3.@@ 8 m above the level , and to create a home that is not just a development site , but a place where Jo@@ anne can live .
as much as there was enough ground to add two spaces to each other , so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create a half @-@ way street in which to stand .
Mr Er@@ fan had to approach the matter in a creative way .
&apos;@@ The structure of the forest is quite complicated , &apos; he explains .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise the facilities so that they are on the other side without having to sit back .
it was not just about building a platform , but rather about using a steel structure to ensure that the level of ambition of both the upper and the lower world is right . &quot;
this emphasis enabled Er@@ fan@@ o to create in the space two rooms with a total e@@ tho@@ s with a number of dramatic elements .
the half @-@ way street is open with the light on the other gla@@ ci@@ er housing in the region under the R@@ et@@ rou@@ us window .
the gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver details and the retro@@ b@@ oon Ser@@ ge Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille light highlight the space for style .
the use of mir@@ rors will play a role in adding theat@@ re , space and lighting .
both sides of a short corridor have been added to the effect that it would appear to be longer .
in K@@ Ã¶Ã¶@@ g , a g@@ host with a mir@@ ror gives the impression of another window of so@@ wing .
on the move , the reflection will provide a reser@@ ving place for all the Ren@@ ta@@ tes and festi@@ vities of Jo@@ anne .
to housing , the possibility of shu@@ tting off vegetables , if not used , will add a more reserved vision .
the g@@ oo@@ ding kit@@ chen is nothing new .
however , there is a unique fact in this kit@@ chen that it is a g@@ rin@@ ding shop of art .
&quot; it has gone a bit to design , &quot; explains the story of M@@ D@@ F , which was spo@@ iled by the ac@@ tion@@ ist cement of Er@@ fan .
&quot; this is a counter@@ weight , which is why it is very simple to put it in motion . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne now has an additional 16 square metres , an additional s@@ lee@@ ping and a better flat plan .
&quot; after all , it is the be@@ rea@@ te that you sell - or that which gives value to property - &apos; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ A far@@ m@@ f@@ land is taking on an historic form of wh@@ im and making calculations based on a surface area of underground land &apos; .
here , they have been able to increase the access to underground space , using high @-@ quality materials which add luxury to the space .
&quot; the materials are what you touched and thus help to create an emotional bond with your home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ You are not we@@ aring the electricity cable in the pig .
this is important , but it is not a question of language @-@ ring@@ ing . &quot;
this shows that a good design and an increased area will help to make something quite ama@@ zing from the normal cor@@ ps .
in fact , they may even be a desire not to leave , as happened to Jo@@ anne .
the main figure , Jen@@ sen , is the main be@@ ac@@ on operating in the H@@ ic@@ ago cloud , which is competing with her colleague for a job .
it is not worth considering the amount of money that is earned , but instead , it is a question of ethics that is forgotten .
the man only sees his wife and three children as a mere early @-@ day and late door .
in the first part of the film , one feels bet@@ ra@@ yed by the idea that it is the version of the business world of the &apos; Ka@@ ar@@ di@@ house &apos; - even in K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s address are similar .
the further proof of the film , the less ac@@ ri@@ c element will remain , and the mor@@ alising intention of the film @-@ makers will increasingly appear .
life @-@ changing experience will mean a cancer for the main pe@@ as@@ ant , the baby .
now we must choose between work and family life .
the po@@ et who is dre@@ aming by the Ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ ct profession makes fathers think in the major buildings of Ch@@ ic@@ ago about what really is important things , such as religion , ch@@ arity , love ... without even affecting the twin sectors .
after the third st@@ ole where a son opens a visible eye , it seems to feel that film @-@ makers have certainly been able to meet the target audience , because even the most basic specta@@ tor of his heart cannot hold back the te@@ ars while seeing the suffering of a pi@@ le @-@ sick army of mal@@ ici@@ ans .
if the son falls into the home and his situation seems to be very hope@@ less , he will ultimately understand the moral mor@@ ality of his work and will do his job to an elderly man who is seeking a ch@@ arity .
now I am putting a stra@@ ta on my own - if a film has a happy film , then I re@@ warding my dis@@ cer@@ n@@ ment after the film coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , then at least one surprise can be praised for at least one .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ic@@ on will be removed from the place - when the spo@@ use calls a sick person and the man is rus@@ hing through the corridor h@@ all in slow motion .
the baby has instead been brea@@ th@@ ed in a wonderful way , and although his father has just lost his job , it is also proving to be positive , because now , after all , there is time to deal with the family .
I , too , feel well - I can predict quite well the end of the American dra@@ ma !
in fact , the film is well designed , and all the elements are there .
one can re@@ sign , can lau@@ gh , the actors are good and the mor@@ ale : the money is not the most important thing in life .
the bitter phrase brings this film well into circulation .
the new staff chief of the T@@ ru@@ k intends to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps Mr Kelly will actually manage this .
in this case , he would be the first .
Mr Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new top of the staff of the White House intends to limit the flow of information that President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in is reaching , including news , in the hope that it will keep the upper hand in a more balanced balance .
here the trial is from Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ i :
&quot; when the new chief of staff for the White House , John F@@ . Kelly , met senior officials on his first day of work , he brought forward a key problem with President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i White in the UK , which he intends to resolve the delivery of poor information in the Maldi@@ ves to the presidential powers .
Mr Kelly said to the officials that information must go through him , whether on paper or in meetings , because the President would do better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried to do so too , and they have failed to track the horse riding on the media .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television dates decades behind and , even now that he is in the White House , his television television television broadcas@@ ts have not gone anywhere .
&quot; when the candidate was anno@@ yed for the unfair media coverage , he was also proved guilty of being reported in the pres@@ ti@@ gious ex@@ ts he was influenced , &quot; the former campaig@@ ner , S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , said to Poli@@ ti@@ us .
the G@@ ood Fla@@ mer wrote at the time that &apos; six former campaig@@ ners said that the key to driving behaviour on the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter is to ensure that his personal media consumption also has a stable praise . &apos;
well , it is .
however , the idea that the habits of using the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is a nonsense .
perhaps those campaig@@ ners will know something that the rest of us do not know otherwise that the Sha@@ kes of T@@ ru@@ p would have been even more hear@@ tening without their intervention .
we probably never know about the figures that were not sent by T@@ ru@@ mp .
if he could rescue him a couple of times from the sha@@ kes , their efforts were worth doing this .
but no one has been able to prevent Opel T@@ ru@@ p from creating po@@ lem@@ ics consistently .
part of the problem is that in the White House , which makes up competing cli@@ cks , people are trying to promote their own interests , without exception , by sending materials to the T@@ ru@@ w , supporting their world view but always not trus@@ ting .
Poli@@ tic@@ o , the whole story story , wrote in May , from the tendency of advis@@ ers to the President to feed , information of strategic value .
one of the examples of the report , Mrs Gold@@ ma@@ cher , is that :
&quot; today &apos;s and former T@@ ru@@ p are telling us that T@@ ru@@ mp can react to a negative press , particularly to information images with detrimental effects , by explo@@ ding , by taking a root idea of identifying their source .
this was the case at the end of February , when someone was lu@@ cky enough to give the President a copy of the Internet provo@@ cative , Charles C. The website in G@@ ot@@ s.@@ New@@ com , which is in his hands , was published on the site , which bla@@ med the de@@ pu@@ tising for the staff chief of the staff , Mrs Ka@@ Wal@@ sh@@ i , for being the White House &apos; a source of a series of information le@@ af@@ lets &apos; .
it is no difference that , because of the mo@@ cking , Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked from Twitter or has not provided any concrete evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and has withdrawn them .
in the T@@ ru@@ mp , you read an article and asked the House about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that the top personnel officer at that time , Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us , and the head of the White House &apos;s office Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; has &quot; tried to establish a system for managing and documentation documents that are ending up in T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did this succeed ?
Mr Kelly is attempting to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than his Pri@@ ber , but T@@ ru@@ mp will remain impul@@ sive and will continue to compete for the sake of his influence .
these ir@@ resis@@ tible factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans who have come from abroad will not be allowed to go on receiving a licence to speak .
in the centre of Tallinn , there is a lot of foreign mus@@ cle .
those with whom the speaker spoke have admitted that he was playing in the old town without the permission of the city .
the first was found at the gates of Vir@@ u , in close proximity to the streets , three people who had taken the same b@@ read@@ th of their homes .
it was clear that mus@@ ici@@ ans with rub@@ b@@ ish and ch@@ op@@ ping @-@ gun clothing were in ab@@ sen@@ tia , and were the ones who had to take one du@@ ke off the March .
despite being so , the only woman in the Chamber in the Lady was playing a la@@ isse@@ z @-@ fa@@ ire story , while one man , alongside her , was playing a gesture of mer@@ cy with three faces in the Congress and pul@@ led the fur@@ th@@ est .
the third man had stood in his house and smoking the di@@ r@@ ty @-@ prepared agricultural cheese himself in his heart .
these three cha@@ mbers did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the people that passed .
the Bo@@ b , who had been co@@ her@@ ating the A@@ cor@@ di@@ on &apos;s No@@ emi and the Pal@@ li@@ on@@ ate , said that he was kis@@ sing on the streets for fu@@ n and money .
the purpose of the exhibition was to collect the ticket price at the same day in the evening of Finland .
in the case of whether they were calling from the towns for mus@@ cle in old areas , No@@ emi and Bo@@ b were sha@@ king their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never be in one town for more than a day or a few days , and most of the time , we will have permits granted for a month or something like that .
there is no point in paying for this , &quot; This is what Boeing is telling us .
when we went back to the gates of Vir@@ u about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women were standing by the mus@@ ici@@ ans and are doing so .
the team of replies to the score of the Vir@@ u centre with cop@@ ies and bags in ab@@ sen@@ tia .
on the Vir@@ u streets , too , three young men from Poland were present , one playing the f@@ ence , another went on display and the third was actually passed on to the electronic glass blood .
&quot; we are here to enter@@ tain people &apos;s dis@@ pleasure to spread music and joy and to make money available for fuel and living , &quot; wrote the tri@@ o from the M@@ iv@@ os@@ h .
according to Mrs M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there must be permission from the city government to be present .
&apos;@@ We do not have this &apos; , of course , he said by jo@@ king .
but we hope that , if people enjoy our mus@@ cles , there is no problem .
of course , if the police comes , then we will go elsewhere , but we must try &apos; .
the Estonian bank purchased bonds for a public programme of central banks in the euro area in July at EUR 149 million , with the central bank having a total increase of EUR 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank will not publish more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Estonian bank , Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , has previously explained in response to the question of the members of the national authorities , that the plan for the re@@ purchase of central banks in the Euro@@ system includes three different purchasing programmes : covered bonds in the financial sector ( covered bonds ) , bonds backed by property ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public bonds ( PS@@ D ) .
the Central Bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage the re@@ selle@@ r who sold bonds to invest elsewhere .
the impact of the purchase is driven by lower @-@ risk assets generating wealth , and this will motivate investors to take on greater risks .
normally , in the framework of the public debt programme , each central bank bu@@ ys its own sovereign debt , while other countries &apos; bonds are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is making so @-@ called &quot; ca@@ king &quot; within the scope of the allocated capacity .
the central banks also have to shop in the countries where the bond provision in the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian bank , confirmed by the H@@ ans@@ son , is generally buying bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the EIB bonds .
the Estonian bank will purchase bonds under its early purchase programme from March 2015 .
in the meantime , bonds were also obtained in Ele@@ ring , but in June 2016 the Estonian bank would no longer buy bonds in the Ele@@ ring .
on behalf of the central banks of the euro area , both the Central Bank of Finland purchase the bonds of Estonia at Ele@@ t@@ tering and Estonia .
migrants ignore the dit@@ ch and come back to &apos; the entity of millions &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est owners of the West Mid@@ lands have once again been caught in the ra@@ ft of confrontation with the determined hard @-@ line actors who have ignored the ca@@ mp@@ us tas@@ ked the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors to win back the ba@@ g from their b@@ read@@ ers .
migrants have boo@@ ked their 20 tra@@ ilers on the path to a prosperous &quot; line &quot; along the path of millions of businesses &quot; on the streets of So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l .
they have returned , together with the w@@ ood@@ land of hor@@ ses , children and trucks , after they were pul@@ led out of the w@@ ret@@ ched only in May , without being dis@@ tracted from the cracy that was du@@ b@@ bed to prevent their intervention by the Council .
the only group found a weak position in the protective limits , turning its own vehicles into a non @-@ deter@@ red part of what was left to be a football .
the people of fu@@ rious gu@@ ys have been conta@@ cted by the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or , saying that the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or is &apos; useless &apos; in tackling the problem .
a anon@@ ymous resident said : &apos; they moved there on Monday evening after their withdrawal from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath , where they were st@@ oned by fur@@ ni@@ tors of the past .
the Council must be ashamed to take action , because it is useless to deal with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were pushed to go and now they are back .
they came on board last night , probably more . &quot;
he added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors know how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect their par@@ ks .
I live on the path of Stre@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k and I am not happy to see that I must continue to have the power to pay the total levy if the Council is not even able to prevent such a thing . &quot;
a local resident who also wanted to stay anon@@ ymous , said : &apos; this is a ridiculous thing ; we have only seen the last of these no@@ vel@@ s left and a new offensive is already under way .
this time , the number has increased and even in the grass@@ land , the horse is seen in ru@@ ins . &quot;
the representative of the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Council said : &apos; we are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the land close to the stre@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k and we are working with the police in So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l ; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
the gathering of evidence will be of great help if as many local residents as possible report any kind of antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour on the police , calling the figure of 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val will be visited by , among others , the Minister for Culture In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is pleased that he has been able to bring true world excellence .
the question as to why We@@ ek@@ end is so important to the pro@@ tag@@ onists at the F@@ esti@@ val is answered by Sa@@ ar that it should be asked from all those who are enjoying the prize in full three days &apos; time .
he does , however , recognise that in the Gulf , real players in his area have arrived .
&quot; looking at the level of artists that has been able to be brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music j@@ arg@@ on are brought home - often not in our body &apos; , the Minister of Culture speaks .
which festi@@ val will the artists present at the F@@ esti@@ val , however , speak up most ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person and for old people of a faith , I think , for one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ uu@@ re@@ n , who stood up last night .
his record has shown that all of us have , at some point , been be@@ ating ourselves on our own feet . &apos;
however , he also highlights a number of other names , such as Cha@@ in@@ smokers , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , the Car@@ in@@ gu@@ a@@ gu@@ a@@ to .
of course , our own Estonian players too : starting with the NO@@ Belder , and they can be read by a whole series .
in reality , this concentration of names , known as , is very high . &apos; says , &apos;

the car industry will renew up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the midst of criticism level@@ led on car manufacturers
the day before the Au@@ ti announcement , B@@ M@@ W said that it would offer a software app for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of B@@ M@@ W , companies believe that &apos; there are wis@@ er options than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the city of B@@ M@@ W , Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that he would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions of diesel engines .
no company described these operations as being the subject of a refund .
European car manufacturers have been actively promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations that have been introduced on CO2 emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide em@@ itted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and could cause as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , the cost of equipment to neutr@@ alise emissions of diesel vehicles is increasing for the automotive industry , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car@@ makers are under thorough investigation , the Federal Chancellor , Angela Merkel , is also accused of har@@ sh@@ ing out powerful automobile manufacturers and of ignoring the signs pointing to the problem .
companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , who was silent about the use of so @-@ called ha@@ em@@ orr@@ ha@@ r devices , which made it possible to adapt emissions @-@ bearing cars to the regulations when testing a car , but which were recalled in normal driving conditions .
several of the heads of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen have been charged with the United States of America and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , a former head of the ther@@ mo@@ dynamic in the Au@@ di motor Development Division was arrested in Germany .
the former President , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o , is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and can be prosecuted in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Au@@ di was placed in a criminal investigation into Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen in Germany , when the authorities accused the introduction of an Audit System to circum@@ vent the European emissions footprint requirements , thereby extending the investigation , which had previously been concentrated in the United States .
the inclusion of the Au@@ di in the investigation may be a major blow to Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen by the enterprise Gar@@ lia in luxury cars disproportionately generates a large proportion of the profits of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen .
Estonian schools will receive a fee of â‚¬ 20 000 for the purposes of the European Union .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy Estonian schools on the EU flags for the purpose of removing the Presidency by 1 September .
taken together , the total figure will be 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 senti@@ metres of the European Union &apos;s 5@@ 70 educational institutions .
the flags are intended to ex@@ pon@@ der in in@@ door spaces , and they must be carried out in the home rooms of high quality printed techniques with an at@@ testa@@ tion , and the ER@@ R &apos;s news portal will be facilitated .
on the flag &apos;s label , the text reads : &apos; Kin@@ gi@@ tus has been able to indicate to Estonian schools the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the supposed cost of the 5@@ 70 flags is EUR 20 000 in the price of the Ministry of Education , or a tie costs EUR 35 .
the journalist &apos;s murder highlights the growing danger in Mexico .
weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers normally gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of S@@ Sin@@ al@@ oa , so@@ wn by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ es@@ s@@ ant drug wars .
but today , under the gu@@ ise of a personal tragedy , they have gathered to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their h@@ aste .
two old wri@@ ters are discussing which seem safer : whether to bring children into an office that was the target target for a personal attack in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words to the top of the agenda in the space : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask repor@@ ters to provide evidence of &apos; tolerance &apos; in every piece of water , and they need to provide evidence , only impres@@ sions and insi@@ ghts .
the under@@ performance of the government or car@@ tels is suspected of being the subject of drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists , as a whole , of being a pa@@ phe@@ rer who is hazardous to reporting the chaos in Mexico .
there are no s@@ pur@@ rs of violence , and the more the bodies over the country accumu@@ late , the majority of them are reported by journalists as being by the Committee for the Protection of journalists , since the inaugu@@ ration of President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena 1980s , in at least 25 . 5@@ 89 journalists have been killed in a state governed by public protection following attacks and threats , and so far in the course of this year , at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states .
the latest casu@@ alties include their edit@@ or and source of inspiration , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den , co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence .
his absence is a deep feeling , even though his presence can be felt anywhere in the wake of the Salafranca pra@@ yer , a big picture of the average figure of our finger , from Val@@ dez , with a headline sentence &apos; Justice &apos; and two 30@@ ken repor@@ ter , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , bears a T @-@ shir@@ t with a portra@@ yal face or a characteristic image of a Lebanese li@@ mo@@ rous pool .
the meeting will take place less than two months after the death of her ; Re@@ por@@ ters will discuss a common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , their dre@@ ams , their obli@@ vi@@ on , their paran@@ o@@ ia .
although in 2010 , a separate Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Defence of the judiciary , only two cases have been taken to account by the judiciary .
as with most of the annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime , the number of murders in thousands , the kil@@ lers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
the edit@@ orial of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce will continue to reflect the violence in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ a , even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without data on murde@@ rers and without justice , the meeting on security , as I@@ bar@@ ra said , will not be of much use .
&quot; it is very good to waste our time in this meeting , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , you will dis@@ trust everyone . &quot;
Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , in the capital state of the State of Lah@@ ti , on the morning of 15 May .
he managed to drive a few quarters just before two men suspended the red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ rol@@ la ; he was forced to leave a car and was shot 12 times , which is presu@@ med to be the name of a newspaper , which means , in translation , the &apos; twelve @-@ th river &apos; .
an armed man dro@@ ve into Val@@ dez &apos;s car and made an accident in the vic@@ inity .
Val@@ dez was the age of 50 years .
he left a woman and two adults .
the images are circu@@ lating freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
however , there is essentially only a silence on the Val@@ dez issue .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition of the United States in January , the Blue authorisation has been one of the most bloody bat@@ tles in the country , because ri@@ val@@ ries are fighting to fill a vacuum of power .
it is no difference that , in the streets of Sin@@ al@@ oa , a few people are being laid off daily or even several people are being shot , or that the dead are gro@@ ssly being glo@@ s@@ sed over by the double @-@ s@@ nat@@ ched ma@@ us@@ ole@@ um of the drug , which is bigger than many homes .
let us not forget for a moment that the time for peace indicates how much the sea side of the valuable ports and the mar@@ sh@@ alling state with drug routes to the United States is run by only one car@@ tel .
despite all this and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , the co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and the Chairman , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , feels a huge com@@ pun@@ ction that he was unable to protect his friend .
he believes that he was favour of having killed two mistakes .
the first was the publication of an interview with the car@@ tel cli@@ ck , which is competing with the son of Gu@@ z@@ man , in a military zone , with D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z in February .
this piece of correspon@@ dence could also have been accompanied by a car@@ pet of gan@@ gs who suspected of being reluctant to use a publication bought all cop@@ ies once they reached the newspaper stories .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after the operation of a crackdown in another newspaper , which had a similar story .
Val@@ dez was leg@@ alised both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had sta@@ yed so long in life that his friends and colleagues had expected him to exist forever .
he served as a ve@@ ter@@ repor@@ ter in the back of No@@ ro@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five of his colleagues to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling 50 @-@ dollar departments .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said that &apos; in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ as it was impossible to deal with the press without tou@@ ching on the problem of nar@@ co@@ tics &apos; .
the newspaper has been gathering up to date with its b@@ older and fair statements , and the sale and advertising grew .
the car@@ cas@@ ses showed a strong investigation without having to be subject to a great sense of censorship and a printing of read@@ ers , which they were able to read stories that no one else could dare to report .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspaper won the pres@@ ti@@ gious award for its Latin American refle@@ ctions , Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot .
in the same year , the Commission for the Defence of journalists ( AK@@ K ) won the International Prize for Freedom of the Press for their courage to follow the Mexic@@ an drug addiction wherever it leads .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&apos;@@ I want to live on , &apos; he said &apos; by adopting the AK@@ K prize .
last October , in an interview with the television channel Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV , he said in an interview that drug trafficking is a way of life in S@@ ha@@ space .
&quot; our head is to accept the role that the journalist &apos;s office has had a second chance to play .
I do not want to ask what I did in the face of so many pressures , or why I did not talk about what is happening . &quot;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ ktii@@ v stri@@ ves a man of Val@@ dez , a jo@@ y@@ man who ro@@ wed like a mad@@ man , a friend who gene@@ rously shared the seeds and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they supported his rou@@ tine .
he always carried his hat .
he went from the office to El Guatem@@ ei@@ y@@ ab@@ o bar and was always sitting on the same des@@ k .
they are now asking whether his love for rou@@ tine has been accompanied by him .
his death has also left them to question how best to do their job and stay in life .
&apos;@@ We do not like to hear how ri@@ gi@@ d@@ dled the w@@ ings of these women , their children , their legitimate business , are with their secret landing pla@@ tes used to carry drugs &apos; .
&apos;@@ The@@ refore , these things should not have been touched &apos; , &apos; said by Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result , even in the best time , is strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ respect .
entr@@ us@@ ting their in@@ st@@ in@@ tures .
if it is a matter of mon@@ gering , then a hotel is thrown away .
as And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ al edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce said , the problem is that &apos; the od@@ our can be chea@@ ted ... and so was that of J@@ avi@@ er &apos; .
he and others say that in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ a , the old rules no longer apply , just as they do not apply to the toxic combination of the pal@@ try routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials in Thailand , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ iro or other states that are home to the gro@@ tes@@ que trafficking routes , to the toxic combination of the weak institutions and to the corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in a space where the workers of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , mobile telephone networks were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days before , it was revealed that only a but@@ ware sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in front of the House , two police officers sought relief from the 40 @-@ degree monthly pu@@ mp , in the shadow of the wood .
the government has ordered them to elect the office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , located in the B@@ or@@ ral building in the central Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an neighbourhood .
some repor@@ ters were wondering , in half , whether these police officers were among the 50 % of the police officers whose govern@@ ors themselves have been carrying out an un@@ reliable test .
several months have passed since reports have moved into mountain areas where controls are in the hands of de facto drug gan@@ gs .
the publication of this week by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce addressed three key le@@ ctures .
one of these was the murder of the former bo@@ xing leg@@ end Ju@@ li@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez ven@@ na in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ a .
moreover , they had an un@@ covered story of spending the government &apos;s money on the home town of the govern@@ or .
and the group of people from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , located from the office of the Prosecutor &apos;s office , which is one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants , to be kidna@@ pped by a group of people .
there was no official announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how it was going to happen , so caution had to be exercised when it was time to write what everyone in the town knows as being a position of attitude to both drug traffickers and authorities .
the film was made aware of the public documents that a restaur@@ ant is registered with the names of a politician who is in power in an Institu@@ tional Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) that dominated all the political levels almost throughout the last century .
recently , several of the leaders of the IR@@ P Governor have been accused of a large @-@ scale corruption of cases .
the Vil@@ lar@@ line has asked the repor@@ ter to write previous incidents in the same place , including the way in which the son of Gu@@ z@@ man , who wear the name El Chap@@ man , esca@@ ped from a military record .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have been looking to the co@@ ca of Val@@ dez to get information on kidna@@ pping from the best sources .
&quot; in the past , we would have known what happened , &quot; said a 46 @-@ year @-@ old village where the body building of a bun@@ ch has served as a slogan to him or her .
&quot; now , all channels of communication have broken down our sources . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has become the ref@@ ra@@ ining for the eyes and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the members of the edit@@ orial workers have become something that they could never expect in the name of the activists in the name of the press .
the Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez took a few bridges and , next morning , went to the office of local Public Prosecutor to protest for another journalist .
Mr Salvador A@@ ka@@ h disappeared in the western state of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an three days after the murder of Val@@ dez .
the body of bodies has been bur@@ nt down and , according to officials , it belongs to them on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists have become more audi@@ ble throughout the country and are cri@@ pp@@ ling as organised protests on the th@@ reads &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; and buildings .
on this day , President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez has been in Washington in an attempt to gather international support in the Val@@ dez case for justice .
the day after the death of Val@@ dez in a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa , the Ra@@ mi@@ rez authorities accused journalists of being detained in a nu@@ ance and being killed for telling the truth .
after that , he asked him to be guided by the government &apos;s actions elsewhere , concerned that hatred has affected his objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists were &apos; in step with &apos; be@@ ac@@ on in the form of organised crime , compli@@ city from national officials and a half @-@ hear@@ ted society &apos; .
in his latest book &apos; Drug press &apos; he wrote that &apos; repor@@ ters are not only being killed by drug gan@@ gs &apos; , but are also being killed at the be@@ h@@ est of the political and security forces , who are in a mes@@ sy manner .
the Media Monitoring Group , Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 , issued over half of the attacks on journalists to the police and civil servants last year .
&apos;@@ In Mexico , you are trying to keep quiet , &apos; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
the murde@@ rers are obviously having ver@@ sa@@ tile effects .
nobody will forget the death of blo@@ g@@ ger Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ d six years ago .
she was found dead in a piece of body which I think had been signed in a car@@ tel , L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas , &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
his fun@@ eral , next to his gun@@ s , was broken by computer stands and de@@ ser@@ ted head@@ phones .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of the northern state of Com@@ man@@ a@@ hu@@ a , Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ hu@@ a , after the killing of their correspon@@ dent Armenia , Barbara vÃ¤ikeettevÃµtetele S@@ la@@ va h , in March .
others will continue to do so as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do did after the murder of their president in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the edit@@ orial list &apos; What do you want us ? &apos; .
some journalists have fled from their national states , or even from their country .
this is a ner@@ ve decision .
it is difficult to find work in the wrong zone and they still have to gra@@ b the streets in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes , they are being driven by , as probably happened in the photo@@ graph , Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , murdered in 2015 with four women in one of the reme@@ mb@@ rance sites in Mexico three months after the crackdown on Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z@@ on .
those who remain in place and continue to work must refu@@ te the risky decisions on a daily basis .
the I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to become a po@@ et , recognises that he is terri@@ fied by reporting the nar@@ co@@ tics trade .
&quot; Mexico is on the way to hell and that is why I will report , &quot; said .
at a mid@@ night of a recent Friday , when the latest figure had already been s@@ lit , the edit@@ ators of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the way to office and be@@ er the ro@@ ck , when suddenly all the phones began to telephone .
in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ i , the gu@@ est in the R@@ and@@ ina@@ via town , 19 people had died in fire @-@ fighting campaigns between ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces .
the war was continuing to equ@@ ate , as were the many messages from car@@ tels found in the area .
on the ver@@ ge of the same line , repor@@ ters u@@ plo@@ aded up the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce site using a mobile phone .
the front @-@ line for next day needed to change .
the authorities were killed by another fire in the region .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was on the side of the police in the custody to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not at least show this .
under a massive book book book @-@ foun@@ der , where the average finger of his bul@@ l is to be seen in all Sin@@ al@@ o@@ ia , the workers of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce took on his tra@@ ils .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w can one think of closing down at all , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; when , on the same day that Javier Javier died , the appren@@ tice asked me to send him to report on the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur used a defence colour to avoid enemies
at first g@@ lance , this seems like a form , albeit rather a fe@@ e@@ ble one .
scientists have now revealed the first findings concerning the supposedly un@@ beli@@ evable levels of convergence discovered by a Canadian min@@ able pu@@ mp , which are so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; an added of &apos; din@@ osa@@ urs Mon@@ a . &apos;
it has been so well preserved that it was even possible to find out that the lea@@ ther covered by his so@@ y@@ bean was a red @-@ Brown colour and had had had had some &apos; complicated &apos; past .
the report published in the Journal &apos; &quot; La Bi@@ ology &quot; described the existence of &quot; the best preserved so@@ om@@ re , which has ever been detected &quot; and &quot; one of the best din@@ osa@@ ur characteristics worldwide . &quot;
in the case of fossil , this is a new type of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ic that lived in the middle of a storm , between 110 and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly good storage in ra@@ ison was awarded to scientists who describe it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
this vege@@ tarian , covered by soya , is the best preserved in the ph@@ os@@ p@@ here of the magaz@@ ine , according to the National Ge@@ o@@ graphic , which has ever been found .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k found this , when he extra@@ cted the Ã‰@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine in For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
he has been hit by something that did not recall the stra@@ w and has decided to look into it .
the po@@ ison@@ ous muse@@ um of the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell was sent to the Al@@ p@@ on@@ ic M@@ use@@ um .
the next six years were created to expe@@ l the animal from the land area of 2 500 p@@ ounds ( 1 100 km ) .
after all this hard work , the end result is now finally ready to bring to the public .
&quot; if you b@@ ent a little mind , you can almost believe that she is s@@ lee@@ ping , &apos; said the leading author , Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , a scien@@ tist in the M@@ use@@ ability of Ro@@ yal T@@ rel@@ l , where the presence is being assa@@ ul@@ ted .
&quot; this will go down in the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osa@@ ur@@ bias - the din@@ osa@@ urs Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &quot;
he found in a s@@ kin@@ t that the her@@ o who , while covered by so@@ y@@ bean and re@@ minis@@ cent of a wal@@ king tan@@ k , was likely to be significantly threatened by food din@@ k .
this din@@ din@@ osa@@ ur , with a high level of soya , used red and white forms of protection to fo@@ ck himself against pre@@ da@@ tors and implemented a sha@@ king technique , which is called a sha@@ m and is also used by many animals today .
this allowed din@@ osa@@ ur to be absor@@ bed better in the region and prevented the enemies , as the major din@@ osa@@ ur pressure probably found him to be hun@@ t .
this figure of 110 million no@@ do@@ sa@@ ic families , which is now in the news for the first time , reached the news in May and is now in the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ ch@@ ology M@@ use@@ um .
the Ad@@ vis@@ ers have now investigated and given this name to Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta Mar@@ mit@@ l@@ or &apos;s muse@@ um , according to mark Mitchell , the famous team that spent over 7 000 hours to un@@ cover a demanding animal .
thanks to the aston@@ ishing good preservation of the father , Dr Mitchell and the team of international scientists have been able to document the shape and size of the z@@ om@@ y of the body .
they discovered a sha@@ dow@@ y - a method of protection in animal states , which means that the head of the m@@ ood was a dark spot than a down@@ fall .
although the un@@ cover is widespread , the findings come as a surprise , as the Vene@@ to is much larger than the animals with mixed pat@@ ro@@ ls today .
this suggests that din@@ osa@@ ur hunting was sufficiently actively motivated by other din@@ osa@@ ur din@@ osa@@ ur pressure that the evolution was preferable to over@@ sha@@ do@@ wing the failure of the failure to act as a &apos; survival &apos; approach .
however , most of the animals that use today &apos;s un@@ sha@@ dy - such as fears , s@@ kin@@ s or b@@ ars - are much smaller and more vulnerable to harves@@ ts , which indicate that no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us had to struggle to survive .
&quot; the vigorous cooling of din@@ osa@@ ur contamination , covered by massive and high levels of soya , shows how dangerous the animals of din@@ ance in the Re@@ lic era could have been , &quot; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds of So@@ om@@ seed also revealed that the lea@@ ther of din@@ osa@@ ur pressure was the red box .
scientists will continue to investigate to get indications of this life , including the content that has been preserved in this warm form , in order to find out what the animal will be the last to have to do with the past .
they believe that din@@ osa@@ ur pressure fell into the dead rivers , thus reaching the sea with a stream of water , where they were left over to the ocean .
at the time , Alber@@ tas was the same soya as is now the case in the Eastern F@@ l@@ ori@@ qu@@ ity , and rivers and oceans were probably much further stret@@ ched into the inland land than they do today .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ inity is truly remarkable as it is fully covered by so@@ om@@ y sk@@ in , while it has remained in three dimensions , preserving its original shape , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; as a result , today , the animal sees the almost identical picture of the century .
there is not much to be imag@@ in@@ ative in this reconstruction : it is enough simply to b@@ lend our eyes and it seems like a s@@ le@@ ep . &quot;
the time for the crisis was when , on land , huge red @-@ co@@ ws of meat @-@ tur@@ f me@@ ters - tero@@ gene@@ ous ap@@ ples .
although their King , Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x , lived for millions of years after Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , some of his for@@ mi@@ dable predecess@@ ors could hun@@ t this dy@@ s@@ wor@@ n @-@ in @-@ house pressure .
these include the long and six tonnes of mon@@ ster , which includes A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ contamination , with 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) .
scientists whose recent findings are published in the current Bi@@ ology magaz@@ ine believe that Boeing &apos;s s@@ tun@@ t after death in the sea and this mu@@ tu@@ ality was repli@@ cated .
on 21 March 2011 , the pre@@ sup@@ position was discovered by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he mined the Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine in the region of For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
the best preserved , as the other example suggests , is the so@@ om@@ din@@ din@@ ance in the world , including lea@@ ther and so@@ y@@ o@@ y , and it is a total concentration up to the timber .
these assumptions were on average with a total of 18 feet ( five metres ) and were cap@@ tured at up to GBP 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .
two hundred and thirty @-@ seven thousand customs sta@@ rs sta@@ mped out of this .
scientists believe that this vege@@ tation that is covered by soya will be through the current pla@@ gue in western Canada , as long as the river floo@@ ded into the open sea .
however , the se@@ ques@@ tration site at sea of din@@ osa@@ ur was able to preserve its fin@@ ely detailed nature .
the coal residues of this particular father are so well preserved that the ti@@ dal boo@@ ts of the my@@ th@@ ological so@@ me@@ teries continue to cover the sk@@ in residues .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote in the Journal of the National Ge@@ o@@ graphic : &apos; this ce@@ me@@ tery is as rare as a lo@@ to@@ victory .
the more I look at this , the more incredible it seems .
the lea@@ ther residues from the boo@@ m continue to cover the creation of my@@ th@@ ical so@@ y@@ bean stands in the y@@ el@@ low .
a better first prize is distributed to him and five of the assets are si@@ ted up@@ wards .
I can read the so@@ y@@ o@@ ws that are on his kne@@ es . &quot;
how did one activist get a response to the question &apos; whose streets are ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll received a total shock .
just days after travelling to New York , it was published on a to@@ ken bed by Lou@@ isi &apos;s resident , Air@@ b@@ b , on a do@@ se bed , in S@@ r@@ ings , Facebook .
he got on to the post of his successor in his own case .
it read : &apos; the police killed a young ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ent of 18 years ago and is still rolling out on the streets &apos; .
he was confused as to why nobody else had posted this information on his bed , which is why he closed down Facebook and opened the Twitter .
the postal services of the P@@ ide@@ mega @ The@@ e@@ P@@ haro@@ ah users were repeatedly transmitted in line with his line of time .
the di@@ r@@ ty tape@@ wor@@ m from the Lou@@ am site broadcast real @-@ time sÃ¤@@ da , Michael Brown , the death of an un@@ armed , 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by a white officer in Fer@@ gus@@ onis Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is .
he has de@@ briefed the image of the room in Bro@@ w@@ n , which was on the streets , remaining there for four hours .
&apos;@@ This is cra@@ zy , &apos; J@@ ust thinking about the quo@@ tations by Mrs Ferreira .
however , the death was nothing new for him or his community .
he has swit@@ ched off his phone , but later this evening saw the rest of the retention , which this time announced the accumulation of people on the Can@@ field in D@@ ri@@ ve .
P@@ ic@@ tures of the police and the people who were afraid of the attack and who claimed to be in the hands of Brown and kept a label with the label &apos; The Fer@@ gus@@ on police killed just my un@@ armed bo@@ y ! &apos;
he looked on in real time a bed in which the police officer stood in front of the group of prote@@ sters with a gra@@ b .
in the second video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I will kill you all ... &apos; .
Mr Fer@@ rell is a reminder of how he has been looking at the thought : &apos; this is unusual . &apos;
&quot; this is not a murder of this kind with which we are ac@@ custo@@ med and could call a typical . &quot;
at this time , I felt the hear@@ tless .
I was ang@@ ry and I was afraid . &quot;
he boo@@ ked a flight and then travelled home the next day .
having been bu@@ ried at 23 o &apos;@@ clock , he left her father with his six @-@ year @-@ old da@@ u@@ ghter and decided that they would travel to Fer@@ gus@@ on next morning .
what happened to Fer@@ rel@@ li and Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ el over the next three years is the central issue in the new document entitled &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; , whose &apos; whose streets ? &apos; , which is appearing in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
this is the story of survival and the protests , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those people who live in this community and who have fulfilled the streets by demanding replies .
if the ball , with a ty@@ rant - who had a flow@@ er ta@@ ll and a good cro@@ wn with it - dro@@ ve the Fer@@ gus@@ on , they again spoke about a subject that they had repeatedly spoken before this morning - the experience and living conditions of black people .
&apos;@@ D@@ o you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; , &apos; he is reminding himself of the question ?
&quot; we are now travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old bo@@ y , and that is not right . &quot;
&apos;@@ I could not take him on board , &apos; said , Commissioner , at a later date .
&quot; what is happening now is the cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
he must know and see this and must grow in the middle .
he must learn about the organisation and organisation of a body , and at the same time know the different la@@ yers of experiences and living conditions for the black , and what we must do to be free and free .
even if I can bring him up so that he is not personally familiar with blatant racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel I would do a dis@@ service to him if I were to defend him against this world . &quot;
the first suspension they made in the presence of Fer@@ gus@@ on was on the South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ t &apos;s way - from the police station to the road@@ way , which had become a sort of camp pla@@ gue , where the activists were awaiting news of the police officer Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not even charged at the end .
there , the Cop@@ ll and her da@@ u@@ ghter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared the southern ones .
they put together the food bags and helped to distribute them to prote@@ sters .
for the Fer@@ rel@@ li , a new type of activist was slowly taking shape .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , &apos; W@@ hen he was a Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ isi , a student at the University of Lou@@ isi , he was the President of the Association of minority students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in the non @-@ performing communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organising .
this is all just a flat . &quot;
after weeks , during a demonstration in the evening , Mrs Ferre@@ ll met a film with a fellow film fo@@ cal Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ i .
the prize was said by him and by the film operator , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , wanted simply to document what is going on .
the question that arose from the example of the Fer@@ rel@@ li was : &apos; are you trying to document what is going on or do you try to find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
this scepticism was due to a number of cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to profit from its efficacy and resilience .
the prize was explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voices of people born and born in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard and we wanted to do so in a different way &apos; .
the prize had already been beaten by the film director D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ in , the man in the region , who was well @-@ known for being a activist for the purpose of being sentenced to death .
his involvement made the project heated by Mr Fer@@ rel@@ li and by another six for the local communities that were tra@@ cked by the team after the shooting of Brown for years .
&quot; no one in this docu@@ mentary po@@ t is talking to us for us , no one talking to us , but we are speaking to us , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; it was important to me how these people are portra@@ yed , because I am also portra@@ yed as being . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rel@@ li , it was to show that the movement was not about &apos; the head of the harvest but about community coming together &apos; , as the Fo@@ lay@@ man said , made it the most open actor in the film .
as a result , &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; is documented in a aston@@ ishing personal way by the life of Fer@@ rel@@ li , such as the gra@@ phen@@ y@@ l@@ isation and the practice of marriage with one &apos;s wife .
&quot; I felt I was wrong , &quot; said Mr Ferre@@ ll , &apos; W@@ hen I was laugh@@ ing at the first time , when he was prepared for a town .
&quot; however , I have realised that the human enrichment of this work and its black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the Fer@@ rel@@ li story emphasises and puts the role of the black homo@@ sexual woman again at the centre of the broader Black Sea in the Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three initi@@ ators of the movement who thought in the social media in 2012 of the h@@ ash@@ ta@@ g , following the killing of the black teen@@ ag@@ er Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , are gay .
&quot; in a leading role , women of black age have kept movement in general , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll , &quot; and this is precisely because we have to fight on a number of fronts .
the black homo@@ sexual women must bear all this burden . &quot;
the pho@@ to accepted , noting that &apos; the movement is indeed kept in life by black women and many of these are black gay women &apos; .
he says , however , &apos; This is not a kind of &apos; act of equal opportunity &apos; - that the film was not chosen as the focus of the film because of his identity .
&apos;@@ he was a man who was hot air , &apos; he said .
&quot; however , it is no coincidence that he is on the front@@ line , because there is a lot at stake as a homo@@ sexual woman living in such no@@ vel@@ s .
his energy can be percep@@ ted through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news camer@@ as from Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ el have been gone a long time ago , but the racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the suspended suspended sentence imposed on Mr. Fer@@ rell during the demonstration in favour of blocking the road haulage route will last for another 2.5 years .
he describes the social policy climate in the region he calls home simply as &apos; a threat to massive freedom &apos; .
nonetheless , he still attaches great importance to the man@@ tra that he has gar@@ ded from the time of his memory , which was the scene of the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ oni only three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our own freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
7 fac@@ tshe@@ et on how to overcome the fa@@ ire of We@@ ek@@ t
some of the b@@ read@@ th boys will find , after a wave of hot air , that there is a problem , including help .
or on the basis of the saying &apos; avoid a po@@ mel@@ le , stop a gun . &apos;
however , this is just unavoidable postponement and a good hu@@ m@@ our for health .
what can you do to better feel in the morning after today and after tomorrow &apos;s We@@ ek@@ ent cycle - or whatever else - and get round the po@@ p@@ pi@@ l as pain@@ lessly as possible ?
Jo@@ o Water .
alcohol was below and above alcohol , after a great deal of pain in the morning ... or , if possible , even in the form of alcohol .
since the body loses a lot of liquids when it uses alcohol , it must somehow be recovered .
along with water , miner@@ als are also being dis@@ per@@ sed from the body and s@@ tun@@ ning is a good ha@@ ir to mineral water .
since , after being me@@ ted out , the bu@@ ck is often irri@@ tated , it is particularly good that it is being thrown off or merely easily stra@@ ined .
W@@ h@@ y to walk .
surely , with po@@ mel@@ l , the car@@ ve @-@ up of trees would not cost the b@@ ath - it could be fatal to mis@@ lead .
but a slight turn of history helps the body to recall again what it is like to be alive .
S@@ cra@@ pping in T@@ sy and s@@ lee@@ ping out po@@ h@@ ma@@ ka are a more time @-@ consuming way to get out .
give the body a little bit of energy back and with caution .
if you are already starting to get to the test of drinking yesterday , it is certainly not worth trying to charge the price a great fat boat .
let me start , for example , with a new volume of plan@@ tations containing tra@@ ps containing trees to keep on maintaining their body in silence .
if health already suffers around the south , then , for example , pul@@ se trees could be tested .
and a little later , the word &apos; clarity &apos; .
the time for departure .
this di@@ u@@ zy@@ alist will free you from your body from the last piece of water .
as has already been said , water and scale are your friends .
we are doing what we can to the pain@@ kil@@ lers .
if a car@@ te ro@@ d is to be pain@@ kil@@ ler in the evening to prevent po@@ ch , then you must tackle not only alcohol but also alcohol but also the per@@ se@@ ph@@ et or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ f@@ en and lose the capacity .
this is the case with even more clo@@ thes of their pay and , in the future , the bo@@ w@@ ls will be worse .
moreover , there is not much to be pain@@ kil@@ ler in the body of dog@@ mas .
if you are a pain@@ kil@@ ler in the morning , you will not do it with a blan@@ k f@@ ty th@@ read - it will irri@@ tate your already di@@ r@@ ti@@ med ma@@ ze .
or , if you do not take a partner , you will get a good deal with yourself .
it is about doing the same thing as wal@@ king , but not by wal@@ king the boat .
however , there was an excessive rate of speed and ex@@ ci@@ tement in the shop - the physical effort should be moderate during the po@@ ch .
a path to fu@@ n .
the story of the rub@@ ber with friends of the time , the easy feeding and the na@@ era am@@ ic@@ ably , both for themselves and for others ( suffering ) .
the ro@@ stru@@ m and the wife may not be able to take a po@@ ker off , but surely they can help to make a more enter@@ taining impression .
once , a po@@ ker is going over anyway !
University of Ox@@ ford , Professor of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and a university member is being sought as suspects in a murder !
according to the police , a profes@@ sor of the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and a member of the University of Ox@@ ford are sought nation@@ ali@@ zed by a worker who has been given suspects after the deadly w@@ ound of bi@@ tes in a man &apos;s province , in a one place of the Ch@@ ic@@ ago luxury bas@@ ket .
according to the judicial documents of the C@@ oo@@ k Region on Monday , arrests of a 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and of 56 years of imprisonment were issued on account of their alleged involvement in the murder of T@@ ren@@ ton H. Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ le@@ u .
according to the documents , the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ u died after repeated ha@@ vo@@ w .
the warning that the Ch@@ ic@@ ago police station issued to the community was that the body of the bodies was found on 27 July .
police officers received telephone calls and found a victim on arrival in the Grand Pla@@ za Kor@@ ter@@ rand , whose body had a number of pi@@ tu@@ late @-@ listed bodies .
according to officials , the Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ u lea@@ f was recognised as dead and the investi@@ g@@ ators treat se@@ ating as murder , while the police actively search two suspects .
since 2007 , La@@ w@@ on has been working as a co @-@ professor of micro@@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at the University of North@@ w@@ ester .
in a statement sent as e @-@ publishing , Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , Vice @-@ President for Public Relations from the University of universities , said that the La@@ w@@ are has now been temporarily removed from employment and is prohibited from entering the town of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n University .
&quot; this is now a criminal act being investigated by the competent authorities , and the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n is working with the investi@@ g@@ ators , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ arre@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant in the financial institution of Ox@@ ford .
a representative from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in a statement communicated as e @-@ publishing : &apos; we have been in touch with the British Police and ready to assist the US investigation authorities in any way possible &apos; .
moreover , the statement stated that the fellow Members from War@@ re are appal@@ led and wish for him to extra@@ dite himself .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , Head of the Delegation for Communications of the Police Department of Ch@@ ic@@ ago , urges the authorities to give in to the authorities on suspicion .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are present , but we are increasingly busy in defining the exact location , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , the suspects are helped by local , regional and national authorities .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police received a telephone call from administra@@ tors of the Grand Pla@@ za Kor@@ ter@@ rand , who had just received a ch@@ ry@@ p@@ tic indication that something had happened in the ch@@ ry@@ p@@ tic exhibition .
according to the police , this was a ma@@ gic specta@@ cle .
according to the statement by G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , it is not clear whether the event itself was also held on 27 July .
he said that the camer@@ as would confirm the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ mil and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the management of the Grand Pla@@ za wrote to the inhabitants : &apos; the police are currently working to identify the cli@@ ron@@ ology of events and the victim &apos;s background , and will examine various mo@@ tives , including the possibility of a family dispute . &apos;
the companies that will help your company to avoid getting the next one .
Mr Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure the satisfaction of his own company in the opening up of e @-@ commerce with satisfaction of workers , but the poll was un@@ helpful .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is leading an e @-@ commerce company with 75 employees in San Franc@@ is@@ co .
he has therefore called for assistance from outside .
it is becoming increasingly clear that new types of human resources are being started up to help companies to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licen@@ sing software with a clear purpose to measure the involvement of workers , they enable companies to commit cells , to target specific teams and demographic groups , to provide staff anon@@ y@@ mity and a bul@@ l for complaints and , in some cases , to allow em@@ pe@@ ers to by@@ pass the level C managers and to direct the Bureau .
&quot; now there are tools like Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ bit , which are designed to monitor health , but where is the F@@ it@@ res company ? &apos; asked Jim Bar@@ net , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O , Red@@ wood City at the start of the City of G@@ lin@@ t , which is used by software analytical tools to measure employee participation .
in the words of Er@@ ret@@ ti , he has received a much better picture of what he has thought and what his workers feel in the space of three years in which he has used G@@ lin@@ ti .
in addition to the pressure studies and the surveys targeted at certain teams , this provides a company &apos;s thermal card which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support , allowing them to find out the reasons .
companies have begun to realise that they must keep up with their working culture so as not to become the next U@@ b@@ lis@@ h@@ man , which has been caught up in riots since the former employee published a blo@@ g de@@ pression describing a har@@ as@@ sed environment in which those who da@@ red to speak were penalised .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and conformity area may be worth more than USD 118@@ 7 billion according to data on financial transactions in the L@@ et &apos;s speak Payments site , according to the Financial Regulation .
the start firm in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , which is operating in Den@@ ver@@ is Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , is responding to the objective of helping companies to prevent and detect inappropriate conduct , this year , in the face of a dubious reputation of U@@ ber , an interest and an increase in activity .
the Conver@@ c@@ enti@@ l has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber recently registered himself as a customer .
like G@@ lin@@ tki , the objective @-@ oriented companies will be able to send an adapted stimulus to the polls , gather confidential answers in real time and look at the problematic areas of the thermal cards .
it also offers a anon@@ ymous label , which will enable employees to report on the impro@@ per conduct .
and , where the executive leader is concerned , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion is an en@@ closed body , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , foun@@ der of the Conver@@ cen@@ ti and CE@@ O .
I said in the words of Qu@@ in@@ lan that if a company is found to treat its employees ill or act in an une@@ th@@ ical way , it may face serious consequences , such as the boycot@@ ts of consumers , the departure of workers and the courts , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaur@@ ant , which has more than 2@@ 5,000 employees in 500 sites of activity , has used the Conver@@ gence cen@@ ti for over a year to ensure that employees know the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way of communicating with the General Corpor@@ ate headquarters .
if the employee had to report earlier on a problem , he had to find a telephone number for the corpor@@ ation &apos;s headquarters or an email address , then to make a formal complaint and to hope that it will be taken seriously .
this was often a da@@ un@@ ting and un@@ comfortable process , said Mr Vit@@ ran@@ o , the general advis@@ er of Ru@@ by Tuesday , who said that he was not well @-@ prepared to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , now that a company uses the Conver@@ cen@@ ti , there are problems , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices , which did not previously end up with managers who were operating in offices in other cities or states , to identify and deal with them more quickly .
&quot; I can get closer to the holistic experience of the workers of 3@@ 60 degrees , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who is leading the risk management group in Ru@@ by @-@ Tuesday .
&quot; and we will defend our shareholders from legal disputes with their employees . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies were going to take far more seriously ethical conduct , values and worker involvement in 2002 , in other words , after the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen failed due to ethical infringement in connection with the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became c@@ oo@@ n @-@ ahead &apos; did companies realise that they could not prevent their black was@@ hing from being publicly online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used to use technology as a strategy of hope , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer their software as a service , taking charge of companies for the perio@@ dic use of their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of a venture capital investor who has been able to rely on both start @-@ ups .
the Conver@@ t was financed in February by companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and Capital , thereby raising the value of the capital collected at USD 47 million .
USD 10 million was invested in November by the B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , increasing the total funding for the enterprise to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise if we consider the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ tedness between companies , cultures and venture capital .
more and more studies show that today &apos;s workers are expecting more from the job .
in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are merely s@@ takes on the table .
the workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy in a company , they feel that the work they are listening to and that the work they do is satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of a business , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President of the Association for General profit and the Labour Administration in L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , which uses both convergence and G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors will earn the revenue if companies that belong to their portfolios do well ; businesses will do well to ensure that employees are committed and involved .
if analytical tools from the third party allow the strengthening of the commitment and involvement of workers , it is no wonder that they will find support .
data collection on the involvement of employees is important , according to experts in professional culture .
however , this data is useless if the companies &apos; supervisors do not start doing anything with them .
in fact , if a company asks the employees for feedback , it may be hoped that there will be changes .
and if the changes do not happen quickly enough or no , this could lead to disappointment and to a reduction in the involvement of workers .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you ask for 4000 proposals , you must be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions &apos; , the President of the Con@@ sul@@ tative and Business Administration of K@@ ot@@ ter International , R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who has seen companies fail to rely too much on data collection .
&apos;@@ because , if things are not done to the end , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
are you concerned ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
in the words of Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Mad@@ ison Re@@ e@@ el , who is now carrying out six studies among the workers , has been able to take measures on the same day as the one announced in G@@ lin@@ ti .
and after receiving feedback from workers who were disappointed with the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , he was able to re@@ organise several company cre@@ ws and offer communication training to deal with the problems .
Ru@@ by ures are , however , collected for the workers and it is hoped that in the long term , this will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment of workers to an industry known for the high turnover of its workforce .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you lose people , &apos; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&apos;@@ and if you lose people , you lose the cli@@ ent .
and if you lose the customers , you lose the businesses . &quot;
the euro area &apos;s sh@@ ining mark is Baltic : income growth rate
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade concerns with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries in Western Europe , B@@ loom@@ berg is writing a European Central Bank report .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
the success is caused by a low debt burden , fast @-@ improving institutions and by business and free market @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few euro area countries with a significant convergence of the EU average in terms of their GDP per capita , &quot;
although the objective is for total economic output per capita to be equal to the rich@@ est Western Europe , in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was based on a population of only 2 / 3 of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led the Bal@@ ots to seek a better wage from abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees Baltic in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local people are not at all enthusiastic .
according to a recent Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies would be very or rather well off .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was a little less than half the respondents who thought it was about their economies .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel the trends that take place twice a day will change the lives of Bru@@ mes !
it is almost 23 o &apos;@@ clock when the foot@@ bal@@ lers of the U@@ C@@ L@@ A will stop conver@@ ting at the very end of a new school s@@ na@@ ping at the University of a team .
some of them have tightened their j@@ ig@@ saw by reve@@ aling their efforts in ab@@ sen@@ tia for the first day of the September Camp .
for a large proportion of the team , these Christmas minutes offer a pa@@ int from mid@@ day .
the participants in the courses will go back to study after a three @-@ hour trend to study the final stage of a collective living before returning to the W@@ ev@@ man football meetings at the next morning .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said a tre@@ asu@@ rer of Bru@@ in@@ si , Jim Mor@@ a , a little before Monday became Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel the trends of bi@@ annual ren@@ tal of players &apos; burdens has in fact increased their days - at least until the end of the day , with endless exa@@ min@@ ations , to the end of Friday .
for this reason , the three first training sessions of U@@ C@@ L@@ A were prompted at 7.@@ 15 p.m. to fit into the already intensive timetable for players .
the transition from two to two training days a day means more of a tr@@ end@@ y days : the start of the Bru@@ in@@ si training camp was increased in the face of the last season , and , for the first time , in the Si@@ a six @-@ tonne season , training sessions are taking place at the summer courses .
they will have an 18 tr@@ en@@ ches agenda until 20 August , before formal preparations begin for the opening ceremony in T@@ ex@@ as A against &amp; M in September .
Mr Mor@@ a said that he is in favour of amending the US@@ SR , although it adds another item to the tight schedule of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&apos;@@ and they are breaking themselves through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are wonderful young people .
I believe that when we come on the table and have more time , it is a real pleasure . &quot;
once the camp has been closed , U@@ C@@ L@@ A training will be closed , which is no easy task , given a clear view of the close @-@ house wi@@ red @-@ by @-@ house and remote centre of L@@ us@@ kin , a higher class hotel that has already been shot at the front from the portal with the front @-@ line pat@@ tern pat@@ tern pat@@ tern pat@@ tern pat@@ ron@@ age .
since this weekend , the players in the hotel are taking the initiative , but Mor@@ a admitted that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&apos;@@ We are implementing the safety measures &apos; , &apos; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real concern and it is not an exagg@@ erated assumption that people can rent and sell a trainees@@ hip there .
if you have a record on your training , you could do a good deal with it .
but we are using a security team there and on board on board 8 .
we will do our best by using the best we can .
I will try not to be very concerned about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
to pay the tax of the Confederation of Cas@@ tle @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , the election union of the founding Confederation of the Central Centre , the defe@@ ated Kris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ and and and forced evi@@ ction from the reformist party , to the presence of the self @-@ employed business@@ men who set up to join the forces of Maria Kal@@ j@@ ach and the party , it seems that , in party politics , at least the local elections , the majority of the elected men who have been created by the July List , will be at least as much as the political parties .
however , the buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether they will have enough frustra@@ ted voters .
who will remain with the land ?
if the support team of Ed@@ gar Sa@@ visa@@ are reduced , one can foresee the events organised to honour his electoral union .
one member of the Council , some former and present members of the centre and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and , why is it that , from being nominated in Tallinn , some of the Sa@@ visa@@ are willing to hold sides and sis@@ ter , can you look at the fact that the &apos; list of talent &apos; of entrepreneurs , led by corruption and suspicion of corruption , is becoming a reality ?
on the ro@@ of@@ s of the municipal@@ ity , a film @-@ based music f@@ ever to the Russian pla@@ gue of the town of the girl , involving the parent of the town of the Las@@ na@@ mÃ¤@@ e ; and in every sense the pri@@ mi@@ tive computer game in which the Prime Minister , J@@ Ã¼@@ ri Ra@@ ta , the Prime Minister , must avoid the l@@ om@@ eran@@ ging and or@@ ac@@ e@@ ur in the course of his riding - is that way the centre is seeking , for the first time , the votes of the suff@@ e@@ rers of the ballot box of the 16@@ th and 17@@ th year ?
we are looking forward to seeing what the views of other political parties are of a youth campaign .
if the vie@@ wer from the beginning of August , email , instead of having enter@@ taining enter@@ tainment , looks against two black spots : to accept that in future , only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn TV and Fran@@ ce@@ en@@ ni@@ l will see the 24 channels , or give a 10 @-@ month gra@@ de to a TV operator , or give up a total of 10 @-@ month period .
there will probably also be those who will initially be happy to hear openly about the free television experience of advertising , but in the end , even though reluctant , they will pay for the television and advertise@@ ments .
Al@@ le@@ an@@ ing music , a dis@@ gus@@ ting people and rub@@ b@@ ish left on the streets are almost any major mus@@ ical plo@@ y .
if you do not want to play a role in the mind , it is worth finding your homeland out of the head of the home rather than getting her own pain - and leaving the place of s@@ lee@@ ping to the polls for the amount they have paid .
Washington will change the rules on the Green Card
the media have been published by President Donald T@@ ru@@ p , who said that a new US immigration plan is to be proposed , which will change the rules on the Green Card .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year for 50 000 people , stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Re@@ publi@@ can and the President supports them .
the draft law will be discussed in two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , because it will change the way in which the green cards are issued to citizens of other US countries .
the law will reduce the migration of the chain and replace the current programme .
the new application process will give the advantage to the candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp , according to the US media ou@@ tle@@ ts .

Y@@ ev@@ se@@ ye@@ v A@@ nat@@ oli will continue to have the tradition of the famous se@@ to gold min@@ ers along the former border of the Ma@@ ana River .
he works 140 kilometres from home as the driver of the additional heating of Ma@@ ana , alongside San@@ ta Ku@@ vai , as the driver of the motor@@ ised car .
this is a tough job : two months of work without rest days , 12 hours &apos; work , and then only ten days &apos; work at home and again .
in the three years worked by the Ar@@ tel , A@@ nat@@ oli has only ever seen the gold .
&apos;@@ There is a hard procedure there : going in in in depth , checking that the means will not be taken as a means and going out to ensure that it goes &apos; , A@@ nat@@ oli speaks .
in the village of H@@ ai@@ da , M@@ are Pi@@ ho will speak local se@@ to Ja@@ ani , who has spoken to him a great deal about the memory of his family in Si@@ beria .
the archa@@ ic culture that has still been preserved in the se@@ to@@ x of Si@@ beria will also affect home @-@ pigs , as it is just so shocking , will take the most far @-@ f@@ ul@@ led Pi@@ ho M@@ are .
his first trip to Si@@ beria will be 30 years later this year .
during this time , he has been there 14 times and has lived there for a year .
how many sa@@ tu@@ rated was it still that travelled to Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took note of this in the words of the rum@@ ours of Si@@ b@@ erian Se@@ x@@ ist , who has himself thought it .
it is difficult to say exactly that , because at the time , up to 30 people could come in a group , but the passport was given only to a man .
the passport was given to only one , but it was children , nur@@ ses and su@@ ch@@ like .
look at what the territory was here .
this was several times larger than historical S@@ et@@ oma@@ a .
after all , this was needed to educate , manage in some way .
Gre@@ et@@ ings came here as pe@@ as@@ ants , but their life change , because here they got into areas that were not only related to agriculture , but also to the river ( pal@@ m par@@ king ) , the gold mines , the industry .
for example , in New @-@ Pet@@ ser@@ i , many pigs went into operation later in the city of K@@ ras@@ no@@ jar@@ sk @-@ 45 , where the Soviet authorities built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P@@ . ) , when it was formed .
did the pigs represent a majority of the population in this region at the time ?
yes , they were living in a ba@@ g .
moreover , a long tradition has kept mar@@ ried and the reproduction of children .
seven to eight children in the family were common .
how much does the Si@@ b@@ erian Se@@ to@@ de culture differ and different from that of mother &apos;s gen@@ i@@ us ?
they are different , although what was brought here was the same thing .
they brought with them a great many ideas of a popular choice .
they did so themselves ( ideas of a popular nature ) , but they always made a distinction , which was brought in and which had been made here .
climate change has had a major impact on the traditional ri@@ ce of se@@ to@@ ws , because the cold is here .
the fuels were changed .
for example , in S@@ et@@ oma@@ al meat , meat was so@@ wn , but it was simply frozen here .
where are the villages of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ ds and what life life life there lives ? / graph@@ ics : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ots
the link with the mother country was spiri@@ tually strong , it was considered very important .
it seems to me that now , this Se@@ tu@@ maa is starting to give back to it , will influence them .
those girls who have lived in their families have listened to the ama@@ zing experiences .
Pi@@ ho is thinking of the people of the Estonian se@@ to@@ de delegation who came to the daily life of the Kingdom of H@@ ai@@ da at the beginning of July and lived four days in homes - J. P .
what is here , this is a disgrace .
&quot; it is extremely easy to come and go away , because the city has a wonderful place : on the railway side and at the crossing points of the roads , &quot; says the oper@@ ist from T@@ ap@@ alt , Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a lot of nature , sports and culture , and the p@@ ound is in every corner .
San@@ k is a ti@@ p @-@ stra@@ w town !
there is a small island along the river through the coast of the city , where the Tamil ha@@ ils are used to keep the scre@@ ws .
&apos;@@ There is no such beau@@ ty as a train window &apos; , and &apos; is mu@@ tating Re@@ ig@@ o &apos; .
those who are not afraid of the cold water will be sw@@ am@@ ped in the river because the river is full of sources .
I have been there to flood , I can do a great deal !
on board of the river , a long @-@ distance and simply a ro@@ man@@ tic can do so - it can look at the flow of the river and look ahead to life and want to be done .
I , too , have been wal@@ king with my bre@@ ed@@ ers there .
in addition to anything else , an oper@@ rist , Tam@@ m , has been active in a river basin of three bridges to get her sho@@ es under way : &apos; that place is in the city , nobody can come into conflict if their stories are cold &apos; .
&quot; the car@@ cas@@ ses of the car@@ cas@@ ses will open a wonderful view for T@@ ap@@ a , but there will also be health professionals who can run , heal the winter , and now play a design course , for example - gol@@ f courses have been made , labels can lend to sports , &quot;
the old tri@@ cks are , of course , going there with their own ca@@ es@@ ta , but I have not yet got to play there .
obviously , Mr Gra@@ le Kul@@ l must be invited to visit T@@ ap@@ ale because she has experienced a dis@@ band of dis@@ course and has a chain .
perhaps he is lending to me .
the Re@@ ig@@ o and M@@ Ã¤n@@ ni@@ g mountain were indi@@ visible in the current period of &apos; oper@@ ino &apos; .

there are many te@@ ars , many dis@@ appointments and many sca@@ ms left in this mountain , and you can count on me in my sporting life .
not to mention the broken ro@@ cks and slu@@ ms .
&quot; the city as a whole is currently full of construction work , all of this becomes unknown , &quot;
however , the old and ti@@ red building of the ancient and ti@@ red is a very attractive place where bathing disco@@ veries are played .
I am pleased that in 2012 , the head of R@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ M , note in Me@@ os , adopted my idea and had to make a statement with his theat@@ re during the summer .
although this year &apos;s theat@@ re season &apos; Ale@@ kse@@ i K@@ aren@@ in &apos; has just passed , on 11 August , the railway station is undergoing a &apos; live @-@ up &apos; process , while in the old old building , in the 1980s , there is a move around in the 1980s .
&quot; from 11 to 13 August , the city of T@@ ap@@ a is the day in which , apart from the h@@ oles opened by the inaugu@@ ral house of the authentic Workers building , cultural events are held , including in the form of a popular passport , &quot; Re@@ ig@@ o will speak , who will be calling for a visit to a city of 9 years in the no@@ se .
in the small y@@ el@@ low farm of 1 May on the net pu@@ mp , the muse@@ um is already 1994 .
&apos;@@ The house is small , but there are a lot of mis@@ statements and information of enormous proportions &apos; , &apos; is a Re@@ ig@@ o in a place full of the history of the town of T@@ ap@@ a , most of which focuses on the railway and on driving .
Re@@ ig@@ o mu@@ b@@ b@@ li@@ er is that , if you go through all the recommended sites in T@@ ap@@ al , you will be a little empty , but fortunately the small town is full of coff@@ ee .
&quot; we have such good food places and sometimes , when you sit in coff@@ ee , you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad . &quot;
well trained and young soldiers from T@@ ap@@ ale spend a lot of time in pub@@ s , and the wall is a gra@@ vest feeling on the site that you are in Estonia and in your home town , but there is a world community of such things together .
I believe that it would be very exciting to hear the stories from the hands of the French or the Americans .

in Greece two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal ten@@ dering
television broadcasting quoted from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who reported that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ ding .
on the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of people illegally on the Ib@@ erian Pen@@ insula , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but an investigation is taking place .
the Foreign Ministry told the television channel that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free @-@ phone ten@@ ding and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone who is caught in a circum@@ ven@@ ted place that is not intended for doing so .
the inspections will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the court may impose fines .
the g@@ host of w@@ ol@@ ves taught by the lis@@ ten@@ ers is breaking the sheep .
farmers in the soil need to give their her@@ d &apos; teaching materials &apos; to the junta again after the year &apos;s break - apparently the w@@ ol@@ f @-@ gra@@ pp@@ ers have already broken a lot of sheep .
this year , the w@@ ol@@ f in the island of Hi@@ u has broken the sheep three times , 23 sheep and eight pages have been w@@ ounded , the Hi@@ i@@ u site wri@@ tes .
the figure was three , up to 124 .
in the g@@ loom@@ y syn@@ ch@@ on , the environmental agency also has the data that the w@@ ol@@ f ben@@ ches in the fourth @-@ hand Country were not born and that the but@@ ton Board of the Netherlands had been informed that two w@@ ol@@ f was@@ hes had been fixed this year on the island .

the rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the land Ministry of Culture has sent a coordination front to a draft law on the release of GMOs into the environment ( &quot; GMOs &quot; ) and a plant protection product amendment law .
the amendment to the law gives up the creation of a separate collection of data for both the locations and the operators of genetically modified ( GM ) crops , thus using a plant health register in the future .
in addition , the GM crop operator will be changed from the obligation to have prior agreements with the beekeeping agent in the requested radi@@ us .
although there are currently no GM crops grown in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence between GM crops and non @-@ GM crops .
this would be at least as long as there were no decisions to declare Estonia GMO @-@ free , &quot; said S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , Head of the plant health department at the department of the Maa@@ elu@@ tic .
&quot; however , it must be taken into account that the measures that have been developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burdens of both the private and the public sectors , &quot;
the draft law repe@@ als provisions relating to the collection and treatment of GM crops in the form of a data collection and management system for GM crops in the GMO , lays down requirements for handling GM crops and for starting an economic activity .
specifically with regard to beekeeping , the GM crop growers will be replaced by a clear obligation to inform bee@@ keepers of the obligation to start growing GM crops by committing an appropriate agreement with the bee@@ keepers before starting cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to the minis@@ tries for coordination .
all interested parties will have the opportunity to famili@@ arise themselves with this in the information system and , if they wish to , present their views to the world &apos;s department .
the proposed changes will particularly affect those operating in the area of crop farming , bee@@ keepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10 - is allowed to be grown .
so far , however , not a single Estonian farmer has taken an interest in growing GM crops .
this is because there is no ma@@ gic bul@@ l@@ la in Estonia , the European cor@@ n Media , which is resistant to mon 8@@ 10 .
also , its maize lea@@ f @-@ bas@@ hing has been culti@@ vated on the southern regions , and this is not appropriate in our climate conditions in May .
to obtain this certainty , the Hague Department of the Regions has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect pollution from potential GM bodies in the seeds of various summer ra@@ pe@@ seed , maize and soya culti@@ vated in Estonia .
the analysis of the tests carried out showed that the seeds were not included in the ex@@ o@@ gen@@ ous area and the inquiry concluded that the seeds of seeds for rap@@ ses , maize and soya vari@@ eties that increased in Estonia were not accompanied by GMOs .
this is the case , in turn , with the fact that in Estonia GM crops are not being deliberately culti@@ vated and it was also confirmed that there was no accident contamination .

GBP 40 million from the player bought from C@@ hel@@ sea in Dublin in the last pre @-@ authoritarian match of Uni@@ te@@ di , in front of UEFA Su@@ per C@@ up on Tuesday , went out in the ru@@ m of Madrid on Tuesday to celebrate 2 @-@ 1 victory in the initial ri@@ gging , giving the impression of defence , while Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Pe@@ re@@ ira were able to engage freely in the attack on the streets .
but , aside from the noble Asian model , Ma@@ tic@@ on was left with a badly needed po@@ ch @-@ iron Strip and he had only had to get up to 45 minutes , as he said , he had to improve before the start of the Pre@@ mi@@ er League season .
&apos;@@ he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , gen@@ i@@ us thinking - he has a football menta@@ lity , &apos; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help it to achieve its standard as soon as possible . &quot;

&quot; I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three of the four &apos; .
&quot; I am even hap@@ pi@@ er if they can deliver on four things , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
another salt po@@ et had his feet on 1 August , and this time on the Sil@@ k Bro@@ ther .

according to the documents of the Es@@ ca@@ de@@ my , Marine H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) , who is responsible for the deployment of a helicop@@ ter , the White House has been called for by a cell cell cell cell , or F@@ AR@@ G@@ O , to a minimum effect 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter &apos;s &apos; extraordinary &apos; celebration at the southern he@@ mic@@ y@@ cle .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , as it is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 com@@ and@@ Ã¶@@ r a day before the event in an email of his personality , the leading officer of the naval domain to the de@@ pu@@ mp in aviation .
the message stated in the message that the helicop@@ ter will arrive on the southern hor@@ ror on 17 July at 7 : 00 in the morning at 7 : 00 , to be launched and stay there until the night is cleared at 18 : 21 .
the added point was that , should the departure from the White House be , the return flight would require a second e@@ tho@@ s , due to the limitations of working time .
the initial aviation crew were at the scene of the event at helicop@@ ter level and the security team of the es@@ ka@@ r kept a plane close to the aircraft throughout its period of stay on the ground .
it was not possible to read out from documents given to the magaz@@ ine whether or not it was necessary to have another version of the e@@ tho@@ s at the end .
the H@@ at@@ chi Law prohibits the use of the assets of the Federal Government for political purposes .
the documents show that the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 study examined whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked whether this was a violation of the H@@ at@@ chi law and we were told that it was not , &apos; wrote a com@@ man@@ der .
&quot; it seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to the Deputy chief victim .
the White House declared the &apos; American &apos; event as an official event and the H@@ at@@ chi law would not have covered it .
however , even in formal events , there are political sub@@ ton@@ es .
the President supported the health reform efforts at the time in the Senate and praised his attempts to keep government regulations under threat .
the use of a aircraft known under the name of the Marine One or Air Force for political gain is not a new phenomenon .
the Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them merely as a photo@@ copy is unusual .
the T@@ ru@@ mp was brought to attention in February when , at the first campaign event in Flor@@ idas Mel@@ bour@@ ne , a president &apos;s plane was held by a background in the water , and he is sli@@ ding from Twitter &apos;s account with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the plane of President .
&apos;@@ The White Ma@@ tel is very pleased with the launch of a &apos; America made in &apos; , where products were represented from 50 states produced by American workers from American materials , &apos; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the spokes@@ person in the White House .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often perform test flights around Washington and at the southern he@@ mic@@ y@@ cle to get to get to gri@@ ps with the white house of the US President with a me@@ tre @-@ me@@ tre c@@ iting .
when the G20 summit was held at the beginning of July in T@@ ru@@ mp in Germany , the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House was able to organise 58 sam@@ ples .
according to the official , the flight was included in the standard for this time @-@ end flight operations performed in America .
on that occasion , the helicop@@ ter of Es@@ ka@@ r fly another 11 hours &apos; for &apos; non @-@ presidential support missions &apos; .
according to the White House , no other expon@@ ential burden on the taxpayer &apos;s w@@ alle@@ ts was placed on the w@@ alle@@ ts of this event .
as the representative of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved in organising the expon@@ ential development at the southern helicop@@ ter .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 will not retain the budgetary documents of the President &apos;s flights and the precise costs arising from the event will be difficult to identify .
however , at the average price of the defence Ministry for the financial year 2017 , the amount of compensation for the V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D will be USD 24 per flight hour .
the first office papers indicated for the flight the length of its main base from the Fa@@ x air force , Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o , on both routes , 30 minutes .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicop@@ ter is well below the sum of this .
&quot; it is very misleading to calculate taxpayers &apos; costs on the basis of the estimated compensation rates , &quot; said Wales .
&quot; these estimates of compensation will include staff , maintenance and many other irreversible costs which will be taken into account in the annual appropriations . &quot;
according to a study from the 2015 ro@@ stru@@ m , the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation rates for personnel costs , but does cover the costs of fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former spokes@@ person for the White House , Se@@ an S@@ pic@@ er , defended the use of a helicop@@ ter at that time .
&quot; the point is to show the things that have been done in America this week , &quot; said S@@ pic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that the S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky state and the State of Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ t are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds , if not thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that , just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly on .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether the T@@ ru@@ mp t@@ ree in the southern factory , when it was circu@@ lating , was pul@@ led in a helicop@@ ter or not , but was sitting behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
in the White House in the Ma@@ in , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky addressed representatives , throwing out the media for jo@@ ke and for the company &apos;s products in its own aircraft park .
&quot; I know this very well from S@@ ik@@ or@@ skÃ¡ , &quot; the President said , &apos; I have three products for them &apos; .
G@@ rit Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o - S@@ lu@@ cky journeys taken through the ha@@ ts were peaceful and happy
in the last area of M@@ il D@@ ae@@ mes in 2011 , the S@@ kate S@@ hu@@ p hit the S@@ ik@@ h , the 800 m@@ our of run@@ k wal@@ ks and the sta@@ di@@ um was taken from the ket@@ tle .
just before that , he had received a ju@@ mp from ha@@ ir to ha@@ m in China .
in 2012 , Helsinki was damaged by cheap injuries , but in London , the debate camp Milin@@ ti had the seat in Article 60 to paragraph 23 .
however , I am still a mistake .
after the opening day in Moscow in 2013 , Moscow M@@ W received a record from Estonia in a plo@@ t to a head @-@ on injury in the timetable .
two years later , he gained 15 seats in Beijing and carried out the Olympic ori@@ um , but this was more than a disappointment to the ath@@ le@@ te .
the cy@@ nic@@ y@@ est hur@@ ric@@ ane passed through Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o only had the cost of not getting a letter from the City of Amsterdam .
I would just like to put together once , even once , a proper multi @-@ contest .
once , &apos; , spra@@ ying for the even@@ ings of the Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
worse than this , a month later , his Olympic contest was already broke at the first barrier due to the re@@ ig@@ ni@@ tion in Ri@@ os .
time has to be taken down - did you go on with seven competitions ?
is the two @-@ day effort really worth all this ?
there was much thought about it , but there was peace .
I could almost think of a sil@@ ver thought .
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time to cure ourselves and to think very quickly .
&quot; I knew that I would not yet sh@@ ru@@ g my head , &quot; says that there is a sh@@ ou@@ ty about self @-@ labelling .
I was able to turn the car@@ d@@ board on the back and take a new impetus .
Mrs K@@ mÃ¤@@ ki said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of care , but she realised that , above all , the spor@@ ts@@ man himself must get his own clarity .
after all , he was so bu@@ ried by everyone .
this was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; however , the leader said he would not give up and he would like to prove what he is worth , &apos; he says no , he says .
now , there is some peace in it .
he is doing so for his own pleasure .
the exhibition came back in May , when the Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o e@@ rec@@ ted a new record of 6 280 points at a multi @-@ competitive competition in G@@ Ã¶t@@ z@@ ise .
at the high @-@ level competition , he improved the personal top sta@@ g at a heat price with almost an in@@ ch ( 13.@@ 89 ) and ran on a record @-@ close race .
then , a competition felt that it was not a level of ability at all , but that the star@@ vation was only the first in the competition .
he has been guided by a word of the hill for years that sh@@ an@@ ty is a black student .
he is prepared to carry out a sports exercise , is a good training .
if something is done or is wrong , then he will say it immediately .
he knows his own body and he has his trust in his own sense .
this is what we must follow .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we will follow it .
the new approach has also been found in the case of Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
&apos;@@ I am not one who makes the maximum of a trend &apos; , but he says and says that the most important thing is to get the best sense of living , because it also provides a good result .
B@@ y@@ e g@@ lu@@ e g@@ lu@@ e g@@ lu@@ e g@@ lu@@ e
the good emo@@ tions have also been offered to sh@@ ud@@ der to sh@@ ud@@ der .
both her former fellow teacher , Mar@@ is hill and sis@@ ter , Gre@@ te , have recently become parents and a competition @-@ shir@@ ter has received new sources of des@@ pair from citizens .
&apos;@@ It has been quite interesting , &apos; , &apos; says &apos; S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
one alcohol whose drinking is sy@@ non@@ ymous with &apos; training &apos; .
Li@@ r@@ Ã© wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is a fa@@ int @-@ hear@@ ted wine fan that he believes that wine can teach a brain better than any other thing in the world .
She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist at the University of Y@@ ale .
he said that this is not a matter of alcohol or of how it affects our feelings and our ideas , but rather of the &apos; very active &apos; process of taste for wine .
by but@@ tering the glass , by tri@@ ggering wine , by enjoying it and by having a taste , we are putting our brain on the job to create a taste for wine .
according to She@@ per@@ d , alga@@ m does not actually contain taste , but a taste arises from the way in which wine stimu@@ lates brain .
he leads to a comparison between the way brain sees &apos; appe@@ aran@@ ces &apos; .
&quot; taste is not wine , taste creates a taste for wine , &quot; says She@@ per@@ d .
things that still affect the emergence of a taste of wine are , for example , the number of our age , our sex and even our heart that humans produce .
of course , She@@ men feels that wine is not a product full of ha@@ ir .
&quot; there must be more of a move , &quot; he says .
if you take the stra@@ w too big , the system will be over@@ loaded .
excessive drinking wine can be done to the detriment of the brain , but according to a survey in 2004 , people who run over three glass of wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity are at risk .
10 % of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia get less salary than colleagues
figures from the Per@@ selection Company Fon@@ tes reveal that 10 % of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less than their salary .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , and the portal is a pr portal .
the teachers &apos; remuneration survey covers 59 IT and telecommunications companies .
a total of 8 5@@ 77 posts were surve@@ yed .
63 % of the posts were worked by men .
&quot; although only 3 companies said that the pay gap is in favour of men and that other companies considered that there is no pay gap , in reality , the average pay gap between men and women is 10 % higher than men &apos;s , and the total salary of men is 8 % higher than women on average , &quot; said Mrs Me@@ tals Il@@ je@@ v Il@@ je@@ v Il@@ je@@ v .

despite the fact that in the second season of &apos; Nar@@ co@@ se &apos; , the kil@@ ler of P@@ ab@@ lo Es@@ co@@ bar was exposed , the Net@@ f@@ li@@ x site site is far from over .
the third and fourth le@@ vers have been confirmed by the stream and the first has already been produced by a cli@@ p of advertising which ri@@ ches the char@@ ger with the new pa@@ w@@ ns .
in the third season , the D@@ EA will pay its attention to the rich@@ est drug organisation in the world , the C@@ al car@@ tel .

according to the UN , the role of women in democracy in Afgh@@ ans depends on political role
the head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can represent the people only if all members of society , including women , play a role .
Sir Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , said that hundreds of women would stand for election at local councils , three women would stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; by underlining the importance of women &apos;s role , it is not possible to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate , &quot; he said in a statement made on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and can only be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all phases of the electoral process .
the local council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is transferred cal@@ mly from one democratically elected government to the next .
according to the Gy@@ m@@ ou@@ th@@ y@@ me , a strong role for women in Afghanistan is increasing the success of democracy .
according to the In@@ dependent Ele@@ ction Commission for Afghanistan , 1.2 million women have registered with the 3.@@ 6 million registered voters .
the joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both large and small .
there is always too little time in common , but with ten@@ se th@@ reads , the opportunity is a good opportunity to combine meetings , play , clo@@ thes and burdens .
and what a convenient solution - wherever you died in the summer , the living win@@ ds of the day are always with you and you are irre@@ pro@@ ac@@ ingly reminded of your fine voice : &apos; let us now make a p@@ ound ! &apos;
A@@ lu@@ min@@ ated insu@@ lation : a normal game of gold or a sli@@ ding through the coast &apos;s licence is a good thing .
a combination is the foundation stone and the be@@ ac@@ on of lasting feet - who would then like to take the form of a s@@ lee@@ ping sand from the wave of w@@ ra@@ ves during the summer ?
it is wonderful to use children instead of a ket@@ tle !
firstly , it is secure and convenient , the difficulty is gradually increasing at the same pace as the training and power .
it is also possible to fill villages with quite great children .
a child is trained on the balance , counts on cleaning and feels fu@@ n at the opportunity to be high and important .
at the same time , larger children can dra@@ g on themselves .
the scope of the movement is determined by reference to land and by instructions .
the finger of the Ho@@ w cold is , to keep the pal@@ le in order properly .
a child can read the accounts and feel like a train@@ er .
the planet is extremely attractive , but hope@@ lessly per@@ ni@@ cious for the child .
however , it is easy to do something .
Par@@ k @-@ plan@@ k : take a long plan@@ k of man@@ ol@@ ine , which will be repeated .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much more a@@ mus@@ ing to do , if , in the meantime , you can hand your hands to your friend .
to add burdens , we can have a w@@ edge , a small pe@@ at , and also a wal@@ king around in this position .
a further aspect is the ability to sit on the children &apos;s seats , but this exercise offers fu@@ n arrogance for all children .
while the cra@@ bs are s@@ lee@@ ping in the sand , the s@@ wine is getting a s@@ win@@ ge@@ ing , ash and a mon@@ ash pressure , as was the case .
the child is wal@@ king on its feet in such a way that its body &apos;s scope is distributed equally and behind .
marketing can be held to hold on to the rescue .
Re@@ ver@@ se feet and pla@@ in@@ ly .
the ang@@ ry can fly , can be fu@@ n , can fro@@ ze a balance and can be a difficulty .
a small mil@@ l &apos;s life is an extra step if he or she gets a little bit of heat on the way .
an additional burden will be placed on the feet in advance .
checking that it would not be in a neutral position .
children themselves have a lot more fu@@ n to do in a couple of fla@@ mes and with a ba@@ g .
a village with hand and with a w@@ ed@@ ding .
follow the safety of the child , the position of the generation and the ho@@ le in a neutral position .
the fav@@ ou@@ rite and great joy of all children !

from the Philippines to the heart of the world &apos;s broader - the T@@ ac@@ k@@ le journey
T@@ rap@@ ped cop@@ ies are a summer class which has in recent years become a piece of s@@ nu@@ ff in itself , and one of the correct wh@@ ist@@ le has to han@@ g on top of the hand , and which has been able to use the dealers to display a price stamp , even though it was from a modest point of view .
the copy of a bun@@ ch of bags red in a bun@@ ch of hypocrisy is probably one of the things that has existed in life at the same time and which has not been aro@@ used much emo@@ tion .
this simply exists and , if it does not exist , there is no pla@@ gue .
now , however , the ju@@ mp bags are taking a real ex@@ o@@ dus , and the mo@@ mo@@ ph@@ ile be@@ et@@ les have changed their top @-@ top design bags for months to come , instead of simple be@@ er @-@ shir@@ ked bags .
this is not just a coastal zone , but it is also , today , just as popular as a street dog , and it is even the b@@ older women who are wal@@ king into office .
however , it is worth making it clear before whether the sole@@ mn idea of this summer is sitting or worth marking and the lap@@ top computer still goes a little further .
however , the aff@@ inity has been made by the be@@ er &apos;s real love of women by summer .
for example , reading foreign mo@@ tives , the first thing to do is to see that mo@@ gur@@ us people are the first thing to do on holiday , as a result of having a be@@ er &apos;s ticket , to acquire a pu@@ mp for themselves , which is the gu@@ est of a full holiday and accompanied by lo@@ ads of be@@ aches , market and also friend @-@ makers in the town .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are so generous a lam@@ b that buying a ba@@ g from the market or selling a larger hea@@ p or giving them to their loyal read@@ ers .
it is worth noting that there is such a great demand for the read@@ ers that , in the rest of the world , women ( and men ! ) apparently have to go to each other &apos;s shores to become happy property for some homes .
in a sense , this mad@@ ness is also understandable , because it is the same procedures that educate itself when , in the mo@@ ck of yesterday , it is possible to buy up a few do@@ zen euro .
true , the ro@@ ck traders have also discovered a simple way of making money here , and so be@@ er @-@ like luxury br@@ ands are selling the bel@@ ts for a few hundred and a half thousand euros .
obviously , in order to ensure that richer customers do not need to feel as easy to die , who pro@@ gram themselves with some cheap bags .
for example , it is possible to buy D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a over EUR 1 000 per li@@ tan@@ y .
however , for the slightest interpretation of the pu@@ mp , EUR 6 000 can be moved out of circulation .
unlike most motor buildings , however , the be@@ er does not come out of a great deal of fu@@ n , but rather from a far more distant experience .
indeed , the outs@@ our@@ ced bags are said to be coming from far too many Philippines , where they have been transported .
the red @-@ down of a bun@@ ch of trains is particularly there for export business and very often the local ones do not see any trace of them .
it has been said that the drinking form of the 14@@ th century is a fairly brutal cor@@ k .
however , since the be@@ er does not have to be as red as the bas@@ ket as the one , they can be labelled with mus@@ ts and other materials that make the co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il more personal and , by extension , also more ac@@ ous@@ tic .
for example , recently , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y bags in which red pa@@ vements or s@@ kin@@ s are in .
however , the full letter may , in particular , be sent by ac@@ cess@@ or@@ ies to J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , the largest be@@ er be@@ er be@@ er be@@ er be@@ er be@@ er of which had not been seen before .
he has adapted the be@@ er to any set of clothing that he can get to , and even had to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
what is less important nowadays , however , is that , in the popul@@ arity of the people , it is not the slightest role that is taking care of them , and unlike all the summer centres , they are not required to care for them with special means , but that the water and the target are also taken away .
as always with the initiative of a trend , the br@@ ands , apart from classi@@ cal appearance , have come up with any interpretation .
for example , if you wish , you can get a ju@@ ice from your be@@ er or you can acquire a tiny piece of bo@@ w@@ l .
it is worth remembering , however , that a classic be@@ er will never be left in the fashion , but with the col@@ dest fuel .
but , what is the classic be@@ er &apos;s copy , then ?
for centuries , a C@@ af@@ lo@@ at copy of a be@@ er that rese@@ mb@@ les a cor@@ k has been kept on the loo@@ p and is short , as well as stra@@ its , cri@@ pp@@ ling .

G@@ M@@ B is concerned about its investments in the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e plant in G@@ las@@ go@@ w
the Trade Union is waiting for the managers of the mature generation Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to be reas@@ sured of long @-@ term production plans at the G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment at customs level .
in a theat@@ re producing H@@ ob@@ no@@ lid and rich @-@ rich know @-@ how and other products , more than 500 people work .
the owner of Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e in Pla@@ di said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years of the site .
it was paid by staff and by trade union chairs &apos; is the first to hear &apos; when something changes are made in the operation of the factory .
in a letter to the Director of the enterprise , G@@ M@@ B addressed the request by Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e Scotland to &quot; pe@@ d@@ dle the concerns that the funding is not being used to modernise production lines . &quot;
the senior organis@@ er of G@@ M@@ B , D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y , said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the head of the site on the business needs of customs and the future investment plan is a cause for grave concern for our Members .
several generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely made up of people from the local community and the region around G@@ las@@ go@@ w , which is an indispensable pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social housing .
thus , in the face of the growth in jobs , salary and welfare in the eastern G@@ las@@ go@@ w , and Bre@@ x@@ t , the very thri@@ ving venture Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e is in dire need of living costs and the decline in production . &quot;
the Bureau representative said : &apos; the head of the customs cros@@ ses was received from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ ting only yesterday , and the company replies directly to him , because we value the active interaction with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the employees in the customs and the representatives of G@@ M@@ B , which openly debated a number of issues .
we then discussed with the workers that , like all other companies that are extremely competitive and in a precarious economic climate , we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this is true of all our businesses and all our objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested over Â£ 5 million in the customs cros@@ h site , and most of this has gone into production lines and improvements in procedures .
we fully understand the legacy of customs as a productive site and , if the object of the site is to change any changes , the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did PS@@ G warn the Netherlands about its approach three years ago ?
the la can regret this interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not give up in the attempt to attract Ney@@ ts to their ranks by making a bid to buy him GBP 18@@ 9 million , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record trip to con@@ qu@@ er ?
this pa@@ thetic approach has opened the summer &apos;s transition window and the club of L@@ ig@@ ue 1 is prepared to break the current world record of double the purchase that was e@@ rec@@ ted at the previous season by returning Mr Po@@ g@@ ba to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ us for GBP 89 million .
once the changeover has been completed , the Ney@@ mark will thus become the most expensive player in the world and , at the same time , the most highly paid professional global player , who will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from the PS@@ G .
Barcelona is , of course , a hin@@ t , both because of the approach and because of the breaking down of Ney@@ ra , although the source close to the Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ an Bureau confirms that the club has always been best off for the football camp since its arrival in San@@ to@@ to@@ to@@ u in 2013 .
however , did the President of the PS@@ G warn the football world of this opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City showed an interest in concluding the contract with Bla@@ ise Ma@@ tu@@ ka in 2014 , Mr Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f warned in a tough way against all clubs thinking of recru@@ iting some of their best @-@ performing retailers in the PS .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that , when they are dealing with some of our players , we will stand down to them and contact their players , &quot; al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f said .
&quot; we honour all the clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have cros@@ sed this border , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the mid@@ field player of PS@@ G , Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow them to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer set@@ backs as a result of this interest by removing , in the form of a Ney@@ mark , one of its precious assets .
Prime Minister , Ireland wants to build bridges after Bre@@ x , not borders .
&quot; Bre@@ x is seriously threatening to drive a w@@ edge between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned early on a first visit to Northern Ireland since its entry into force in June .
&apos;@@ I cannot imagine who would benefit from this &apos; , he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible to move freely to the current people and goods , says the Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; he emphasised .
as the car@@ tel suggests , he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union , and as it is not , he would be part of the European common market .
this would preserve the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom .
another chance to make Britain &apos;s departure smoo@@ ther would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explained by the Ta@@ o@@ ise@@ ach .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , the Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said , &apos; surely we could have had this kind of Great Britain &apos; .
the alternative would be to return to customs points , which would h@@ eral@@ d a historical sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia and a political failure .
&apos;@@ L@@ et the trade , prosperity and peace &apos; , the Ta@@ o@@ ise@@ ach of Ireland said .
he called Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t &apos; a challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that the outcome could affect every aspect of the everyday life of Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in the north of Ireland , in Bel@@ fast .
