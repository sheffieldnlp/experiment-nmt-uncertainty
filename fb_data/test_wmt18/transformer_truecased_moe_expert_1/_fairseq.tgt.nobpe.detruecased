Four members of the Group of Cape Verde were detained in Estonia and Spain .
According to Mr Posselt , in Spain , the police detained the so @-@ called leader of the group of Cape Verde , in charge of the Estonian alliance , Slava Gulevitn , who is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski .
In Spain , Gulevich was arrested by a court .
Yesterday , the Court also took three suspects who were detained in Estonia .
It is suspected that these are the criminal members of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde &apos; Community aged between 27 and 57 years old , who are committing mainly drug crimes .
In the province of Malaga in Spain , Mijav , the alleged head of the criminal organisation was detained .
In Estonia , three men were held as suspects , one of which is collected according to data and the two are members of the criminal organisation .
The data collected indicates that there were clearly assigned tasks and roles in the criminal community .
The criminal organisation of the criminal organisation was aimed at committing drug crimes and thereby generating criminal proceeds , &quot; commented the head of the pre @-@ trial proceedings in criminal matters , the Public Prosecutor , Vahur Verte .
&quot; We shall not rule out that the circle of suspects in this criminal case will increase &quot; added to the Prosecutor &apos;s .
These are people who have previously become interested in law enforcement agencies , and some of them have been punished for the crime of narcotics .
Mrs Verte stressed that cooperation with my Spanish counterparts has been high on the agenda throughout the course of the investigation .
&quot; International cooperation has become common for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of the cooperation , &quot;
The head of the General Criminal Police Service , ago Leis , said that the detentions were preceded by a preliminary investigation of almost one and a half years .
&quot; In the first half of the week , a long @-@ standing job was realised and , at the same time , we observed the suspicious crimes in Estonia and Spain , &quot;
In the Leis , the central criminal police officers were instrumental in the detention of Spain .
For years now , we have had good contact and understanding from one another with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
These detentions are yet another message to the perpetrators that we can also get them from the other side of Europe . &quot;
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that , in the free stay , those suspected of a suspect can continue to commit new crimes , and the prosecution office requested their arrest and approved by the court .
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
In order to ensure that confiscation is carried out , there are seizures of property , vehicles and cash .
The preliminary proceedings of the Criminal Court are conducted by the Office of the Police for organised crimes of the Central Criminal Police and are led by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
The City Court in Tallinn sentenced Slava Gulevitch in 2005 to blackmail and punished him by five years in prison .
In the mid @-@ last decade , the Allevitv Alsar , Nikolai Tarankov , was considered the second most important man in the world , following the then Manor of the Kavalor .
Gulevich from Cape Verde has highlighted the Estonian alliance in the early 1990s , when he began to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
It is claimed that he taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating in different hotels and ordered a monthly roof tax on businessmen .
International joint operations , confiscation of proceeds of crime and the court judgments that have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
For example , the latest court decisions , the eight indictees of the so @-@ called &apos; Dikactivist &apos; criminal association , who were confiscated on the proceeds of crime by â‚¬ 80 000 , or the sentence against nine individuals in 2006 , were created by Igor Aleynikov , a criminal organisation aimed at illegal trade in illegal cigarettes and committing crimes against human trafficking in East Virgland and southern Estonia .
The proceeds from the collected crime amount to almost EUR 71 500 .
In these criminal cases , progress has been made by the police officers to exchange information and prosecutors on a daily basis with their colleagues in the field of external affairs , and , if necessary , to carry out proceedings in any European Union country .
Civil Rights group warns against travelling to MSY
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) has warned the people of Missouristic appeal against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state .
The group statement states : &apos; The NAACP travel link issued for the State of Missourc shall apply until 28 August 2017 , calls on all non @-@ American travellers , visitors and souls to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the whole state , given the whole range of novelty @-@ based racial events that have been occurring in the state and are also pointed out at the recent state of state at the time . &apos;
In the NAACP , the group was urged to issue a travel warning both the recent Missouri law , which makes it more difficult to obtain court cases involving discrimination , and also the fact that the objectives of the state &apos;s law enforcement are , in large measure , unequal in nature .
&quot; The rights of citizens are being violated .
They are caught for their colour of their bait , beaten or killed , &quot; said Rod Chapel , President of NAACP Missour , to The Kansas City Star .
&quot; We have never been so complacent . &quot;
This is the first warning to be issued by an organisation for a US state .
The group referred to events such as racial insults against black students in the Missouri University and the death of Sanders , a 28 @-@ year @-@ old black boy from Tennessee .
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances at the beginning of this year after having been able to cross through the state in a flight from benkel and the Missour police took him to arrest without being charged with a crime .
In addition , a note refers to a recent report compiled by the Chief Prosecutor of Missour , which shows that in the state , the cars of black drivers are less likely to be stopped than priests .
&quot; The comment is intended to make people aware and to warn their families , friends and collaborators of what can happen in Missour , &quot; said Mr Chapel .
&quot; People must be prepared , whether this means taking money away from the top of the day or informing their relatives that they are passing through the state . &quot;
On the basis of the latest information from the programme for information on hate crime by FBI , 100 hate crime cases were recorded in Missoura in 2015 , which places the state in a cross @-@ section 16th place in the number of offences similar to the state .
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missour law , which makes it difficult to sue the company against the discrimination in the search for housing or work .
The American Civil Liberties Association ( ECEC ) , Mexico , had previously issued travel concerns for Texas and Arizona , after these states adopted immigration laws that obliged local authorities to arrest people for infringements of immigration , as the ACLU says that it will increase the racial profiling .
Normally , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs against other countries , but recently , interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .
Hepatitis : What could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease ?
Hepatitis , or a liver burner , may be caused by five different diseases ranging from A , B , C , D and E hepatitis .
All these viruses are a cause of acute flax .
However , with a bad cost , the hepatitis B and C are chronic , which can continue to develop the lip , that is to say , the liver and the pay cancer .
The epidemiology apples of health advisor , Kucrown , tells us that the acute hepatitis disease phenomenon is the same for all types of vegetable species - pound disease , fatigue , tigue , birth , oestation , soul , defamation , malal emissions , black horse mackerel , meat and pasta , and meat and pigmeat , and meat and mass strah .
The last disease is also the result of the folk name of the liver &apos;s disease .
Children can undergo hepatitis without any disease .
Different types of organic combustion can only be identified on the basis of data from a laboratory study .
Besiver hepatitis can pass on to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without symptoms , which means that a person may not know anything about a disease that is harmful to his or her harmful liver .
The audio Kutsar highlights various forms of hepatitis and describes their course of action in detail .
One hepatitis viruses spread from a sick to human and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water or drinking water , via pigs , from beach , from infected humans to beaches , from farm to food , from trees , from farm to maize , from dirty to wood , from dirty to permeation and from drug consumption .
A hepatitis was a risk of infection - that is to say , the family and carers of the disease , people suffering from chronic liver diseases , sex with an infection , sex men with men , drug addicts , travellers with hepatitis high @-@ quality countries visiting travellers .

Fruit and vegetables are forgiven before consumption , and to avoid eating little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , to drink only safe drinking water and to avoid drug consumption .
Although at the last round , competitors were testing four @-@ fold Olympic winners to go out of the way , the Farah , 34 years old , found power at the end row and won 26.49.51 .
The Farah did not think long enough to take the lion &apos;s path after the finiler along the road to his wife , Tania , and children .
This was a particular moment for me .
I am very much giving my family my own initiative .
They were on a wonderful course , &quot; said Farah for journalists .
Farah is targeting the fifth edition of the prize in London , with an increasing budget of 5 000 and 10 000 metres of the current gold heading .
Everything is possible if there is faith in it .
Despite the title , Mrs O &apos;Connori is summer in &apos; Daam gold &apos; , the remarkable story of the Gustav Klimt &apos;s masterpiece , the book of Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer , is triggering a work of art from scratch to much deeper into the 20th century and the early 20th century in Vienna .
But in more depth , in history .
A lethal information on the car would have the effect of a cut in the North straw , a narrower whim , would have a client on an exceptional portfolio allowed in the title .
At present , there are two books between the chambers of the Gustav Klimt and his painting , the story of Adele Bloch @-@ Baueri , and a much larger and more comprehensive newspaper book from the distinguished Jewish families and the German occupation , with its follow @-@ up effects in Austria .
The first third of the book in the middle of a draconian Vienna , who has become a cultural life in the middle of a wedding trial and who himself has been in the capital city of Austria , can hardly imagine how , over a hundred years ago , she went around life in Russtrass or how , in the Centrali cake , all the heads fell when the customer was in .
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities of Europe and , seeing the name that we know in the book , seemed to have felt more culturally .
However , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a town where he pulled in an indeterminate piece of guilt and was the highest level of suicides in Europe is , as if nothing else , conducive to the development of the story .
Or perhaps , however , every couple of couples also take a fair line adds colour to the life of culture in Vienna at the start of the 20th century .
The dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In recent decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna has exploded , turning into the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
The timing exchange was almost one in ten people in Vienna .
Visitors were also newcomers in Vienna , but by the time the helpless for Adele was the twet of two times the Czech Republic sugar magnadi Ferdinand Bloch and the Klimt were represented for his famous painting , his father has already become the seventh @-@ largest bank bank in the Habsburg Empire .
However , the whole life of the glacier , where he was famous , was not drawn .
If you look at &apos; Daami gold &apos; , you cannot believe that , at the end of life , this great antiquated anti @-@ nationalism and dreamt of a journey from the air to the Soviet Union .
In 1903 , when Mr Bloch decided to order his wife &apos;s portfolio from Klimbook , the last moment &apos;s bull @-@ manner in Vienna was a mageyelder .
The climt ordered the price at the time of USD 4 000 per litre , a quarter of the price of a good house of house .
The fact that , in some of the portfolio cases , a master &apos;s modelle was suspected , did not discourage sugar magnate .
As far as the brain is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship that has been established in the course of the work with the artist continued to work until the end of life .
Ms Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connor - &apos; in Daam gold .
Gustamt &apos;s masterpiece , Adele Bloch @-@ Baueri portm , a special story &quot; , Varrak 2016 , Aldo Randmaa translated from English .
Just before the start of the work with Adelega , the Klimt had been in San Vitale , and the researchers believe that it was there that the gulty mosaic countries from the spring Theodora gave the arts the idea of making a golden portfolio from Adeleree a a pathored mosailic .
The customer was presented in his &quot; Daami gold &quot; in Vienna in 1908 and at around the same time ( between 1907 and 1908 ) , was born in another golden land , &quot; The Svellus &quot; .
The artists did not notice the similarity of two women .
What about the story of Hitler ?
&quot; I think I owe him to remember my friend Klimt to make his hand to the public , &quot; wrote to him Bloch @-@ Bauer a few years after leaving a man ( Klimt died in February 1918 ) to the Director of the Belvedere Museum and he wanted to see their family Klimmuti go to Museum and he wanted to see their climour .
Six years before the death of , the customer was a marathon from Adelest .
In his testament ( Adele left in February 1925 ) , he also asked that her wife leave two sports courses and four Gustav Klimt birds to the Austrian city of Galway .
He gave his true testimonies to Mariana and Luves .
One year after the customer had finished the &apos; Austrian Mona lisa &apos; , Viin Kaath had attempted access to Akademine by Adolf Hitler , 17 years old , but failed the drawing period .
Although sometimes the reason for Hitler &apos;s late anti @-@ Semitism is that the Jewish professors did not accept him in the Academy , no one of his excusers was actually a habit .
In any case , the task of Austrian Galer , referred to in Maria testament , had changed considerably by 1939 , had become important in finding work for the benefit of the women in the Gosphere in the rich Jewish arts in Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal wealth of art was also a match for some of the work he has been at home , but not for the Klimt .
Sixty years after the kidnapping of the arts of the Nazis , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute began between the heir from the Austrian Government and Bloch @-@ Baumir .
All that remains is that , if the &apos; Snovelanism &apos; sees &apos; in Vienna in Belvedere Castle , the &apos; Daami gold &apos; described by Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer must be viewed in New York &apos;s Neue Galway .
And before Vienna , it was also possible to read through the aforementioned book .
Even if you do not intend to look at the Klimt &apos;s work , because my emotion , at least , after the closure of the book , was more the subject of nair and hair than the bucket and the modell of Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer , sold for USD 135 million .
So , not so much a portfolio , but rather a very moving story of a marriage - a family .
In a significant way , events facilitated the orientation of the relatives of the Bauer who was brought into the book at the beginning .
The 17 @-@ year @-@ old swimmer in Canada was very close to Estonia &apos;s record
In their quest for life , gold was the personal record of 200 m pork swimming in the swimming areas of 2.16.62 .
The label comes from a 17 @-@ year @-@ old pipe time , when the Canadian Championship was awarded a maximum of 16.58 , the Priit Aaviku &apos;s Ujumiskio bloc .
Gold ended , in other words , by the end of the calendar , &apos; A &apos; .
In the chair , he passed the distance from 2.68 to 2.76 , and achieved a good seventh position with a new powerful top @-@ level mark .
Alina Kendzioris of the Estonian record ( 2.15.13 ) in the Gulf of Costag left a little over half a second .
In Estonia &apos;s ranking of all history gold rose third and its fresh personal top @-@ down is the fifth outcome of all the times in Estonia .
The young hope for the future is to start a further 100 m , 200 m and 400 mighty in the Canadian football championships , and to wage 200 mand 400 more kings .
Last week in Toronto , the Canadian Championship , the Venice championship , was held and gold was able to make a successful start there .
He won 200 m in pipe oil with the silver medal time 2.2.3.22 .
So quickly , this was swamped by the last quarter of the year in 2008 .
The Golden site has been through the time @-@ out in Estonia only had the record Estonian Elina Park distance .
In Canada , the leader of the new Canadian city won a further scolley in a faint of 100 m @-@ alkali , with excellent personal samples and 56.66 new Estonian season marches .
For example , his year old Kertu ly Alnek has distanced this distance from being just one century .
He reached the top @-@ profile circle by finding a further 100 m in the swimming boom in the opening of the theatre of the correspondence at 1.03.69 .
For half , he only gained a seat from the 7th distance when he stunned in the final figure 2.17.31 .
Gold is currently running a ranking of four distinct distanced from the Estonian season .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics cheer ahead
The time for the holidays has come - that is to say a tick back to US President , Donald Trumpin .
However , as Trump has so far been one of the Presidents who has removed one of the most holidays , the critics are already hammer .
According to the US &apos;s current and CNN reports , the President &apos;s plan is for 17 days &apos; leave in the liquid golf clubs in Bedminster in New Jersey .
Even though the President began yesterday , the President &apos;s leave has spoken for a week on the subject of the irregular leave of Trup .
They are throwing ahead too often , in the form of a whim .
Indeed , the President has the standard practice of having a period of weekend in his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey cotton .
Incidentally , Mr Trump has not been the President who has pumped the most into his 196 term of office .
For example , on a holiday holiday at the time , George W. Bush had already reached 67 days , Barack Obama , but halves less than Trump , just 21 days .
What the Olympic Games are doing is to quickly fail .
The days before becoming President , in the case of Mr Trump , &apos; in the sending &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , it was said that , for long periods of leave , his man would not be in time because a great deal has to be done .
He also expressed his outrage three years ago to Barack Obama &apos;s leave .
The current President wrote on Twitter then : &apos; While Obama is on holiday , golf is playing , the brakes and the gentlemen &apos;s groups , in Thailand , journalists are walking their heads from the horse &apos; .
According to the information of the white house officials , the 17 @-@ day golf club visit to the pollen is not a cut @-@ off .
This is officially called &apos; working time &apos; , instead , during which the Tirker has no time to read or any other act of intent .
In addition , there had to be another reason for working time .
Indeed , the western housing system of the White House is replaced by a special system for the private storage of accounts , which is why the whole staff had to leave .
The West Bank also has a presence in the Ovaalpekycabinet and other places of work of the President .
&quot; I do not think anybody would like to be in the West in August if you have 38 degrees and no balance pensions there , &quot; said Lindsay Walters , the spokesperson of the White House , who stressed that the President would continue to work during his leave .
Where President Trump will spend 17 days &apos; time , you will get a sounding spot .
Blocking critics of the critics on Facebook , excluding candidates from a national office if you do not tolerate criticism from the voters
Our father knew a great deal about the unfavourable media reports .
The Americans loved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take much to start chatting him on everything from internal politics to his political principles .
The criticism , of course , has annoyed him .
However , he did not have to keep his critics alive .
Because in 1783 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression could be taken from us and , more strongly and in silence , we could be led by fire on the slaughterhouse of sheep &apos; .
This brings me to Mrs Hogan , Governor of Maryland , who has to struggle to be more in Washington .
Under Hogan , the detentions of at least 450 people have blocked and erated , and have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page .
And at the beginning of the week , the Alliance for Freedom of Citizens of America ( American Citizens ) was therefore taking it to court .
The Sixist officers were investigating an action as empty and web comments were broken up by &apos; who cares ? &apos; .
&apos;These is just Facebook , &apos; many people said .
But this matters .
And this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan .
This is an astonishing popular guest of governors in an overwhelming democratic state .
His percentage of discharge is the second highest in the country among the 50 governors .
The Hogan is not a reactive head of view .
He has led the state in a firm manner and has remained firm in his principles .
In addition , he has used his or her Facebook relatively wisely as the main instrument in communicating with voters , for example , by presenting his own rostrum head after chemotherly .
So the writer &apos;s body Mercedes Bresso is a public forum with a formal mark , managed by a staff who is paid on taxpayers &apos; dollars and who are in need and end up being unsafe .
In an interview with the Director of the Hogan press , Amelia Chasse , in defence of the conduct of the Governor in The Washington Martin , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation .
But it is all too easy to paint a picture of online screening , of spammers or of people full of hatred .
The post was held by a number of people who were blocked by Hogan .
This is what they are , and this is what they are , quite what the agenda is , namely , people who are communicating with their elected leaders , the teacher , the owner of the company and the pastor , not online controls .
They all said that their comments were respectful , considered and not at all rose .
In his mail , the Pastor quoted milk in the form of a call to the Catholic traffic of Hogan .
A lawyer from Maryland in Bowie , Lakshm Sarma Raman , not encouraged hatred , but rather a hate crime .
&quot; I have put it politely that I am disappointed that I have not reacted to hate crime or to other recent news reports , &quot; he wrote a comment in the countdown of The mail news story .
&apos;I also do not like the idea that , if many people are commenting on the same subject , some of them will suddenly be called a dilimpezy collective effort , instead of acknowledging that it is a great deal of concern for citizens &apos; .
What the Governor &apos;s officer called &apos; the targeted junk fire attack &apos; would probably be invited by others to &apos; public support &apos; .
The age of Facebook allows messages to be easily matched by blocking or deleting a negative comment .
It is a much cleaner thing than in the past , when it was necessary to send out staff to do the same , so that they can gather newspapers with critical editorial lists and burn them or arrest them and make them keep them quiet .
But this is exactly what is happening now , just digital .
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media hyperseless .
President Trup has been sued by users of Twitter who have been blocked from the stream of Twitter .
One of the first sentences of notice on this subject was made in Virginia last week .
A US @-@ based Judge , James C. Cacheris , decided in Alexandria that the board of supervisors of the Loudounn Region had infringed the first amendment to the constitution when he blocked the constituent on Facebook page .
In Ktucky , the Governor , Matt Bevinit ( R ) , also visited the Governor for the use of the ACLU Facebook and Twitter .
This should not be so difficult .
During Washington , the affordable postal costs had a similar impact to the Internet .
Between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers and the anonymous writers dared him to drive his way of driving .
And even then , Washington had to face up to its anonymous walls .
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseudo @-@ law such as Juricola , Valerius , Belisariu and Portius , by grappling Washington decisions .
In the framework of the &apos; Seal George Washington &apos; project , he has collected the signatures of his historic documents , he has buried a cabinet in petition criticising his views on friendship , Trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain .
But he did not force them to keep silent .
Freedom of expression , differences and debates are the very foundations of our country .
And proper management means accepting it .
Ronan Rafferty hopes for comfort of the home territory in Renaissance Clubus
The former European representation , Ronan Rafferty , hopes for comfort in the home territory in the next three days , if the Full Renaissance Renaissance Clubi golf takes place on 25 occasions : Scottish Senior Open .
The Northern Ireland , which was in the last round of Archerfield Linksi courses in the vicinity of last year , before the fall of Paul Ealpit , has opened the new site of departure and is filling the role of the facilitator and executive leader , Jerry Sarvadi , as a market agent instead of the person .
&quot; I saw how Renaissance Clubi was built , and now we can see how the club is shining in full smack of this event , &quot; said Rafferty .
&quot; The players see the path in their best shape , this is in a splendid state .
Jerry has done an excellent job in establishing this place .
He is a keen supporter of a golftsroom and proud of what has been achieved here .
This will allow the path to be presented excellently . &quot;
An Englishman is ever looking forward to being able to host the first championship , even though he has won both the European Cypriot and the European challenge in his 32 years of life .

&quot; I could not defend the title of my Extremadura Overs , as this was taken off my poker one year later .
It is mathematical to come back to this channel .
This is a great place to play golf .
I remember the memories of last year , for me and for my wife , Sharon , a particular victory was last year .
This was a very special time , which we will be forever committed to . &quot;
On the soil of the home , another Gary Orr is returning to the competition , who joined the European Youth Association at the beginning of this year , when he got 50 .
This is the first event in Scotland after the participation of Aberdeen Management Scottish Openil in 2013 .
&quot; It is always a little more meaningful to play at home , &quot; said Helensburg &apos;s man .
&apos;You have got good , but there are also some additional brilliant figures .
I have enjoyed a huge amount of gamble and have demonstrated a fairly decent game of golf .
I am happy with the progress made so far . &quot;

Poverty and death in the gold land of Indonesia
If Mr Degei is preparing , he will not use the lead .
He even seldom uses the poker .

However , working late may be dangerous outcomes , most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink hard , plus soldiers .
&quot; No one will dare to go around after five o &apos;clock in a happy morning , &quot; he says .
It is a rare sight in the history of the book in Papua Khalibut , a former Dutch colony that was added to Indonesia in 1969 , after the referendum that created polemics , where only 1 026 people who had to vote , under the very eyes of the forces , to vote .
The move , which has been released from the power of the Dutch people , is being quickly instigated by its outrage against the Jakarta government , which is still holding the region under its tight control , away from foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
In 2003 , the province of Pope was officially distributed to the West Pope , so that Papua New Guinea , independent , remained in the east of the island .

&quot; Before then , we only carried a plant on a body . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty threshold , and the statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are one of the worst in Asia .
But this is also a gold @-@ rich country for Indonesia .
Just 100 km from Paniaas , which is the tune of New Jersey , a mountain province with a population of 153 000 inhabitants , is the largest and most lucrative gold mine in the world , Grasberg , a company in Phoenix , Freeport McMoran .
In 2015 alone , Freeport from here was extracted some USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and coph .
In addition , Papua can be smuggled with consumer timber stocks , which are estimated at USD 78 billion .
However , these riches are a source of suffering for pathogens , as they are the cause of the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian army .
A study carried out in 2005 by the New York Times showed that Freeport paid approximately USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including around USD 150 000 per victim .
The attempts by the Paats to ensure greater autonomy threatens this golden hall and is ruthlessly retreated .
According to human rights activists , more than 500 000 killers have been killed since 1969 , and another thousands of the Indonesian army have raped , tortured and imprisoned .
According to the Committee on Human Rights of Asia , the massive killing of the genocide in the hills of the 1970s in the memories belonging to the certificates of Papua tribal pride was an inmeasurable measure .
Last year alone , over 3 900 peaceful protestors were arrested in the region of Indonesia .
The 2016 report of the Syndrome Zhop of Burma contains testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year , such as extrajudicial executions , torture ( another report says that rape and the delivery of electric slash are particularly widespread ) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; It is difficult to read the figure , because there are incidents like this every week , &quot; says Andreas Harsono , the journalist of the Organisation &apos;s Human Rights Watch .
The concessions are even more strongly shut down , because the natural assets of Papua Mountains have caused the influx of new settlements from elsewhere in Indonesia .
Eighty @-@ five per cent of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demographics are changing , because there are economic migrants coming from the junk of the Indonesian people , Jaava , Kalimantan , Sumatra and the Sulawes islands .
Live canteens sell in the gallery and stores with gadame and mututains , which are stored in tank with the geomamic depth .
The local community cannot compete with them .
&quot; Migrants started selling hens and vegetables more cheaply than local boats in the traditional market , &quot; explains the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ege Habitat born in Paniai , who worked to work in the city of Jayapurus .
&apos;Children &apos;s paaf Veld , the Alpleper of the poor people , Papua mama &#91; Women &#93; , therefore loses their market share &apos; .
The President of Indonesia , Joko Widodo , who is known to the population as Jokowi , promised to address in his election campaign in 2014 these inequalities and human rights violations in the Pope .
The former purest won on its way from the Jakarta presidential Palace to the 27 of Papua 29 constituencies , including the Paniai .
But the Pope has changed very little , and the local feel cheated .
&quot; Our hearts are broken because in 2014 , we voted for Jokow in the expectation that he would live up to our hopes of restoring justice , &quot; said You will say .
In fact , Mr Paniai only had two months after he took office in October .
On 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the Morotali songs on a Christmas Christmas , when two Indonesian soldiers were wearing the darkness of the motorcycle .
The children who met said to them that they should include the front lights .
After talking about a local pastor Yavedt Tebai , one of the soldiers was sentenced to one of their voices and subsequently returned to four troops .
According to victims and witnesses , soldiers in the Cob were using children and behaving them with their own devices .
Then one of the soldiers was shot among children .
One child , one of the 16 years old , Yulianus Yeimot , was so cruelly beaten that he fell into the home .
A few hours later , the building in the close electoral Commission was burnt down and , the next day , the estuary was still further .
Around 1 000 young Pamen , women and children gathered to demand justice at the football pitch of the local police office and the military command centre .
They carried out cerer buses and presented a pago in Papua mee &apos;s clothing without a waving tanker , where a drink was running round and a mong was buried .
Some of the protesters started to wrapping up against the police and the military .
&apos;Whew , when the screw of anger was carried on to soldiers via an internal calendar , &apos; if the crowds show resistance more than three times , go down , &apos; was said in a formal document what has been seen by the time limit but which has not been issued to local media exhibitors .
The parent Mayor of Kego Koto , Yeremias Kayame ( 56 ) , was feeling a threatening threat and called for the maintenance of peace by asking for the crowd to go home .
No one wanted to hear .
&quot; All round , I was shot at the extreme left , &quot; he said time for a magazine in his private colour , on the verb of the cave .
Kayame still does not know who the shoot was , but says that in the month , the ranks of the soldiers gathered came .
&quot; There was a lot of people , a lot of abject , in the garden . &quot;
Alfius Youw , a local man , was arrested three times after he had been shot , say the kettle .
&quot; I would like to come back to him and inquire through his body to make sure that it was with him , &quot; said the magazine time in Yohanes , who , like many Indians , use only one name .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I was novel to him . &quot;
The chief inspector of the Pakian police , Yotje Mende , told reporters that he was only responsible for ensuring the security of his own Parish , because it was attacked .
&quot; We must protect ourselves if threats are to be made , &quot; said Pudjo Sulistiyo , the spokesman for the Pakian police .
&quot; This is a matter of life and death . &quot;
According to human Rights Watch , five young protestors were killed and there were many injured people .
The news of the killings reached Jakara only the day after .
Three weeks later , Jokow Jayapura held a passionate speech , in which he expressed his condolences to the victims &apos; families and allowed the impropriety of the Pope to be dealt with .
&quot; I want to resolve this incident immediately so that it will never be repeated in the future , &quot; he said .
In October 2016 , Wiranto , the security minister , said that he would set up an alternative mechanism for resolving the human rights crimes .
However , almost immediately followed the excuses .
&quot; Most of the crimes happened a long time ago .
Some of these were in the 1990s and in the early 2000s .
The point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we must follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
However , speaking at the time of the time on 5 June in Jakarta , Wiranto took his words back , saying that he had no intention of setting up a Pope mechanism to deal with complaints .
Instead , he said that &apos; everything is resolved according to the law &apos; .
Wiranto , who has been accused by the UN of committing crimes against human rights in relation to the death of more than 1 000 people in East Timor in the course of the bloody referendum in 1999 , said that 11 human rights crime had already been solved in Pope , including what happened in Paniai .
The families of the victims of the Paniai took such arguments with a gloomy belief .
&quot; I have been interrogated four times in the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Yohanes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
He says that , years later , there is still fear .
&apos;I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&quot; I am afraid that the army is arresting me , I am afraid I am being shot . &quot;
He gave a clean assurance to Ms. Yacobus that the people of Panian are afraid to slander this incident .
He said that he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bury four victims .
&quot; After burying the bodies , the army had to look at me , &apos; he says .
The arrests have not stopped .
On Tuesday , the Mayor of the Indonesian police , in the neighbouring Siliary , in Deiyais , was shot .
One person was killed and 17 wounded , including children , when it went on to go on to talk between the head of the village and the building company , who refused to carry an unknown man to hospital .
This man , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ravianus Douw , who drown into nearby rivers in an attempt to fish , died on the road to hospital .
The inhabitants of the villages of the country were protesting against the office of the company on the construction site .
According to the police , the people in the villages were storing police stoned , with the latter responding with warning bullets .
However , local would argue that mobile British people ( the Indonesian police ) started to fire on the population , killing a single person .
&quot; We were in a great panic , we are afraid of revenge , &quot; said a letter of time number 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dominggu Badii who lives near hospital and saw the infuriating of the injured .
&quot; I have been deceiving myself in my own house for two days . &quot;
The Deiyi Parliament has called for the police to be held responsible and for the re @-@ drawing of a mobile Briton from the region .
The Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government .
The lack of meaningful development will feed the dissatisfaction of the honey , the mone , the dancing and the dammal tribes in Papua Bhalic land .
Many of these have joined the army of free Paapua ani rebels ( VPL ) , which , in its own words , protects the rights of boats by carrying out casual attacks and abductions among Indonesian soldiers .
Some of the leaders of VPL come from Paniya , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
In response , in the name of defending &apos; the sovereignty of the state &apos; , the army has in recent years arrested in Paniai and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
Some of them will never emerge again .
Among the people of Papua , the Panii is known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
Poverty is fuelling dissatisfaction .
The little rip that is sold in the majority is too costly to buy for local people .
The figure is as unachievable .
People are growing mainly on the basis of the fabric of their entire food , plus a little fruit and food .
Farming is the job of women , who can each manage to maintain four or five of the objects of the baseline .
They usually keep most of the harvests to their families , and the remainder is sold on the local market .
Ten bars pay only 10,000 premises in Indonesia ( 75 cents ) .
In time , economic disparities between the incompetent boats and the new migrants who have come to a great deal since the opening of new flight routes at Nabire airport have deepened .
The few jobs that exist are going to go to more educated and more wealthy migrants .
The matches themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business .
&quot; Young people are not interested in leaving a fridge because there is no jobs or no money , &quot; says John Gobai , Chairman of the Paniai tribal Council .
The isolation will keep the eyes of the world from the Pope .
In addition , there are severe restrictions on the external media .
At the beginning of this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basilth Longchamp were expelled from the Pope because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they had been given a rare film authorisation .
According to Mr Kine , Deputy head of the Asia Division for Human Rights Watch , the commitments made by Mr Jokow to remove the restrictions placed on reports to promote transparency and development have not been implemented .
&quot; In Indonesia , journalists trying to report on the most turbulent provinces of peace in Papua Paputan and West Pope are facing new threats to the rejection of the Sakharov visa and blacklist , &quot; he said in a statement .
The absence of a glance into the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to the closest neighbours .
In March , six Pacific countries were encouraged by jaotatakse ts , Nauru , Belau , Tuvalu , Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands to investigate &apos; a series of large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in the Paapua , including the shooting of Paniai .
The same countries have historically supported VPL .
The journalist , Arrmanatha Nasir , the spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed the accusations of a group &apos;s beer by stating to the press : &apos; In Indonesia democracy and freedom of the press , so that proof of cases against human rights is hard to bury &apos; .
The people who are there want more of the foreign governments to be taken into consideration .
When the delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , Kees Van Baari , visited Jayapurat on 4 May , the local people interrupted the meeting , but anonymous with the source of their silence , urging us to &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
In Indonesia , there will be new presidential elections in 2019 , but the pacifs will not believe that they will be voting again for Jokow .
&quot; Jokowi is a man with good intentions , but the people around him who are involved in shooting Paniai say &quot; he , President of the tribal Council , Hobai .
He wants to give Jokow the impression that , apart from the fact that the people of Panii are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army , they are suffering from the scourge of misery of education and health services .
According to Mr Bloom , people in the Panian , like other boats , regard their vote in the debt that they have to pay to Jokow .
&apos;They do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
Despite the theft and intimidation , the families of the victims of Panian were able to cope with the latest symbolic reaction , pirates , which have served the body of the victim , the police stations and the army bases in the country .
Knowing that justice may never be done , they will at least not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&apos;One of our family members was killed &apos; says the main message that has been felled in Yacobus .
&apos;What else can we do ? &apos;
The neil came in the Horycle of Dubai Torch , the second time in the room .
On Friday , one of the greatest residential blocks in the world sank in Dubai , forced hundreds of residents to escape from this 337 @-@ metre of desert and 79 @-@ till @-@ based buildings .
This is the second fire that has devastated in just two years from the High Hall , which is , incidentally , called the Torch , the TÃµrvik .
The building was evacuated , no injury was reported and no direct cause of fire was presented .
&quot; We sleep and woke up the fire camp and the crying out of the people .
We would be getting under the cows and we needed about 10 minutes to get down to the bottom of the 50th , &apos; Reuterna was a single man who called himself George &apos; .
According to the civil protection officers of Dubai , firemen were also out of killer at around 4 a.m. in the morning at local time ( 00.00 GMT ) and jailed in the building .
The government said that it was working to ensure shelter for the victims .
This incident may once again raise questions around the world about the safety of materials used on the external surface of high @-@ ranking sources .
A study carried out at the end of the storm in the Torch Bureau in 2015 found that the most damage was caused by fassasic tests , the decoronised panels and isolation of external soil .
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of Grenfell Tower in London and the fasteners could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June , with nearly 80 deaths .
See : From these phones , sales claims will probably be available in the autumn
Key and autumn is a time for technical sports , because then telephone manufacturers will be making their new models of excellence public .
In the spring , the sales of Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia Premium came to be sold , and in the autumn , too , new hitt @-@ phones for boelephire trees are expected .
According to the leader of the television markets and sales , Sir Christian Seema , street ships are characterised by an innovative design , a mouse @-@ ray of eyes , a serse @-@ servani resolution 4K screen and an ultra @-@ fast process .
The great excitement of the technology world , Samsung Galaxy S8 , has also been shown to be in the top ranking of the Estonian smartphone League .
In autumn , the latter will allow even more advanced radiation to be charged to the use of smartbent products , a more robust treaders , and a higher water and dust resistance .
He added that , on the basis of rumours , he can already speculate and predict the four top models that will probably commemorate the sales tables .
These four top @-@ edge model for smartphones will reach the supermarket operators in the autumn of this year .
The long @-@ awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone Plus should reach the boys as early as mid @-@ September .
The images of what the new Apple model sees and can do about it are much .
If the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences between the iPhone 6s , it is expected that the new model will be completely distinct from the previous one for Apple &apos;s 10th birthday .
Four colours have been mentioned : Black , white , white , white and white gold and chromium .
One element of the new design is obviously the screen , which covers the entire phone panel , has been lost in the home and the fingerprints are built on the screen .
The new model of the Apple design , JonyIve , requires that a new iPhone model look like a glass .
There has also been talk about a ceramic version of an iPhone .
In addition to the &apos; catch the eye &apos; , the &apos; wireless &apos; and the even higher @-@ quality &apos; camera , speed A11 can be expected .
This is certainly one of the most expected smart phones for the year .
The launch of the optional Galaxy note 8 of the brand brand brand will begin on 23 August .
There are a lot of rumours of what the new Galaxy note 8 will look like .
It is worth noting that even more is intended for the businessmen and that the S pen will allow even more functionality .
The telephone should have two cameras , one being a slander and the other a television item with a narrow view .
Nobody is yet aware of what two drowning sticks are capable of , but in any case this is the first test of the same same , which is surely of the same level in terms of quality as the iPhone 8 .
However , we are awaiting intense August 23 .
Although Nokia has brought sales this year with three smart phones , led by Nokia 6 , there is still a shortage of their flagship ship , Nokia 8 , which is already to be presented on 16 August .
We are awaiting a screw from well to 5.3 @-@ dust @-@ guzzling and a very fast @-@ trail of Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processes and a more robust ag .
Nokia is also talking about lower aluminium flats and significant levels of water and customs security IP68 .
Like the code , Nokia &apos;s new model has two nurtures of the camera , the optics of which is produced by the Zeiss company .
If the Sony @-@ proof flagship ship has been in the run @-@ up to XZ Premium , the producer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smart phones will have even more innovative functions .
We are awaiting a smart phone which is a little more modest than XZ Premium , but at least with the same good or the better camera .
There has been speculation about the new model for Sony that it is on a screen that is at least hot air .
What is the reality , we can see the very soon , because traditionally at the International Technology Fair ( IFA ) , which is due to be published at the Sony &apos;s autumn flagship International Technology Fair , this year , this year , from 1 to 6 September .
According to transcriptors leaked by telephone calls , Trump was pressurised by the border wall by the bill
The Washington post revealed transcriptions of telephone calls between US President Donald Trup and Mexican Heads of State .
On 27 January , the telephone word for Trump pressed the Mexican President , Enrique Pena Nieto , went to the effect that the latter would stop declaring that he would not be able to pay for the proposed border wall .
The American President was in abhor with him for denouncing the wall , saying &apos; You must not say this to the press &apos; .
The Trump has placed a commitment in its presidential campaign to build a trail of the United States &apos; southern border walls and the old age , to make Mexico pay for this project .
Transcriptors were also published from his first speech with the Prime Minister of Australia , Malcolm Turnbull , which reveals an intense debate .
Mr President , Mr Turnbull said that the agreement that the United States would take on the refugees who are heading to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; nervous &apos; and &apos; foolish &apos; ; he said that an agreement that was made during the Obama Government would leave him with the &apos; head &apos; impression , because he has proposed a ban on refugees from the United States .
The taxi finished the speech by stating to Mrs Turnbull that &apos; this was the most unpleasant speech of the day &apos; .
The Supreme Court did not take up a complaint in the City of Orange MRP in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their offer of bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 2029 .
This is a handbook rejecting the offer of the city of OÃœ MRP to the Tartu bus , because the offer was not compliant , Anneli Apuhtin , Director @-@ General of the Tartu City Service .
This is a public bus and coach transport procurement for the period from 1.1.07.2019 to 0.06.2029 .
The associations of MRP have brought to the Supreme Court the judgment of the Tartu District Court .
The Supreme Court did not act .
Although many in the social media complain that the web @-@ sounding session from the festival is disrupting their night and that the entire town is full of breaders in the drink , there are many who do not have a single word to say a bad about the festival that is going on in the field .
I am even positively surprised that the brakes were so polite in the supermarket !
I have not seen any disgust or any lack of courtesy .
Even the flame saw , &apos; there is a nice wave .
&quot; It is good that you are coming , you are caught and you are happy to see what has been a winter grade , &quot; she is happy to add .
The wave of a wave of rubber @-@ jumping is not a shame .
While living in a central town , he is still hearing music being played on the floor , now the music has not reached his home rate .
&quot; But I hope that I hear , &quot; he will be happy to say .
Also , in the conversation about the evening , Agnes says that the &apos; Grand festival &apos; is good for the record &apos; , which is a major contribution to the turnover of local merchants .
Furthermore , he is pleased that the capital city of the summer has come so many outbreaks .
No woman of the family &apos;s metal .
Although I am no longer on the coast , it is good that the rand has recovered .
And it is good that the people are moving and that has already been the case three times &apos; , says a woman .
I think that the first time round was a little worse .
&apos;Perhaps there were complaints &apos; , he will reflect on .
What is common for the people of Ireland , he said , is the normal thing for the summer capital .
&quot; This Weekend is a very good prof for our small town , &quot; says Harri , who is beating in the park .
Neither does he or she have bogged down in his life and mouth .
Well , for what ?
We should all make savings .
Think how this communication between nations would be better .
After all , the man of music is not kissing .
This does not happen , although I live near there .
&quot; The good people can make savings and there is no trouble at all , &quot; he is speaking .
Visitors coming to the Seals are , according to him , visa @-@ free .
&quot; With the Alliance , they have , of course , also joined a bit , but young people are young people and issance - give God , go , but be people and we can do it ! &quot;
The people on the ground have travelled away somewhere by then , whether to their relatives or to those who know .
&quot; But in general , the festival has a positive effect on life - people like this metre , &quot; says Tiina , the Tiina , a man who has walked with children from Vienna .
His family , too , is not bothered by the festivals , although last year , it was even more than this year &apos;s .
Last summer , the scene was different , then we heard more .
We live outside the city that , in fact , it is quite well lit there from the Seals of Heritage . &apos;
Beijing is cutting another 3 000 jobs and reducing dividends to revive the business
The British educational firm Pearson said on Friday that he would cut another 3 000 jobs and reduce his interim dividend by 72 % , thus launching another restructuring programme to deal with the mentoring burden of business .
The jobs that will be covered , which will most likely be concentrated according to the CEO , John Falloni , at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will add to the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring .
Beijing announced in May the intention to cut expenditure under the third cost @-@ cutting programme by another GBP 300 million ( USD 394 million ) to try and revive the business that has been hit by the move to fast digital learning .
A company that agreed to sell its participation in the company , Penguin Random House , to its partner company , Bertelsmann , last month said that their expectation of a year in connection with the situation has not changed since the sales revenue increase of 1 % was announced at EUR 2.05 billion was declared in the first half of the year .

Kabul attack : In a suicide bombard , NATO soldier lost his death
A suicide bomber attacked the army convoys in the Afghan capital , Kabul , to death a single NATO soldier and wounded several others .
The NATO statement stated that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
Without verification of local reports , three civilians were killed in an incident in the town of Qarabaghi .
This bombing is the last acts of violence to have hit Afghanistan this month , with more than 30 people killed this day in the Herati mosto attack .
On Monday , the suicide bomber killed two people in Kabul near the embassy in Iraq .
The NATO statement stated that an explosion on Thursday was carried out when , with the Afghan army united by patrol , &apos; a man @-@ made explosives &apos; was attacked .
The statement states that everything is injured in a stable state and is treated in an US military hospital on the flight of Bagram .
According to the correspondents , the Taliban and the group known as the &apos; Islamic state &apos; ( in Denmark ) are the growing forces in Qarabh as a serious source of concern to the forces in Bagrage in NATO .
According to the UN , in the first half of 2017 , at least 1 662 civilians have died in Afghanistan , of which nearly 20 % in the capital .
At the end of July , the car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people , mainly in the line of Shi &apos;ite rays .
According to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
On 31 May , a major bomb attack in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people , which has resulted in the greatest deaths in a military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant to carry out the Taliban &apos;s power in 2001 .
This violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops and the number of US forces that will help the country &apos;s army and the police .
According to the correspondents , the suicide attacks in recent weeks in Kabul have also led to a public confidence crisis in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf Ghan .
The EPA repealed the decision to postpone the regulation after the actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency ( UNStates Environmental Protection Agency Garrido ) repealed the decision to delay the establishment of a regulation at the end of the Obama , which requires states to limit emissions of emissions from the summer , one day after 15 states were sued by this move .
The EPA announced the decision to proceed with &quot; the decision to decide on the content of the BONUS &quot; on Wednesday , saying that it would demonstrate the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperating with the states .
&quot; We believe that we need to have a dialogue and take heed of our national partners , &quot; said Scott Pruitt , the leader of the EPA , in a statement .
The ball had announced in June &apos;s intention to reject the declaration of the June EPA &apos;s levels of ozone in Mehhiko tern , which measure pollution in various parts of the country in order to determine where it should be reduced to compliance with the more stringent air quality standard by one year from February to 2018 .
In conjunction with the Colombian community , 15 main democratic states lodged a fixture of proceedings on Tuesday , saying that this decision was unlawful .
President Donald Trumpi &apos;s government has tried to bring back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President , Barack Obama , and I think that is part of the broader plan for boosting growth .
However , these efforts have led to reactions among the groups of democrats and nature protection who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
The EPA website states that an inhaling of the ozone layer &apos; may reduce the ability of lung to work and increase the risk of disease to respiratory diseases &apos; , for instance in asthma .
German pigs can come from a dead end .
German pigs and cattle can have a ticket , since heavy rains are a threat to the harvesting of the EU &apos;s second @-@ biggest wheat producer , which is to be signed by Bloomberg .
This year , it may be the case that the weekend of precipitations before harvesting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry would only be eaten to animals .
&quot; The quality of content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said Agravis Raiffeisen analytics , Bernhard Chilla .
This year , up to 40 % of German wheat can be fed , which is double the normal , in Agravis .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have been exposed to any beauty this year .
First of all , the winter was too dry .
Then came the cold rock , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
In July , the German Council of Ministers hit the event , which has continued in August .
Many eyes have been turned on to northern Germany , where rain hinders the harvesting .
So far , only five per cent of the wheat has been cleared .
Most areas in the region have not even started harvesting , and the local buyer of the harvest in Ceravis has stated .
&quot; This is a very difficult day , &quot; said Frank Deckert Rendsburg , the parent trader of Ceravis .

Mr Lomachenko and Ms Garcia , who should be on the course of a collision to face the most attractive poxing plague in the near future , up to 66.7 kg , met for the first time on Thursday .
They were in Lgelef , in their special rooms in LOS Angeles , until Garcia , the unwon World Boxing Councili lightweight champion , walked to the other side of the corridor to welcome Lomachenkot , the World Boxing Times tably consulting the sulgrasram .
Following the unanimous decision by Garcia , the victory of the former four @-@ fold world champion , Adrien Broner , in Showtime on Saturday in Showtime , both combatants will be part of the top @-@ table format .
The Garcia extended its better hand and said : &apos; How will you go , the champion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
Lomachenko is defending his belts , Miguel Marriaga , on Saturday evening , 19 in the ESPN .
When a few photographers were able to pose a potash , Lomachenko &apos;s mountain jer Egis Klima pointed out that it would be a &apos; perfect exercise &apos; between opposing fighters .
&quot; I am a former sultative , &quot; reminded Mr Garcia .
&quot; I have been calling for Broner &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 63.5 kg .
I want to move below the lighter .
And he must move up the trail &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
The fanatics have asked for this .
Let &apos;s put this on our feet . &quot;
Mrs Lomachenko has agreed .
&quot; The world needs this fight . &quot;
The question that he asked was whether he should be paid for this review , and that is part of his strategy of wanting to allow Lomachenko to book the final half of this year in the 61.2 kg class to make it possible for next summer to meet with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 months ) , who also has an interest in combating Jorge Linarese and Luke Campkkich , following the celebration of the celebration of the primand the celebration of the primour celebration at the Foruence of the commemoration on 23 September .
&quot; Looking at this fight could be worthwhile , because the fans have asked for it , &quot; said Garcia , later saying that it was open to fighting any channel providing the best financial package .
&quot; We are the main actors .
No other name can deserve so much attention .
Whenever they are prepared ... &apos;
Mrs Garcia said that she was considering Lomachenkot as a &apos; forceful fighter &apos; and could go on to stand by her Saturday .
However , Lomachenko was modest in praising the Garcia , saying that he thought that the champion of the three divishons from Riverside saw it &apos; very slow ; I am sorry , Mikey ... you wanted it a nose &apos; .
According to Garcia , the aim was to show strength and then to bow down .
Both have confirmed that they will feel that the tension is increasing to try out between them .
&quot; This is a struggle that is awaiting realisation .
No other confrontation is causing so much attention and a lack of talent .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Garcia .
Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been on the waiting lists of the best fighters , and Mikey is just that .
This will be a good struggle . &quot;
What sort of world raids will be relocated to Estonia ?
The soil was extended and issued by the police and border surveillance agency ( PPA ) in record time over 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work , study or family .
For example , if , for example , the soil was chosen to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit to 6702 foreigners , then Laval was 4928 .
The agencies cannot tell us how many migrants will eventually be stayed in Estonia , but such an analysis will be carried out in the Ministry of the Interior .
If , ten years ago , there were almost 500 Ukrainians in the region of Estonia per year , in recent years this figure will reach 2 000 .
The number of applicants for the residence permit soared during the Ukrainian crisis , with 1 075 people in 2014 as a result of the fixed @-@ term residence permit .
According to the statistics of the office , the highest number of Ukrainian citizens is increasing in Estonia - the cost of the past arrived in Estonia on more than a lottery for 850 Ukrainian citizens .
&quot; The Ukrainian community has been very busy in Estonia all the time , and it is natural because of the difficult circumstances in the country that work and learning opportunities are being sought in the country where the community and many families already had to be represented , Kristin Rammus , the spokesperson for the Home Department .
Soil and Monacd had a greater number of Ukrainians granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit , even with a number of citizens of Russia , although in 10 years total , the most fixed @-@ term residence permits have been granted to them .
If Ukrainians come here largely to work , then the citizens of Russia will be able to migrate .
&quot; Given the historical community here , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties in relation to people living in Russia , &quot; said Helina Meuse , the chief theatre of the Interior Security Academy .
&apos;If you look at where the Russian citizens who have been granted a residence permit to Estonia have moved , then , after Harjuno , there is an East Festen &apos;ll , &apos; he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them are married to a European Union citizen .
Soil was granted to 1.696 Russian citizens for fixed @-@ term residence , which is also a record figure .
At the same time , the residence permit for extending the number of Russians that wanted to enjoy was actually reduced .
&quot; &quot; The stick is the result of requests for a new residence permit to be permanently located in Estonia , &quot; wrote a press representative in the Ministry of the Interior , Rammus , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years .
The new residence permit for Estonia to settle on a permanent basis can be applied for foreigners who have been living here for at least three years from the previous year .
Its aim is to encourage the sincere saving of the people who have adapted .
However , a residence permit for a long @-@ term resident will require , for example , five years .
The new residence permit has apparently also resulted in a reduction in the old entitlement to reside .
For example , soil was given such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
Now the Ukrainians can exchange their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be able to point the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
This residence permit became popular in the courtyard - the holders of the pitiful passports ( 1029 ) , the Russians ( 487 ) , the Indians ( 54 ) and the Finns ( 36 ) .
In total , 1968 people were granted a residence permit to reside in Estonia , including , for example , 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 Georgians and equally many Chinese .
This year , the total number of applicants is already 12.69 .
In 10 years , Nigeria has become a country with citizens who are among the most active candidates for residence permits in Estonia .
When three residence permits were issued for the Finns in 2007 , the soil was 200 .
From Nigeria , lessons are learned to these universities .
In addition , higher education institutions in Estonia are popular , for example among Georgians , the Chinese and the Turks .
The number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to the search game .
For these too , the rule applies that there is a community @-@ led rule , with more clarity to others , &apos; will add to the Rammus .
In ten years , two people have moved to Estonia , for example from North Korea , as much from Laos and Madagascar .
Ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 from South Korea , 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay .
If around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit per year , this is about 0.46 % of the total population .
Even if you include the citizens of the European Union , the migration will remain around a percentage , &apos; , commended on the Meuse , that the figures are actually small .
In total , according to data offices in Estonia , 14 822 people were able to migrate to Estonia , and 13 792 people were able to come out of it .
This means that immigration has gone beyond emigration for a second year .
The majority of those who move to and move are Estonian citizens , but more are among the exodus .
Therefore , the Estonian citizens &apos; migratory secrecy with 2 000 people was in the red .
The Estonians are particularly going to be divided between Finland and Estonia .
Mammu @-@ long Couture glue glue with sausage , weed and disgust
However , in the wake of the North @-@ West of ideas , there is history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and serrols : &apos; I can dream somewhere for hours in the museum and old thief and admire .
If you are going to find a way , then you will study and learn a little every day about it .
This is a joy of discovery !
The world of Mammu Couture glamorous may seem like some of its faiths , but the designer does not think so .
You yourself decide how much you are in your life !
I have a friend who has full gall full of the battery of the batteries that I have created , the couture brokers .
Because it is not his fault , nor is he living in Hollywood and not on a red horse every day , he also wants to carry on these most beautiful brokers and he will suffer !
You can live yourself in a special way for your life !
The Moeartist does not recognise the divisions between shining events and the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day .
It was this reasoning that led to the plan to move higher grades to the land centres , between forests and fields in Estonia , between people who are often not reached by the fashion .
Mammu ago , the collections were presented on the basis of comparison , JÃµhvi and LT moealleel , for example , where a King Hall , a 45 modelled , carried out a house of the street .
In Tallinn , the supermarket is often imported , a dignified nod is nodding , but there is more emotion elsewhere - the cry is bvo rising , you want to thank you , including .
A large proportion of the audience had to be downloaded , but now they are the fans of Mammu Couture .
If you exceed the expectations of the people , they will be admired !
And I like the feeling that I am with my momomomoisy like the spring of the summer .
In the past , we had a 50 @-@ metre red carpet , full of rubber @-@ stamp across the streets , it seemed they would not end !
Mrs Maria does not recognise the fashionable fact that creation must be presented by a supersupermodel , which she will be happy to bring to the mercy of ordinary women .
I often invite my own customers - they have always come with pleasure .
This is the very cushion experience , the saga of the ashes in the wonderful hole on the theories !
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen what I have been doing , I am always behind the scenes to give the last piece of hope in the wings of a boile .
My nervous would not allow a calm watch from the Chamber .
Mrs moeloomer of this kind , who not only wants to play a representative role , but has to be involved in everything .
I have a soul of my own breadcrumbo , and I myself carry out most of the collections .
I like the whole process in which you have been playing with the details .
I am never far from my own creature and I am not afraid of work .
The issue with the substance is not limited , nor is it the organisation of the purification , logistics , organisation , organisation - everything must reach the day of one temperate woman .
Well , these hours of work are still hugely coming from fanatics .
I cannot say when my day of work will end , but for me , it is simply full of joy .
I have always been very lucky - it is like the incessant happy chain : I am doing something fine , man gets something beauty and , moreover , compliments .
It has been said many times that I have a cookness in my stickers - they make themselves feel like a princely .
The aberrant spectacular quotations that Maria talent made to the book overnight have remained a wake @-@ up call for Mammu Couture .
Martin Myrrrrtupp of U18 boys : The weapon of alagpiturÃ© of the Estonians was turned into our opponent now
I am sorry , I am afraid I am missing .
The first thing that has come out of the woods is that we could not get our songs .
And , if such a difference is in the table , &apos; no action is taken , Estonia commented U18 corvball boxes 61 : 75 dislephors in Britain have played our only corvball role in the Nare , the only one in the UK , the Chalev / Craabitreer Martin Myrrrrrer .
Opponents took the pound of attack from 28 pounds and , as a result , received so many more attacks .
We were also not prepared to protect them aggressively and not to attack them , it was created .
Many attacks by English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build up protection .
However , in defence , they have been able to keep their hands everywhere , we could not combine .
This has led the team to make a clean ride .
The work of the opponent was done better .
The chef estimates that Estonia should have made more tactical errors to remove the momentum of the opponents in the bud .
Last , in the last quarter , we had a zero error , but we had already had a few quick records of opponents .
Instancefulness and intense insistence , which was the beacon of the albind weapon , have now turned against us all .
Today , we had no power against their aggressiveness .
The ymouthest remained satisfied with his lack of care in Kalevi , Matthias Tass .
In general terms , a whole team can be said to be well @-@ worn , so far in a united shock .
It is a pity that this aggressive opponent had not been met before .
The ball has been sound all the time and has played out today , but it seemed to have been tired - he has borne quite a lot of the burden .
But he made some quite nice moves that I have seen in the past in the trenches &apos; , added a mentor .
Terrible numbers : The flat @-@ ball concentration of nefresh fish trees was vished by the EM @-@ turnial with three fewer than 10 exceptions ...
In the U18 age class , not only do they need to ask the Korvpalliturniir in the company of emi B @-@ divisjon , but she started the day before yesterday in Dublin .
And the Estonian game with Poland has unfortunately strained into the area of antirects .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , the figure was 9 : 49 , or only in the last 10 minutes , the opponents took the floor from the gas family , and the period remained at the rate of 16 : 16 .
In both the first and the second quarter , Estonia set out 4 , point 1 , point 1 ...
Then , at the beginning , two bits of the four first iron creatures were caught by the Estonians , and then 25 pieces were knocking down the gamble , then one of the three , then another 21 are to be ignored ...
Perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 creatures were caught out of a single .
In addition , 2 points came from four free @-@ tones .
The loss of many people was a reasonable figure with this time , 12 .
The game was eventually followed by a 35 % ray of visuality in Poland and 13 % in Estonia ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , and on the inaugural day , Portugal had to recognise the 83 : 56 disadvantages .
NATO vessels came to the office to supplement stocks .
Today NATO has arrived for 1 permanent group of landers for the weekend to visit Tallinn to prepare for the stock of ships and for the forthcoming exercises .
During the visit , ships are preparing for naming the sea , giving crews the possibility to take a couple of days &apos; leave .
Following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in the waters of Estonia to carry out a series of exercises and to prepare for future , historic explosives @-@ searching operations .
&quot; The participation of the Estonians in the NATO entity and the co @-@ existence of local waters is a good illustration of our integration into the allied forces , &quot; said Captenore Arto Reinmaa , the chief executive of the overseas military and planning station .
Since 29 June , NATO has been holding a permanent mine steering group in Latvia &apos;s Navy Captain Gvileitnaium Laudups , who has taken over from the Estonian navy officer , Johan @-@ Elias Seljaa , at a ceremony in Riga .
The group &apos;s flagship ship is the LVNS Virsaitis naval support vessel in Latvia , which also operates on a group &apos;s steering period .
This semester includes the credo of the Estonian Navy and the Sakalas .
As one of the four groups of ships subject to the NATO seaside management , NATO is the permanent anti @-@ missile group 1 of primary emergency advisers , which could be sent to different places in the world within five days .
4 @-@ 13 August , the fatigue series of Pirita monastery turns into another place where the Alestro Etat , orchesta Festival , was depicted 13 years ago .
This year &apos;s Birgitta Festival will be awarded the artistic leader of the Charleonia , to Joosti ( 36 ) , a beautiful , powerful and unprecedented venture .
At the risk of the Five : &apos; Gothic &apos; and &apos; Tosca &apos; in the classroom of the World &apos; , balletilalalaus &apos; , &apos; Balselltilaus &apos; , the Bolerost &apos; Castle &apos; Karlssonin &apos; , and neither the program &apos;s own production , this time Joseph Haydni &apos;s magic oritories &apos; , &apos; Aastaajad &apos; , responding by the same international team of Lovels who brought to Piriyni hospital in 2015 , even &apos; creation of the organisation of a pawney works &apos; .
Burma , Festival , has much more than simply concerts and theatre replies .
This is greater than any musical theatres in their normal form .
This is a festival whose snow is gaining ground and will never get off the ground .
Because the experience that the audience can gain in this unjust and mysterious environment is a more vibrant place for human beings and for human beings in a way that cannot be described .
At the risk , you are the first year in which Burma is a splendid art leader .
Did the shoes of the maestro Ek not feel a little like a bit like a bit ?
Of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been a great help .
He went through a whole of my student careers and supported the digists careers at the beginning .
Perhaps this is because I am making it easier for me to carry on with her work .
In Klas , the team of Birgitta Festival has been so heartened by its goodwill and , of course , all of this also spills me over .
It was excellent to join a team who knows how things are going .
It was the great heart of Eri Kese who also gave me the strength to thrive on Burma with the Tallio Filtu Festivald .
And here I am , and I can !
What could be the audience for this year &apos;s festival , what are you offering in particular ?
We have the first balleum to be presented to the performer of the artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and surprise , by the way , to the demonstrations in the first place , written to the speech by Astrid Lindgren .
To this end , &apos; Karlsson will fly &apos; .
And one notorious nuance in this respect is that the author of this balleum is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons , who himself expressed a desire to write on this work .
Apparently , he has already had a carakr in the heart of his child .
At the risk , how are you all fat this ?
Thanks to my life partner , which is my supporter , I am sure .
This work requires a lot of love and support , and I have the greest of it .
And I have noticed that my personal emotion is not as dependent on so many other people as I myself , in other words , how I will go against every new day .
And this is a conscious awareness of the tone , of maintaining a positive spirit and actually smiling on ourselves into the mirror this morning , considerably increased my percentage of happiness .
Especially now , this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen to practise this and it works .
To laugh is to Strip the brain and to raise the tone .
This is not just a fine word .
I think that people do not yet know about the body that they have to offer in the universe , but perhaps everyone is gradually diagnosing it .
Right now , the important moment has come .
Also , is there any ritual before the pulse of dirigendi ?
It is time that clothing must be exchanged against more comfortable people .
This is a small moment for itself .
But generally , yes , I do not have the opportunity to cool up before a great deal of speech or to make a little smile .
In fact , I even like to actively communicate with the people , even before the dirigendidrag is taken .
But come to Burma , and there is also a lot of evidence here to find for the warring friend of the non @-@ particularly great oOC and the ballet !
Watch the scene of the demonstration with the presence of the Risto Joostir !
New results of the assessment of the age of Swedish asylene applicants have been published
In Sweden , ashes were made among asthylene seekers , which evaluated their age @-@ old novel approach in medicine , and the latest results of the test show that more than 80 % of theistic minorities were considered to be older than 18 , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
The Swedish National Institute for medicine ( RÃ¤ttsmedicinalvert ) started with the tests earlier this year .
The tests were set up to improve the accuracy of the age in the application for asthma testing , after the Swedish Authority for Migration ( Migrationsverket ) was criticised for failing to correctly establish the age of several of the admittedly minors .
To date , the Migrationsverket has sent 68 cases to the test , and the Institute for Justice has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) was assessed as 18 or over and another 25 cases were assessed by the Institute for Justice ( CEN ) that the &quot; trial period &quot; could be 18 years old or older .
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that a person was &apos; perhaps younger than 18 &apos; .
The tests will only be used if the age of the person is under question .
According to Joseph GÃ¶ransson , the performance of the Institute for Justice ( PL ) is consistent with those in the past months .
&quot; We do not see any major differences in comparison with the statistics of the past months , and the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; he said to The Local Journal .
The fact that a large proportion of cases were judged to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that applicants for asylum have been misguided by their age .
In May , the institute issued the results of the 581 test and said that in 442 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person being examined is 18 or more &apos; .
However , when the newspaper Svenska Dagdet studied the results of the 581 test , it turned out that in 243 cases , the person had directly claimed that he would be able to receive 18 this year .
This method of evaluating medical age , whereby wisdom is carried out through X @-@ ray of nexgeniimages and MRT from fields , has been used to analyse them in some quarters , and then in some quarters , they are allowed to be used by dentists and radiologists .
One of the sceptics is the endokrinologist of the Karolinska Institute , Claude Marcus , whose tasks include evaluating human biological maturity , in order to find out whether they went through the usual audience in the past or beyond .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the method of measurements that we are using now should be used .
The designation of a biological age in this way is very uncertain .
If we cannot say so strongly , then we should not pretend to have a taste , &apos; he said &apos; to the record &apos; in Metro &apos; .
But , in defence of the accuracy of the tests , Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Institute for Justice : &apos; Generally speaking , the risk of leaving the child inaccurate adulthood is small .
Perhaps the biggest figure at around 10 % is the risk of a person under the age of 18 . &quot;
9 indication that you could have done a more expensive job of forgiving you .
Your day spent a day more expensive and she was carrying a night with another man .
You are on the wrong track because you have so many nice times and so many memories together .
I would like to forgive him , but is this the right time ...
Your Tanggo lists nine indicators indicating that the price of your action is twofold and could be forgiven to her .
The more expensive thing seems to be worth understanding and hard to resolve .
The price is more expensive dealt with a problem that he has led to her being moved to bed by another fellow passenger .
The cost of your own is no longer in a defensive position .
He sincerely regrets and takes on responsibility for his actions .
He is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
He agrees that he has made a serious mistake and that he genuinely is trying to improve the situation .
He is attentive and he is trying to communicate with you in a pleasant way .
However , he is pressing for your haste to get through the matter .
They are not denying what has happened and are trying to make it unnoticed .
You and your cost is more of the understanding why the intransigence with you arose .
You talk about this and about how we will prevent it in the future .
You must better communicate and assess each other &apos;s needs .
The more expensive attitude and actions have helped you to develop your own sympathy with his or her error .
More expensive commitment and behaviour have created the basis for your proximity to recovery .
As a couple , you have made progress in retrusting your unity and your relationship .
The 20 @-@ year @-@ old vasser , Anna Maria Orel , has done a nice discourse on the part of the City of London , with 67.376.a good 18 seats .
The leader was the youngest female champion of MM and a happy woman has confirmed that she hopes to fight for the medals in the future .
The contest was successful and I gained a good deal of experience .
With the first test ( 64.80 ) , I immediately paid out my average performance , the second ( 62.80 ) , I took the risk of being too high , and the third ( 67.37 ) I could almost keep it clear , &quot; said Orel after the contest .
I have been thinking about my emissions , and I am very pleased that I have found them .
Anna Maria Oreli MM has lost her pocket , which has ended in a good 18 @-@ fold period .
Mr Orelio did not blend his way because he is training in the winter at the stage of the LTTE .
&apos;I am afraid , &apos; , he said &apos; with a little muddle &apos; .
At the London Olympic stage , almost a full House had a population , did they not get round the people or was they able to put themselves off ?
I have returned , but in a positive sense .
Everyone says that this will give in - that is true !
If you are competing yourself , then you can experience it .
After all , he confirmed that he would be pleased with the abuse of MSY and that he still has many good competitions : &apos; I came here with the 32nd , the last outcome , of this season , to the end of my 18th .
This is a very good result .
I am 20 years and I am on the other side - that is the only thing that counts .
I will take on board a good deal of experience and , in a few days , I want to compete on behalf of the medals .
The governor of West Virgina announced a party change .
The governor of Western Virginia Democrat , Jim Justice , announced at the gathering of Thursday evening with President Trumpi that he would change the parties .
&apos;Why it or not , the democrats walked out of me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; Today , having been a great deal of hot air and thinking about it ... today , I say to you , the west must , that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor . &quot;
In the Chamber , the outburst were stirring .
&quot; So I will be Republican tomorrow , &quot; in the Annex Justice .
&quot; As a coke , I would say to you that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
The Trump had previously allowed a major announcement to be made at the gathering of West Virginia .
Trump won the west of Virginias on 42 points and Justice did not support the candidate for Democratic Democrats , Hillary Clinton .
The justice case , which is the only one billion banners of the state according to Formal state , was elected in 2016 .
In the Forbes , it states that it has coal mines in five states and that it has coal trading in quite its own right .
It has a value of approximately USD 1.59 billion .
At the same time , on Thursday evening , the National Council of Republican People ( RNC ) published an announcement that &apos; the party change of the Governor , Justice , is yet another blow to the democratic family that would prevent the country from getting better , rather than working for it &apos; .
&quot; Just 15 stars and controls on the lowest number of states in history - the Governor , Justice , &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent expression of a parade to tell the parks that is in a hurdle and unable to find a positive and united message , &quot; said Daniel Bronna RNC , Ronna , a leader , in Ronna McBS .
It is hardly surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured people .
In a photovoltaic , Urmet , the Commissioner in the court , said yesterday to a jury that they had to share a lot of posters .
Ferls and marches are fundamental , omission and slight failures .
Of course , too , the statements in the past , in the past and in the past .
According to Urmeti , visitors will come out to the festival with false footsteps , and so the problems will come .
The media have also had to assist a few visitors who are more injured - there have been some scaremongering cases and there has been also one foot in the foot .
We have also made bogs @-@ and @-@ walk when someone has gone out of their hand or when we have broken the finger .
We are doing the minor things here , and we are sending to hospital more .
Watch videos whether the solemn media will also be asked for a painkiller to treat pophifty .
Coe praised the honest apologies of the Russians for the scandal of doping
The international blacker , Sebastian Coe , was praised by him for &apos; Russia &apos;s &apos; Fair excuse &apos; for the Doping scandal , but repeated that this is not the time to allow sport back .
In the wake of the Russian athletes &apos; Dmitry Shylakhtin , the IAAF Congress , which had previously held the athletes &apos; World Cup , said that the order of conduct imposed on his country was right and had a clear objective of combating doping .
He has apologised to &apos; all the frivolous people who are stranded at the matches in the golden and silver medals &apos; .
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban on the contest , which was introduced in November 2015 , following the report of the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) , which found evidence of state @-@ sponsored doping in Russia .
&quot; I believe that today was a very fair response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said the President of the IAEA to the press in Coe .
&quot; The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that Russia itself admitted that they had had had had quite difficult times and that they would do everything possible to reorganise the UU . &quot;
In addition , Coe said that it was pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own forecasting .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and that progress is being made , but the Congress supports the proposal from the working group that this is not the time for Russia to resign , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; We must do everything we can in the next few months to bring about normalisation of the situation .
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate honest sportsmen from the system , &apos; he added .
Ninteen Russian frivolous staffs meeting the strict criteria of IAAF will compete as neutral sportsmen and women in the World Cup matches to be launched in London on Friday .
The head of the IAAF working group , Rune Andersson , said on Monday that Russia is not yet meeting a number of criteria for reinstatement .
Following a presentation by the IAAF Council , he told the press in London that doping controls were still insufficient and that the training officers who have banned were still operating freely .
The electric car revolution is making a significant difference to the demand for honey .
Who are the winners and the losers ?
Not least because the revolution in electric cars will make a significant difference from the fuel market to the infrastructure , it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market .
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that they can win from one place and lose the other , this will not help the smaller mining companies .
Today , Glencore is being served by coal and oil , but in the era of electric cars , cobalt , lithium , copper , aluminium and nicity demand will increase .
This year , in the area of the spread of electric cars , contributions have been made by the governments of the United Kingdom , France and Norway , which will in the coming decades allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned .
This is why Volvo has already knew that it is intended to abandon the combustion engine and that Tesla will bring a cheaper 3 electric car on the market .
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates , over two decades , electric cars will be sold more than cars used for oil @-@ generated fuels .
&quot; For some metals this will change everything , &quot; the capital economics stocktaking exercise of raw materials was said to Simona Gambranini Bloomberg .
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as code and the lithium , which has increased demand for years .
In the electric cars there are about three times more than in the normal car , Glencore has announced .
Even more is needed at charging stations , which is why Exane BNP Paris estimates that this will increase demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
The increase in demand for batteries in electric cars will mean additional demand for lithium , cobalt , graphite and manganese .
Glencore will be able to raise the income from the growing trend in electric cars from the price hikes and from being the world &apos;s largest cobalt producer , predicting the Jefferies Group .
This broker company estimates that other winners of the victory of electric cars are Freeport @-@ McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals .
The market is reacting to a trend that is already changing .
This year , 70 % of the surface of the EU &apos;s metal code in London has gone .
The increase in the bubble was 37 % .
The wheat has also risen to 14 % this year , mainly because of economic growth .
As a shareholder of Glencore , London increased 20 % , exceeding the price increase for rival Rio Tto Group , BHP Billiton and Anglo American .
On the side of the bosses , there are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine , which have to adapt to the new era .
The main end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ day use of the phone is the supply of the batteries of cars with a petrol and diesel engine .
Electric cars use sclerops .
&quot; This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said the Bank of America Merrill Lynchi , the analytical leader of the market , Michael Widmer .
The price shift has not yet shown the effect of the drifting trend .
Cotton has risen by 17 % this year , with prices rising in London for the main industrial metals being the best metre .
Investors can only see the problems on metals in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure that is so bad for lead because it is low @-@ cost oil that keeps the normal cars on the market &quot; said Herwig Schmidt , the vendor Triland Metals ,
If demand falls , then it will slow .
This can be the case in around ten years .
In the meantime , stricter emission standards will mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which are more frequent in the process of setting up engines based on lead @-@ based batteries , will be assessed by the international lead and the Kuwait research organisation .
Lighten metals like aluminium substitute steel , as a simpler car can drive further away with less electricity .
This can explain as early as 2013 @-@ 2016 an additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes .
This represents 2.7 % of the world production of aluminium .
This trend is likely to intensify , Mr Widmer said .
The Aluminium has risen by 13 % this year , as the growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a shortage in the market .
The steel industry is not .
The holding of the ak Sby will work with General Motors to use nanotechnologies to produce miracles .
Also , ArcelorMittal and the Europe Strob are trying to develop a lighter meltdown in order to withstand the minimum .
&quot; A very strong message should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Exane BNP Paribasi analyst Sylvain Brunet .
We in Europe can see some progress .
The end of the oil era may also bring to an end the suffering plague .
The cost of soil was about half of this lump diesel engine for cars , as catalysts for the memosaica , Johnson Matthey were .
&quot; Many of the raw materials that are now so high @-@ demand , such as oil and platinum , may not have any great demand in the future , &quot; said the Natixise raw materials analysts Bernard Dahdah .
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important , but will change in importance in the course of 15 years .
The Plainatinatinatymakers believe in continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars .
The leader of Uncore , Marc Grynberg , said that in 2025 more hybrid cars would continue to be sold in a breath of light cars .
The great hope of the Plainatinatinatnes manufacturers in the 10 @-@ year perspective is that of cars based on a hydrogen element developed by Toyota Motori and Hyundai Motosis , which are dependent on posturing to produce a hydrogen @-@ based electricity .
However , so far , this technology has not yet proved commercial .
&quot; On the road to the electric car , a clear loophole seems to be there , &quot; said Exane BNP Paribasi from Brbaset .
The German car manufacturers were also hit very hard in July , as the Stuttgart Court prohibited the use of diesel in the city of Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche .
How the financial rules of football affect the transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the excesses of European football clubs do not prevent the record transfer of the Neyge World football clubs from the Spanish club of Paris @-@ Saint Germain in Barcelona .
Any consequences from UEFA , the governing body that dominates the European game and which has the power to prevent teams from taking part in the turnival of the Group of Meisters ( MEAs ) , are expected to wait until after Paris Saint @-@ GerMay .
The Financial Rules for the fair play of UEFA in 2011 ( FFFFFFP ) mean that the PSG must at some point prove that the takeover was funded without massive losses .
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona ( USD 262 million ) for the sole purpose of buying an Austrian who would be out of his contract , and the wages of Neymark would reach tens of tens of millions of dollars per year .
There are some financial aspects of the integration of the Neymar into the French club .
PSG will undoubtedly be able to pay the Neymark and to put its staple rice on the table such as this money , given that the team is funded by the family in the cell of Qatar .
Clumb is allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players , but they must balance it with the legal sources of income that will enable them to come out with them in a football business .
FFP was set up by Michel Platini , after he was elected as President of UEFA in 2007 .
This former French player believed that the clubs that would be successful in finding a way into massive debt would actually be doing the wrong thing to defraud and risk ruin if banks or owners had to give up support .
From 2011 onwards , FP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of being a sports debt .
This amendment means that the model of business used by Roman Abramovich first in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then to make a major contribution to improving the team and creating a global brand - will be harder to implement .
During the current three @-@ year evaluation period of FFFP , which runs until 2018 , clubs can bear the costs of up to EUR 30 million .
And despite the disrepute of the presidential office of Platini in 2015 , his successor to UEFA , Alexander ander Ceferin , remains committed to preventing excessive waste .
&quot; FFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to reinforce these rules further , &quot; said The associated PC Andrea Traverso , the chief of the UEFA @-@ FP Quartet .
Although , in return for the overpurchase clause for the EEA , they can allocate this amount to a single payment , for the purpose of accounting , they can allocate it to the full extent of the duration of the agreement .
Mr Neymar has signed a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it will be possible to show the transitional charge in the next five years as a sum of EUR 44.4 million .
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , the PSG , together with Manchester Cityi in Abu Dhabi , received the most severe sanctions .
The PS was fined â‚¬ 60 million ( at this moment at a rate of $ 82 million ) , which was subsequently reduced to â‚¬ 20 million , and was required to limit the team of Meicians during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season to 21 players instead of business as usual 25 .
UEFA is seeking clubs that can try to rock over the regulatory institutions by extricating their income through companies connected to the owners of the club .
While the Qatar company may sponsor the PSG , if the value of sponsorship is deemed to be above standard market rates , UEFA would not accept this as an official income .
This was the case in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of the PS support for the Qatar Tourism Authority was stuned .
It has been said that a certain proportion of the Neymar &apos;s PSG services could come from Kainfrastructure through payments by the World Cup Board of 20 May .
However , the PSG and Katar 2022 deny that Neyra could become a world championship and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulators could easily reveal such an manoeuvre .
The penalties imposed on the PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules .
People familiar with the situation on Thursday said that UEFA had not discussed the transition from the PSG to Neymark proactively .
They have stated with The &apos; The City Guard &apos; , provided that their anonymity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PSG .
Reports published recently show that , during the 2015 @-@ 2016 season , more than â‚¬ 10 million in profits for the total amount of around â‚¬ 542.4 million .
The data from the last financial year have not yet been published .
The PSG hopes that the arrival of Neymark will have a positive effect on sponsorship transactions , on trade in goods and on sales of snus .
The shield is looking forward to an increase of at least 30 % in the order of business as regards the conclusion of the agreement .
Too , as Spain is clearly annoyed about leaving one of the largest football stars , it tried to prevent the transition , claiming that the PSG is in breach of FP .
&apos;This is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with the club and with the State , &apos; said President Javier Tebas , Spain &apos;s newspaper , with the exception of Kaent .
Arpol Wrian , a remitnederous , a lawyer whose club belongs to the American sporting magnet , shares the attitude of La with the latter that the state is financing the club .
&quot; This is the result of ownership and has completely changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger on Thursday .
&quot; If the club forms part of the country , then everything is possible .
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the country can have other ways or interests to represent such a major player . &quot;
The Norwegian low @-@ cost airline has a nice tradition of putting on board the pictures of those who have moved borders in the more oiling area and have been inspired by others , and they are writing tripp.ee
Along with the expansion of the scope of the Registry of CECAF , the circle of people who have served on the aircraft facilities has also expanded .
Among the selected personal areas is , for example , Benjamin Franklin , Greta Garbo ( pill ) and Miguel de Cervantes .
In the short term , however , one plane will be trialled by the Queen legendarson Freddie Mercury marathon .
Fifty years ago today : The gloomy storm of the hurricane in Estonia , which was foolish in roofs and windows .
The hurricane , which was mentioned as a stormy for the century , which was raging on 6 and 7 August , resulted in major damage , particularly to the West , the Carthedonian and the Rapid countries .
In the north @-@ west Estonia , over 30 m / s was at the wind during these days .
In my old medal , a single @-@ seat in the garden was running from the beach to the other side and it was a fuss to support them .
Everything was blind and sophisticated , as was the world lesson .
The beneficiary had already been flying from houses , and in 2002 , an old woman , Linda Kurova , reminded the magazine in an interview with Estonian Nature .
The wife of Linda saw how the tree he was sitting in .
What , though , are you going to be able to give a hand of support in which you are suffering such storms ?
The sea came under the window , from windows in glasses , &apos; she spoke about the Hellas , Mrs Linda , who lived on the streets of Haapsalus Kalda .
The fact that roads were full of trees and the roof of of the railway station had flown 20 @-@ 30 metres away was only next morning .
Local people said that behind the Paralepa there was a barge of hope , some were a little bit too long , some hanging .
Everyone saw the very frustrating , the storm went through a ragish and pragmatic circle from beautiful old to proud trees like a war .
Western Virumaa did not suffer particularly badly in the 1960s compared with Western Estonia in August , but the damage was still severe there , as Virumaa Official Journal wrote in 2007 .
The Dear Park and the Padise Park were painted in a painsby fashion , but our paratus parks too were severely damaged .
In Tallinn , the wind was measured at 35 metres per second , that is to say , 130 km per hour .
On the evening of August , on MerivÃ¤ljal , a small series of crings of lead had said : &quot; Mother , mother !
&apos;Canes are in the air and no longer can be signed ! &apos; , Virumaa ReJournal wrote .
The concept of the Building in the land of Viljandiary was so decidedly destroyed during the storm that it was decided to be dismantled afterwards .
The Autori was not opposed by the designs of the ski hire of Tyr , which was not subsequently restored .
On 12 August 1962 the newspaper , Punane TÃ¤ht , wrote that the cleaning up of towns and settlements from depressed trees and their oxygen would slow , and that the population would be free to make a correction to the repair work .
What also hit fertility crops hard , and the newspaper announced that &apos; party organisations must be an incentive for both maintenance and fertility stations &apos; .
One can talk about cyanides if the average speed at wind is over 32.7 m / s .
The situation at the nerve of Estonia will last from 2 November 1969 , when the Ruhnul measured at the wind speed of the wind at the rate of 48 m / s .
The only story in the island was broken by a measure , so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be recorded precisely .
Secret of bowy beaches : Night @-@ to @-@ site work and poor coastal face
The guerrillas of summer will also mean less duplication in the cannon areas of Tallinn .
&apos;If there are , people are on the coast , and if not , there are no people , &apos; , the beer is trurer of the beach .
The candom beach in the area of Stroom in Northern Tallinn .
They are offered a seamless drift by a wielding ripe of satuouting , which is plundering the plate .
In fact , the last one is going through a seven @-@ metre period in the sand , pulling out of it a sea bag and leaving a cross left by the people : Bottomless sands , cigarette consoles and so on .
People are still coming on the coast , whether or not the water is sober .
If it is nice , then people are on the coast , and if not , there are no people , &quot; says Alexandr Usov , the head of the administration of the Private Company , the head of the Corps .
There is a bitter duplication at 6.30 p.m. and there is a hole in the beach , because at 8 o &apos;clock , the record must be in order .
The new job is already at four o &apos;clock .
In addition to Stroom , he is still keeping a close eye on the beach of Pirita , Harku Lake , KakumÃ¤e and Paljasais Pikakr .
The amounts of waste have fallen .
Years ago , there were many more of this .
People can now already assess what is being done for them , &apos; the Usov who has harvested the boat for 15 years is telling us .
Before it was that , when something new came to a standstill , it was already over the next day .
Now , what is in the position is kept on the coast .
Price of a clean bearer
One of the greatest entries on the Estonian beaches is the clean @-@ up of a seabed , or an adru .
For example , in the Pirita coast , it must be transported 400 000 tonnes of coastline time .
&apos;This is an incredible amount &apos; , &apos; notes the Usova .
The second big category is that of municipal litter , or all that people leave .
One @-@ and @-@ a @-@ a @-@ half kilometre at the coast of Stroom eight major waste bent seiners , which need to be disposed of three times a week .
So much is generated by waste .
However , the cold weather of summer has meant that waste is five times less than it was .
The third type forms part of the abandoned business .
These are mostly bulk products .
As a result , the wave of ten highs out of the sand has grappled the sludge .
These holders will wait for the timber route leading to the beach .
&quot; Normally , they will come out more , but it is normal to catch , &quot; and it is already a discovery that they will soon find them again in the sand .
Children are coming on to shores and taking toys to get them in the sand again .
The landfill is being spread
The representative of hospital administrative services Erika Scholler concedes that the driving activity of the tractor is disrupted by local authorities .
Noise , which runs from night to night to time , is interrupted by the intractured breeding of those living in the vicinity .
However , on a day , this work is impossible .
One month , the rock has to be driven twice .
&apos;If we do not , the city section will fine us &apos; , Mr Scholler will note .
However , like Pirita , Pikr and Persia , the aim is to get Stroomi rand below the international sinimong quality mark .
&quot; There is much more work in Estonia to keep the beaches &apos; , says Scholler .
We have more anatheses and more difficulty in talking about sand .
What is more , there is less rubbish on our beaches than there is in Europe .
When I hear that there is talk of waste in the floor , Martin , who lives near Stroom &apos;s beach , is suddenly playing around with a journalist and a team of corroborating staff , highlighting the current bottlenecks .
Hommimint is a sight everywhere in the gallery .
The problem is with birds and pumps who have pulled rubbish bags in the bath , &quot;
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change the behaviour they have hitherto pursued , Martin hopes that the city &apos;s government will take action with the breaders and , for example , will impose on them a carve to stop at least birds from afoot .
However , in general , Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroomi &apos;s rank .
We can see that the city is taking care of this .
With the roads that are nurtured , lit and fresh asphorised , it has become more pleasant .
It was never the case that only one way was to go on on the subject &apos; , Mr Martin notes .
Aardemic findings in Stroomis : Coins , only coins
A period of measurements of morning has had to be used by a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Dimitr who , as a proxy fuel , hampers a metal @-@ type reactor along the coastline .
He does not believe that he will find anything in the price , today or in the future .
Marine gasoly is not enough to be generous enough to this .
&quot; I have been working on this year and have not found anything of value so far , &quot; says Dmitry .
As a campus , there are some euro coins , bottles and also hazardous pounds in the Dmitry Tandy Trapping , which will subsequently dump in the breadth .
Normally , there are still coins .
&apos;They , finger and so on are normally not the same thing &apos; , &apos; says &apos; .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level as weak growth and the easing of inflation have cushioned speculation in relation to the rise .
Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish , since the tight incomes of households have set their interest rates on hold .
The decision @-@ makers of the Bank &apos;s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) have voted in favour of keeping the rate at 6.25 % below the rate of 0.25 % , and fewer members will require an increase this month , as slow growth has weakened support for the upturn .
In its quarterly report on inflation , the Bank has cut the growth forecast for 2017 from 1.7 % and 2018 to its 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on households &apos; incomes would remain , as in the autumn , inflation is expected to rise to 3 % .
However , the bank also signalled that the increase in rates is necessary to contain inflation from Brex over the next few years and that financial markets could be the necessary rise in the expected cost of borrowing .
Members also voted a year ago in favour of partially reintegrating the mammoth package that was introduced as a result of the Brext economy .
The bank will close its fixed @-@ term financing scheme in February , which will provide cheap funding to banks , although it said that it is now expected to offer an increase of GBP 15 billion , which is GBP 115 billion .
In the minutes of the decision on the rate , the bank says , &apos; In the MC central forecast gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain powerless in the near future , as the difficult situation in real income in households will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
On the subject of rates , it was repeated that in order to mitigate inflation , &apos; some effort is needed in fiscal policy &apos; , and this &apos; somewhat higher &apos; , if the markets are expected .
The BÃ¶ge margin is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second in the year 2020 .
However , the Bank stressed that any leap would be gradual and limited .
The bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this purpose and for next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
The forecast of 1.8 % growth in 2018 remained .
After this news , the pound fell the course against the dollar and the euro .
Women have fallen by 0.5 % to USD 1.31 and by 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .
The decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have spurred on increasing hopes of an increase in GDP in the second quarter of last three months , from 0.2 % to 0.3 % .
The bank says that the growth is likely to stay at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year , this will start to gain some momentum .
The latest inflation report by the Bank provided little reason to rejoice in rising inflation and the wretched household suffering from an outcry , saying that the situation would go a little further before it could .
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent an income from striking blows in the next few years , but a significant recovery is expected for the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
The plug of the euro also encourages the economy to demand growth in British production , which partly compensates for lower costs for consumers .
The decision comes one year after the rate was reached 0.25 % last August after the shocking EU referendum , which caused a sudden weakening of the pound .
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years to breathe life into the price and the economy in full .
Before the bank &apos;s final decision , there was a growing demand for raising the rate , as inflation had increased the pressure on households in the straits ; in July , three policy @-@ makers were demanding an increase of 0.5 % .
Inflation fell from 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the message from the bank was that it was expected and that there is a return to the rise in the coming months .
The bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was due to a completely weak pound .
The head of Coreco mortgage brokers , Andrew Montlake , said : &apos; In the light of the recent decline in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive again , as lenders are yearning for work and hoping to complete the year &apos;s positive outcome .
The BÃ¶ge dividend seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are about to come to an end , as refinancing , often earning a service and low @-@ rate comparison have become increasingly popular . &quot;
NHS is writing a drug to tackle 10 000 people , a drug that has led to a contradiction
Since September patients have had access to &apos; transformational &apos; HIV treatment following a battle held in court after the United Nations on whether or not the NHS should finance the medicine .
NHS announced that public healthcare would now make an initial three @-@ year clinical trial available to 10,000 people during an estimated 3 @-@ year clinical trial - a tactic ( PrEP ) of pre @-@ exposure to a pre @-@ trial system , which has shown a reduction of approximately 86 % in the risk of infection in cases of high @-@ risk people .
The HS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the Supreme Court supported last year &apos;s decision by the Supreme Court that the NHS is capable of paying for PrEP , despite the authority &apos;s own assertions that it should finance the medicine itself .
The executive director of NHS England , Simon Stevens , welcomed the release of this petition as &apos; major new meddling &apos; on Thursday , while the National AIDS Fund ( NAT ) described it as &apos; turning moments &apos; .
The clinical trials in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpol and Sheffield are among the first to register people , and in October , additional clinics will be added before the programme is introduced throughout England by April 2018 .
The pre @-@ HIV infection ( PrEP ) is a hotline for HIV medicines , which is to be taken up before the mid @-@ term , in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV to the risk of infection amongst people .
The adoption of PrEP before the break means that there are a sufficient number of medicines in the body of the person that prevent HIV infection .
These medicines can be taken on a daily basis or at the latest two hours before the divorce procedure .
Eligible candidates for treatment include men of homosexual or bisexual origin , transgender people and people with partners that are infected with HIV and cannot receive treatment .
The clinical persons will find suitable people willing to participate in a clinical trial , including men , women , transgender people and those who do not receive antiretroviral treatment as a partner with an HIV treatment .
People who live in England and who have elected a family doctor in the UK can also register their wish to participate in a local hospital clinic in the programme .
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed the Treaty in order to obtain medicines this week , following an international procurement procedure .
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of the PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who is destined for the medicine , and how it is consumed and implemented in a big picture .
Stevens said : &apos; This new massive intervention should complement and boost the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV .
This is another milestone in the struggle for more than three decades with one of the greatest health problems in humanity . &quot;
Deborah gold , CEO of NAT , said : &quot; This is a turning point in the fight against HIV .
The PrEP , if targeted correctly at those who need it and are in the risk class , offers an opportunity to transform Britain into an HIV epidemic .
Since September , through this clinical attempt , funded by the NHS , people with high risks of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool which is individually managed and is not dependent on dialogue with the partner , thereby improving many lives .
We warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Executive Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation , said : &apos; Now the priority is to ensure that the clinical trial is quickly pushed through the country and that no section of the HIV @-@ related HIV @-@ related group is excluded .
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected by HIV .
Sharon Hodgson , the Minister of Public Health , said : &apos; The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delay and the permission of the government &apos;s feet .
Evidence shows how much this medicine can bring about in terms of preventing HIV and ending the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
This clinical attempt will take us one step further towards fully understanding the advantages of PrEP .
It is now important that a clinical attempt is taken across the country as soon as possible to protect people with HIV exposure and to take us one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
The price of electricity in Estonia has risen by 12 % , whereas in Latvia and Lithuania it has decreased .
In July , the difference in the price differential between the next day &apos;s stock exchange rate between Latvia and Lithuania fell to 1.94 euros , compared to â‚¬ 7.71 in June this year , was announced in Elering .
The main reason for this difference is the wealth of the association between Lithuania and Sweden .
In Estonia , the average electricity exchange rate last month was EUR 34.33 per megawatt hour , and the price increased by 12 % from June .
In Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by 5 % to 36.27 euros per megatt .
In Finland the price was EUR 34.17 and the Nord half of the electricity exchanges had a cost of the system at the same time as EUR 26.37 per megawatt hour .
The prices rose by 12 % and 7 % respectively .
In the 75 % last month , an electricity between Estonia and Finland moved from the last hours towards Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
The other nine % of hours in the next two days were not transactions between the two countries .
In the course of the period , an electricity between Estonia and Latvia was mobile from 99 % of the time to Latvia to 90 % at the Estonian level , with a total capacity for transmission .
According to transactions on the last trading day in July on the Nasdaq OMX market , the wholesale electricity exchange rate in August could reach approximately â‚¬ 34 and â‚¬ 37 in September from the megawatt hour .
The price of carbon dioxide that would affect electricity production last month went up and transactions were made at a price of between 5.04 and 5.47 â‚¬ per tonne .
Living in higher education - half @-@ hearted designers and clever designers have made it a house for the little Earls Court cork cork
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with passion for a building revaker , replaced her great town of Knightsbridge in 2014 against the Earls Court corti in the City of London .
This is in the first order of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not combined his bags and has sold on to her house is an honour to a new design .
&quot; Before that , I lived together with a former life @-@ co in Kightsbridge on a much larger ground , &quot; said Joanne .
&quot; I had something that would be equal to the price I have offered .
I was shown this by the Earls Court of Justice and it had the same high scores .
I have spent a head on this and made a deal on the same day . &quot;
Since the first visit , this 93 @-@ square metre corps has passed through a full innovation apparatus .
At the beginning , it was a piece of sleeping and complex staple corps : In order to get a sleeping ball , it had to walk through the kitchen ; Joanne wanted to add housing and quasi order to exploit the high levels .
&quot; I wanted to see a lot of light from the top , the big windows .
These were my demands , &apos; he said .
She has nominated the architectural and designer of Erfan Azadi , who operates in the hill , Duck &amp; shed to exploit a home of 3.8 m above the level , and to create a home that is not just a development site , but a place where Joanne can live .
As much as there was enough ground to add two spaces to each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a half @-@ way street in which to stand .
Mr Erfan had to approach the matter in a creative way .
&apos;The structure of the forest is quite complicated , &apos; he explains .
&quot; We had to reorganise the facilities so that they are on the other side without having to sit back .
It was not just about building a platform , but rather about using a steel structure to ensure that the level of ambition of both the upper and the lower world is right . &quot;
This emphasis enabled Erfano to create in the space two rooms with a total ethos with a number of dramatic elements .
The half @-@ way street is open with the light on the other glacier housing in the region under the Retrouus window .
The golden furniture , silver details and the retroboon Serge Serge Mouille light highlight the space for style .
The use of mirrors will play a role in adding theatre , space and lighting .
Both sides of a short corridor have been added to the effect that it would appear to be longer .
In KÃ¶Ã¶g , a ghost with a mirror gives the impression of another window of sowing .
On the move , the reflection will provide a reserving place for all the Rentates and festivities of Joanne .
To housing , the possibility of shutting off vegetables , if not used , will add a more reserved vision .
The gooding kitchen is nothing new .
However , there is a unique fact in this kitchen that it is a grinding shop of art .
&quot; It has gone a bit to design , &quot; explains the story of MDF , which was spoiled by the actionist cement of Erfan .
&quot; This is a counterweight , which is why it is very simple to put it in motion . &quot;
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage , Joanne now has an additional 16 square metres , an additional sleeping and a better flat plan .
&quot; After all , it is the bereate that you sell - or that which gives value to property - &apos; says Erfan .
&apos;A farmfland is taking on an historic form of whim and making calculations based on a surface area of underground land &apos; .
Here , they have been able to increase the access to underground space , using high @-@ quality materials which add luxury to the space .
&quot; The materials are what you touched and thus help to create an emotional bond with your home , &quot; says Erfan .
&apos;You are not wearing the electricity cable in the pig .
This is important , but it is not a question of language @-@ ringing . &quot;
This shows that a good design and an increased area will help to make something quite amazing from the normal corps .
In fact , they may even be a desire not to leave , as happened to Joanne .
The main figure , Jensen , is the main beacon operating in the Hicago cloud , which is competing with her colleague for a job .
It is not worth considering the amount of money that is earned , but instead , it is a question of ethics that is forgotten .
The man only sees his wife and three children as a mere early @-@ day and late door .
In the first part of the film , one feels betrayed by the idea that it is the version of the business world of the &apos; Kaardihouse &apos; - even in Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler &apos;s address are similar .
The further proof of the film , the less acric element will remain , and the moralising intention of the film @-@ makers will increasingly appear .
Life @-@ changing experience will mean a cancer for the main peasant , the baby .
Now we must choose between work and family life .
The poet who is dreaming by the Architect profession makes fathers think in the major buildings of Chicago about what really is important things , such as religion , charity , love ... without even affecting the twin sectors .
After the third stole where a son opens a visible eye , it seems to feel that film @-@ makers have certainly been able to meet the target audience , because even the most basic spectator of his heart cannot hold back the tears while seeing the suffering of a pile @-@ sick army of malicians .
If the son falls into the home and his situation seems to be very hopeless , he will ultimately understand the moral morality of his work and will do his job to an elderly man who is seeking a charity .
Now I am putting a strata on my own - if a film has a happy film , then I rewarding my discernment after the film coffee , if I am wrong , then at least one surprise can be praised for at least one .
For a moment , there is a suspicion that the icon will be removed from the place - when the spouse calls a sick person and the man is rushing through the corridor hall in slow motion .
The baby has instead been breathed in a wonderful way , and although his father has just lost his job , it is also proving to be positive , because now , after all , there is time to deal with the family .
I , too , feel well - I can predict quite well the end of the American drama !
In fact , the film is well designed , and all the elements are there .
One can resign , can laugh , the actors are good and the morale : The money is not the most important thing in life .
The bitter phrase brings this film well into circulation .
The new staff chief of the Truk intends to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
Others have tried and failed .
Perhaps Mr Kelly will actually manage this .
In this case , he would be the first .
Mr Politico writes that the new top of the staff of the White House intends to limit the flow of information that President Trumpin is reaching , including news , in the hope that it will keep the upper hand in a more balanced balance .
Here the trial is from Josh Dawseyi :
&quot; When the new chief of staff for the White House , John F. Kelly , met senior officials on his first day of work , he brought forward a key problem with President Donald Trumpi White in the UK , which he intends to resolve the delivery of poor information in the Maldives to the presidential powers .
Mr Kelly said to the officials that information must go through him , whether on paper or in meetings , because the President would do better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried to do so too , and they have failed to track the horse riding on the media .
President Trumpi &apos;s relationship with television dates decades behind and , even now that he is in the White House , his television television television broadcasts have not gone anywhere .
&quot; When the candidate was annoyed for the unfair media coverage , he was also proved guilty of being reported in the prestigious exts he was influenced , &quot; the former campaigner , Sam Nunberg , said to Politius .
The Good Flamer wrote at the time that &apos; six former campaigners said that the key to driving behaviour on the Trumpi Twitter is to ensure that his personal media consumption also has a stable praise . &apos;
Well , it is .
However , the idea that the habits of using the Trumpi Twitter have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is a nonsense .
Perhaps those campaigners will know something that the rest of us do not know otherwise that the Shakes of Trup would have been even more heartening without their intervention .
We probably never know about the figures that were not sent by Trump .
If he could rescue him a couple of times from the shakes , their efforts were worth doing this .
But no one has been able to prevent Opel Trup from creating polemics consistently .
Part of the problem is that in the White House , which makes up competing clicks , people are trying to promote their own interests , without exception , by sending materials to the Truw , supporting their world view but always not trusting .
Politico , the whole story story , wrote in May , from the tendency of advisers to the President to feed , information of strategic value .
One of the examples of the report , Mrs Goldmacher , is that :
&quot; Today &apos;s and former Trup are telling us that Trump can react to a negative press , particularly to information images with detrimental effects , by exploding , by taking a root idea of identifying their source .
This was the case at the end of February , when someone was lucky enough to give the President a copy of the Internet provocative , Charles C. The website in Gots.Newcom , which is in his hands , was published on the site , which blamed the deputising for the staff chief of the staff , Mrs KaWalshi , for being the White House &apos; a source of a series of information leaflets &apos; .
It is no difference that , because of the mocking , Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter or has not provided any concrete evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and has withdrawn them .
In the Trump , you read an article and asked the House about Walsh . &quot;
Goldmacher added that the top personnel officer at that time , Reince Priebus , and the head of the White House &apos;s office Rob Porter , &quot; has &quot; tried to establish a system for managing and documentation documents that are ending up in Trumpin . &quot;
How did this succeed ?
Mr Kelly is attempting to do exactly the same three months later .
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than his Priber , but Trump will remain impulsive and will continue to compete for the sake of his influence .
These irresistible factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .
Street musicians who have come from abroad will not be allowed to go on receiving a licence to speak .
In the centre of Tallinn , there is a lot of foreign muscle .
Those with whom the speaker spoke have admitted that he was playing in the old town without the permission of the city .
The first was found at the gates of Viru , in close proximity to the streets , three people who had taken the same breadth of their homes .
It was clear that musicians with rubbish and chopping @-@ gun clothing were in absentia , and were the ones who had to take one duke off the March .
Despite being so , the only woman in the Chamber in the Lady was playing a laissez @-@ faire story , while one man , alongside her , was playing a gesture of mercy with three faces in the Congress and pulled the furthest .
The third man had stood in his house and smoking the dirty @-@ prepared agricultural cheese himself in his heart .
These three chambers did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people that passed .
The Bob , who had been coherating the Acordion &apos;s Noemi and the Pallionate , said that he was kissing on the streets for fun and money .
The purpose of the exhibition was to collect the ticket price at the same day in the evening of Finland .
In the case of whether they were calling from the towns for muscle in old areas , Noemi and Bob were shaking their heads .
Firstly , we did not know .
Secondly , we will never be in one town for more than a day or a few days , and most of the time , we will have permits granted for a month or something like that .
There is no point in paying for this , &quot; This is what Boeing is telling us .
When we went back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women were standing by the musicians and are doing so .
The team of replies to the score of the Viru centre with copies and bags in absentia .
On the Viru streets , too , three young men from Poland were present , one playing the fence , another went on display and the third was actually passed on to the electronic glass blood .
&quot; We are here to entertain people &apos;s displeasure to spread music and joy and to make money available for fuel and living , &quot; wrote the trio from the Mivosh .
According to Mrs Mivoshi , they are aware that there must be permission from the city government to be present .
&apos;We do not have this &apos; , of course , he said by joking .
But we hope that , if people enjoy our muscles , there is no problem .
Of course , if the police comes , then we will go elsewhere , but we must try &apos; .
The Estonian bank purchased bonds for a public programme of central banks in the euro area in July at EUR 149 million , with the central bank having a total increase of EUR 4.36 billion .
The Central Bank will not publish more detailed information on purchases .
The President of the Estonian bank , Hardo Hansson , has previously explained in response to the question of the members of the national authorities , that the plan for the repurchase of central banks in the Eurosystem includes three different purchasing programmes : Covered bonds in the financial sector ( covered bonds ) , bonds backed by property ( ABS ) and public bonds ( PSD ) .
The Central Bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage the reseller who sold bonds to invest elsewhere .
The impact of the purchase is driven by lower @-@ risk assets generating wealth , and this will motivate investors to take on greater risks .
Normally , in the framework of the public debt programme , each central bank buys its own sovereign debt , while other countries &apos; bonds are not purchased .
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is making so @-@ called &quot; caking &quot; within the scope of the allocated capacity .
The central banks also have to shop in the countries where the bond provision in the purchase scheme is limited .
The Estonian bank , confirmed by the Hansson , is generally buying bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the EIB bonds .
The Estonian bank will purchase bonds under its early purchase programme from March 2015 .
In the meantime , bonds were also obtained in Elering , but in June 2016 the Estonian bank would no longer buy bonds in the Elering .
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area , both the Central Bank of Finland purchase the bonds of Estonia at Elettering and Estonia .
Migrants ignore the ditch and come back to &apos; the entity of millions &apos;
Some of the wealthiest owners of the West Midlands have once again been caught in the raft of confrontation with the determined hard @-@ line actors who have ignored the campus tasked the councillors to win back the bag from their breaders .
Migrants have booked their 20 trailers on the path to a prosperous &quot; line &quot; along the path of millions of businesses &quot; on the streets of Solihull .
They have returned , together with the woodland of horses , children and trucks , after they were pulled out of the wretched only in May , without being distracted from the cracy that was dubbed to prevent their intervention by the Council .
The only group found a weak position in the protective limits , turning its own vehicles into a non @-@ deterred part of what was left to be a football .
The people of furious guys have been contacted by the Solihull councillor , saying that the councillor is &apos; useless &apos; in tackling the problem .
A anonymous resident said : &apos; They moved there on Monday evening after their withdrawal from Bentley Heath , where they were stoned by furnitors of the past .
The Council must be ashamed to take action , because it is useless to deal with the problem .
The migrants were there in May , they were pushed to go and now they are back .
They came on board last night , probably more . &quot;
He added : &apos; Birmingham councillors know how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect their parks .
I live on the path of Streetsbrook and I am not happy to see that I must continue to have the power to pay the total levy if the Council is not even able to prevent such a thing . &quot;
A local resident who also wanted to stay anonymous , said : &apos; This is a ridiculous thing ; we have only seen the last of these novels left and a new offensive is already under way .
This time , the number has increased and even in the grassland , the horse is seen in ruins . &quot;
The representative of the Solihull Council said : &apos; We are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the land close to the streetsbrook and we are working with the police in Solihull ; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
The gathering of evidence will be of great help if as many local residents as possible report any kind of antisocial or criminal behaviour on the police , calling the figure of 101 .
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
The Weekend festival will be visited by , among others , the Minister for Culture Indrek Saar , who is pleased that he has been able to bring true world excellence .
The question as to why Weekend is so important to the protagonists at the Festival is answered by Saar that it should be asked from all those who are enjoying the prize in full three days &apos; time .
He does , however , recognise that in the Gulf , real players in his area have arrived .
&quot; Looking at the level of artists that has been able to be brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music jargon are brought home - often not in our body &apos; , the Minister of Culture speaks .
Which festival will the artists present at the Festival , however , speak up most ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person and for old people of a faith , I think , for one of the most experienced doctors , Armin van Buuren , who stood up last night .
His record has shown that all of us have , at some point , been beating ourselves on our own feet . &apos;
However , he also highlights a number of other names , such as Chainsmokers , Deadmau5 , the Caringuaguato .
Of course , our own Estonian players too : Starting with the NOBelder , and they can be read by a whole series .
In reality , this concentration of names , known as , is very high . &apos; Says , &apos;

The car industry will renew up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the midst of criticism levelled on car manufacturers
The day before the Auti announcement , BMW said that it would offer a software app for more than 350 000 vehicles .
According to the Chairman of BMW , companies believe that &apos; there are wiser options than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the city of BMW , Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions of diesel engines .
No company described these operations as being the subject of a refund .
European car manufacturers have been actively promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations that have been introduced on CO2 emissions .
However , nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and could cause asthma .
At the same time , the cost of equipment to neutralise emissions of diesel vehicles is increasing for the automotive industry , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
While German carmakers are under thorough investigation , the Federal Chancellor , Angela Merkel , is also accused of harshing out powerful automobile manufacturers and of ignoring the signs pointing to the problem .
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen , who was silent about the use of so @-@ called haemorrhar devices , which made it possible to adapt emissions @-@ bearing cars to the regulations when testing a car , but which were recalled in normal driving conditions .
Several of the heads of Volkswagen have been charged with the United States of America and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
Last month , a former head of the thermodynamic in the Audi motor Development Division was arrested in Germany .
The former President , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and can be prosecuted in the United States .
At the beginning of this year , Audi was placed in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany , when the authorities accused the introduction of an Audit System to circumvent the European emissions footprint requirements , thereby extending the investigation , which had previously been concentrated in the United States .
The inclusion of the Audi in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen by the enterprise Garlia in luxury cars disproportionately generates a large proportion of the profits of Volkswagen .
Estonian schools will receive a fee of â‚¬ 20 000 for the purposes of the European Union .
The Ministry of Education intends to buy Estonian schools on the EU flags for the purpose of removing the Presidency by 1 September .
Taken together , the total figure will be 105x158 sentimetres of the European Union &apos;s 570 educational institutions .
The flags are intended to exponder in indoor spaces , and they must be carried out in the home rooms of high quality printed techniques with an attestation , and the ERR &apos;s news portal will be facilitated .
On the flag &apos;s label , the text reads : &apos; Kingitus has been able to indicate to Estonian schools the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
The supposed cost of the 570 flags is EUR 20 000 in the price of the Ministry of Education , or a tie costs EUR 35 .
The journalist &apos;s murder highlights the growing danger in Mexico .
Weekly newspaper Riodoce workers normally gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of SSinaloa , sown by organised crime , corrupt officials and incessant drug wars .
But today , under the guise of a personal tragedy , they have gathered to discuss their own security .
They are told that it is important to change their haste .
Two old writers are discussing which seem safer : Whether to bring children into an office that was the target target for a personal attack in 2009 , or leave them at home .
Security experts have written three words to the top of the agenda in the space : &apos; Enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
They ask reporters to provide evidence of &apos; tolerance &apos; in every piece of water , and they need to provide evidence , only impressions and insights .
The underperformance of the government or cartels is suspected of being the subject of drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists , as a whole , of being a papherer who is hazardous to reporting the chaos in Mexico .
There are no spurrs of violence , and the more the bodies over the country accumulate , the majority of them are reported by journalists as being by the Committee for the Protection of journalists , since the inauguration of President Enrique Pena 1980s , in at least 25 . 589 journalists have been killed in a state governed by public protection following attacks and threats , and so far in the course of this year , at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states .
The latest casualties include their editor and source of inspiration , Javier Valdez Carden , co @-@ founder of Riodoce .
&quot; The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist , &quot; Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence .
His absence is a deep feeling , even though his presence can be felt anywhere in the wake of the Salafranca prayer , a big picture of the average figure of our finger , from Valdez , with a headline sentence &apos; Justice &apos; and two 30ken reporter , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , bears a T @-@ shirt with a portrayal face or a characteristic image of a Lebanese limorous pool .
The meeting will take place less than two months after the death of her ; Reporters will discuss a common trauma , their nightmare , their dreams , their oblivion , their paranoia .
Although in 2010 , a separate Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Defence of the judiciary , only two cases have been taken to account by the judiciary .
As with most of the annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime , the number of murders in thousands , the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
The editorial of Riodoce will continue to reflect the violence in Sinaloa , even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
Without data on murderers and without justice , the meeting on security , as Ibarra said , will not be of much use .
&quot; It is very good to waste our time in this meeting , &quot; he says .
&quot; As long as the reason is not known , you will distrust everyone . &quot;
Valdez left the office of Riodoce in Culiacan , in the capital state of the State of Lahti , on the morning of 15 May .
He managed to drive a few quarters just before two men suspended the red Toyota Corolla ; he was forced to leave a car and was shot 12 times , which is presumed to be the name of a newspaper , which means , in translation , the &apos; twelve @-@ th river &apos; .
An armed man drove into Valdez &apos;s car and made an accident in the vicinity .
Valdez was the age of 50 years .
He left a woman and two adults .
The images are circulating freely in Culiacan .
However , there is essentially only a silence on the Valdez issue .
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of the United States in January , the Blue authorisation has been one of the most bloody battles in the country , because rivalries are fighting to fill a vacuum of power .
It is no difference that , in the streets of Sinaloa , a few people are being laid off daily or even several people are being shot , or that the dead are grossly being glossed over by the double @-@ snatched mausoleum of the drug , which is bigger than many homes .
Let us not forget for a moment that the time for peace indicates how much the sea side of the valuable ports and the marshalling state with drug routes to the United States is run by only one cartel .
Despite all this and despite the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , the co @-@ founder of Riodoce and the Chairman , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , feels a huge compunction that he was unable to protect his friend .
He believes that he was favour of having killed two mistakes .
The first was the publication of an interview with the cartel click , which is competing with the son of Guzman , in a military zone , with Damaso Lopez in February .
This piece of correspondence could also have been accompanied by a carpet of gangs who suspected of being reluctant to use a publication bought all copies once they reached the newspaper stories .
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after the operation of a crackdown in another newspaper , which had a similar story .
Valdez was legalised both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
He had stayed so long in life that his friends and colleagues had expected him to exist forever .
He served as a veterreporter in the back of Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five of his colleagues to create Riodoce , selling 50 @-@ dollar departments .
Bojorquez said that &apos; in Sinaloas it was impossible to deal with the press without touching on the problem of narcotics &apos; .
The newspaper has been gathering up to date with its bolder and fair statements , and the sale and advertising grew .
The carcasses showed a strong investigation without having to be subject to a great sense of censorship and a printing of readers , which they were able to read stories that no one else could dare to report .
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce , the newspaper won the prestigious award for its Latin American reflections , Maria Moors Cabot .
In the same year , the Commission for the Defence of journalists ( AKK ) won the International Prize for Freedom of the Press for their courage to follow the Mexican drug addiction wherever it leads .
He openly admitted that he was afraid .
&apos;I want to live on , &apos; he said &apos; by adopting the AKK prize .
Last October , in an interview with the television channel Rompeviento TV , he said in an interview that drug trafficking is a way of life in Shaspace .
&quot; Our head is to accept the role that the journalist &apos;s office has had a second chance to play .
I do not want to ask what I did in the face of so many pressures , or why I did not talk about what is happening . &quot;
Riodoce collektiiv strives a man of Valdez , a joyman who rowed like a madman , a friend who generously shared the seeds and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
They supported his routine .
He always carried his hat .
He went from the office to El Guatemeiyabo bar and was always sitting on the same desk .
They are now asking whether his love for routine has been accompanied by him .
His death has also left them to question how best to do their job and stay in life .
&apos;We do not like to hear how rigiddled the wings of these women , their children , their legitimate business , are with their secret landing plates used to carry drugs &apos; .
&apos;Therefore , these things should not have been touched &apos; , &apos; said by Bojorquez .
The result , even in the best time , is strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ respect .
Entrusting their instintures .
If it is a matter of mongering , then a hotel is thrown away .
As Andres Villarreal editor of Riodoce said , the problem is that &apos; the odour can be cheated ... and so was that of Javier &apos; .
He and others say that in Sinaloa , the old rules no longer apply , just as they do not apply to the toxic combination of the paltry routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials in Thailand , Veracruz , Guerreiro or other states that are home to the grotesque trafficking routes , to the toxic combination of the weak institutions and to the corrupt state officials .
The landscape is constantly changing .
In a space where the workers of Riodoce met for security training , mobile telephone networks were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days before , it was revealed that only a butware sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
In front of the House , two police officers sought relief from the 40 @-@ degree monthly pump , in the shadow of the wood .
The government has ordered them to elect the office of Riodoce , located in the Borral building in the central Culiacan neighbourhood .
Some reporters were wondering , in half , whether these police officers were among the 50 % of the police officers whose governors themselves have been carrying out an unreliable test .
Several months have passed since reports have moved into mountain areas where controls are in the hands of de facto drug gangs .
The publication of this week by Riodoce addressed three key lectures .
One of these was the murder of the former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez venna in Sinaloa .
Moreover , they had an uncovered story of spending the government &apos;s money on the home town of the governor .
And the group of people from Culiacan , located from the office of the Prosecutor &apos;s office , which is one of the most expensive restaurants , to be kidnapped by a group of people .
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it was going to happen , so caution had to be exercised when it was time to write what everyone in the town knows as being a position of attitude to both drug traffickers and authorities .
The film was made aware of the public documents that a restaurant is registered with the names of a politician who is in power in an Institutional Revolutionary Party ( IRP ) that dominated all the political levels almost throughout the last century .
Recently , several of the leaders of the IRP Governor have been accused of a large @-@ scale corruption of cases .
The Villarline has asked the reporter to write previous incidents in the same place , including the way in which the son of Guzman , who wear the name El Chapman , escaped from a military record .
Just a few months earlier , readers would have been looking to the coca of Valdez to get information on kidnapping from the best sources .
&quot; In the past , we would have known what happened , &quot; said a 46 @-@ year @-@ old village where the body building of a bunch has served as a slogan to him or her .
&quot; Now , all channels of communication have broken down our sources . &quot;
The office of Valdez has become the refraining for the eyes and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the members of the editorial workers have become something that they could never expect in the name of the activists in the name of the press .
The Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few bridges and , next morning , went to the office of local Public Prosecutor to protest for another journalist .
Mr Salvador Akah disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez .
The body of bodies has been burnt down and , according to officials , it belongs to them on the basis of DNA tests .
Journalists have become more audible throughout the country and are crippling as organised protests on the threads &apos; SOS press &apos; and buildings .
On this day , President Bojorquez has been in Washington in an attempt to gather international support in the Valdez case for justice .
The day after the death of Valdez in a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa , the Ramirez authorities accused journalists of being detained in a nuance and being killed for telling the truth .
After that , he asked him to be guided by the government &apos;s actions elsewhere , concerned that hatred has affected his objectivity .
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were &apos; in step with &apos; beacon in the form of organised crime , complicity from national officials and a half @-@ hearted society &apos; .
In his latest book &apos; Drug press &apos; he wrote that &apos; reporters are not only being killed by drug gangs &apos; , but are also being killed at the behest of the political and security forces , who are in a messy manner .
The Media Monitoring Group , Articulo 19 , issued over half of the attacks on journalists to the police and civil servants last year .
&apos;In Mexico , you are trying to keep quiet , &apos; said Ramirez .
The murderers are obviously having versatile effects .
Nobody will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipad six years ago .
She was found dead in a piece of body which I think had been signed in a cartel , LOS Zetas , &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
His funeral , next to his guns , was broken by computer stands and deserted headphones .
Some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of the northern state of Commanahua , Chihuahuhua , after the killing of their correspondent Armenia , Barbara vÃ¤ikeettevÃµtetele Slava h , in March .
Others will continue to do so as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their president in 2004 .
In 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the editorial list &apos; What do you want us ? &apos; .
Some journalists have fled from their national states , or even from their country .
This is a nerve decision .
It is difficult to find work in the wrong zone and they still have to grab the streets in order to avoid dangers .
And sometimes , they are being driven by , as probably happened in the photograph , Ruben Espinosa , murdered in 2015 with four women in one of the remembrance sites in Mexico three months after the crackdown on Veracruzon .
Those who remain in place and continue to work must refute the risky decisions on a daily basis .
The Ibarra , who once wanted to become a poet , recognises that he is terrified by reporting the narcotics trade .
&quot; Mexico is on the way to hell and that is why I will report , &quot; said .
At a midnight of a recent Friday , when the latest figure had already been slit , the editators of Riodoce sat on the way to office and beer the rock , when suddenly all the phones began to telephone .
In Mazatlani , the guest in the Randinavia town , 19 people had died in fire @-@ fighting campaigns between rival gangs and security forces .
The war was continuing to equate , as were the many messages from cartels found in the area .
On the verge of the same line , reporters uploaded up the Riodoce site using a mobile phone .
The front @-@ line for next day needed to change .
The authorities were killed by another fire in the region .
Bojorquez was on the side of the police in the custody to see whether they are vigilant .
If they were afraid , they did not at least show this .
Under a massive book book book @-@ founder , where the average finger of his bull is to be seen in all Sinaloia , the workers of Riodoce took on his trails .
&apos;How can one think of closing down at all , &apos; said Bojorquez , &apos; when , on the same day that Javier Javier died , the apprentice asked me to send him to report on the streets ? &apos;
Dinosaur used a defence colour to avoid enemies
At first glance , this seems like a form , albeit rather a feeble one .
Scientists have now revealed the first findings concerning the supposedly unbelievable levels of convergence discovered by a Canadian minable pump , which are so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; an added of &apos; dinosaurs Mona . &apos;
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to find out that the leather covered by his soybean was a red @-@ Brown colour and had had had had some &apos; complicated &apos; past .
The report published in the Journal &apos; &quot; La Biology &quot; described the existence of &quot; the best preserved soomre , which has ever been detected &quot; and &quot; one of the best dinosaur characteristics worldwide . &quot;
In the case of fossil , this is a new type of nodosaic that lived in the middle of a storm , between 110 and 112 million years ago .
Its incredibly good storage in raison was awarded to scientists who describe it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
This vegetarian , covered by soya , is the best preserved in the phosphere of the magazine , according to the National Geographic , which has ever been found .
On 21 March 2011 , Shawn Funk found this , when he extracted the Ã‰cor Millenium mine in Fort McMurray in the northern Albertas in Canada .
He has been hit by something that did not recall the straw and has decided to look into it .
The poisonous museum of the Royal Tyrrell was sent to the Alponic Museum .
The next six years were created to expel the animal from the land area of 2 500 pounds ( 1 100 km ) .
After all this hard work , the end result is now finally ready to bring to the public .
&quot; If you bent a little mind , you can almost believe that she is sleeping , &apos; said the leading author , Caleb Brown , a scientist in the Museability of Royal Trell , where the presence is being assaulted .
&quot; This will go down in the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurbias - the dinosaurs Mona Lisana . &quot;
He found in a skint that the hero who , while covered by soybean and reminiscent of a walking tank , was likely to be significantly threatened by food dink .
This dindinosaur , with a high level of soya , used red and white forms of protection to fock himself against predators and implemented a shaking technique , which is called a sham and is also used by many animals today .
This allowed dinosaur to be absorbed better in the region and prevented the enemies , as the major dinosaur pressure probably found him to be hunt .
This figure of 110 million nodosaic families , which is now in the news for the first time , reached the news in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Paleonchology Museum .
The Advisers have now investigated and given this name to Borealopelta Marmitlor &apos;s museum , according to mark Mitchell , the famous team that spent over 7 000 hours to uncover a demanding animal .
Thanks to the astonishing good preservation of the father , Dr Mitchell and the team of international scientists have been able to document the shape and size of the zomy of the body .
They discovered a shadowy - a method of protection in animal states , which means that the head of the mood was a dark spot than a downfall .
Although the uncover is widespread , the findings come as a surprise , as the Veneto is much larger than the animals with mixed patrols today .
This suggests that dinosaur hunting was sufficiently actively motivated by other dinosaur dinosaur pressure that the evolution was preferable to overshadowing the failure of the failure to act as a &apos; survival &apos; approach .
However , most of the animals that use today &apos;s unshady - such as fears , skins or bars - are much smaller and more vulnerable to harvests , which indicate that nodosaurus had to struggle to survive .
&quot; The vigorous cooling of dinosaur contamination , covered by massive and high levels of soya , shows how dangerous the animals of dinance in the Relic era could have been , &quot; said Brown .
Chemical analysis of organic compounds of Soomseed also revealed that the leather of dinosaur pressure was the red box .
Scientists will continue to investigate to get indications of this life , including the content that has been preserved in this warm form , in order to find out what the animal will be the last to have to do with the past .
They believe that dinosaur pressure fell into the dead rivers , thus reaching the sea with a stream of water , where they were left over to the ocean .
At the time , Albertas was the same soya as is now the case in the Eastern Floriquity , and rivers and oceans were probably much further stretched into the inland land than they do today .
&quot; This nodosainity is truly remarkable as it is fully covered by soomy skin , while it has remained in three dimensions , preserving its original shape , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; As a result , today , the animal sees the almost identical picture of the century .
There is not much to be imaginative in this reconstruction : It is enough simply to blend our eyes and it seems like a sleep . &quot;
The time for the crisis was when , on land , huge red @-@ cows of meat @-@ turf meters - terogeneous apples .
Although their King , Tyrannosaurus rex , lived for millions of years after Borealopelta , some of his formidable predecessors could hunt this dysworn @-@ in @-@ house pressure .
These include the long and six tonnes of monster , which includes Acrocanthocontamination , with 38 feet ( 11.5 metres ) .
Scientists whose recent findings are published in the current Biology magazine believe that Boeing &apos;s stunt after death in the sea and this mutuality was replicated .
On 21 March 2011 , the presupposition was discovered by Shawn Funk , when he mined the Millenium mine in the region of Fort McMurray in Northern Albertas in Canada .
The best preserved , as the other example suggests , is the soomdindinance in the world , including leather and soyoy , and it is a total concentration up to the timber .
These assumptions were on average with a total of 18 feet ( five metres ) and were captured at up to GBP 3 000 ( 1300 kg ) .
Two hundred and thirty @-@ seven thousand customs stars stamped out of this .
Scientists believe that this vegetation that is covered by soya will be through the current plague in western Canada , as long as the river flooded into the open sea .
However , the sequestration site at sea of dinosaur was able to preserve its finely detailed nature .
The coal residues of this particular father are so well preserved that the tidal boots of the mythological someteries continue to cover the skin residues .
As Michael Greshko wrote in the Journal of the National Geographic : &apos; This cemetery is as rare as a lotovictory .
The more I look at this , the more incredible it seems .
The leather residues from the boom continue to cover the creation of mythical soybean stands in the yellow .
A better first prize is distributed to him and five of the assets are sited upwards .
I can read the soyows that are on his knees . &quot;
How did one activist get a response to the question &apos; whose streets are ? &apos;
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell received a total shock .
Just days after travelling to New York , it was published on a token bed by Louisi &apos;s resident , Airbb , on a dose bed , in Srings , Facebook .
He got on to the post of his successor in his own case .
It read : &apos; The police killed a young adolescent of 18 years ago and is still rolling out on the streets &apos; .
He was confused as to why nobody else had posted this information on his bed , which is why he closed down Facebook and opened the Twitter .
The postal services of the Pidemega @ TheePharoah users were repeatedly transmitted in line with his line of time .
The dirty tapeworm from the Louam site broadcast real @-@ time sÃ¤da , Michael Brown , the death of an unarmed , 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by a white officer in Fergusonis Missouris .
He has debriefed the image of the room in Brown , which was on the streets , remaining there for four hours .
&apos;This is crazy , &apos; Just thinking about the quotations by Mrs Ferreira .
However , the death was nothing new for him or his community .
He has switched off his phone , but later this evening saw the rest of the retention , which this time announced the accumulation of people on the Canfield in Drive .
Pictures of the police and the people who were afraid of the attack and who claimed to be in the hands of Brown and kept a label with the label &apos; The Ferguson police killed just my unarmed boy ! &apos;
He looked on in real time a bed in which the police officer stood in front of the group of protesters with a grab .
In the second video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I will kill you all ... &apos; .
Mr Ferrell is a reminder of how he has been looking at the thought : &apos; This is unusual . &apos;
&quot; This is not a murder of this kind with which we are accustomed and could call a typical . &quot;
At this time , I felt the heartless .
I was angry and I was afraid . &quot;
He booked a flight and then travelled home the next day .
Having been buried at 23 o &apos;clock , he left her father with his six @-@ year @-@ old daughter and decided that they would travel to Ferguson next morning .
What happened to Ferrelli and Fergusonel over the next three years is the central issue in the new document entitled &apos; Whose street &apos; , whose &apos; whose streets ? &apos; , which is appearing in cinemas on 11 August .
This is the story of survival and the protests , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those people who live in this community and who have fulfilled the streets by demanding replies .
If the ball , with a tyrant - who had a flower tall and a good crown with it - drove the Ferguson , they again spoke about a subject that they had repeatedly spoken before this morning - the experience and living conditions of black people .
&apos;Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; , &apos; he is reminding himself of the question ?
&quot; We are now travelling to Ferguson , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that is not right . &quot;
&apos;I could not take him on board , &apos; said , Commissioner , at a later date .
&quot; What is happening now is the culmination of what happened in the past .
He must know and see this and must grow in the middle .
He must learn about the organisation and organisation of a body , and at the same time know the different layers of experiences and living conditions for the black , and what we must do to be free and free .
Even if I can bring him up so that he is not personally familiar with blatant racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel I would do a disservice to him if I were to defend him against this world . &quot;
The first suspension they made in the presence of Ferguson was on the South Florissant &apos;s way - from the police station to the roadway , which had become a sort of camp plague , where the activists were awaiting news of the police officer Darren Wilson , who was not even charged at the end .
There , the Copll and her daughter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared the southern ones .
They put together the food bags and helped to distribute them to protesters .
For the Ferrelli , a new type of activist was slowly taking shape .
&quot; My activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , &apos; When he was a Missouri @-@ St. Louisi , a student at the University of Louisi , he was the President of the Association of minority students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in the non @-@ performing communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organising .
This is all just a flat . &quot;
After weeks , during a demonstration in the evening , Mrs Ferrell met a film with a fellow film focal Sabaah Folayani .
The prize was said by him and by the film operator , Lucas Alvarado @-@ Farrar , wanted simply to document what is going on .
The question that arose from the example of the Ferrelli was : &apos; Are you trying to document what is going on or do you try to find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
This scepticism was due to a number of cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to profit from its efficacy and resilience .
The prize was explained in a recent interview : &apos; We had heard that the voices of people born and born in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do so in a different way &apos; .
The prize had already been beaten by the film director Damon Davin , the man in the region , who was well @-@ known for being a activist for the purpose of being sentenced to death .
His involvement made the project heated by Mr Ferrelli and by another six for the local communities that were tracked by the team after the shooting of Brown for years .
&quot; No one in this documentary pot is talking to us for us , no one talking to us , but we are speaking to us , &apos; said Davis .
&quot; It was important to me how these people are portrayed , because I am also portrayed as being . &quot;
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrelli , it was to show that the movement was not about &apos; the head of the harvest but about community coming together &apos; , as the Folayman said , made it the most open actor in the film .
As a result , &apos; Whose street &apos; is documented in a astonishing personal way by the life of Ferrelli , such as the graphenylisation and the practice of marriage with one &apos;s wife .
&quot; I felt I was wrong , &quot; said Mr Ferrell , &apos; When I was laughing at the first time , when he was prepared for a town .
&quot; However , I have realised that the human enrichment of this work and its black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
Moreover , the Ferrelli story emphasises and puts the role of the black homosexual woman again at the centre of the broader Black Sea in the Matter movement .
Two of the three initiators of the movement who thought in the social media in 2012 of the hashtag , following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin , are gay .
&quot; In a leading role , women of black age have kept movement in general , &quot; said Ferrell , &quot; and this is precisely because we have to fight on a number of fronts .
The black homosexual women must bear all this burden . &quot;
The photo accepted , noting that &apos; the movement is indeed kept in life by black women and many of these are black gay women &apos; .
He says , however , &apos; This is not a kind of &apos; act of equal opportunity &apos; - that the film was not chosen as the focus of the film because of his identity .
&apos;he was a man who was hot air , &apos; he said .
&quot; However , it is no coincidence that he is on the frontline , because there is a lot at stake as a homosexual woman living in such novels .
His energy can be percepted through the screen . &quot;
At the same time , the news cameras from Fergusonel have been gone a long time ago , but the racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
The suspended suspended sentence imposed on Mr. Ferrell during the demonstration in favour of blocking the road haulage route will last for another 2.5 years .
He describes the social policy climate in the region he calls home simply as &apos; a threat to massive freedom &apos; .
Nonetheless , he still attaches great importance to the mantra that he has garded from the time of his memory , which was the scene of the streets of Fergusoni only three years ago .
&quot; It is our duty to fight for our own freedom .
It is our duty to win .
We must love and support one another .
We have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
7 factsheet on how to overcome the faire of Weekt
Some of the breadth boys will find , after a wave of hot air , that there is a problem , including help .
Or on the basis of the saying &apos; avoid a pomelle , stop a gun . &apos;
However , this is just unavoidable postponement and a good humour for health .
What can you do to better feel in the morning after today and after tomorrow &apos;s Weekent cycle - or whatever else - and get round the poppil as painlessly as possible ?
Joo Water .
Alcohol was below and above alcohol , after a great deal of pain in the morning ... or , if possible , even in the form of alcohol .
Since the body loses a lot of liquids when it uses alcohol , it must somehow be recovered .
Along with water , minerals are also being dispersed from the body and stunning is a good hair to mineral water .
Since , after being meted out , the buck is often irritated , it is particularly good that it is being thrown off or merely easily strained .
Why to walk .
Surely , with pomell , the carve @-@ up of trees would not cost the bath - it could be fatal to mislead .
But a slight turn of history helps the body to recall again what it is like to be alive .
Scrapping in Tsy and sleeping out pohmaka are a more time @-@ consuming way to get out .
Give the body a little bit of energy back and with caution .
If you are already starting to get to the test of drinking yesterday , it is certainly not worth trying to charge the price a great fat boat .
Let me start , for example , with a new volume of plantations containing traps containing trees to keep on maintaining their body in silence .
If health already suffers around the south , then , for example , pulse trees could be tested .
And a little later , the word &apos; clarity &apos; .
The time for departure .
This diuzyalist will free you from your body from the last piece of water .
As has already been said , water and scale are your friends .
We are doing what we can to the painkillers .
If a carte rod is to be painkiller in the evening to prevent poch , then you must tackle not only alcohol but also alcohol but also the persephet or ibuprofen and lose the capacity .
This is the case with even more clothes of their pay and , in the future , the bowls will be worse .
Moreover , there is not much to be painkiller in the body of dogmas .
If you are a painkiller in the morning , you will not do it with a blank fty thread - it will irritate your already dirtimed maze .
Or , if you do not take a partner , you will get a good deal with yourself .
It is about doing the same thing as walking , but not by walking the boat .
However , there was an excessive rate of speed and excitement in the shop - the physical effort should be moderate during the poch .
A path to fun .
The story of the rubber with friends of the time , the easy feeding and the naera amicably , both for themselves and for others ( suffering ) .
The rostrum and the wife may not be able to take a poker off , but surely they can help to make a more entertaining impression .
Once , a poker is going over anyway !
University of Oxford , Professor of Northwestern and a university member is being sought as suspects in a murder !
According to the police , a professor of the University of Northwestern and a member of the University of Oxford are sought nationalized by a worker who has been given suspects after the deadly wound of bites in a man &apos;s province , in a one place of the Chicago luxury basket .
According to the judicial documents of the Cook Region on Monday , arrests of a 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi and of 56 years of imprisonment were issued on account of their alleged involvement in the murder of Trenton H. Cornell @-@ Durleu .
According to the documents , the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Duranu died after repeated havow .
The warning that the Chicago police station issued to the community was that the body of the bodies was found on 27 July .
Police officers received telephone calls and found a victim on arrival in the Grand Plaza Korterrand , whose body had a number of pitulate @-@ listed bodies .
According to officials , the Cornell @-@ Duranu leaf was recognised as dead and the investigators treat seating as murder , while the police actively search two suspects .
Since 2007 , Lawon has been working as a co @-@ professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwester .
In a statement sent as e @-@ publishing , Alan K. Cubbage , Vice @-@ President for Public Relations from the University of universities , said that the Laware has now been temporarily removed from employment and is prohibited from entering the town of Northwestern University .
&quot; This is now a criminal act being investigated by the competent authorities , and the University of Northwestern is working with the investigators , &quot; said Cubbage .
Warren is a senior assistant in the financial institution of Oxford .
A representative from the University and Somerville College said in a statement communicated as e @-@ publishing : &apos; We have been in touch with the British Police and ready to assist the US investigation authorities in any way possible &apos; .
Moreover , the statement stated that the fellow Members from Warre are appalled and wish for him to extradite himself .
Anthony Guglielm , Head of the Delegation for Communications of the Police Department of Chicago , urges the authorities to give in to the authorities on suspicion .
&quot; The police have an idea where they are present , but we are increasingly busy in defining the exact location , &quot; said Guglielm .
According to Guglielm , the suspects are helped by local , regional and national authorities .
Guglielm said that the police received a telephone call from administrators of the Grand Plaza Korterrand , who had just received a chryptic indication that something had happened in the chryptic exhibition .
According to the police , this was a magic spectacle .
According to the statement by Guglielm , it is not clear whether the event itself was also held on 27 July .
He said that the cameras would confirm the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building .
&quot; We believe that Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
The management of the Grand Plaza wrote to the inhabitants : &apos; The police are currently working to identify the clironology of events and the victim &apos;s background , and will examine various motives , including the possibility of a family dispute . &apos;
The companies that will help your company to avoid getting the next one .
Mr Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of his own company in the opening up of e @-@ commerce with satisfaction of workers , but the poll was unhelpful .
The answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; This system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Errett , who is leading an e @-@ commerce company with 75 employees in San Francisco .
He has therefore called for assistance from outside .
It is becoming increasingly clear that new types of human resources are being started up to help companies to find out what their workers feel .
By developing and licensing software with a clear purpose to measure the involvement of workers , they enable companies to commit cells , to target specific teams and demographic groups , to provide staff anonymity and a bull for complaints and , in some cases , to allow empeers to bypass the level C managers and to direct the Bureau .
&quot; Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit , which are designed to monitor health , but where is the Fitres company ? &apos; Asked Jim Barnet , co @-@ founder and CEO , Redwood City at the start of the City of Glint , which is used by software analytical tools to measure employee participation .
In the words of Erretti , he has received a much better picture of what he has thought and what his workers feel in the space of three years in which he has used Glinti .
In addition to the pressure studies and the surveys targeted at certain teams , this provides a company &apos;s thermal card which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support , allowing them to find out the reasons .
Companies have begun to realise that they must keep up with their working culture so as not to become the next Ublishman , which has been caught up in riots since the former employee published a blog depression describing a harassed environment in which those who dared to speak were penalised .
For start @-@ ups such as Glint , the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity .
The global governance , regulation and conformity area may be worth more than USD 1187 billion according to data on financial transactions in the Let &apos;s speak Payments site , according to the Financial Regulation .
The start firm in Colorado , which is operating in Denveris Colorado , is responding to the objective of helping companies to prevent and detect inappropriate conduct , this year , in the face of a dubious reputation of Uber , an interest and an increase in activity .
The Convercentil has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
Uber recently registered himself as a customer .
Like Glintki , the objective @-@ oriented companies will be able to send an adapted stimulus to the polls , gather confidential answers in real time and look at the problematic areas of the thermal cards .
It also offers a anonymous label , which will enable employees to report on the improper conduct .
And , where the executive leader is concerned , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; Public opinion is an enclosed body , &quot; said Patrick Quinlan , founder of the Convercenti and CEO .
I said in the words of Quinlan that if a company is found to treat its employees ill or act in an unethical way , it may face serious consequences , such as the boycotts of consumers , the departure of workers and the courts , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant , which has more than 25,000 employees in 500 sites of activity , has used the Convergence centi for over a year to ensure that employees know the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way of communicating with the General Corporate headquarters .
If the employee had to report earlier on a problem , he had to find a telephone number for the corporation &apos;s headquarters or an email address , then to make a formal complaint and to hope that it will be taken seriously .
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process , said Mr Vitrano , the general adviser of Ruby Tuesday , who said that he was not well @-@ prepared to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
However , now that a company uses the Convercenti , there are problems , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices , which did not previously end up with managers who were operating in offices in other cities or states , to identify and deal with them more quickly .
&quot; I can get closer to the holistic experience of the workers of 360 degrees , &quot; said Vitrano , who is leading the risk management group in Ruby @-@ Tuesday .
&quot; And we will defend our shareholders from legal disputes with their employees . &quot;
Quinlan said that companies were going to take far more seriously ethical conduct , values and worker involvement in 2002 , in other words , after the audit company Arthur Andersen failed due to ethical infringement in connection with the Enron scandal .
However , only when &apos; social media became coon @-@ ahead &apos; did companies realise that they could not prevent their black washing from being publicly online .
&quot; Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used to use technology as a strategy of hope , &quot; he said .
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service , taking charge of companies for the periodic use of their products .
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of a venture capital investor who has been able to rely on both start @-@ ups .
The Convert was financed in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Capital , thereby raising the value of the capital collected at USD 47 million .
USD 10 million was invested in November by the Bessemer Venture partners , increasing the total funding for the enterprise to USD 60 million .
Such investments will not come as a surprise if we consider the interconnectedness between companies , cultures and venture capital .
More and more studies show that today &apos;s workers are expecting more from the job .
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high wages and interesting projects are merely stakes on the table .
The workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission .
&quot; If people are happy in a company , they feel that the work they are listening to and that the work they do is satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of a business , &quot; said Nina McQueen , Vice @-@ President of the Association for General profit and the Labour Administration in LinkedInis , which uses both convergence and Glinti .
Investors will earn the revenue if companies that belong to their portfolios do well ; businesses will do well to ensure that employees are committed and involved .
If analytical tools from the third party allow the strengthening of the commitment and involvement of workers , it is no wonder that they will find support .
Data collection on the involvement of employees is important , according to experts in professional culture .
However , this data is useless if the companies &apos; supervisors do not start doing anything with them .
In fact , if a company asks the employees for feedback , it may be hoped that there will be changes .
And if the changes do not happen quickly enough or no , this could lead to disappointment and to a reduction in the involvement of workers .
&apos;If you ask for 4000 proposals , you must be ready for 4 000 conversations &apos; , the President of the Consultative and Business Administration of Kotter International , Russell Raath , who has seen companies fail to rely too much on data collection .
&apos;because , if things are not done to the end , the workers will think : &apos; Did you actually listen to me ?
Are you concerned ?
And if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
In the words of Erretti , the Madison Reeel , who is now carrying out six studies among the workers , has been able to take measures on the same day as the one announced in Glinti .
And after receiving feedback from workers who were disappointed with the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , he was able to reorganise several company crews and offer communication training to deal with the problems .
Ruby ures are , however , collected for the workers and it is hoped that in the long term , this will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment of workers to an industry known for the high turnover of its workforce .
&apos;If you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you lose people , &apos; said Vitrano .
&apos;and if you lose people , you lose the client .
And if you lose the customers , you lose the businesses . &quot;
The euro area &apos;s shining mark is Baltic : Income growth rate
Although the crisis in 2008 and the trade concerns with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries in Western Europe , Bloomberg is writing a European Central Bank report .
According to the Central Bank , since 1999 total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
The success is caused by a low debt burden , fast @-@ improving institutions and by business and free market @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; The Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few euro area countries with a significant convergence of the EU average in terms of their GDP per capita , &quot;
Although the objective is for total economic output per capita to be equal to the richest Western Europe , in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was based on a population of only 2 / 3 of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
Low wages have led the Balots to seek a better wage from abroad .
Although the European Central Bank sees Baltic in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local people are not at all enthusiastic .
According to a recent Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies would be very or rather well off .
In the Czech Republic and Poland , it was a little less than half the respondents who thought it was about their economies .
NCAA &apos;s decision to cancel the trends that take place twice a day will change the lives of Brumes !
It is almost 23 o &apos;clock when the footballers of the UCLA will stop converting at the very end of a new school snaping at the University of a team .
Some of them have tightened their jigsaw by revealing their efforts in absentia for the first day of the September Camp .
For a large proportion of the team , these Christmas minutes offer a paint from midday .
The participants in the courses will go back to study after a three @-@ hour trend to study the final stage of a collective living before returning to the Wevman football meetings at the next morning .
&quot; The next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said a treasurer of Bruinsi , Jim Mora , a little before Monday became Tuesday .
The NCAA decision to cancel the trends of biannual rental of players &apos; burdens has in fact increased their days - at least until the end of the day , with endless examinations , to the end of Friday .
For this reason , the three first training sessions of UCLA were prompted at 7.15 p.m. to fit into the already intensive timetable for players .
The transition from two to two training days a day means more of a trendy days : The start of the Bruinsi training camp was increased in the face of the last season , and , for the first time , in the Sia six @-@ tonne season , training sessions are taking place at the summer courses .
They will have an 18 trenches agenda until 20 August , before formal preparations begin for the opening ceremony in Texas A against &amp; M in September .
Mr Mora said that he is in favour of amending the USSR , although it adds another item to the tight schedule of players .
&quot; They have a huge burden on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mora .
&apos;and they are breaking themselves through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are wonderful young people .
I believe that when we come on the table and have more time , it is a real pleasure . &quot;
Once the camp has been closed , UCLA training will be closed , which is no easy task , given a clear view of the close @-@ house wired @-@ by @-@ house and remote centre of Luskin , a higher class hotel that has already been shot at the front from the portal with the front @-@ line pattern pattern pattern pattern patronage .
Since this weekend , the players in the hotel are taking the initiative , but Mora admitted that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&apos;We are implementing the safety measures &apos; , &apos; said Mora .
&quot; This is a real concern and it is not an exaggerated assumption that people can rent and sell a traineeship there .
If you have a record on your training , you could do a good deal with it .
But we are using a security team there and on board on board 8 .
We will do our best by using the best we can .
I will try not to be very concerned about this .
We have a plan in place . &quot;
To pay the tax of the Confederation of Castle @-@ Ivanova , the election union of the founding Confederation of the Central Centre , the defeated Kristiina Ojuland and and forced eviction from the reformist party , to the presence of the self @-@ employed businessmen who set up to join the forces of Maria Kaljach and the party , it seems that , in party politics , at least the local elections , the majority of the elected men who have been created by the July List , will be at least as much as the political parties .
However , the buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether they will have enough frustrated voters .
Who will remain with the land ?
If the support team of Edgar Savisaare reduced , one can foresee the events organised to honour his electoral union .
One member of the Council , some former and present members of the centre and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
And , why is it that , from being nominated in Tallinn , some of the Savisaare willing to hold sides and sister , can you look at the fact that the &apos; list of talent &apos; of entrepreneurs , led by corruption and suspicion of corruption , is becoming a reality ?
On the roofs of the municipality , a film @-@ based music fever to the Russian plague of the town of the girl , involving the parent of the town of the LasnamÃ¤e ; and in every sense the primitive computer game in which the Prime Minister , JÃ¼ri Rata , the Prime Minister , must avoid the lomeranging and oraceur in the course of his riding - is that way the centre is seeking , for the first time , the votes of the sufferers of the ballot box of the 16th and 17th year ?
We are looking forward to seeing what the views of other political parties are of a youth campaign .
If the viewer from the beginning of August , email , instead of having entertaining entertainment , looks against two black spots : To accept that in future , only ETV , ETV2 , ETV + , Tallinn TV and Franceennil will see the 24 channels , or give a 10 @-@ month grade to a TV operator , or give up a total of 10 @-@ month period .
There will probably also be those who will initially be happy to hear openly about the free television experience of advertising , but in the end , even though reluctant , they will pay for the television and advertisements .
Alleaning music , a disgusting people and rubbish left on the streets are almost any major musical ploy .
If you do not want to play a role in the mind , it is worth finding your homeland out of the head of the home rather than getting her own pain - and leaving the place of sleeping to the polls for the amount they have paid .
Washington will change the rules on the Green Card
The media have been published by President Donald Trup , who said that a new US immigration plan is to be proposed , which will change the rules on the Green Card .
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year for 50 000 people , stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
The new rules have been proposed by the Republican and the President supports them .
The draft law will be discussed in two chambers of Congress .
&quot; This law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , because it will change the way in which the green cards are issued to citizens of other US countries .
The law will reduce the migration of the chain and replace the current programme .
The new application process will give the advantage to the candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Trump , according to the US media outlets .
The young people in Sxadbia are moving to the town , pensioners are returning to their country .
Yevseyev Anatoli will continue to have the tradition of the famous seto gold miners along the former border of the Maana River .
He works 140 kilometres from home as the driver of the additional heating of Maana , alongside Santa Kuvai , as the driver of the motorised car .
This is a tough job : Two months of work without rest days , 12 hours &apos; work , and then only ten days &apos; work at home and again .
In the three years worked by the Artel , Anatoli has only ever seen the gold .
&apos;There is a hard procedure there : Going in in in depth , checking that the means will not be taken as a means and going out to ensure that it goes &apos; , Anatoli speaks .
In the village of Haida , Mare Piho will speak local seto Jaani , who has spoken to him a great deal about the memory of his family in Siberia .
The archaic culture that has still been preserved in the setox of Siberia will also affect home @-@ pigs , as it is just so shocking , will take the most far @-@ fulled Piho Mare .
His first trip to Siberia will be 30 years later this year .
During this time , he has been there 14 times and has lived there for a year .
How many saturated was it still that travelled to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here ?
This is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took note of this in the words of the rumours of Siberian Sexist , who has himself thought it .
It is difficult to say exactly that , because at the time , up to 30 people could come in a group , but the passport was given only to a man .
The passport was given to only one , but it was children , nurses and suchlike .
Look at what the territory was here .
This was several times larger than historical Setomaa .
After all , this was needed to educate , manage in some way .
Greetings came here as peasants , but their life change , because here they got into areas that were not only related to agriculture , but also to the river ( palm parking ) , the gold mines , the industry .
For example , in New @-@ Petseri , many pigs went into operation later in the city of Krasnojarsk @-@ 45 , where the Soviet authorities built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P. ) , when it was formed .
Did the pigs represent a majority of the population in this region at the time ?
Yes , they were living in a bag .
Moreover , a long tradition has kept married and the reproduction of children .
Seven to eight children in the family were common .
How much does the Siberian Setode culture differ and different from that of mother &apos;s genius ?
They are different , although what was brought here was the same thing .
They brought with them a great many ideas of a popular choice .
They did so themselves ( ideas of a popular nature ) , but they always made a distinction , which was brought in and which had been made here .
Climate change has had a major impact on the traditional rice of setows , because the cold is here .
The fuels were changed .
For example , in Setomaal meat , meat was sown , but it was simply frozen here .
Where are the villages of Siberian setods and what life life life there lives ? / graphics : Alari Paluots
The link with the mother country was spiritually strong , it was considered very important .
It seems to me that now , this Setumaa is starting to give back to it , will influence them .
Those girls who have lived in their families have listened to the amazing experiences .
Piho is thinking of the people of the Estonian setode delegation who came to the daily life of the Kingdom of Haida at the beginning of July and lived four days in homes - J. P .
What is here , this is a disgrace .
&quot; It is extremely easy to come and go away , because the city has a wonderful place : On the railway side and at the crossing points of the roads , &quot; says the operist from Tapalt , Reigo Tamm .
The city is no longer just a military capital , we have a lot of nature , sports and culture , and the pound is in every corner .
Sank is a tip @-@ straw town !
There is a small island along the river through the coast of the city , where the Tamil hails are used to keep the screws .
&apos;There is no such beauty as a train window &apos; , and &apos; is mutating Reigo &apos; .
Those who are not afraid of the cold water will be swamped in the river because the river is full of sources .
I have been there to flood , I can do a great deal !
On board of the river , a long @-@ distance and simply a romantic can do so - it can look at the flow of the river and look ahead to life and want to be done .
I , too , have been walking with my breeders there .
In addition to anything else , an operrist , Tamm , has been active in a river basin of three bridges to get her shoes under way : &apos; That place is in the city , nobody can come into conflict if their stories are cold &apos; .
&quot; The carcasses of the carcasses will open a wonderful view for Tapa , but there will also be health professionals who can run , heal the winter , and now play a design course , for example - golf courses have been made , labels can lend to sports , &quot;
The old tricks are , of course , going there with their own caesta , but I have not yet got to play there .
Obviously , Mr Grale Kull must be invited to visit Tapale because she has experienced a disband of discourse and has a chain .
Perhaps he is lending to me .
The Reigo and MÃ¤nnig mountain were indivisible in the current period of &apos; operino &apos; .
At least during the hours .
There are many tears , many disappointments and many scams left in this mountain , and you can count on me in my sporting life .
Not to mention the broken rocks and slums .
&quot; The city as a whole is currently full of construction work , all of this becomes unknown , &quot;
However , the old and tired building of the ancient and tired is a very attractive place where bathing discoveries are played .
I am pleased that in 2012 , the head of R.A.A.M , note in Meos , adopted my idea and had to make a statement with his theatre during the summer .
Although this year &apos;s theatre season &apos; Aleksei Karenin &apos; has just passed , on 11 August , the railway station is undergoing a &apos; live @-@ up &apos; process , while in the old old building , in the 1980s , there is a move around in the 1980s .
&quot; From 11 to 13 August , the city of Tapa is the day in which , apart from the holes opened by the inaugural house of the authentic Workers building , cultural events are held , including in the form of a popular passport , &quot; Reigo will speak , who will be calling for a visit to a city of 9 years in the nose .
In the small yellow farm of 1 May on the net pump , the museum is already 1994 .
&apos;The house is small , but there are a lot of misstatements and information of enormous proportions &apos; , &apos; is a Reigo in a place full of the history of the town of Tapa , most of which focuses on the railway and on driving .
Reigo mubblier is that , if you go through all the recommended sites in Tapal , you will be a little empty , but fortunately the small town is full of coffee .
&quot; We have such good food places and sometimes , when you sit in coffee , you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad . &quot;
Well trained and young soldiers from Tapale spend a lot of time in pubs , and the wall is a gravest feeling on the site that you are in Estonia and in your home town , but there is a world community of such things together .
I believe that it would be very exciting to hear the stories from the hands of the French or the Americans .
The speakers , yes , we are going a lot !
In Greece two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tendering
Television broadcasting quoted from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tending .
On the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of people illegally on the Iberian Peninsula , including two Bulgarians .
They were released on the same day , but an investigation is taking place .
The Foreign Ministry told the television channel that the Bulgarians were later released .
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free @-@ phone tending and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone who is caught in a circumvented place that is not intended for doing so .
The inspections will continue throughout the season .
According to the Ministry , the court may impose fines .
The ghost of wolves taught by the listeners is breaking the sheep .
Farmers in the soil need to give their herd &apos; teaching materials &apos; to the junta again after the year &apos;s break - apparently the wolf @-@ grappers have already broken a lot of sheep .
This year , the wolf in the island of Hiu has broken the sheep three times , 23 sheep and eight pages have been wounded , the Hiiu site writes .
The figure was three , up to 124 .
In the gloomy synchon , the environmental agency also has the data that the wolf benches in the fourth @-@ hand Country were not born and that the button Board of the Netherlands had been informed that two wolf washes had been fixed this year on the island .
On Monday night , the wolves broke the Musycles from 15 sheep in the village of Emvest Kabuna and injured 18 of the ruins survived .
In the morning of the morning of the morning , the wolf broke a sheep in the grazing ground in the Reheselja village and was severely injured by another who had to be subjected to an emergency killing .
The rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
The land Ministry of Culture has sent a coordination front to a draft law on the release of GMOs into the environment ( &quot; GMOs &quot; ) and a plant protection product amendment law .
The amendment to the law gives up the creation of a separate collection of data for both the locations and the operators of genetically modified ( GM ) crops , thus using a plant health register in the future .
In addition , the GM crop operator will be changed from the obligation to have prior agreements with the beekeeping agent in the requested radius .
Although there are currently no GM crops grown in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence between GM crops and non @-@ GM crops .
This would be at least as long as there were no decisions to declare Estonia GMO @-@ free , &quot; said Sigmar Suu Kyi , Head of the plant health department at the department of the Maaelutic .
&quot; However , it must be taken into account that the measures that have been developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burdens of both the private and the public sectors , &quot;
The draft law repeals provisions relating to the collection and treatment of GM crops in the form of a data collection and management system for GM crops in the GMO , lays down requirements for handling GM crops and for starting an economic activity .
Specifically with regard to beekeeping , the GM crop growers will be replaced by a clear obligation to inform beekeepers of the obligation to start growing GM crops by committing an appropriate agreement with the beekeepers before starting cultivation .
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination .
All interested parties will have the opportunity to familiarise themselves with this in the information system and , if they wish to , present their views to the world &apos;s department .
The proposed changes will particularly affect those operating in the area of crop farming , beekeepers and the agricultural profession .
In the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 810 - is allowed to be grown .
So far , however , not a single Estonian farmer has taken an interest in growing GM crops .
This is because there is no magic bullla in Estonia , the European corn Media , which is resistant to mon 810 .
Also , its maize leaf @-@ bashing has been cultivated on the southern regions , and this is not appropriate in our climate conditions in May .
To obtain this certainty , the Hague Department of the Regions has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect pollution from potential GM bodies in the seeds of various summer rapeseed , maize and soya cultivated in Estonia .
The analysis of the tests carried out showed that the seeds were not included in the exogenous area and the inquiry concluded that the seeds of seeds for rapses , maize and soya varieties that increased in Estonia were not accompanied by GMOs .
This is the case , in turn , with the fact that in Estonia GM crops are not being deliberately cultivated and it was also confirmed that there was no accident contamination .
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United colbas Nemanja and Maticu in the form of &apos; genius &apos;
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited in the form of Nemanja Maticu as &quot; genetic &quot; after the central player , Sampdoria , on Wednesday evening , was given a designer .
GBP 40 million from the player bought from Chelsea in Dublin in the last pre @-@ authoritarian match of Unitedi , in front of UEFA Super Cup on Tuesday , went out in the rum of Madrid on Tuesday to celebrate 2 @-@ 1 victory in the initial rigging , giving the impression of defence , while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were able to engage freely in the attack on the streets .
But , aside from the noble Asian model , Maticon was left with a badly needed poch @-@ iron Strip and he had only had to get up to 45 minutes , as he said , he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&apos;he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genius thinking - he has a football mentality , &apos; said Mourinho .
&quot; We will help it to achieve its standard as soon as possible . &quot;
Like the inexcuses at the Aviva stadium , other new man recruited by Victor Lindelof and Mourinho began to keep in the balance of the rock at the beginning of their season .
The report published this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three more sportsmen and women , but he confirmed that the club had already done a &apos; excellent job &apos; by concluding contracts with three of four of its four priority options .
&quot; I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three of the four &apos; .
&quot; I am even happier if they can deliver on four things , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
Another salt poet had his feet on 1 August , and this time on the Silk Brother .
The first guest to be filled in the area of Mati Martinson , a rarer , was accompanied by a former spawning pool in SÃµrves , and the washing washing basin is already walking , walking away and signing the Mullutu @-@ Great Belrishall .
This is because , after all , murder does not have any fruit fields , the voice of the islands writes .
This time , relatively late in smacking the sail , the accompanying person received another pump , and this was the case on the island of Boy .
According to Martinson , the installation of the accompanying workers is , in fact , an international project , operated by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojare .
Soil was supplied by a pump called Mati &apos;s successor , SÃµrves TÃ¼rjul .
&quot; His activities are all on the internet : How he went to Spain to farm , coming back for a long time at the border between Germany and Poland , and then on the Saareland , &quot; Martinson spoke .
British inventors to fit in with microchips to get to their own body in order to get to a hand @-@ hand house and a car .
The first person to come from a British inventor in a country to which a microchip was installed so that he can only open his way to his own advantage , access the office and even start a car .
Steven Northam , aged 33 , has been able to install a small chip between his pÃ¶la and his captive finger , and is now also providing this service to companies and individuals who want to make life easier by means of Bioq .
She has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson in a Royal hospital in Winchester , at the town of Hampshire , in Hanting , to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards .
The technology is similar to that of the microchip fitted on the casts and dogs , and the procedure takes only 30 seconds .
The Northam company also has to replace the snowings of houses and cars so that they are compatible with ambulances by asking for a lump sum at GBP 300 .
This father of a child who has married has now installed technology in both his own country and his car , BMW Z4 , which will start if he has a hand in the rostrum .
A cartel correction cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents published for the magazine , the decision taken by the White House to aeroplane a naval helicopter for last month &apos;s production event in the southern horror has cost taxpayers USD 24 000 .
The green and white colour , Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , which is called the &quot; Marine One &quot; under the presidency &apos;s parity , was the centrepiece of the play of the US construction programme in White on 17 July .
President Donald Trump , the senior officials of the White House and Mike Pence , have been reporting on industrial products in their circulation from all 50 states .
A helicopter built at the Connecticut was rolled together with a cell cell cell cell cell cell cell from the repute , a lamb from WrocÅ‚aw and a lead panel .
According to the documents of the Escademy , Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX @-@ 1 ) , who is responsible for the deployment of a helicopter , the White House has been called for by a cell cell cell cell , or FARGO , to a minimum effect 36 hours before the helicopter &apos;s &apos; extraordinary &apos; celebration at the southern hemicycle .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , as it is an unusually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said HMX @-@ 1 comandÃ¶r a day before the event in an email of his personality , the leading officer of the naval domain to the depump in aviation .
The message stated in the message that the helicopter will arrive on the southern horror on 17 July at 7 : 00 in the morning at 7 : 00 , to be launched and stay there until the night is cleared at 18 : 21 .
The added point was that , should the departure from the White House be , the return flight would require a second ethos , due to the limitations of working time .
The initial aviation crew were at the scene of the event at helicopter level and the security team of the eskar kept a plane close to the aircraft throughout its period of stay on the ground .
It was not possible to read out from documents given to the magazine whether or not it was necessary to have another version of the ethos at the end .
The Hatchi Law prohibits the use of the assets of the Federal Government for political purposes .
The documents show that the HMX @-@ 1 study examined whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; We asked whether this was a violation of the Hatchi law and we were told that it was not , &apos; wrote a commander .
&quot; It seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to the Deputy chief victim .
The White House declared the &apos; American &apos; event as an official event and the Hatchi law would not have covered it .
However , even in formal events , there are political subtones .
The President supported the health reform efforts at the time in the Senate and praised his attempts to keep government regulations under threat .
The use of a aircraft known under the name of the Marine One or Air Force for political gain is not a new phenomenon .
The Presidents must use them to travel .
However , the requirement to use them merely as a photocopy is unusual .
The Trump was brought to attention in February when , at the first campaign event in Floridas Melbourne , a president &apos;s plane was held by a background in the water , and he is sliding from Twitter &apos;s account with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the plane of President .
&apos;The White Matel is very pleased with the launch of a &apos; America made in &apos; , where products were represented from 50 states produced by American workers from American materials , &apos; said Lindsay Walters , the spokesperson in the White House .
HMX @-@ 1 teams often perform test flights around Washington and at the southern hemicycle to get to get to grips with the white house of the US President with a metre @-@ metre citing .
When the G20 summit was held at the beginning of July in Trump in Germany , the HMX @-@ 1 White House was able to organise 58 samples .
According to the official , the flight was included in the standard for this time @-@ end flight operations performed in America .
On that occasion , the helicopter of Eskar fly another 11 hours &apos; for &apos; non @-@ presidential support missions &apos; .
According to the White House , no other exponential burden on the taxpayer &apos;s wallets was placed on the wallets of this event .
As the representative of Sikorsky said , the company was not involved in organising the exponential development at the southern helicopter .
HMX @-@ 1 will not retain the budgetary documents of the President &apos;s flights and the precise costs arising from the event will be difficult to identify .
However , at the average price of the defence Ministry for the financial year 2017 , the amount of compensation for the VH @-@ 3D will be USD 24 per flight hour .
The first office papers indicated for the flight the length of its main base from the Fax air force , Quantico , on both routes , 30 minutes .
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below the sum of this .
&quot; It is very misleading to calculate taxpayers &apos; costs on the basis of the estimated compensation rates , &quot; said Wales .
&quot; These estimates of compensation will include staff , maintenance and many other irreversible costs which will be taken into account in the annual appropriations . &quot;
According to a study from the 2015 rostrum , the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation rates for personnel costs , but does cover the costs of fuel , maintenance and contracts .
The former spokesperson for the White House , Sean Spicer , defended the use of a helicopter at that time .
&quot; The point is to show the things that have been done in America this week , &quot; said Spicer .
&quot; And I know that the Sikorsky state and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds , if not thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
And I believe that , just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked tirelessly on .
So , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
It is not clear whether the Trump tree in the southern factory , when it was circulating , was pulled in a helicopter or not , but was sitting behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
In the White House in the Main , Trump Sikorsky addressed representatives , throwing out the media for joke and for the company &apos;s products in its own aircraft park .
&quot; I know this very well from SikorskÃ¡ , &quot; the President said , &apos; I have three products for them &apos; .
Grit Å adeiko - Slucky journeys taken through the hats were peaceful and happy
In the last area of Mil Daemes in 2011 , the Skate Shup hit the Sikh , the 800 mour of runk walks and the stadium was taken from the kettle .
Just before that , he had received a jump from hair to ham in China .
In 2012 , Helsinki was damaged by cheap injuries , but in London , the debate camp Milinti had the seat in Article 60 to paragraph 23 .
However , I am still a mistake .
After the opening day in Moscow in 2013 , Moscow MW received a record from Estonia in a plot to a head @-@ on injury in the timetable .
Two years later , he gained 15 seats in Beijing and carried out the Olympic orium , but this was more than a disappointment to the athlete .
The cynicyest hurricane passed through Å adeiko only had the cost of not getting a letter from the City of Amsterdam .
I would just like to put together once , even once , a proper multi @-@ contest .
Once , &apos; , spraying for the evenings of the Å adeiko .
Worse than this , a month later , his Olympic contest was already broke at the first barrier due to the reignition in Rios .
Time has to be taken down - did you go on with seven competitions ?
Is the two @-@ day effort really worth all this ?
There was much thought about it , but there was peace .
I could almost think of a silver thought .
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
Fortunately , there was time to cure ourselves and to think very quickly .
&quot; I knew that I would not yet shrug my head , &quot; says that there is a shouty about self @-@ labelling .
I was able to turn the cardboard on the back and take a new impetus .
Mrs KmÃ¤ki said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of care , but she realised that , above all , the sportsman himself must get his own clarity .
After all , he was so buried by everyone .
This was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; However , the leader said he would not give up and he would like to prove what he is worth , &apos; he says no , he says .
Now , there is some peace in it .
He is doing so for his own pleasure .
The exhibition came back in May , when the Å adeiko erected a new record of 6 280 points at a multi @-@ competitive competition in GÃ¶tzise .
At the high @-@ level competition , he improved the personal top stag at a heat price with almost an inch ( 13.89 ) and ran on a record @-@ close race .
Then , a competition felt that it was not a level of ability at all , but that the starvation was only the first in the competition .
He has been guided by a word of the hill for years that shanty is a black student .
He is prepared to carry out a sports exercise , is a good training .
If something is done or is wrong , then he will say it immediately .
He knows his own body and he has his trust in his own sense .
This is what we must follow .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we will follow it .
The new approach has also been found in the case of Å adeiko .
&apos;I am not one who makes the maximum of a trend &apos; , but he says and says that the most important thing is to get the best sense of living , because it also provides a good result .
Bye glue glue glue glue
The good emotions have also been offered to shudder to shudder .
Both her former fellow teacher , Maris hill and sister , Grete , have recently become parents and a competition @-@ shirter has received new sources of despair from citizens .
&apos;It has been quite interesting , &apos; , &apos; says &apos; Sadeiko .
One alcohol whose drinking is synonymous with &apos; training &apos; .
LirÃ© writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is a faint @-@ hearted wine fan that he believes that wine can teach a brain better than any other thing in the world .
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at the University of Yale .
He said that this is not a matter of alcohol or of how it affects our feelings and our ideas , but rather of the &apos; very active &apos; process of taste for wine .
By buttering the glass , by triggering wine , by enjoying it and by having a taste , we are putting our brain on the job to create a taste for wine .
According to Sheperd , algam does not actually contain taste , but a taste arises from the way in which wine stimulates brain .
He leads to a comparison between the way brain sees &apos; appearances &apos; .
&quot; Taste is not wine , taste creates a taste for wine , &quot; says Sheperd .
Things that still affect the emergence of a taste of wine are , for example , the number of our age , our sex and even our heart that humans produce .
Of course , Shemen feels that wine is not a product full of hair .
&quot; There must be more of a move , &quot; he says .
If you take the straw too big , the system will be overloaded .
Excessive drinking wine can be done to the detriment of the brain , but according to a survey in 2004 , people who run over three glass of wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity are at risk .
10 % of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia get less salary than colleagues
Figures from the Perselection Company Fontes reveal that 10 % of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less than their salary .
The 10 % pay gap is between men and women , and the portal is a pr portal .
The teachers &apos; remuneration survey covers 59 IT and telecommunications companies .
A total of 8 577 posts were surveyed .
63 % of the posts were worked by men .
&quot; Although only 3 companies said that the pay gap is in favour of men and that other companies considered that there is no pay gap , in reality , the average pay gap between men and women is 10 % higher than men &apos;s , and the total salary of men is 8 % higher than women on average , &quot; said Mrs Metals Iljev Iljev Iljev .
&quot; Narcos &quot; : Now that Pablo Escobar has gone , the top of the Netflix hitcard will be the Cali cartel
Despite the fact that in the second season of &apos; Narcose &apos; , the killer of Pablo Escobar was exposed , the Netflix site site is far from over .
The third and fourth levers have been confirmed by the stream and the first has already been produced by a clip of advertising which riches the charger with the new pawns .
In the third season , the DEA will pay its attention to the richest drug organisation in the world , the Cal cartel .
They are acting under the leadership of four powerful Christian women , &apos; like Fortune 500 companies &apos; , with more bribery and violent acts .
Mr Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the head of the cartel , Mr Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) , whose brain , Ms Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) is leading the ties with Mexico and Ms Chepe Sanpe Sannorsuntaz London ( Pepe Rapazote ) is operating in New York .
In a self @-@ proclaimed advertising clip , Mr Pascali is seeing his return to the death of Javier pen as a figure who recruits the American and Colombian law @-@ enforcement assistance in the war against drugs .
Other new indicators include Matias Varela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .
The third season for &apos; Narcos &apos; will be opened on 1 September .
According to the UN , the role of women in democracy in Afghans depends on political role
The head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can represent the people only if all members of society , including women , play a role .
Sir Nicholas Haysom , head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , said that hundreds of women would stand for election at local councils , three women would stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; By underlining the importance of women &apos;s role , it is not possible to exaggerate , &quot; he said in a statement made on Wednesday .
The elections can truly represent the people and can only be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all phases of the electoral process .
The local council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
The Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coincides with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
This year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is transferred calmly from one democratically elected government to the next .
According to the Gymouthyme , a strong role for women in Afghanistan is increasing the success of democracy .
According to the Independent Election Commission for Afghanistan , 1.2 million women have registered with the 3.6 million registered voters .
The joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both large and small .
There is always too little time in common , but with tense threads , the opportunity is a good opportunity to combine meetings , play , clothes and burdens .
And what a convenient solution - wherever you died in the summer , the living winds of the day are always with you and you are irreproacingly reminded of your fine voice : &apos; Let us now make a pound ! &apos;
Aluminated insulation : A normal game of gold or a sliding through the coast &apos;s licence is a good thing .
A combination is the foundation stone and the beacon of lasting feet - who would then like to take the form of a sleeping sand from the wave of wraves during the summer ?
It is wonderful to use children instead of a kettle !
Firstly , it is secure and convenient , the difficulty is gradually increasing at the same pace as the training and power .
It is also possible to fill villages with quite great children .
A child is trained on the balance , counts on cleaning and feels fun at the opportunity to be high and important .
At the same time , larger children can drag on themselves .
The scope of the movement is determined by reference to land and by instructions .
The finger of the How cold is , to keep the palle in order properly .
A child can read the accounts and feel like a trainer .
The planet is extremely attractive , but hopelessly pernicious for the child .
However , it is easy to do something .
Park @-@ plank : Take a long plank of manoline , which will be repeated .
In fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much more amusing to do , if , in the meantime , you can hand your hands to your friend .
To add burdens , we can have a wedge , a small peat , and also a walking around in this position .
A further aspect is the ability to sit on the children &apos;s seats , but this exercise offers fun arrogance for all children .
While the crabs are sleeping in the sand , the swine is getting a swingeing , ash and a monash pressure , as was the case .
The child is walking on its feet in such a way that its body &apos;s scope is distributed equally and behind .
Marketing can be held to hold on to the rescue .
Reverse feet and plainly .
The angry can fly , can be fun , can froze a balance and can be a difficulty .
A small mill &apos;s life is an extra step if he or she gets a little bit of heat on the way .
An additional burden will be placed on the feet in advance .
Checking that it would not be in a neutral position .
Children themselves have a lot more fun to do in a couple of flames and with a bag .
A village with hand and with a wedding .
Follow the safety of the child , the position of the generation and the hole in a neutral position .
The favourite and great joy of all children !
At the same time , the oldest really effective all the body trend .
The sports tools were Ott ( 10 ) , SÃ¤de ( 8 ) , happy ( 4 ) .
From the Philippines to the heart of the world &apos;s broader - the Tackle journey
Trapped copies are a summer class which has in recent years become a piece of snuff in itself , and one of the correct whistle has to hang on top of the hand , and which has been able to use the dealers to display a price stamp , even though it was from a modest point of view .
The copy of a bunch of bags red in a bunch of hypocrisy is probably one of the things that has existed in life at the same time and which has not been aroused much emotion .
This simply exists and , if it does not exist , there is no plague .
Now , however , the jump bags are taking a real exodus , and the momophile beetles have changed their top @-@ top design bags for months to come , instead of simple beer @-@ shirked bags .
This is not just a coastal zone , but it is also , today , just as popular as a street dog , and it is even the bolder women who are walking into office .
However , it is worth making it clear before whether the solemn idea of this summer is sitting or worth marking and the laptop computer still goes a little further .
However , the affinity has been made by the beer &apos;s real love of women by summer .
For example , reading foreign motives , the first thing to do is to see that mogurus people are the first thing to do on holiday , as a result of having a beer &apos;s ticket , to acquire a pump for themselves , which is the guest of a full holiday and accompanied by loads of beaches , market and also friend @-@ makers in the town .
Some bloggers are so generous a lamb that buying a bag from the market or selling a larger heap or giving them to their loyal readers .
It is worth noting that there is such a great demand for the readers that , in the rest of the world , women ( and men ! ) apparently have to go to each other &apos;s shores to become happy property for some homes .
In a sense , this madness is also understandable , because it is the same procedures that educate itself when , in the mock of yesterday , it is possible to buy up a few dozen euro .
True , the rock traders have also discovered a simple way of making money here , and so beer @-@ like luxury brands are selling the belts for a few hundred and a half thousand euros .
Obviously , in order to ensure that richer customers do not need to feel as easy to die , who program themselves with some cheap bags .
For example , it is possible to buy Dolce &amp; Gabbana over EUR 1 000 per litany .
However , for the slightest interpretation of the pump , EUR 6 000 can be moved out of circulation .
Unlike most motor buildings , however , the beer does not come out of a great deal of fun , but rather from a far more distant experience .
Indeed , the outsourced bags are said to be coming from far too many Philippines , where they have been transported .
The red @-@ down of a bunch of trains is particularly there for export business and very often the local ones do not see any trace of them .
It has been said that the drinking form of the 14th century is a fairly brutal cork .
However , since the beer does not have to be as red as the basket as the one , they can be labelled with musts and other materials that make the cocktail more personal and , by extension , also more acoustic .
For example , recently , there are particularly trendy bags in which red pavements or skins are in .
However , the full letter may , in particular , be sent by accessories to Jane Birkini , the largest beer beer beer beer beer beer of which had not been seen before .
He has adapted the beer to any set of clothing that he can get to , and even had to go to the Cannes Film Festival .
What is less important nowadays , however , is that , in the popularity of the people , it is not the slightest role that is taking care of them , and unlike all the summer centres , they are not required to care for them with special means , but that the water and the target are also taken away .
As always with the initiative of a trend , the brands , apart from classical appearance , have come up with any interpretation .
For example , if you wish , you can get a juice from your beer or you can acquire a tiny piece of bowl .
It is worth remembering , however , that a classic beer will never be left in the fashion , but with the coldest fuel .
But , what is the classic beer &apos;s copy , then ?
For centuries , a Cafloat copy of a beer that resembles a cork has been kept on the loop and is short , as well as straits , crippling .

GMB is concerned about its investments in the McVitie plant in Glasgow
The Trade Union is waiting for the managers of the mature generation McVitie to be reassured of long @-@ term production plans at the Glasgow plant .
According to GMB Scotland , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment at customs level .
In a theatre producing Hobnolid and rich @-@ rich know @-@ how and other products , more than 500 people work .
The owner of McVitie in Pladi said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years of the site .
It was paid by staff and by trade union chairs &apos; is the first to hear &apos; when something changes are made in the operation of the factory .
In a letter to the Director of the enterprise , GMB addressed the request by McVitie Scotland to &quot; peddle the concerns that the funding is not being used to modernise production lines . &quot;
The senior organiser of GMB , Drew Duffy , said : &apos; The fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the head of the site on the business needs of customs and the future investment plan is a cause for grave concern for our Members .
Several generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely made up of people from the local community and the region around Glasgow , which is an indispensable pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social housing .
Thus , in the face of the growth in jobs , salary and welfare in the eastern Glasgow , and Brext , the very thriving venture McVitie is in dire need of living costs and the decline in production . &quot;
The Bureau representative said : &apos; The head of the customs crosses was received from GMB Scotting only yesterday , and the company replies directly to him , because we value the active interaction with workers and trade union representatives .
Two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the employees in the customs and the representatives of GMB , which openly debated a number of issues .
We then discussed with the workers that , like all other companies that are extremely competitive and in a precarious economic climate , we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this is true of all our businesses and all our objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
He added : &apos; In recent years , we have invested over Â£ 5 million in the customs crosh site , and most of this has gone into production lines and improvements in procedures .
We fully understand the legacy of customs as a productive site and , if the object of the site is to change any changes , the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
Did PSG warn the Netherlands about its approach three years ago ?
The la can regret this interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not give up in the attempt to attract Neyts to their ranks by making a bid to buy him GBP 189 million , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record trip to conquer ?
This pathetic approach has opened the summer &apos;s transition window and the club of Ligue 1 is prepared to break the current world record of double the purchase that was erected at the previous season by returning Mr Pogba to Manchester Uniteus for GBP 89 million .
Once the changeover has been completed , the Neymark will thus become the most expensive player in the world and , at the same time , the most highly paid professional global player , who will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from the PSG .
Barcelona is , of course , a hint , both because of the approach and because of the breaking down of Neyra , although the source close to the Catalansan Bureau confirms that the club has always been best off for the football camp since its arrival in Santototou in 2013 .
However , did the President of the PSG warn the football world of this opportunity three years ago ?
When Manchester City showed an interest in concluding the contract with Blaise Matuka in 2014 , Mr Al @-@ Khelaif warned in a tough way against all clubs thinking of recruiting some of their best @-@ performing retailers in the PS .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that , when they are dealing with some of our players , we will stand down to them and contact their players , &quot; al @-@ Khelaif said .
&quot; We honour all the clubs .
But if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this border , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the midfield player of PSG , Marco Verratti .
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow them to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer setbacks as a result of this interest by removing , in the form of a Neymark , one of its precious assets .
Prime Minister , Ireland wants to build bridges after Brex , not borders .
&quot; Brex is seriously threatening to drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned early on a first visit to Northern Ireland since its entry into force in June .
&apos;I cannot imagine who would benefit from this &apos; , he added .
Cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible to move freely to the current people and goods , says the Varadkar .
&quot; This is our vision for the future : Building bridges , not borders , &quot; he emphasised .
As the cartel suggests , he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union , and as it is not , he would be part of the European common market .
This would preserve the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom .
Another chance to make Britain &apos;s departure smoother would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explained by the Taoiseach .
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , the Varadkar said , &apos; surely we could have had this kind of Great Britain &apos; .
The alternative would be to return to customs points , which would herald a historical schizophrenia and a political failure .
&apos;Let the trade , prosperity and peace &apos; , the Taoiseach of Ireland said .
He called Brexitit &apos; a challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that the outcome could affect every aspect of the everyday life of Northern Ireland .
The Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in the north of Ireland , in Belfast .

Today , the capital city of OtepÃ¤Ã¤l was the largest triathonic gas from the Baltic States , when around a thousand triathles were able to win the semi @-@ 8th prize .
70.3 miles of design consisted of swimming 1.9 km , cycling 90 km and walking at 21,1 km .
Among others , the first trialogue also gave a successful outcome to the note Avand .
&quot; I thought it would be difficult and , ultimately , was difficult , &quot; saying Avand AvunÅ¡i .
Despite the complexity of the game , Avand said that in fact , the trialogue is feasible for almost everyone .
&apos;The disgusting is not killing but kills the pace &apos; , he said , suggesting that with a feasible rate , one can almost every man gets to the finish .
Apart from Ott Sepp , &apos; Oo be in order with the odour , but unfortunately , he is not in a swimming position &apos; .
Avand had already made a great deal of headway from February onwards .
Initially , between 4 and 5 hours a week , and then ten hours a week .
Time 05 : 34 : 12 , he won a general account of 27th place .
While Avand lost both to Raio Piiror ( time 04 : 59 : 53 ) and to JÃ¼rgen Ligi ( time from 05 : 06 : 37 ) , she won other so @-@ called &apos; prominent class &apos; .
Last year , Tanel Padar , who served as a &apos; good model for personal &apos; , lost her name to Avanti in seven minutes ( time : 05 : 05 : 54 ) , journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes ( time from 05 : 50 : 23 ) , Kalev Krrreeand Raivo E. Tamm ( approximately one hour ( time : 31 : 53 ; 06 : 53 ; and 06 : 45 : 18 ) .
