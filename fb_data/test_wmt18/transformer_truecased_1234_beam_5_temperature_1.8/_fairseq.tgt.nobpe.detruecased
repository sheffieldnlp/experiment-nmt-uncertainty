In Estonia and Spain , four members of the Cape Verde group were detained .
According to Mr Posselt , in Spain , the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde Group &apos; was held up by the police , the head of the so @-@ called group in Estonia , Mrs Gulevich , who is known in the criminal world under the name of SpinKadrovski .
Gulevich detained in Spain was arrested at a court permit .
Yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
It is suspected that the so @-@ called members of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde &apos; criminal community are aged between 27 and 57 years of life , mainly committing drug crimes .
The alleged leader of the criminal community was detained in the province of Miris in Spain .
In Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of them collected according to data is the leading figure of the criminal community , and two are members of the criminal community .
The data collected indicates that tasks and roles had been clearly divided in the criminal community .
The purpose of criminal activities was to carry out drug offences and thus to earn criminal proceeds , &quot; commented on the head of the pre @-@ trial proceedings in criminal cases , the Public Prosecutor Vaila Verte .
&quot; We do not rule out that there will be an increase in the range of suspected criminals , &quot; added the Prosecutor .
It is people who have previously taken the interest of law enforcement authorities , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; International cooperation has become commonplace for all of us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; said Public Prosecutor Verte .
Charles Leis , head of the central criminal police service , said that detention was preceded by nearly one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year pre @-@ trial .
&quot; In the first half of the week , we had a long history of work and , at the same time in Estonia and Spain , suspected of committing crimes , &quot; he said .
He added that central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
For years now , we have good contacts and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
These detentions are yet another message for criminals that we will get them out of another European way . &quot; Said Leis .
The information gathered so far makes it clear that men suspected of being free can continue to commit new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office asked for their arrest and also approved by the court .
The man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
Property , vehicles and cash have been seized for confiscation under this criminal law .
A prior criminal proceedings will be carried out by the Office for organised crimes organised by the Central Criminal Police and led by the Public Prosecutor .
He was sentenced to blackmail by the Mayor of Tallinn in 2005 and sentenced to five @-@ year imprisonment by SBlokland Gulevich .
In the middle of the last decade , Gulevišit was regarded as the second most important in Estonia &apos;s criminal world , following the Marxomic Alliance , Nikolai Tarankov .
Mr Gulevich , from Cape Verde , came up in Estonia &apos;s alliances at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Admittedly , he taxed taxi drivers and women on various hotels and ordered a monthly rotation tax for businessmen .
International joint operations , the confiscation of proceeds of crime and the entry into force of judicial decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
For example , the latest court rulings , the eight accused of the so @-@ called Dikic criminal community , who confiscated EUR 80 000 of criminal proceeds , or the verdict against nine persons , that Igor Aleynikov set up a criminal community in 2006 aimed at illegal trade in illegal cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in East Viruland and southern Estonia .
There is a total of around EUR 71 500 worth of confiscated criminal profits .
In these criminal cases , it has made progress that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and , if necessary , procedures are carried out in any European Union country .
The Civil Liberties Group warns of Missoula travel
The National Association for the Advangue of the People of Colored People ( NANicaragua ) has warned people of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the State .
According to the Group &apos;s statement , &apos; The NASR issued for the State of Missouri State , valid until 28 August 2017 , calls on all African Americans to be particularly attentive and very careful when they move around the country , given the suspicious racial events which have taken place recently and which have also been pointed out here &apos; .
According to NATA , the group urged both the recent Missouri law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and also the fact that the targets of the state &apos;s law of law @-@ enforcement officers are , to a large extent , minorities .
&quot; Citizens &apos; rights are violated .
They will be trapped because of their skin colour , beaten or slaughtered , &quot; &quot; said Ros Chapel , President of NASR City Star .
&quot; We have never received so close complaints before . &quot;
This is the first warning issued by an organisation for the US state .
The group referred to events such as racist insults on musicians &apos; students at Missouri University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black Sandersi of Tennessel .
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , after he ran through the state of the country , and the Missouri police captured him without being accused of a crime .
In addition , the report recently compiled by Missouri &apos;s Chief Prosecutor shows that in the State car drivers &apos; cars will be halted by 75 % more likely than that of white drivers .
&apos;For people to be aware and to warn their families , friends and collaborators about what might happen in Missouris , &apos; said Chapel .
&quot; People need to be ready , whether it is to include remote money or to inform relatives that they pass through the state . &quot;
According to the most recent figures from the FBI programme , the Missouris was recorded in 2015 at 100 hate crime , which puts the state in the 16th country in the presence of similar offences .
A travel warning is also in response to the new Missouri law , which makes it difficult for a company to refer to the Court of Justice for reasons of discrimination in the quest for housing or work .
The American Civil Liberties Association ( American Civil Guard ) had previously issued travel barriers for Texas and Arizona following the adoption by those states of immigration laws obliging local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences because , according to ACLU , it increases racial profiling .
Usually travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Hepatitis : What could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
Hepatitis , or incineration , can be caused by five different types - A , B , C , D and E @-@ hepatitis virus .
All of these viruses provoke a fierce burst of the liver .
However , there is chronic hepatitis B and C , which can develop further into a cirrhop - a liver corps and a liver cancer .
The epidemiological Adviser of the Health Agency , KuSuu r , tells us that acute hepatitis disease events are the same in the case of all types of skimmed combustion - fever , fatigue , Embrance , Easperation , oineration , spatience , pic emissions , horse mackerel , meat and sweeteners , as well as swine and limasters .
The last hour of the disease is also accompanied by the popular name of a litre of burnt @-@ up disease .
Children can undergo hepatitis without disease phenomena .
The various types of household incineration can only be determined on the basis of laboratory research data .
Alpatitis may turn to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without disease phenomena , which means that man may not know anything about his or her dangerous illness .
Mr Kuelar points out various forms of hepatitis and describes their culmination in greater detail .
A hepatitis virus is spread from a disease to humans and infects us when we eat contaminated food or drink water , via pigs , from infected people &apos;s emissions to hands and orders on foodstuffs , soils , objects , contact and the consumption of drugs .
A hepatitis was carried out by family members and carers , people suffering from chronic liabilities , sex people with infections , sex men with men , drug users , countries with hepatitis A .
Contamination can be prevented by vaccinations , in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling a lot and at risk of hepatitis A .
In addition , it is important daily compliance with hygiene requirements : To wash or disinfect hands , before using food , to wash all fruit and vegetables .
The hepatitis virus is disseminating the disease when it comes to dealing with man &apos;s blood , injection of drugs , therapeutic treatment , augmentation , use of blood @-@ contaminated meters ( toothmeters , pregnancy means ) , use of donating blood , sex with hepatio @-@ hepatitis sufferers as well as infpatitis sufferers .
Drug cells , the sex partners of the infected person , sex men with men , newborn mothers of infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police officers , as well as passengers visiting countries with hepatitis B high diseases .
In order to prevent hepatitis , it is possible to vaccinate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vaccinate people who belong to the risk group , as well as people suffering from chronic pay , HIV infections , sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes .
( B ) hepatitis other preventive measures are : Refrain from the use of xenophole hygiene and manbal devices , other sharp devices and needles and systalstalles , prophytoisation and augiliation , as well as the use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection or the prevention of sexual risk .
Vaccination against hepatitis V in Estonia is part of the National immunisation Scheme and free of charge for children .
Hepatitis C viruses spread when dealing with man &apos;s blood , when it comes to injection of drugs , therapeutic treatment , augmentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated meters , donor blood blood , hepatitis bullet person in sex and hepatitis disease to animals / newborn babies .
The Hepatitis Hepatitis @-@ infection is accompanied by therapeutic drugs , sexual partners of infected human beings , sex men with men , newborn mothers of infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , health care , rescue workers and police officers , people with HIV infections , and passengers travelling to countries with hepatitis C countries .
Prevention of hepatitis C is : Refraining from the use of xenophole hygiene and manbal devices , other sharp devices and systalstalles , prophytoisation and augiliation , as well as the use of condoms in the event of a risk of infection .
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C .
D hepatitis contamination is caused by the hepatitis D virus , which goes much further in the presence of the hepatitis B virus .
As a result , Dhepatitis Bhepatitis infections , combined with hepatitis B or superinfants , occur on chronic hepatitis B sufferers .
Hepatitis viruses are spread in contact with blood and other body liquids , contaminated needles , relatives and rarely infected animals .
The hepatitis hepatitis exposure tax is chronic hepatitis B infections and non @-@ hepatitis B people .
An effective preventive measure is vaccination against hepatitis B vaccines , which also protects people from HIV infection with hepatitis virus .
E @-@ hepatitis viruses spread by feudal means of drinking water and foodstuffs , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , donor blood , psychips and more infected animals .
Passengers may be infected with high levels of E hepatitis disease in countries .
Ehepatitis preventive measures include compliance with the hygiene requirements : To wash or disinfect hands after slaughter , prior to food preparation and eating , after hospital care .
Fruit and vegetables are washing ahead of consumption , avoiding eating little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption .
Even though , over the last few months , competitors tried four times to printing the Olympic winner , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Farah final hub took power and won 26.49.51 .
Mr Farah did not think for a long time , drawing the husband Tania and the children on the road after the finalists .
This was a special moment for me .
I very much support my family .
Being with them was wonderful , Farah said to the press .
Farah is focusing its fifth edition in London on the golden dump of 5 000 and 10 000 metres .
Everything is possible if there are religions in it .
In spite of the title , Ms Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connorm in Daam gold . Gustav Klimti Cup , Mr Bloch @-@ Baueri has an extraordinary story of &apos; the birth of one art at a much deeper than the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna .
But even more in history .
The inflammatory slope would have lost more influence on the attractive bandwidth , the narrowly subject would have had to have been put on the title .
At the moment , there would be some sort of two books : Gustav Klimti and his painting &apos; Daam gold &apos; for Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri , and a much greater and more comprehensive history of Honourable Jewish families and the German occupation , along with its aftermath in Austria .
The first third of the book will lead to a flourishing cultural life in the middle of Viin , who himself owed to the Austrian capital , can hardly imagine how life went anywhere more than a hundred years ago around Ringstrass , or how all its head was turned when the climate invaded .
The concentration of cultural characters in one of the richest cities of Europe , seeing the name familiar with in the book , was felt like a gram in a more cultural way .
However , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city in which there was untreated arson and the highest level of suicide in Europe does not add anything to development .
Or perhaps , however , every couple of paternalistic footballs also add colour to cultural life at the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna .
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
Nearly one in ten people in Vienna had a chance to live in Sajanditis .
Elderly parents were also newcomers in Vienna , but by the time that Arad married itself twice to open the Czech sugar magnaad Ferdinja Bloch and the customer for his famous paints , his father had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire .
However , Adelet the whole life that she belonged to did not lead to .
If you look at &apos; Daam gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that , at the end of a life , this kind of colless socialist virus was infected and dreamt of a trip to the Soviet Union .
For 1907 , when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband &apos;s luggage from Climate Kong , it was the last six @-@ minute painting maker in Vienna .
At that time , 4 000 kroons , a quarter of the price of a well @-@ established rural house , were paid at that time .
The fact that , in the case of a number of directories , there was a suspicion of a modelli of a master , was not intimidated by sugar magnaat .
As far as the deletion is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between modelli and the artist created in the course of their work continued until the end of life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connor - Daam gold .
Gustav Klimti Championship , Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri Corporree , an extraordinary story , &quot; Varrak 2016 , Aldo Randmaa , who translated English .
Shortly before the beginning of the work with Adelem , the climate had come to Ravenna San Vitale , and the investigators believe that it was precisely there that glorious mosaic countries from the Grand front , Theodorf , gave artists the idea of making a golden portfolio known from Adeledeledelede as a mosaic .
At the same time ( between 1907 and 1908 ) , the climate presented its &apos; Daam gold &apos; in Vienna in 1908 , was born one of the golden terrestrials .
Art historians did not notice the similarities of two women .
What about nature is Hitler ?
&quot; I think to remember my friend Mr Klimmer , I am obliged to make him publicly available to the public , &quot; said Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer , a few years after the departure of an artist ( Klimt died in February 1918 ) to the Director of the Belvedere Museum and he wanted their families to go together to museums .
Six years prior to the death penalty , there had been a flight ree made by Mr Klimer .
He also asked her husband to leave her two sports courses and four Gustav Klimti &apos;s landscapes to the Austrian Galeri in February 1925 .
In his words , she asked Mrs Mariana and Mr Luda for her sisters .
One year after the end of the &apos; Austrian Mona &apos; climate , Viin Kacarriart de Akademine , 17 @-@ year @-@ old Adolf Hitler had been trying to get through the Code .
Even though Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ Semitism is sometimes seen as a result of the fact that Jewish professors did not accept him in the academine , none of his culminants were actually Jews .
In any case , the role of the Austrian Galeri , referred to in Mrs Christ , had changed considerably by 1939 , which had become essential for finding decent work from the rich Jewish art collectors in Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal artistic musicians also served some work at home , but not that of the climate .
Sixty years after the nineteenagers &apos; arts , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute began between the Austrian Government and Bloch @-@ Bauer heirs .
It should just be noted at this point that , if the &apos; Snovel &apos; is seen in Belvedere Castle in Vienna , the &apos; Daam gold &apos; portrayed by Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer must be tracked to New York Neue Galeri .
And , before the Vienna War , to read the aforementioned book .
Even if you do not plan to look at the climate &apos;s work , because at least my emotion , following the closure of the book , the subject of Nazis and Jews was sold more than USD 135 million over the mamal and modell Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer .
Therefore , not so much cabin , but rather a matribal fate - and a very moving story .
There was a great deal to facilitate the focus on events on the work done at the beginning of the book by the relatives of Bauots .
17 @-@ year @-@ old swimming in Canada was very close to Estonia .
In eating , gold was very close to the personal flambles of its own 200 m glue glue flooding at 2.16.62 .
The Tippmark dates back to the 17 @-@ year @-@ old festival of Canadian jewellery championship 2.16.58 , the Priit Aavik Ujugation blog .
Gold finally escaped the A @-@ finalists of a decade .
In the Finally , he went through his distance to 2.15.76 and achieved a good 7th seat with a new , high level of excellence .
Alina Kendziorn of Estonia ( 2.15.13 ) left the Golf to split a little over half a second .
In Estonia , gold rose all the time , with its latest personal peak mark being the fifth anniversary of Estonia .
A young hope for the future lies at 100 m , 200 mm and 400 m in balfire in Canada , and 200 mm and 400 m in bunkering .
Last week in Toronto , there was the Canadian championship of jewellery , and gold made a successful start there too .
She won 200 mm in baltuous shuttling with a silver medal of 2.03.22 .
So quickly , it was swamped as a distance campaigner last in 2008 .
In Estonia this distance has only been extended more quickly than Estonia &apos;s record wines , Elina Parkika .
In Canada , a vibrant champion won a top 56.66 of the new Estonian season with 100 mm vouchers .
For example , she has been distanced for just one century more quickly by her grandmother , Kertu ly Alnek .
He arrived at another 100 m in the open exchange of theatre swimming to 1.03.69 .
At half a long distance , he won only the seventh seat when he sleep at 2.17.31 p.m. .
Gold is presently leading up to four different distances in Estonia .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics insured teeth
The holiday season is in hand - it is also a nonsense for the President of the United States , Donald Trul .
However , since the Trump has so far been one of the President who took out one of the most holiday days , the critics are wearing teeth .
According to reports by the United States VIS and the CNN , the President intends to have 17 @-@ day leave in a static golf club in Bedminsteris located in New Jerseys .
Although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , opponents of Trumpi have been speaking for a few weeks .
What they are doing is throwing too much out to the Olympic Games .
It is precisely that the President is entitled to spend a weekend in his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey in cotton .
By the way , Mr Trump has not cleaned the President for his 196 working day .
George W. Bush , for example , was able to have 67 days on this holiday , with Barack Obama half less than the Trump , but only 21 days .
However , it tends to foolish things quickly .
Ten days after he became President , when he received the Trump , he said , &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , that there would be no time left for him to leave , because so much needs to be done .
Three years ago , he also expressed his outrage at Barack Obama &apos;s holidays .
On Twitter , the current President wrote : &apos; While Obama is on holiday , plays golf , the brakes and the jässist concerts are going on , journalists in exile are pulling their heads out &apos; .
According to officials of the White House , 17 @-@ day golf club visit pollen does not feature in a segment .
Instead , it is officially referred to as &apos; working leave &apos; , during which Trul does not have the time to read the Olympic Games or for other sporting activities .
In addition , there had to be a second reason for working leave .
It is precisely that there will be a change in the western prison of the White House , which is why all staff had to leave it .
In the West Bank there will also be Ovalker and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not believe that any one of you would like to be in the West in August if there are 38 degrees and no conglomerates , &quot; said Lindsay Walters , the white house spokesperson , who stressed that the President would continue to work during his leave .
Where President Trump is going to spend 17 days , you get an idea of video .
Blocking critics on Facebook do not apply to public office if you do not tolerate voters &apos; criticism .
The father of our country knew so much about disadvantaged media coverage .
The Americans loved Mr Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to bull him for everything , from internal politics to his political principles .
Of course he was annoyed by the criticism .
However , he did not make his critics quiet .
Because , in 1783 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and , in darkness and silence , we could be hijacked by sheep . &apos;
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan , who will have to work harder to do more in Washington .
At least 450 people who expressed their views on their official Facebook page have been blocked and removed from their offices .
And at the beginning of the week , the American Union for the Freedom of Citizens ( American Civil Nations Union ) addressed him to the courts for this reason .
The officials of the Kuberner &apos;s office paved the action empty and web commentates burnt in the counter @-@ reaction style &apos; who is interested ? &apos;
&quot; It is just Facebook , &quot; many said .
That counts , however .
And this is particularly important when it comes to honey such as Hogan .
It is an astonishingly popular Republican pub in an overwhelmingly democratic state .
His approval percentages are the second highest ranking among the country &apos;s 50 Governor .
Hogan is not a reactive sight .
It has led the state firmly and remains strictly firm on its principles .
In addition , she has used her as a major tool for communicating with her constituents quite deliberately on Facebook , for example , by presenting his or her wool head , for the first time after the chemical waste .
Therefore , a public forum with a formal label , managed by the staff who pay taxpayers &apos; dollars , is unnecessary and , ultimately , dangerous .
Hogan &apos;s press representative , Amelia Chess , defended in an interview given to Washington Posselt the behaviour of the Governor , arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderecasting .
It is too easy , however , to taste the picture of Internet browsing online , sub @-@ prime workers or people full of hatred .
The post spoke to a number of people who were blocked by Hogan .
And that is precisely what they are really the people who interact with their elected leaders : The user , the owner of the company and the pastor , and not Internet controls .
They have all said that their comments were respectable , thought @-@ out and not ropaste at all .
Pastor quoted the Bible in his post , urging the Khogan Catholic movement .
A lawyer from Marylan , Bowie , Lakshmi Sarma Raman , did not instigate hatred , but rather hate crimes .
&quot; Let me put it politely that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; he wrote the editorial news story in his country .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that how many people comment on the same subject , some of them call it an indifferent collective effort instead of acknowledging that it is a great deal of concern for citizens . &quot;
Others would probably call &apos; public support &apos; what the Governor &apos;s office called &apos; targeted spam attack &apos; .
The age of Facebook makes it easy to reconcile messages by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments .
It is much cleaner than before when it came to sending out workers to do the same , so that they aggregate newspapers with critical headlines and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent .
However , that is exactly what is happening now , just digitally .
Mr Hogan is not the first public official criticised for making Facebook and other social media toothless .
President Trumpi has accused Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter .
One of the first key judgments on this matter was made last week in Virginia .
Mr James C. Cacheris , the US civil servant , decided in Alexandria that Mr Loudouni &apos;s Board of supervisors violated the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the voter on his Facebook page .
In Ktuckys ACLU on Facebook and Twitter he also visited Matt Bevinit ( R ) .
This should not be so difficult .
There was a similar impact on affordable postal costs in Washington than on the Internet .
Between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers and anonymous writers stunned the way in which he led .
And even then , Washington had to deal with anonymous controls .
People wrote letters to the newspapers from pseudo @-@ unionyms such as Juricola , Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , grappling the decisions of Washington .
According to historical documents compiled in the framework of the Web @-@ based George Washington magazine magazine , he burned his cabinet with petitions criticising his views on twinning , trade and shipping agreements with Britain .
However , it did not force them to remain silent .
Freedom of expression , differences of opinion and debates are fundamental pillars of our country .
And proper management means accepting it .
Mr Ronan Rafferty hopes of the comfort of Renaissance Cclub &apos;s home territory
The former President of Europe , Ronan Rafferty , hopes of comfort over the next three days of East LoER , Renaissance Club golf courses taking place 25 .
In the run @-@ up to last year in the vicinity of Archerfield Linony , the Northern Ireland , which was in the vicinity of the last year , headed by Mr Paul Ealissance , has staged into a new place of operation , and is playing the role of the founder of the club and executive leader , Jerry Sharid , instead of the exclusion .
&quot; I saw Renaissance Club built , and now we can see how the club is blowing in full glory , &quot; said Rafferty .
&quot; Players see the path in their best shape ; it is in an excellent state .
Jerry has done an excellent job in setting up this place .
She is a keen supporter of golf games and proud of what has been achieved here .
This will allow an excellent presentation of the path . &quot;
Ingan ever looks forward , for the first time , to defending the title , even though the man has won both European Toubon and the European challenge Touril during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; This sends a very special feeling , &quot; said Sethportis , a committed player .
&quot; I was unable to defend my Extremadura Orange , because it was taken away from my competition calendar one year after my victory .
It is mathematical to come back to this chicken .
This is an excellent place to play a golf .
I remember the memories of last year , for myself and for my wife , Mrs Sharon , last year &apos;s victory was a special one .
It was a very special period that we will always bear at the heart . &quot;
Gary Orr will return to the competition once again on his country &apos;s soil , who joined the European Works Agency later this year , when he became 50 .
This is his first event in Scotland since the participation of Aberdeen Bank in 2013 .
&quot; It is always a little more significant to play at home , &quot; said Helensburgh man Orr .
&quot; Denmark did well , but at the same time it was interesting to add .
Once again , I have had tremendous enjoyment and quite a decent golf game .
I am pleased that things are going on so far . &quot;

Poverty and death of Indonesia in gold @-@ stricken areas
When Barina Degei is preparing dinner , he does not use lead .
He seldom uses the boy .
Indonesia &apos;s resistance , in the capital city of the Municipality of Papua Paniai , places its house in the house of the puppet in the local language , in the direct replacement of the bar to be invited .
In half an hour &apos; time there will be a fire in the dared sludge , and there will be an eagerness to bury hands .
Degei is silenced from the mud to Peru and , at the same time , it is doing its daily homework , for example , washing washing the water of crafts coming from a nearby sex .
It plays a role in an unbroken room .
Since she is a mother of four women , she has not been allowed to take care of any possessions .
Polügaamia is commonplace here on May .
Late work , however , may be dangerous for the vast majority of Luxembourgster men to be unemployed , and many of them drink hard , and there are still soldiers here .
&quot; No one dares to walk around after 5 a.m. in the village , &quot; he says .
This is a rare pill in Papua mäki , a former Dutch colony which entered Indonesia in 1968 following a referendum which forced only 1 026 older people to vote hand in front of troops .
In the direction of moving towards a rapid Yakarta government , which liberated the Dutch people from the supremacy of power , it will continue to keep the region under strong control by holding off foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pope and Western Pope , so independent Papua New Guinea remained eastern of the island .
In order to be able to do so , the majority is both remote and abandoned ; in order to arrive here , 90 minutes from the capital of the province of Jayapuru to Nabimel and then through a 5 @-@ hour journey with a rental car .
There is no public transport .
The city of approximately 19 000 inhabitants is made up of columns surrounded by carmbs and covers lainous iron rockets , which have been transformed into different ruins .
Very few indicators have taken the road here , not to mention journalists , nor have there been almost any foreigners here .
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries , Mrs Mee Pago &apos;s paints were marathon with the name of Tamee .
There were other changes as well .
&apos;We were not accustomed to wearing such clothes , &apos; says Degei by referring to your paperwork club , the fire on the plug , and the pigmeat .
&quot; Prior to that , we were only wearing a plant cow . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
But it is also Indonesia &apos;s golden land .
Just 100 km away from Paniao , which is a mountainous province with about 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey , Grasberg is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , which is owned by Fbetreport McMoran , a company operating in Phoenic .
Approximately USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copies were extracted from the Fre report in 2015 alone .
What is more , it will be possible to boast of supplies of raw wood , worth an estimated USD 78 billion .
However , these riches are the source of the suffering of boats , as they result in the stifling presence of a powerful Iranian army .
The New York Times study in 2005 showed that the Fre @-@ export paid about USD 20 million to local troops and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to USD 150 000 to one of the victims .
The attempts made by speculators to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden hall , and are seamlessly betrayed .
According to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1959 and thousands more have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the Venezuelan army .
According to the Asian Committee on Human Rights , there was a massive killing of genocide in the mountains in the 1970s .
Last year alone , more than 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police in the region .
The 2016 report of Birsbane &apos;s Grand Archbishop will contain testimony to the atrocities committed in the previous year , such as extrajudicial executions , torture ( rape and electric blowers are particularly common according to another report ) and brutal repression of peaceful protests .
&quot; It is difficult to read the number of victims , because such incidents take place every week , &quot; says Andreas Harsono , a researcher of Human Rights Watch , Indonesia .
There have been even stronger blockades because Papua natural resources have led to the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demographics are changing , as there are black economic migrants coming from many people in Indonesia , Jaava , Kalimantan , Sumatra and Sulaws .
Popular canteens are sold in the ballocks as a chickens and mired vegetables in gado @-@ gado @-@ gado , which are serted along with ground level .
They cannot compete with them .
&quot; Migrants started selling heroes and vegetables more cheaply than local boats in the traditional market , &quot; says Androulla Kroes born in Paniai , 24 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ olds who worked in the province &apos;s capital , Jayapplause .
&quot; Syrians Birmama @-@ Mama &#91; women &#93; painting boats are therefore losing their market share . &quot;
The President of Indonesia , Joko Widodo , who is well known among the people as Jokow , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to deal with these inequalities and breaches of human rights in Pope .
The former pub won 27 constituencies , including Paniai , on its way to the presidential Palace of Jakarta .
However , there has been very little change in the Pope , and the local people feel cheated .
&quot; Our hearts are broken because , in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jokow in the expectation that he fulfils our hopes with regard to the restoration of justice , &quot; says apprenticeships .
In fact , only two months after Jokow took office in October .
On 7 December 2014 , eleven children in the Tyrotail stunned on Christmas when two Indonesian soldiers woke blindness .
Missing children said to them that they should put the lights in place .
According to what the local pastor Yavedt Tebai said insulted one of the soldiers on their tone and returned later with four soldiers .
According to the victims and spectators , in the words of &apos; drink @-@ driving soldiers &apos; , children were hunted up by children and deceived with their guns .
Then one of the soldiers was shot among children .
One child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yulianus Yeimot , was so brutally beaten that he fell into the home .
A couple of hours later , a close electoral Commission building was burnt down , and the next day things went further .
Some 1 000 young people came together in order to claim justice to the local police department and the military management centre .
They carried mee pago a waita @-@ tantantsu in which poultry songs were burnt around and buried .
Some of the protesters started to lecture the police and the military .
&apos;When a crowd shows resistance more than three times , let them down , &apos; it was stated in a formal document , which has seen a magazine for delays but has not been issued to local media publications .
Kego Koto , the mother city of Kego Koto , Yeremias Kayme ( 56 ) , felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking the public to go home .
No one had the will to listen .
&quot; Returning me to the left , I was suddenly shot dead , &quot; he said , in a magazine magazine magazines , at a treasure station in his German colours .
We still do not know who the fire was , but it says it came from soldiers &apos; rigs in the month .
&quot; There was a lot of people , a dozen cows , &apos; add him .
Alfius Youw , a local man , was shot three times , according to a councillor .
&quot; Let me wait to him and have looked through his body to make sure that it is with him , &quot; the magazine was born in Yohanes , who uses only one name , like many characters .
&quot; I have seen that he is dead ... Snovel lew . &quot;
Dr Yotje Mende , Chief Police officer , said to the reporters that he was subject only to the security of his department because it was attacked .
&quot; We need to protect ourselves if we are threatened with killing , &quot; said Vice @-@ President Pudjo Sulistiyo , the spokesman for the Police Service , in 2015 .
&quot; This is a matter of life and death . &quot;
According to Human Rights Watch , five young protesters were killed and many injured .
The news about the killings arrived in Jakartail only on the next day .
Three weeks later , Jokowi Jayapuras held a passionate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses to be dealt with by the Pope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
Security minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would put in place an alternative mechanism to deal with human rights crimes .
However , the excuses followed almost immediately .
&quot; Most crimes took place a long time ago .
Some of them took place in the 1990s and in the early 2000s .
The point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
However , when he talked about the magazine on 5 June in Jakartas , Wiranto withdrew his words by saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism to deal with complaints in Pope .
Instead , he said : &apos; Everything will be resolved by law &apos; .
Mr Wiranto , who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in relation to more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Pope , including what happened in Panian .
The families of the victims of Paniai adopted such claims with gloom .
&quot; I have been intercepted four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Yohanes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
He says that there will still be fear for years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I am afraid that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I will be shot . &quot;
His brother d Yacobus confirmed his opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid of this incident .
He said that he was beaten by the army after helping to bury four victims .
&quot; I had to be looked for by the army after burying the bodies , &quot; he says .
Executions have not stopped .
On Tuesday , the inhabitants of the Egyptian police were shot in the Paniai neighbouring District in Deiyais .
One person was killed and 17 wounded , including children , when he went into a war between the inhabitants of the village and the head of the construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to hospital .
The male people , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ravianus Douw , who drowned to close rivers when trying to fish , died on their way to hospital .
The recent inhabitants of the villages protested at the construction site before the company office .
According to the police , the people of the villages were lecturing policemen to death , which the latter responded to with alerts .
However , according to local reports , mobile Britons ( Iranian military police ) started to shoot at the people by killing one person .
&quot; We were in great panic , we are afraid of revenge , &quot; said Times 29 @-@ year @-@ old Domingda Badii , who lives close to the hospital and saw those who were injured .
&quot; I have deceived myself in my house for two days . &quot;
Mr Deiyai &apos;s Parliament has called for police officers involved to be held responsible and police mobile Britons withdrawn from the area .
Pania has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the metals , moni , dans and dammal tribes living in Papua haljendaeva .
Many of them have signed up to the army of insurgents who , according to themselves , defend the rights of boats by orally carrying out attacks and kidnappings among Iranian soldiers .
Some VPL leaders come from Pania , including Tadius Yog and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
In response to this , over the last few years , under the pretext of defending the sovereignty of a state , the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
Some of them will never happen again .
Among the people of Papua Islands , Panians are known as &apos; tragic forgotten place &apos; .
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction .
The small rice that is sold in the majority is too expensive to buy locally .
Leib is equally inaccessible .
The people themselves cultivate all their food , mainly the Bahá , as well as a bit of fruit and vegetables .
Farming is the work of women , each of whom is able to care for four or five ruins .
They usually hold most of the receipt to the family ; the rest is sold on the local market .
Only 10 000 Indonesian premises ( 75 cents ) will be paid by the 10 Baha .
Over time , economic inequalities have been exacerbated between heavy boats and new migrants , who have arrived a great deal from the opening of new routes at Nabire airport .
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants .
Speculators themselves often do not have the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&quot; Young people are not interested in leaving the village because there is neither jobs nor money , &quot; says John Gobai , President of the Paniai tribal Council .
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from the Pope .
In addition , there will be severe restrictions on foreign media .
At the beginning of this year , French journalists , Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp , were extradited because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , even though they had a rare film permit .
Human Rights Watch , Vice @-@ President of the Asian department , Pichm Kine , said that the election pledges made by Jokow have not been implemented to lift the restrictions on reports aimed at promoting transparency and development .
&quot; In Indonesia , journalists attempting to report from the most troubled provinces in the East and from the Western Pope face new threats to the rejection and blacklist of Madagascar , &quot; he said in a statement .
The absence of a satellite view of the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to its immediate neighbours .
In March , six of the countries of the Pacific , Bahrain , Nauru , Belau , Tupain , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands alike , urged the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate &apos; various large @-@ scale crimes &apos; , including the shooting of Paniai .
These same countries have historically supported VPL as well .
Arrmanatha Nasir kiss , spokeswoman at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , withdrew charges from the group , saying to the press : &apos; In Indonesia , democratic order and freedom of the press are still in force , so it would be difficult to bury evidence of cases against human rights &apos; .
The local people want more foreign governments to heed .
When the Dutch official delegation visited Jayapurat on 4 May , the country &apos;s Ambassador for Human Rights , Mr Van Bartiga , the local people intercepted the meeting , but wanted to be anonymous , according to the source , to remain silent , urging : &apos; We want freedom &apos; .
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019 , but boats do not believe that they will vote again in favour of Jokow .
&quot; Jokow is a man with good intentions , but surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai , &quot; says Hobai , President of the tribal Council .
He wants to give Jokow the impression that , in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly living under the threat posed by predatory military forces , they are suffering misery as a result of poor education and health services .
According to Mr Gobai , the people of Paniai , just like other boats , regard their voice to Jokow as the debt that they have to pay .
&quot; They do not need money , they want justice , &quot; he says .
In spite of threats and intimidation , the families of the victims of the fire in Paniai were able to cope with yet another symbolically controversial response by Yemen , which swept one of the victims dead into the police department and the army in line with the country in question .
Knowing that justice can never be put on its feet , they at least do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; One of our family members has been killed , &quot; says Yacobus with a shot .
&quot; What else can we do ? &quot;
Ney Dubai Torch &apos;s pilots came under the carpet for the second time .
On Friday , one of the world &apos;s biggest residential storms in Dubai was eaten , forcing hundreds of people to flee this 337 metre height and a 79 @-@ stroke building .
This is the second fire , which has been ravaged for just two years from a high level called &apos; Turin &apos; case , or the Thimvikur one .
The building was evacuated , none of the injuries were reported and there were any direct causes of fire .
&quot; We sleep and threw up the fire sub @-@ divisions and people &apos;s fears .
Let us wait for the tour and it took about 10 minutes for us to get down to the 50th order , &apos; said to Reuterans one of the people who called themselves George .
According to Dubai &apos;s civil protection officers , fire @-@ fighters were also deleted at around 4 o &apos;clock in the morning at local intervals ( 00.00 GMT ) and hijacked the building .
The government said that they were working to provide shelter to those affected .
This incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on high seas worldwide .
A study carried out in the aftermath of March 2015 by the Turin Governing Board was found to suffer the greatest damage caused by kidneys such as decretical panels and insulation on external premises .
The British police have said that they believe that the insulation of the London Grenportfolio Tower , together with its ambassadors , could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that took place there in June , killing almost 80 people .
See : These phones are likely to receive sales cards in the autumn
There will be a waste time for the electronic filters because , then , phone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia Premium came to sale in the spring , and new hitt telephones are expected in the autumn .
According to the Tele2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Semother , today &apos;s flagships are characterised by an innovative design , an outrageous shandnner , the serser @-@ servani 4K resolution , a screen and a ultra @-@ fast process .
Samsung Galaxy S8 , in the world of technology , was of great importance , which has also come to the forefront of Estonia &apos;s smartphones .
The autumn will allow clergy sufferers to fly even more haste , more resistance , more quality cameras and greater water and customs security .
He added that rumours show that you can already speculate and predict four top @-@ level models , which are likely to conquer today &apos;s sales tables .
These four &quot; smart phones top &quot; models will be available to boys in the autumn of this year .
Expected iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach boys by mid @-@ September .
However , there is a great deal going on to hear what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do .
If iPhone 7 did not give rise to significant differences between iPhone 6s , Apple &apos;s 10th birthday is expected that the new model will be completely different from previous ones .
There has been talk of four colours : Black , White , Sweep and chromium .
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers all of the telephones , has been lost at home , and fingerprints have been built into the screens .
Mr JonyIve , Director of Apple &apos;s design , is calling for the new iPhone model to look like a glass .
There has also been talk of an iPhone version .
In addition to the head @-@ up , the unmanageable charging and even higher @-@ quality camera , we can expect a faster A11 process .
It will certainly be one of the most expected smart phones of the year .
The outsourcing of the new model Galaxy Spring 8 will begin on 23 August .
There have been a lot of rumours about what new Galaxy Plan 8 will look like .
Admittedly , even more business users are meant , and S pen allows even greater functionalities .
The telephone fund should have two cameras , one of which is lainurt and one with a narrow view to teleobjects .
At the moment , no one yet knows what it is possible for the two taboos , but in any case it is the first test of Samsung , which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8 in terms of quality .
However , we look forward to 23 August .
Although Nokia has sold sales this year with three smart phones headed by Nokia 6 , their flagship vessel - Nokia 8 - is still missing on 16 August .
We look forward to 5.3 screens stretching from scratch and ultra @-@ fast Qualcomm Sscarce dragon to 835 processes and more durable batteries .
In the case of Nokia , there is also talk of aluminium corps and significant levels of water and customs security IP68 .
Similarly to Samsungone , Nokia &apos;s new model has two flambles of rotation , an optimist produced by the company Zeiss .
Once Sony &apos;s fixed flag has been XZ Premium so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smartphones with even more innovative functionalities will be added .
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than XZ Premium , but at least as good or better .
There has been speculation about the new Sony model that its screen is at least hot .
What the reality is , we can already see right now , because traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flag vessel at IFA , which will take place between 1 and 6 September this year .
According to transcripts leaked by telephone calls , Trump of Mexico pressed for payment of the border wall .
The Washington post unveiled telephone calls between US President Donald Trumpi and Mexican and Australian Heads of State .
On 27 January , Enrique Pena Nieto , the Mexican President , went on a telephone call to put an end to public proclamation that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
The American President warned him about his public condemnation of the wall , saying : &apos; You must not say this to the press &apos; .
The Trubunch made a commitment in his presidential campaign to build a wall on the southern borders of the United States and the age of making Mexico pay for this project .
Transcriptors were also published in his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turmes , revealing intense debate .
Trump said to Turunele that the agreement whereby the United States takes refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; nervous &apos; and &apos; rum &apos; . He stated that the agreement that was made during the Obama Administration would give him the impression &apos; guide &apos; because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
The Trump ended the speech by telling the Turku that &apos; this was the day &apos;s most unpleasant speech &apos; .
The Supreme Court did not take a complaint against the city of OC MRP Liine in the event that the city of Tartu rejected their offer for bus and coach transport between July 2019 and 2029 .
This is a letter rejected by Anfour Aputin Aputin , Head of the Tartu Civil Service , because the offer did not meet the requirements .
This is a tender for intra @-@ Tartu city public coach transport between 1.07.2019 and 30.06.2029 .
MRP city Liine referred to the Supreme Court of Justice to the District Court ruling .
The Supreme Court did not act .
Even though many people in the social media complain that their night is disturbed by the clip at the Weekise Festival , and the entire city is full of screens , there are also a great many who do not have to say any bad words about a permanent festival .
I am even positively surprised that the brakes were so polite in the shop .
I did not see any misrepresentation or courtesy .
Even so , I saw &apos; , there is a wonderful wave .
After all , it is wonderful to see that there will be pitfalls , there will be , and there will be joy , of Persia , which has remained like winter , &apos; he will gladly add .
There will not be a wave of flambles coming from Ranny .
If , when living in a central city , he was still listening that music is being played on beaches , then the music has not yet arrived at his homework .
&quot; However , I hope I hear , &quot; he will gladly say .
Agnes , too , who talked with a hand , tells us that the Grand Festival is rather a good thing for Perter - it will make a significant contribution to the turnover of local merchants .
Furthermore , it welcomes the fact that so many houses have come to the visitors &apos; capital in the summer .
The woman of Peolives does not matter .
Even though I am no longer on the coast , it is fortunate that rand has revived .
And it is good that the people are moving , and this has already been the case three times &apos; , a woman says .
The first time was probably a little worse .
Then perhaps there were complaints , he is wondering .
However , what he said to be happening on the ground is normal for the capital cities of the summer .
&quot; This Weekise is a very good prophmo for our little city , says Harri , who is on the park .
Life and möll have also failed to bury his elurtm .
But what about it ?
We should all pull together .
Think about how it would be better to communicate between nations .
After all , music does not mislead a man .
This does not happen , although I live near it .
&quot; Good people can save , and there is no pause at all , &quot; he talks .
Visitors coming to Slovenia are , according to him , courtesy .
&quot; Of course , they have joined them a little , but young people are young people and heroes God - give but be people and we can do it ! &quot;
Painful residents have moved away from somewhere by then , whether to relatives or to acquaintances .
&quot; In general , however , the festival has a positive impact on life - people like such melu , talking with relatives as Tiina .
His family , too , does not sweep the Festival , even though in the past year it went even further than it did today .
Last summer , we heard more .
We live outside the city itself , that in fact there is a long way away from the River Perter , &apos; he talks .
Pearson cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividends in order to revitalise business
Beijing Pearson , a British education company , said on Friday that 3 000 more jobs will be cut and reduced by 72 % , thereby launching yet another restructuring programme to deal with business @-@ threatening pressures .
These jobs , which , according to the CEO John Fallon , are highly likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , add to the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring process .
Pearson announced in May his plan to cut expenditure by another GBP 300 million ( USD 394 million ) under the third expenditure reduction programme in order to try to revitalise businesses that have been hit by the transition to high @-@ speed digital learning .
The company , which agreed last month to sell the participation of Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann , said that their expectation for a year had not changed since the sales income increase was announced to GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year .
On Sunday there will be plenty of sow in the rainforests .

Attack in Kabul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
Suicide bombers , according to officials , attacked military convoys in the capital of Afghanistan , Kabul , killing one NATO soldier and injuring a number of others .
According to NATO &apos;s statement , five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
There were also three civilians who died in an incident in the city of Qarabaghi , according to local reports .
This bombing is the latest acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herati mosque attack on Tuesday .
On Monday two people were killed by suicide bombers near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul .
According to NATO &apos;s statement , there was an explosion on Thursday evening , when a joint patrol Afghan army was attacked with &apos; man @-@ made explosives &apos; .
According to the statement , everything has been injured in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital in Bagram airport .
According to Correspondents , the Taliban and group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic state in Chad , are a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabagh , NATO in Baghdad .
According to the United Nations , at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital city .
At the end of July , the car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people , mainly in the Shi &apos;être .
According to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
On 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the central city , which has resulted most of all in a military assault in the country since US @-@ led forces failed the Taliban in 2001 .
This violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the President of the United States , Donald Trump , is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country &apos;s military forces and the police .
According to experts , the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Arias Ghan .
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the regulation following sharks .
The United States Environment Protection Agency ( United Nations Environmental Protection Agency ) annulled the decision to delay the adoption of the Obama regulation , which obliges states to limit emissions from flying , one day after 15 states referred the Agency to the courts on account of its conduct .
The EPA announced a decision to proceed late on Wednesday 2015 , saying that it demonstrates the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; We believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our national partners and listen to them , &quot; said Scott Pruitt , head of the EPA .
The Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the level of ostility content in Peru , which measured pollution in the various parts of the country in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year by one year , in order to meet the highest air quality standard .
Fifteen mainly democratic states , together with the Colombian community , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President Donald Trumpi &apos;s government has attempted to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama .
However , these efforts have led to reactions among the groups of democrats and nature conservation who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on people &apos;s health .
It says on the EPA website that the breathing of ozone @-@ containing air &apos; could reduce the employability of Copts and increase the risk of dying of respiratory diseases , such as asthma .
Cigarettes in Germany may have pipes .
German swine and pigs can come from pipes , as heavy rainfall threatens the yields of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union , Banimal berg writes .
This year , it can be said that weeks before harvesting can mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry can only feed animals .
&quot; The quality of content is far worse than that of the bubble and worse than in 2015 , &quot; Agravis Raiffeen &apos;s analysis , Mr Bernhard Nepal , said .
This year , up to 40 % of Germany &apos;s enthusiasm for animal feed , which comes from feed compared to the usual one , is predicted in Agratis .
German farmers , just like their European counterparts , have been exposed to any weather this year .
First of all , the winter was too dry .
Then came the cold spring , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
In July , Germany was hit by the storm , which has continued in August as well .
Many eyes have been placed on northern Germany , where the rain obstructs harvesting .
So far , only five per cent has been cleared up .
The majority in the region has not yet started harvesting , notified the local buyer of catches in Ceravis .
&apos;There are quite difficult days &apos; , Mr Frank Deckert Rendsburg , a senior trader in Ceravis , said .
Consistency in everything , that is to say , internal design of Finns
Caunis Nature plays a part in the internight of mesh homes , because , through big windows , Saimaa fishers will have equal views in a number ( life ) rooms .
At every step , our northern neighbours &apos; aspiration to create both harsher and perfect ( energy @-@ saving ) homes comes to an end .
The ability of Finns to use wood as construction and reconstruction materials , furniture and furniture is also worthy of identity and traceability .
Virgised techniques and smart solutions can be found both as a builder and ( home ) maker in pubs .
There , it is striking to note that black , white and grey collections , if they are supplemented by harvests and toxins , can be very frustrating .
Good ideas can go for another week , because the air will run until 13 August .
Suppliers and spices suggest that this kitchen is often copied .
The Ööl opposed today &apos;s line to Weekise Festival Balticen , and Martin Garrido did all he can to remember the last speaker .
The people were truly revolving when they took the floor - songs , hubs , tanks were stunned .
When lunch stopped , a common mastery of the Spanish city was dispersed .
Let us bring together the photographers that attempted our photographs within three days on the Weekise .
Of course you are some of them too , you are looking for yourself !
Müry Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation .
Mr Vasyl Lomachenko and Mrs Garcia , who are supposed to be on a collision course to face up to 66.7 kg in the boxing category for the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
They were at the ESPN office in LOS Angeleles , until Garcia , the unwinning World Boavian Council lightweight champion , walked off the other side of the corridor in order to welcome Lomachenkot , the World Bank Boеzationi sulgweight cheque .
Following a unanimous decision by Garcia , both combatants belong to the top of the weight table on Saturday in ShowTime , the former four @-@ time world champion , Adrien Broner .
Mrs Garcia extended her better hand and said : &apos; How is the summer going , the champion ?
I wish you luck . &quot;
Mr Lomachenko is defending his belts against Miguel Marriga on Saturday evening at 19 ESPN .
When a couple of photographs appeared , Lomachenko &apos;s mänejer , Eg Klimas , stated that there would be a &apos; perfect yardstick &apos; for opposing combatants .
&quot; I am a former consultant , &quot; said Garcia .
&quot; I called for Bronger &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 63.5 kg .
I want to move downwards .
And he has to move up to half the lightweight &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; , and then we can fight .
Games have asked for this .
So let us hurt them . &apos;
Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; The world needs this fight . &quot;
In the climate , it raised the question as to whether it should be worthwhile looking at it ; it forms part of its strategy to allow Lomachenkol to debate at the end of this year at 61.2 kg of class in order to make it possible next summer to meet with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 novans ) , which also has an interest in combating Jorge Linarese Linarese and Luke Campbelli &apos;s match winners , following their lightweight on 23 September .
&quot; Looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as fans have called for this confrontation , &quot; said Garcia later , saying that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial packages .
&quot; We are key players .
No other name can receive so much attention .
Whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Mrs Garcia said that she considers Lomachenkot to be a &apos; armed fighter &apos; , and that she could go to his desk on Saturday .
However , Lomachenko was modest in praising Garcia by saying that , in his opinion , three divisjon masters from Riverge saw it as &apos; very slow ; apologies , Maey ... you wanted this nodistant &apos; .
According to Garcia , the aim was to show the strength and then boast .
They both affirmed that they felt that the tension is increasing in order to challenge them .
&quot; This is a fight that looks forward to realisation .
No other confrontation arouses so much attention and noise .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Garcia .
Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters , and that is precisely what Maey said .
This will be a good fight . &quot;
What world events in Estonia are being moved ?
Soil was extended and issued quarterly more than 13 000 residence permits by the police and border control authority ( PPA ) for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work , study or family .
When , for example , soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 6702 foreigners , VIS was 4928 .
The services cannot say how many migrants will end up permanently staying in Estonia , but such an analysis will be drawn up by the Ministry of the Interior .
Ten years ago , nearly 500 Ukrainians sat to Estonia a year , in recent years , this figure will be close to 2 000 .
During the crisis in Ukraine , the number of applications for renewal increased dramatically , with 1087 people receiving fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , up from 675 in the previous year .
According to the statistical authority in Estonia , the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing most , with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia in excess of their generosity .
&quot; The Ukrainian community in Estonia has always been big and , due to difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that employment and learning opportunities should be sought from a country in which the community and many families are already in front of the family . &quot; Said Kristin Rammus , spokesman at the Ministry of the Interior .
The number of Ukrainian citizens who had fixed @-@ term residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens , even though in 10 years the longest @-@ term residence permits have been issued .
If Ukrainians come to work mostly here , then Russian citizens for family migration .
&quot; Given the historic Russian community here , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with the people living in Russia , &quot; said Helina Medal , an Internal Protection Academy .
&quot; If you look at where the nationals of Russia who have been licensed by Estonia have moved to live , Harjumaa is immediately Eastern Virgland , &quot; he added and pointed out that about 40 % of them have been married with the citizens of the European Union .
Soil was granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
At the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permits decreased instead .
&quot; Compensation is the result that , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested to settle permanently in Estonia , &quot; was explained by a press spokesperson at the Ministry of the Interior who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonian residency has remained rather stable for many years .
A new residence permit for Estonia to reside permanently can apply to foreigners who have lived here for at least three years from the previous year .
Its aim is to encourage the Silk stripping of people who have been adapted .
However , long @-@ term resident residence permits require five years , for example .
The extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased because of the new residence permit .
For example , soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years .
The Ukrainians will now be able to exchange work , and the Estonian state will no longer stop pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
This residence permit has become popular - applications were still made by holders of a grey passport ( 1029 ) , Russians ( 487 ) , Indians ( 54 ) and nigerans ( 36 ) .
A total of 1968 people were able to live in Estonia for the purpose of entry , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese .
In the first half of this year there is already a total of 1269 such applications .
In 10 years , surprisingly , Nigeria has become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residency .
When , in 2007 , three residence permits were issued to Finns , soil was 200 .
From Nigeria , you can learn lessons from these universities .
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular , for example , among Georgians , the Chinese and the Turks .
The number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen mostly thanks to learning games .
For them , too , there is the rule that , where a community has been set up , there will be others more easily , &quot; added Ramallah . &quot;
Over ten years , two people in Estonia have also moved , for example , from North Korea , just as much from Laos and Madagascar .
Ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four Uruguay .
If around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , it is about 0.46 % of the total population .
Even with the citizens of the European Union , migration remains close to about a per cent , &quot; the mafia commented that the figures are actually low .
A total of 14 822 people emigrated to Estonia according to the statistics office , 13 792 .
This means that immigration transcended migration for a second year .
The vast majority of entrants are Estonian citizens , but there are more of them among those who leave them .
That is why Estonia &apos;s citizens &apos; migration mystery with 2 000 people was in decline .
Estonians in particular migrate between Finland and Estonia .
Mammu Couture Princincssimde with tanks , weeds and flavours .
There is , however , a history for Mrs Tammeoru - old paints and defendants : &apos; I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire the thieves and crats of the old era .
If you take something stone , then you will study and learn about it every day .
It is a pleasure to find out .
A modern world of Couture can look like some alien , but the designer does not think so .
You yourselves decide how much soul your lives !
As a friend , as a whole , I am full of the stickers of the shark couture that I created .
Because nor is it his fault that he does not live in Hollywoos and does not go every day on a red whip ; he also wants to wear the most beautiful brokers , and he is suffering !
You yourself will be able to live your own special life !
An artist does not recognise the gap between heinous events and grey days .
It was this reasoning that put forward a plan to move high grades in Estonia to rural areas , between forests and fields , between people who often do not reach them .
For example , there has long been a presentation of a collectilation in comparison , in Jevening , and in the Bay of Poles , in which 45 mosques were carried out by the Royal defilee ( Queen ) .
There is often a hang in the city of Tallinn , with dignity , but there is more emotion elsewhere - slogans , bbavo , stand up , want to thank you .
A large part of the audience had to be heard just now , but now they are the fans of Mammu Couture .
If you overcome the expectations of the people , they will be delighted !
And I like the feeling that I am in my fashion like the summer .
Incidentally , we had a 50 @-@ metre bunch red carpet , a whole street full of stickers , it seemed that they would not come to an end .
Mrs Ashton also does not recognise the fashionable practice that nature has to be presented as a superimperialist superb , she brings fervent ordinary women with pleasure .
I often call on my own customers - they have always come with pleasure .
After all , this is a lax of experience , a beautiful piece of rubbish on the temple .
I am so sorry that I have never seen that I have never seen my own play , I am always behind the ground in order to be able , as a hopeless Spaniard , to put a last piece of meat on things .
My nervous would not allow a calm sight of the Chamber .
It is this kind of motto that Mrs Maria Maria Damanaki , who wants not only to play a representative role , but also to be involved in everything .
I have my sister in the core , most of the collections are carried out by myself .
I like the whole process in which you are playing with details to discover .
I am never far removed from my nature and I am not afraid of work .
It does not confine itself , but it is also a matter of injection , logistics , organisation , organisation - everything has to jump away from the days of a woman of a temperment .
For these hours of work , the fanatics will still have a great deal of work .
I cannot tell you when my working day is coming to an end , for me this is just a happy day !
I am still very lucky - it is like unstoppable happiness : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compliments .
It has been said a number of times that my brokers have a magy - they make themselves feel printed .
The guerrilorious treasure made by Mrs Ebadi for hearing overnight has long since remained a signal from Couture until now .
Martin Myrsep U18 boys : Weapons of Estonians were now turned against us .
The damage , the fairy tale , ran out .
The first thing came to an end was that we could not get round our tables .
And when so much difference comes in the table , there is nothing to do , &quot; said Estonia U18 corvpallipos 61 : 75 drop @-@ out to Britain , our only Korvpalte , BC Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsep .
Opponents took 28 requests from the south @-@ west , which led to so many more attacks .
Nor were we prepared to protect them aggressively and not to attack them , which created it .
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
In defence , however , they were able to hold their hands somewhere , and we could not combine them .
It brought the team down its feet .
There has been a better homework on opponents .
Myrsepa estimates that more tactical errors should have been made by Estonia in order to take up the anti @-@ missile season .
In the last quarter , we had a zero error , but opponents have already received a number of quick records .
Atlessness and density , which were our weapon at the alagropiturnir , all now turned against us .
Today , we did not have the power against their aggressiveness .
Myrrhenp remained satisfied with his negligence in Kalevis , Matthias Tastery .
Security in general can say good words about the whole team ; to date there has been a united shock .
It is a pity that such an aggressive response had not been met in the past .
Tass have always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but he seemed to have been tired - he has borne quite a heavy burden .
However , he made some of the fine gestures that I have seen before in trendars , adding guidance .
Horrendous figures : EM @-@ turnir , in the corvpallip of neps , threw less than 10 points at three quarters of EM @-@ turnim ...
U18 age classes do not apply only to a young man &apos;s formula B @-@ divisjon corvpallisigniir in Tallinn , she started in Dublin the day after yesterday .
However , and Estonia &apos;s play with Poland lagged in the area of anti @-@ refrigerators .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but even after the third quarter , the situation was 9 : 49 , or only in the last 10 minutes , opponents took their feet from the gas beet , and the period remained at 16 : 16 .
In both the first and the second quarter , Estonia threw 4 , the third point ...
At the same time , in the first two minutes , the Estonians caught two pieces of the first few minutes , and yet there were 25 pieces of play , then one yellow , and then a further 21 queues ...
Perhaps in almost half an hour there was one left out of 47 fingers .
In addition , 2 points came from the four looses .
There was a reasonable number , 12 .
At the end of the game there was 33 % in Poland and 13 % in Estonia ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , with 83 in Portugal having to be admitted on the opening day : 56 on the right .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement supplies .
Today , for a week in Tallinn , NATO arrived at a permanent mine attack group to complement vessels &apos; reserves and prepare for prospective practices .
In the course of a visit , ships are preparing for landing on the sea , thereby giving crews the opportunity to holiday on a daily basis .
Following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonia &apos;s waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations in search of historic exploits .
&quot; The participation of indigenous people in the NATO entity and the combined activities they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with alliances , &quot; said the chief captain Arto Reinland , the overseas fleet Commander .
As of 29 June , NATO will chair a permanent group of landslides from the Latvian Navy Captain , Gvido Laudups , who took over from a capter Johan @-@ Elias Seljab from Estonia at a ceremony in Riga .
LVNS Virsaitis , a Latvian naval force , has been designated as the group &apos;s flagships , which will also act as the group &apos;s manager .
During this semester , the Estonian navial mine hunters will also be part of an international unit .
As one of the four groups of vessels subject to NATO naval boards , NATO is a permanent group of primary responsiveness units that the Alliance can send to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - To 13 August , Pirita kooter will once again become a place where Birgitta Festival , launched 13 years ago by Maestro Er Kans , will be held down .
Earlier this year , Birgitta Festival will , according to hedge to Joosti ( 36 ) , be a beautiful , powerful and unprecedented leader in Tallinn .
&apos;Travieta &apos; and &apos; Tosca &apos; , balletilagic answers from Bolerost , Karlssonin , and there is also no shortage of own @-@ productions this time from Joseph Haydn &apos;s wonderful Orchestra , which led to the creation in 2015 . &apos;
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre replies .
It is higher than any music theatre in its normal form .
It is a festival that takes over power and never gets rid of it .
It is because the experience to which a listener receives in this superior and mysterious environment puts humanity in a brighter way and concerns human beings in a way that cannot be described .
At the risk , for the first year , Birgitta Festival is the art leader .
Did the Maestro Eri Kbabies &apos; shoes not feel a little big ?
Of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , there has been a lot of support for it .
In his direction , I was supported by a whole student career and also supported at the start of my diaphration career .
Perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work .
There has been so much charity in the Festival team of Birgitta and , of course , all of this goes over to me .
It was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going on .
It was the great heart of Eri Kans , too , who gave me the strength to go ahead very well with Mrs Festival in Tallinn .
And here I am and I can do it .
What about the audience at today &apos;s Festival , what are you offering in particular ?
We have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and surprise , among other things , we have the first ballery written on Mrs Lindgreni cheese .
To do this is &apos; Karlsson lb &apos; .
And there is also a notorious nuance that the author of this baller is the Latvian composer , Juris Karlinning , who himself expressed a wish to write it .
Apparently she has already experienced the Carlsson carature from a child in the breath .
At the risk , how are you all tired of all this ?
Thank you very much to my life @-@ sponsored colleague .
Such work requires a system of support and a great deal of love , and this is something that I am thankful to have .
And I have noticed that my personal emotion does not depend so much on other people as on me , in other words , how do I oppose every new day ?
And such an awareness of maintaining the tone , maintaining the usefulness and , in fact , laughing ourselves into the mirror in the morning showed me a significant increase in my happiness .
Especially now this week , when there are the most important tests , I have exercised it with particular zeal , and it is working .
To laugh oneself is hurting the brain and raising the tone .
That is simply not a word .
I think people do not yet know half the things of their own body that the universe provides for them , but it belongs to everyone himself slowly .
Right now , this is an important moment .
Is there also a hardship before the dirigent was taken ?
There is still a need to replace clothing with more comfort .
This is a small moment for ourselves .
In general terms , however , I do not have the opportunity to pump or make a little cool before the big event .
In fact , I even like to engage actively with the people , even before the dirigendium took place .
However , come all to Birgitta Festival , what is also to be detected here is not a very big manager and a baller friend .
See a stark video with the risk of Joostiga !
Publication of new tests on the age assessment of Swedish asylum seekers
The most recent results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the houses were assessed as older than 18 , but not all believe in the accuracy of the results .
The Swedish National Institute for Legal medicine ( Rasytspreferably inalvert ) started the tests earlier this year .
The tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of the age in the course of applications for asylum , following criticism by the Swedish Office for Migration ( IOM ) for the fact that they have not been able to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly juvenile refugees .
From March 2017 until mid @-@ 31 July 2017 , Tunisia has sent 680 cases of testing , and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 2481 tests .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) was assessed for 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older cases , and in another 25 cases , the Institute for Legal medicine estimated that the test &apos; may be 18 years old &apos; .
In 432 cases , it came to the conclusion that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
The tests will only be used if a person &apos;s age is questioned .
According to Johan Göransson , who works in the Institute of judicial medicine , the results are consistent compared with those of previous months .
&quot; We do not see a big difference compared to the statistics of the past months ; the figures are quite consistent , &quot; he said to the newspaper The Local .
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed on average than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have chosen their age .
In May , the EIT issued the results of the 581 test and said that , in 442 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person studying is 18 years old or older &apos; .
However , when a newspaper Svensson ska Dagbladet investigated the results of their 581 tests , it turned out that , in 243 cases , a person had stated directly that he would get 18 this year .
This medical age assessment method , in which fabrics of smart therage röntgeniids and of fields MRT are carried out , has then been criticised in some circles by dental doctors and radiology .
One of the sceptics is Arkrinologist Claude Marcus , the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes an assessment of people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether or not they went through audiences sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the method of measurements currently being used should be used .
The designation of biological age in this way is very precarious .
If we cannot safely say , then we should not pretend that we get , &apos; he said forestry to the newspaper &apos; .
However , Johan Göransson of the Institute of medicine defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; In general , it can be said that the risk of pumping the baby inadequately into adulthood is low .
The biggest risk , perhaps at around 10 % , would be if the person is just under 18 . &quot;
9 sign that you could forgive you for the more expensive .
You paid you and spent a night with someone else .
Summer is painful , because you have so many nice times and memories together .
I would like to reassure him , but is it the right time ...
Your Tango lists nine signs , which show that the cost of your action will be regretted and could be forgiven to him .
It seems more expensive to understand the seriousness of the situation and hard to deal with it .
More expensive deals with the problem that led him into a bed with a different compass .
You are no longer in a defensive position .
It sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for its actions .
He is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
It agrees that it has made a serious mistake and is sincerely trying to rectify the situation .
He is attentive , and he is trying to communicate with you in a pleasant way .
At the same time , it is forcing you to get to grips quickly .
They do not deny what has happened , nor are they trying to make it unnoticed .
It is more expensive for you and for you to understand why there has been a lack of loyalty .
You talk about this , and also about how to prevent it in the future .
You need to communicate better and assess each other &apos;s needs .
Your more expensive attitude and action have helped you to develop our condolences against his mistake .
A more costly commitment and behaviour has created the basis for your proximity to return .
As a couple , you have made progress to re @-@ believe in your unity and relationship .
The 20 @-@ year @-@ old newer , Anna Maria Orel , made a beautiful debate in London , receiving 67.37 places of good 18 seats .
After that , MM noorim was a female jungle , and a positive woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for medals in the future .
The contest went well and gained good experience .
With the first test ( 64.80 ) , I immediately removed my average result , the second one ( 62.80 ) risked too much and the third ( 67.37 ) I was able to keep it very clear . &quot;
I chose my emissions , and I am very pleased that I found it .
Anna Maria Oreli MM &apos;s debate ended in a good 18th place .
Vihmasadu Orelit did not mix , as he is , after all , training the winter through the TEC stage .
&apos;I am afraid &apos; , he said a little bit more .
The London Olympic Assembly had almost a full house of the people , did the people reconsider themselves , or were they able to turn themselves off ?
Mr Tajani , but in a positive sense .
Everyone is saying that it adds - that is the case .
If you compete on your own , then you can experience it .
He then confirmed that he will be satisfied with the MM debate and that he is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 32nd outcome of this season , in other words the last one , ended in 18th place .
This is a very good result .
I am a 20 @-@ year @-@ old and Black - that is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and , in a few days , I want to compete on behalf of medals .
Western Virgina kuberner announced party change
The Western Virginia Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President Trumpa , that he replaced political parties .
&apos;Let it not , but the democrats walked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; Today , I say to you that I cannot help you any longer as a democratic Governor . I say to you today .
Explanations of joy were shed at the sitting .
&quot; So I am going to become Republican tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; As a engineers , I would say to you that it is time to play another game . &quot;
The Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Virginia .
Trucher won 42 points in Western Virginia and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats , Hillary Clinton .
Justice , which , according to Forterai , is the only billion star of the state , proved to have been elected in 2016 .
Ford states that it has coal mines in five states , and that the coal business is quite out of it itself .
Its value is approximately USD 1.59 billion .
At the same time , the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) published an announcement on Thursday night that &apos; the party exchange of Governor Justice is yet another blow to the democratic party park , which would rather prevent the country from being upgraded again rather than working for it &apos; .
&apos;Over 15 months and controls over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent wake @-@ up call for parks that are out until the end of the day and are unable to find a positive and united message &apos; said RNC representation Ronna McDaniel CS Newsi .
It is hardly surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
Ms Urmet , who is in office at the Weekise medical axis , said yesterday to the girl that posters had had to be distributed quite a great deal .
Grandes and brands are fundamental , excuses and slight defects .
Of course , there is also chaos , absentia and footwear .
According to Urmeti , visitors come to the festival with false footwear , and so there will be problems .
The media have also had to provide assistance to a couple of visitors with major injuries - there have been some scaremongering practices , and there have also been one footballs .
We have also made brothers when a person has pulled the hand or the finger .
Let us do less nurses here ; let us send more to the hospital .
Look at the videos as to whether the brakes on the media to treat the boy , too , ask the painkiller .
Coe praised the Russians &apos; honest apologies for the Dingushall .
According to what he said , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apology from Thursday &apos; , the international rallied Sebastian Coe was praised , but reiterating that now is not the time to let the country return to sport .
Dmitry Shycehtin , who entered into force at the IAAF Congress on the eve of last night &apos;s World Cup , said that the competition ban imposed on his country was the right one and has a firm aim to combat doping .
He apologised for &apos; all kinds of lighters who have been burnt away in competitions by golden and silver medals &apos; .
In spite of his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of keeping in force a ban in November 2015 after the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) report found evidence of state @-@ sponsored doping in Russia .
&quot; In my opinion today it was a very honest response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said to the journalists of IAAF President Coe .
&quot; The Council as a whole and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognised that they had had had had quite difficult times and that they would do their utmost to reform the alunion . &quot;
According to Coe , she was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for self @-@ anticipation .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but the Congress supports the group &apos;s proposal that now is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; Over the next few months , we must do all we can to normalise the situation .
We have always governed the principle that we want to isolate clean sportsmen and sportspeople from the broken system , &quot; he added .
A quarter of Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of IAAF will compete as neutral athletes in the World Cup in London on Friday .
The head of the IAAF working group , Rune Andersson , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of rehabilitation criteria .
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that lecturers banned are still operating freely .
The electric car revolution makes significant changes to the demand for metals .
Who are the winners and losers ?
Not only does the electric car revolution fundamentally change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market .
Although mining giants such as Glencore can say that they will win from one place to another , smaller mining firms will not help .
Glencore coal and oil currently serve , but in the era of electric cars there will be an increase in cobalt , lithium , copper , aluminium and nickel demand in the future .
This year , governments in the United Kingdom , France and Norway have stepped up their contributions on the spread of electric cars to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades .
That is why Mr Volvo has already announced that he is planning to give up an internal combustion engine , and Tesla will bring to the market a cheaper blue 3 electric car .
Banimal berg New Energy Finance estimates that over two decades electric cars will be sold more than oil @-@ fired cars .
&quot; With regard to some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Simona Gambranin Banimal .
We have already seen a huge impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium , which have been growing demand for years .
In electric cars there are approximately three times more copies than in conventional cars , Glencore declared .
An even bigger response is needed in recharging stations , so Exane BNP Paris estimates that this will increase demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
The increase in demand for electric cars means an additional demand for lithium , cobalt , graphite and patriots .
Glencore derives profits from a growing trend of electric cars at copper prices and from the fact that there is the world &apos;s largest cobaltier producer predicted by Jefflatores Group .
According to this broker company , the winners of the winners of the Fbetreport @-@ McMoRan and First Quanma Minerconventions are the winners of the competition for electric cars .
The market reacts to an already changing trend .
This year there has been a 70 % drop in the London metal exchange rate .
There was a 37 % increase in soil prices .
Finally , 14 per cent this year , mainly due to economic growth .
Glencore shares rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price rise for rival Rio Tonipa Group , BHP Billitoni and Anglo Stream .
On the side of the losers there are lead companies such as Recyhtx and Campine , who have to adapt to a new era .
The main end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ hand use of the sun is the batteries supplying the start @-@ ups of cars with a petrol and diesel engine .
Electric cars are powered by liitiumines .
&quot; This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the drop in demand , &quot; said Michael Widmer , Governor of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch metal Market analysis .
There has yet to be no sign of the impact of the tapping trend .
It is 17 % this year , and it is the best metal in London among the main industrial metals .
Investors will see problems for metal in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil is keeping ordinary cars competitive , &quot; said Herwig Schmidt , a metal company Triland Metals .
If lead demand falls , it will take place slowly .
That may be the case in about 10 years &apos; time .
Up to now , however , stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which depend more often on advanced lead @-@ based batteries , will be assessed by the international lead and by the investigative body .
Heavy metals such as aluminium will be replaced by steel , as a lighter car will be able to drive less electricity .
This explains an additional EUR 1.6 million of closed minimum demand between 2013 and 2016 .
It accounts for 2.7 % of the output of the aluminium world .
This trend is likely to grow , says Widmer .
Aluminium catches 13 per cent this year , as growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market shortages .
Steel producers do not .
He will work together with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful cars .
ArcelorMittal is also trying to develop a lighter meltdown from steel in order to oppose a minimum .
&apos;A strong steel should act as a response to this development &apos; said Exane BNP Paris &apos;s analysis , Sylvain Brunet .
We see some progress in Europe .
The end of the oil era can also result in suffering for plaice .
Soil took about half of that precious metallic diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , the metal refiner , Johnson Matteries .
&quot; Many raw materials , such as oil and plate , may not have high demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard Dahdah , Natix &apos;s raw materials analysis .
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
Plaatine manufacturers believe in the continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc Grynberg , leader of the Uncore , said that , in 2025 , more hybrid cars will continue to be sold .
In the 10 @-@ year perspective , Toyota Motors and Hymuni Motos have been developed on hydrogen @-@ based cars that depend on a poster in order to generate electricity from hydrogen .
Up to now , however , this technology has still not commercially justified itself .
&quot; The Diet appears to have a clear losers on the way to electric cars , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris from Brussels .
German car manufacturers received a major setback in July because the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche &apos;s home city .
How the monetary rules for football affect Neyra &apos;s transition to Paris .
The rules aimed at preventing rampant spending of football clubs in Europe do not preclude Neyra &apos;s world record transfer from the Spanish football club to the French club Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
Any consequence from UEFA , the governing body , which dominates the European game and which has the power to ban teams from taking part in this prestigious League of Ministers , is still ahead of Paris Saint @-@ GerMay .
The financial rules on fair play ( FFP ) , established by UEFA in 2011 , mean that the PSG will have to prove at some point that the migration of Neyra was financed without huge losses .
EUR 222 million were paid to Barcelona ( USD 262 million ) just because the Brazilians bought out of his contract , and Neyra &apos;s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year .
Here there are a few aspects of Neyra &apos;s transfer to the French club .
PSG will undoubtedly be in a position to extract such money in order to recruit Neyra and to include its stars in a cloak , bearing in mind that the team is funded by a family governed by the Katar energy pipeline .
Clubs have been allowed to spend a great deal on recruiting players , but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that enable them to come up with them in football .
FFFP formed the basis for Michel Platini following his election to UEFA in 2007 .
This former French player believed that clubs who are falling into debt in search of success are actually engaged in fraud and risk swindling if the banks or owners had to give up subsidies .
As of 2011 , FFFP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of the debts of clubs .
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then to spend a great deal in order to improve the team and create a global trademark - is more difficult to implement .
During the current three @-@ year evaluation period of FFFP , which runs until 2018 , the clubs may bear up to EUR 30 million in losses .
And even though Mr Platini &apos;s successor to UEFA , Alexander Ceferin , is still committed to blocking excessive spending in 2015 .
&quot; FFFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules in the future , &quot; &quot; said last week The negotiator , Andrea Traverso , the UEFA @-@ s FFP Supervisor .
Even though Mr Neyra &apos;s overpurchase clause has become one full payment , they will be able to allocate this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the agreement .
Mrs Neymar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it is possible to indicate a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years .
For the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , PSG , together with Manchester Cityga belonging to Abu Dhabi , received the most severe penalties .
PSG was fined EUR 60 million ( USD 82 million at that time ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million , and the club called for the crew of the League of Meists to be restricted to 21 players during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of the usual 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to override the regulatory authorities by blowing their revenues through companies associated with owners of the club .
The Katar company may sponsor the PSG , but if the value of sponsorship is perceived to exceed standard market levels , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
This was the case in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Qatar tourist Authority PSG &apos;s value had been excited .
It has been said that a certain part of Mrs Neyra &apos;s PSG service could come to Kainfrastructure through contributions from the Management Committee of the World Cup in 2022 .
However , the PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Mrs Neyra could become world championships and say that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities would be easily able to challenge such a manoeuvre .
The penalties imposed earlier on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
People familiar with the situation said , on Thursday , that UEFA had not discussed the switchover pro @-@ cyclically with PSG Neyra .
They were talking to ETA on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed because they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG .
Most recently published reports show that over € 10 million worth of revenue in the PSG service in 2015 @-@ 2016 at around € 542.4 million .
Data from the last financial year have not yet been published .
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have a positive impact on sponsorship transactions , trade and snus .
The club looks forward to an increase of at least 30 % with regard to the conclusion of the contract .
Spain too , having clearly annoyed one of the biggest football stars , sought to block Neyra &apos;s switchover , arguing that the PSG is in breach of the FP .
&quot; This is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with the club and with the state , &quot; said President Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS , indicating that the PSG belongs mainly to Katarias .
Arsenal mänejer ArţWenger , a club belonging to the American sports magnage , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; This is the result of property rights and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger on Thursday .
&quot; If the club belongs to the state , everything is possible .
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a major player . &quot;
The Norwegian low @-@ cost airline scenario has a nice tradition of putting on the aeroplane crash pilots who have shifted borders in their own area and inspired others , writes trip.ee .

Fifty years ago today : An orthodox storm erupted from houses and windows in Estonia .
The Hurricane referred to as the storm of the century , which , on 6 and 7 August , caused serious damage , in particular , to the West , Harjuria and the Black Sea .
There were more than 30 mm / s during these days in the north @-@ west of Estonia .
In my old factory in Bavaria , I went from one map pub to the other to the other and had a hand in supporting them .
Everything was blind and bitter , just like the world stage .
Taamal already withdrew from houses , recalled in 2002 the old Mrs Linda Kurova hospital magazine Estonian nature in this interview .
Linda &apos;s husband saw his belongings collapsed .
However , what kind of support do you still have with your hands , where do you stand up against such a storm ?
Haapsalus Kalda , who lived on the streets , came down as a window , when it came out of window water . &quot;
The fact that trees were full of roads , and the serooni coverage of the railway station had been flying 20 to 30 metres , Linda has seen the majority of sharks just like next morning .
According to the local authorities , there were cots behind the Paralepa , some completely lengths , some boys .
Everyone saw it very frustrating , the storm went out of the beautiful old trees as radar and pragmatism like a war .
Western Viruland could not be particularly badly affected in August 1967 compared to Western Estonia , but the losses there were also huge , written by Virumaa theatre in 2007 .
Batsalu Lfossil Park and the Padise Park were swept away from the ground , but the parks of our chain were also severely affected .
In Tallinn , the wind was measured by up to 35 metres per second , about 130 kilometres per hour .
In the winter city of Meriana , one of the few lead chambers had died on the evening of 6.August : &apos; Mother , mother !
They are in the air and will no longer be signed ! , &quot; wrote Virumaa theatre .
In Viljandiland , the generation &apos;s natural building was destroyed so much during the storms that it was decided afterwards to dismantle it .
The design of the Tür Empire , which was no longer restored at a later stage , was not opposed to August .
On 12 August 1957 , the Red Cross wrote that cleaning up towns and cities and settlements is proceeding slowly and that their vehicles are progressing slowly , and the population could play their part in cleaning work .
Grains were also severely affected in Turin , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party organisations must be an incentive and guidance both for corps and fertility corps &apos; .
It is possible to talk about GMOs if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s .
In Estonia , there will continue to be around 2 November 1959 , when Ruhnul measurements wind radiation 48 m m / s .
On the island of Vaindstory , a measure was broken , so there was no precise record of the strong nuclear radiation measured there .
Secret of holiday beaches : Night harvesting and poor coastlines .
Younger summer festivals will also mean smaller corroments in the beaches of Tallinn .
If there is no , then people are on the ground and , if not , there will be no people &apos; , then there will also be a repeat of the floor .
Stroom , the city of Northern Tallinn , is wrapped up .
They are offered artificial competition by a bottomless tractor on low turns , which drives down the platinist triipe .
In fact , the last seven centimetres of gross rubbish is blowing out seafood and people left behind : Insects , cigarettes and so on .
People are still coming to ransom , regardless of whether the water is warm or not .
If there is beauty , then people are on the ground , and , if there are no , there are no people too , &apos; the management of the private company hospital hospital will be said by Alexander Usov , the head of cleaning works .
It is 6.30 p.m. , and there is a bitter corps on the coast , because at 8 o &apos;clock a poster must be in order for the people .
Usov is already at four o &apos;clock .
In addition to Stroom , he will keep an eye on the coast of Pirita , Harta Lake , Kakumäe and Palaraare Pikakari .
Landfill amounts have decreased .
Many years ago , there was much more .
People will now be able to assess what is being done for them , &apos; Usov will talk about who has corrupted migrants for 15 years .
It was the case earlier that , when something new had been stood up , it had already been broken next day .
Now , what is on the coast is already being maintained .
Price of clean beach
One of the biggest jobs on Estonia &apos;s beaches has been ravaged by sea rubbish , that is , adru repeat .
For example , it has to be transported 400 000 tonnes on the coast of Pirita .
&apos;This is an incredible amount &apos; , marks Usov .
Another large category is municipal rubbish , that is to say , all that people leave behind .
There are eight big rubbish lines in Stroom , one and a half kilometres of coastline , which need to be scrapped three times a week .
So much will come from rubbish .
However , the cold summer days have meant that rubbish is five per cent less than otherwise .
The third species comprise abandoned things .
For the most part , they are children &apos;s televisions .
This time , the Usov Empire has pulled out of the sand ten metres of sludge .
They leave owners waiting for a rough timber route .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is usually more out of them , but it is a normal harvest . &quot;
Children come to rank and take toys in order to bury them back into the sand .
Landfill is broken down .
Erika Scholler , a representative of administrative services , has admitted that a tractor &apos;s sister work is disrupted at local level .
Noise , which lasts from night to hour , is mixed up by people living in the neighbourhood .
On the day , however , this work is impossible .
In one month , rand will have to travel twice .
&quot; If we do not do so , we will be fined by the city , &quot; Scholler says .
However , like Pirita , Pikkar and Savary , Stroom rand also aims to get under the international flag .
&quot; Compared to Europe , there is a lot more work in Estonia to care for beaches , &quot; says Scholler .
We have more adples and more kids , and it is more difficult for an exaggerated friend .
However , there is less rubbish in our beaches than elsewhere in Europe .
When I hear that there is talk of rubbish on the coast , Mr Martin , who is living near Stroom &apos;s beach , takes an unacceptably conversation between the journalist and corrogation workers , highlighting current bottlenecks .
There is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
There is a problem with birds and bottle slaves who have pulled out rubbish bags , &quot; says Martin .
Although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something with rubbish slogans and , for example , put them on the roofs , in order to obstruct at the very least birds there .
In general , however , Mr Stroom is satisfied with developments .
We can see that the city takes care of this .
It has become more agreeable with children &apos;s fields , enlightened and newly established roads .
At one time it was the case that only one route could be taken in instant cases , &quot; says Martin .
Findings of Stroomis : Coins , only coins
Twenty @-@ seven @-@ year @-@ old Dimitri , who , as an armier heating , is sailing along the coastline with a metal depression , has had to take advantage of a metal metal period .
He does not believe that , today and in the future , there will be anything of a price .
Sea angles are not generous enough to do so .
&quot; I have been dealing with this for one year , and so far nothing worthwhile , &quot; says Dmitry .
As a refrigeration , there are some euro coins in the Dmitry of Dmitry , bottles and also the dangerous pounds that later throw in the rubbish .
Normally there are still coins .
&quot; Culture , fingers and others do not usually exist . &quot;
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain on the previous level , as unprofitable economic growth and the easing of inflation have cushioned speculation in relation to the increase .
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain a loophole , as household incomes have put interest rates on hold .
Decision @-@ makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MPC ) have voted 6 : 2 in favour of 0.25 % and fewer members this month require an increase because slow economic growth has weakened support .
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected close to 3 % in the autumn .
At the same time , however , the Bank also signalled that an increase in rates is necessary in order to contain inflation from Brexon over the next few years , and the expected increase in lending costs on the financial markets may be necessary .
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package , which was launched a year ago as a result of Brexti .
In February , the Bank will terminate its fixed @-@ term cash scheme , which provides banks with cheap funding , even though it said that it is now up to GBP 15 billion more to be offered under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
In the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; In the central forecast of MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain powerless in the near future , since the situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
As regards the rates , it was reiterated that , in order to mitigate inflation , a &apos; fiscal effort &apos; was needed , to a somewhat greater extent than expected in the markets .
Eurostars is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
However , the Bank stressed that any anthem is gradual and limited .
The Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % in May and 1.7 % respectively .
The projected 1.8 % growth in 2018 was maintained .
After this news , the pound went down against the dollar and the euro .
Women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.31 and 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .
The decision not to make changes is the result of recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to an increase in expectations concerning the increase in GDP in Cotonou in the second quarter , from 0.2 % to 0.3 % over the previous three months .
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it is starting to boost a little .
The Bank &apos;s most recent inflation report gave little reason to rejoice households with rising inflation and pitiful wage increases , saying that the situation would go a little worse before improvements were made .
It has been added that monetary policy could not prevent a fall in incomes over the next few years , but a significant recovery is expected towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
Thanks to the noble pound , the growing demand for British produce is also an incentive for the economy , partly compensating for lower costs for consumers .
The decision will come one year after rates were reduced by 0.25 % in August last year , following the shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the pound .
According to the Bank , it is likely that it will take four years for prices and the economy to be completely revived .
Prior to the Bank &apos;s last decision , there was a feeling of increasing demand , as inflation had increased pressure on hard households ; in July , three policy @-@ makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
Inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , even though the Bank &apos;s message was expected , and in the coming months it is expected to rise again .
The Bank said that an excessive increase compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak pound .
Andrew Montlake , leader of Coreco mortgages , said : &apos; In the light of the recent downturn in exchange rates , the mortgage market appears to be becoming increasingly competitive again , as borrowers want work and hope to finish the year in a positive way .
Eurostars seems to be particularly favourable for those whose current transactions come to an end , since refinancing , often without service and a low rate , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
NHS writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV medication
Patients will have access , from September onwards , to &apos; transformative treatment &apos; for HIV prevention after the fight in the Supreme Court on whether or not the NHS should finance it .
NHS England announced that public healthcare is now available for an estimated 10 000 people during the initial three @-@ year clinical trial to pre @-@ pre @-@ contractual ( PrEP ) - a tablet to be manned prior to the interim procedure , which has shown a reduction of approximately 86 % in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people .
The NHS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after last year &apos;s ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP , in spite of its own assertions that it should be financed by local authorities .
The Executive Director of NHS England , Simon Ste186 , welcomed this on Thursday as a &apos; sweeping intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NAT ) described it as a &apos; momentous moment &apos; .
Sex health clinics in London , Bright ton , Manchester , Liverpoolis and Sheffiels are among the first to register people , and further clinics will be added in October , before the programme is introduced anywhere in England by April 2018 .
&apos;PrEP &apos; is a hotline for HIV drugs that is taken prior to the incident in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
Clinical trials show that the PrEP significantly reduces transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection .
PrEP prior to taking action means that there will be a sufficient number of certain medicines in the body that prevent HIV infection .
Such medicines can take place on a daily basis or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure .
The right candidates include LGBT men , transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment .
Minors identify suitable people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , transgender people , and those who cannot receive anti @-@ retroviral treatment .
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their willingness to participate .
The programme costs GBP 10 million , and NHS England signed the contract to get medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
The aim of the clinical attempt is to assess the true potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who is intended for treatment and how it is consumed and implemented in a large cloud .
Ste186 said : &apos; This new large @-@ scale intervention should complement and enhance a comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV .
This is yet another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of mankind &apos;s biggest health problems . &quot;
Deborah gold , CEO of NAT , said : &apos; This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
The PrEP , if properly targeted at those who need it and belong to the risk line , offers an opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic .
Since September , people with a high HIV risk in England have had access to a powerful new tool financed by the NHS through this clinical trial , which is tailor @-@ made and does not depend on the negotiations with the partner , thereby improving many lives .
We warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Executive Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation , said : &apos; It is now essential to ensure that a clinical trial is launched quickly across the country and that none of the members of the HIV risk group are excluded .
Now that the PrEP clinical experiment has been received , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
Minister for Public Health , Sharon Hodgson , said : &apos; The beginning of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the census of government shoes .
Evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to HIV prevention and end the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
This clinical experiment takes us a step closer to a complete understanding of the benefits of PrEP .
It is now important that a clinical attempt is carried out as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV and bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
Electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
Between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania , in June this year the difference in electricity exchange rates decreased to EUR 1.94 compared with € 7.71 , Elering .
The main cause of the price gap lies in the richness of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
In Estonia last month , the average electricity exchange rate amounted to EUR 34.33 per megawatt hour and the price rose by 12 % compared to June .
In Latvia and Lithuania the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt hour .
In Finland , the price was EUR 34.17 , while the electricity stock exchanges in the Nord Bank had a system price of EUR 26.37 per megavage per hour .
Prices rose by 12 and 7 % respectively .
Between Estonia and Finland , electricity moved by 75 % last month to Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
The other nine per cent of transactions between the two countries did not take place for the next day .
Between Estonia and Latvia , 99 % from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of hours had full transmission capacity .
According to transactions in Nasdaq OMX on July &apos;s latest trading day , in August the electricity exchange price could reach approximately EUR 34 and EUR 37 per megavage hour .
Last month , the price of carbon dioxide , affecting the production price of electricity , came to EUR 5.04 @-@ 5.47 per tonne .
Living in higher life - In a quasi quasi and smart designers have made it home to the small Earls Court of Justice .
Joanne Leigh , a former banker who is a passionate property innovator , changed his home of Knightsbridge in 2014 against the Earls Court .
It is in Queen Anne Terţi &apos;s first order , and the fact that Joanne has not bundled his bags and sold the flats is a tribute to the new design .
&quot; Prior to that , together with a former compass in Knightsbridge , I lived on a much larger scale , &quot; said Joanne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tantamount to the price that I offered .
I was shown by the Earls Court of Justice , which had the same high waves .
I knew about it and made an offer on the same day . &quot;
Since the first visit , the 93 @-@ metre corps have gone through a complete innovation gap .
At the beginning , it was a sleeping cort and a difficult sticking plaster - it had to go through kitchen to reach a sleeping wall , and Joanne wanted to add reservoirs and quasi @-@ regulation in order to take advantage of the high mountains .
&quot; I asked for a great deal of light , big windows .
These were my demands , &apos; he said .
He appealed to Erfan Azad Notting , the architectural and designer session Duck &amp; Order , to take advantage of the 3.8 m deserts and create a home that is not just a development site , but a place in which Joanne can live .
It was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a quasi @-@ order in which to stand up .
Erfan had to take a creative approach .
&quot; Aquaculture is rather complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; We had to re @-@ organise the premises so that they were located on one another without having to boast either .
It was not just about building a platform , but using steel design so that it is right that there is not only an upper but also lower space . &quot;
This emphasis allowed Mr Erfans in the room to create two flambles with complete arrogance with a lot of dramatic elements .
One @-@ and @-@ a @-@ one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ the @-@ one @-@ face lighting from the Retrouvius window opens up to the glacians nearby the wayside .
The golden furniture , silver details and retropacilian Serge Mouille &apos;s light underline the style of space .
The use of mirrors plays an important role in the inclusion of communications , spaces and traffic lights .
In the short corridor , mirrors have been added to both sides , so that it would appear longer .
There is an impression in the night that the mirror comes in as the window opened up by another tup .
In the course of its activity , the centrepiece of care for all of Joanne &apos;s boxes and banknotes will be reflected .
Housing is accompanied by a false opportunity to close the vegetables if they do not use it , creating an image of a smarter space .
Cumulative kitchen is nothing new .
However , with this kitchen , what is unique is the fact that it is a plug of uprisings of garage .
&quot; It did a little bit of design , &quot; explained by Erfan terastronomy from MDF .
&quot; This has a counterweight , which is why it is very simple to reject it . &quot;
Thanks to the smart use of space and reservoirs , Joanne now has 16 additional square meters , additional sleeping rooms and a better harvester plan .
After all , what you sell - or what adds value to real estate - is the floor of Erfan .
&apos;KinnisNatural Counkler takes an outdated form and makes calculations on the basis of an underground area &apos; .
Here , they have been able to increase surgery , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to space .
&quot; The materials are what you are dealing with and thus help to create emotional links with your homes , &quot; says Erfan .
&quot; You do not love the electricity cables in mine .
It is important , but it does not put heart languages ringing . &quot;
This shows that a good design and an increased area of land will help do something astonishing from a rather normal record .
In fact , they can even create a desire not to leave , as was the case with Joanne .
The chief figure , Jensen , is Chicago , a petroman in a pilot night who is competing with a fellow Member because of professionalism .
No more than the amount of money that has been earned , apart from which there is any ethics .
His wife and her three children can only see a man on property and late in the evening .
In the first part of the film , I find myself in the idea that this is indeed a version of the business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler .
However , what the film goes on , the less clerical element remains , and the moralising intention of filmmakers is beginning to appear more and more .
Life @-@ changing experience leads to cancer for the main contractor .
There must now be a choice between work and family life .
The poet dreaming the father &apos;s feet at the Chicago Large buildings to think about matters of real importance such as religion , charity , love ... without even touching on the disaster of the twin sectors .
After the third astery in which a son opens his father &apos;s eyes , there is a feeling that film @-@ makers will certainly be able to herald the goal , because even the most stubborn spectator will not be able to hold back tears when they see the suffering of a cum of cancer sick boys .
If the poet falls into the House and his situation seems to be almost hopeless , the father will once and for all understand the morality of his work and do a good job for the elderly .
Now , in my own sense , if the film has its own destination , then I would pay tribute to my sensibilities after the film coffee , if I am wrong , then it could be praised for at least one surprise .
For a moment , there is a suspicion that there will be no residual coffee - when the husband handles a sick person and a man drives to the Palace of the slow @-@ line corridor .
However , Poeg has been amazing , and even though his father has just lost his job , it is even positive , because it now has time to deal with the family .
I , too , can feel very well - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well .
In truth , the film is well constructed , with all the elements required to do so .
There will be a Council , there will be laughing , illustrators will be a good and moral beauty : Money is not the most important thing in life .
I am surprised to introduce this film well .
The new Staff Commander is planning to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
Others have tried and failed .
Perhaps John F. Kelly will actually be able to deal with this as well .
In that case , it would be the first .
Mr Politico writes that the new chief of staff in the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President Trumpin , including news , in the hope that it will hold the balance in water .
Here there is a full report from Josh Dawseyan :
&quot; When John F. Kelly met with senior officials on his first day of work , the White House revealed a key problem with President Donald Trumpi Valges Main , which he plans to solve the poor flow of information to the President &apos;s hands .
Mr Kelly told the officials that the information had to pass through him , either on paper or at meetings , because the President would take better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried it too , and they have failed to tame Trumpi by monitoring its media consumption .
President Trumpi &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades , and even now that he is in the White House , his television screenings have gone nowhere .
&apos;When the candidate Trump was annoyed for dishonest media coverage , to show him that he was also fairly reflected in the statements affecting him &apos; said Sam Nunberg in February to Politico , the former campaigner .
Politico tara Palmer wrote at the time that , according to the six former campaigners , Trumpi Twitter is a key factor in the management of ter @-@ habits , to ensure that her individual media consumption is also accompanied in a stable way . &quot;
OK .
However , the idea that Trumpi Twitter &apos;s habits have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
Perhaps those campaigners will know something that the rest of us do not know that the Trumpi refutters would have been even more heartening without their interventions .
We will probably never be able to find out about shuttles that the Trump did not announce .
If he was helpless able to save him , just a few times , his efforts were worthy of it .
However , no @-@ one has been able to prevent Trumpi from constantly creating polemics .
Part of the problem is that in the White House , which consists of competing tactics between them , people are trying , without exception , to promote their own interests by transferring materials to the Truel that support their global views , but may not always be reliable .
In May , Politico , which reflects the whole course of the story , writes the reluctance of the advisers to inform the President of a strategic interest in feed .
One of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows :
&quot; The current and former Trumpi submits that Trump can react to the negative press , with a particularly damaging impact on leaflets , in an explosive way , taking as a obsession with identifying their source of origin .
This was also the case at the end of February , when someone discredibly gave the President a copy of the Internet provocation , Charles C. GotNews.com , a website belonging to Johnson , which accused the deputor Katie Walshi of being a white house &apos; source of multiple leaflets &apos; .
It goes without saying that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter , or that he did not provide any concrete evidence , or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
The Trump read the article and started to ask the subordinate Wales . &quot;
Goldmacher added that Rob Porter , the then staff chief , Reince Priebus , and the head of the White House , had attempted to set up a system for the management and documentation of documents reaching Trumpin . &quot;
How did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but the Trump is still an impulse and his assistant will still compete for influence .
These irrevocable factors make Mr Kelly &apos;s mission very difficult .
Street musicians coming from foreign capital will not be allowed to take the floor .
In the city of Tallinn , there is a great deal of alienation of foreigners .
Those with whom the message came to light acknowledged that they were playing in the elderly without the permission of the municipal government .
We first found three street musicians along Viru &apos;s gates , who had involved the same number of houses with them .
It was clear to see that musicians with rubbergs and broken hardliners were in absentia who would have to spend one duš martyrs on .
In spite of the humiliation , the only woman in the company involved played a trail in the acordiation , while one man , alongside him , called him three Palliations and presidents closer together .
The third man had sat alongside them on one of the dogs and smoked the craftsmen themselves .
Their three chambers did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people .
Mr Bob , who has played with Mr Noemi and the faces , has said that he is wearing on the streets both for fun and for money .
The purpose of the event was to collect tickets for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day evening .
With regard to the question of whether or not they asked for permission from the city for rotation , Noemi and Bob were shaking their heads .
Firstly , we did not know .
Secondly , we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a few days , and in most cases we will be allowed to do so for one month or another .
It makes no sense to pay for this , &quot; explained by Bob .
Some 20 minutes later , when we came back to the gates of Viru , we saw that two women are in the hands of musicians and are trying to get away with them .
It paved with sacks and dogs in absentia to come to grips with Viru crossing the centre .
There were also three Polish young men present on Viru street , one of whom played a fifth , the other knife , and the third had even contributed electronically .
&quot; We are here to offer people entertainment in order to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and life , &quot; the trio pipe Mivosh explained .
According to Mivoshi , they are aware that there has to be permission from the City Government .
&quot; Of course we do not have it , &quot; he said it joke .
However , we hope that , when people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
Of course , when it comes to the police , we go elsewhere , but we have to try &apos; , he added .
The Bank of Estonia purchased bonds worth EUR 149 million under the Public Private Company Programme of Central Banks in the euro area in July , the Central Bank &apos;s bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion .
The Central Bank does not provide more detailed information on purchases .
Estonian bank President Hardo Hansson has made it clear in the past when he asked the members of the national assembly that three separate buy @-@ up programmes for central banks in the euro system : Covered bonds for the financial sector ( SIS II ) , asset @-@ backed bonds ( ABS ) and public bonds ( PSPP ) .
The Central Bank will buy bonds from the market in order to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
The impact of purchases reduces the production of low @-@ risk assets and encourages investors to take greater risks .
As a rule , as part of a public sector bond exchange programme , each central bank buys its own national government bonds , other countries &apos; bonds are not purchased .
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is making so @-@ called replacement purchases within the amount allocated to them .
Central Banks will also shop in those countries where the offer of bonds to the purchase scheme is limited .
The Bank of Estonia , confirmed by Hansson , generally buys the bonds of the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) and the European Investment Bank bonds .
The Bank of Estonia will buy bonds under the asset exchange programme as of March 2015 .
In the meantime , NTBs were also procured , but in June 2016 the Estonian bank no longer bought up Election bonds .
On behalf of the central banks in the euro area , the Finnish Central Bank will purchase energy bonds from both Eleven and Estonia as of June .
Emigrants ignore degrees and return to a &apos; millionset of millions &apos; .
Some of the richest owners of the West Midlands have once again found themselves in fierce confrontations with determined migrants who have ignored the unelected bureaucracies of the county council in order to win back their walls away from them .
Migrants have refined their 20 trailers on the brink of a wealthy &apos; crowd of millions of businesses &apos; on the streets of Sohatulli .
They have returned , together with horses , children and lorries , to the army , when they were blowing out there only in May , without putting themselves in the mess of the bureaucracies cured to block their invasion by the Council .
An active group found a weak place in the limits of protection , turning its vehicles through an unblocked part that had been left to football .
Maruangy residents have skirted at the Sopigulli Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless to deal with the problem &apos; .
One anonymous person said : &apos; They copied there on Monday evening following their expulsion from Bentley Heathy , where they refused to stoning .
The Council has to be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
The migrants were there in May , they were delayed , and now they are back again .
They came more yesterday evening , probably more today . &quot;
He added : &apos; Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect his parks .
I live on the road of street etsbrook , and I am not happy that I have to continue to pay a mandate if the Council is not even able to block such a thing . &quot;
A local resident who also wanted to be anonymous also said : &apos; It is ridiculous ; we have only just seen how the last of these migratory movements disappeared , and there is already a new offensive .
This time , there has been an increase in the number , and even a horse has been recorded on the grassland . &quot;
Representative of the Someat City Council said : &apos; We are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the land near the street etsbrook route and we are working with the Someat ulli police , and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
It will be very helpful if , as far as possible , as many local residents report any form of antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by phone number 101 .
This will help create an image of the situation for the courts if we present the case to them . &quot;
The Weekna Festival will , among other things , visit the Minister for Culture , Indrek Saar , who is pleased to have been able to bring real world top names to Estonia .
The question as to why it is so important for the Estonians at the Weekise Festival is Saar that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the Festival for three days .
However , he will admit that there have been real players in his own area who have arrived in Persia .
&quot; If you look at the level of the artists that we have been able to bring home to Estonia , then the absolute top names of this music director will be brought home - and this is often not the case in our book - the Minister for Culture will speak . &quot;
Which festival , however , do the artists present the Saart speak for themselves the most ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person , and it is certainly one of the most experienced doctors , Armin van Bnewren , who stood up last night .
After all , according to his poster , all of us at some point have complicated our own feet . &quot;
However , he also highlights a number of names , such as ChainCameroon , Deadmau5 , Knifebels .
Of course , our own Estonian players too : Starting with NOPOL , they can be read in a whole series .
In practical terms , this concentration of well @-@ known names is very high , &quot; he says .
Look more closely at the lessons learnt from the video .
Audi upgrades up to 850 000 diesel vehicles amid criticism by car manufacturers .
A day prior to the Audi announcement , BMW said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles .
According to BMW Chairman , the company believes that &apos; there are smarter alternatives than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the BMW home city to Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be upgraded to reduce emissions from diesel engines .
None of the companies described these practices as provocation .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with CO2 emission regulations .
However , nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma .
At the same time , equipment installed to neutralise exhaust exhaust gases emitted from diesel vehicles will increase the cost for car manufacturers , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
While German car manufacturers are under an in @-@ depth investigation , Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s Government is also accused of ringing powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring signs referring to the problem .
Companies are trying to prevent Volkswagen from repeating its faults , who sat down so @-@ called petroleum devices , which made it possible to adapt emissions fares to regulations when testing a car , but came back to normal driving conditions .
A number of Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
In Germany last month , the former head of the Audi engine Development unit was arrested .
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
At the beginning of this year , Audi in Germany went into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen when the authorities accused of installing an audit system in order to circumvent Europe &apos;s emission performance requirements , thereby extending the investigation , which was previously focused on the United States .
The inclusion of the awards in the investigation may be a major blow to the Volkswagen , a producer of Luxembourluxury cars , disproportionately generating the profits of a large proportion of Volkswagen .
Estonian schools will receive 20 000 euro of European Union flags .
The Ministry of Education intends , by 1 September , to buy European Union flags in Estonian schools .
A total of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union &apos;s flag will be 570 education institutions with measurements .
Lips are intended to invest in indoors ; they must also be carried out in high @-@ quality printed indoors with a sense of attestation ; the ERR news portal will be facilitated .
On the label , there is a text : &apos; Kingitus to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
The estimated cost of 570 flags lies at EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , a flag costing EUR 35 .
Murder of the journalist highlights the growing threat situation in Mexico
The workers of the weekly newspaper , Riodoce , usually gather on Wednesday in order to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Blue authorisation , sowed by organised crime , corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars .
Today , however , they have gathered in the guise of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
They are told that it is important for them to change their stupidity .
The two parents &apos; writers are discussing what seems safer : Whether to bring children into the office that was the target of the grandiose attack in 2009 , or leave them home .
Security experts have written three words to the leader of the room : &apos; Enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
They are asking reporters to provide the names of each water in each of them not to provide systematic evidence ; impressions and internal emotions suffice .
There are suspicions of drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists appearing to be employed by the government or cartels who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos that exists in Mexico .
There are no slogans of violence , and the more dead people across the country accumulate , the majority of whom are made up , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists appearing to have been imprisoned since the arrest of President Enrique Pena Portuguto at least 25 in December 2012 . 589 journalists are under public protection following attacks and threats , and this year at least seven journalists in seven journalists in seven states have still died .
The most recent deaths include their editor and source of inspiration , Riodoce co @-@ founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .
&quot; The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Valdez wrote one of his many reports on drug @-@ related violence .
His absence makes a deep sense , even though his presence can be felt everywhere on the Asian Riodoce Building , a big picture of Valdez , which shows an average clip , with a letter entitled &apos; Justice &apos; , and two of the 30nines reporters , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , carries T @-@ shirts , which have been portrayed by his wife @-@ private glasses , or the face of his petroleum .
Less than two months after his death , the Reporters are discussing common trauma , their nightmare , their hopelessness , their paranoia .
In 2010 , although a separate public prosecution service was set up to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
Just like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime @-@ related murders , which amount to thousands , journalists &apos; killers seldom reach justice .
Riodoce &apos;s editorial action continues to reflect the violence in Sinalo , even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
Without the data and justice of murderers , the meeting on security will not be of great use , according to Mrs Ibarra .
&quot; It is very nice to waste your time here at this meeting , &quot; he says .
&quot; As long as the reason is not well known , everyone will be trusted . &quot;
Valdez left Riodoce &apos;s office on 15 May in the capital of the State , Culiacan .
He was able to drive just a few quarters before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla , forcing him to exit the car and shot him 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , meaning in translation the &apos; twelfth river &apos; .
In Valdez &apos;s car , an armed man went away and made an accident close to it .
Valdez was 50 years old .
She was left behind by a woman and two adult children .
There will be free circulation in Culiacan .
On Valdez , however , there is mainly silence .
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition to the United States in January , the Blue Card has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country , as rivalries are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
It makes no difference that , on the streets of Blue authorisation , a few people , or even a number of people , are burnt down every day , or that the dead are saturated en masse from two @-@ fold sweets of drug gangs , which are higher than many homes living .
Let us forget , for a moment , that the time for peace refers to the fact that only one cartel is headed by a maritime state with valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
In spite of all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers associated with its work , Riodoce &apos;s co @-@ founder and the President , IsMay Bojorquez ( 60 ) , feels that he was unable to protect his friend .
He believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
The first of them was the publication in February of an interview with Guzman &apos;s sons , who is competing with the sons of Guzman .
This piece of correspondence could have been alluded to by gangs suspected of appearing , all copies of publications were bought up as soon as they were found in newspapers .
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security , after there had been a crackdown in one of the newspapers with the same story in another .
Valdez was legalised both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
He had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to exist forever .
In 2003 , he served as a veteranreporter report in Noroeste when he joined five colleagues in order to set up Riodoce , sold 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bojorquez said it was impossible to deal with the press without touching on the problem of drugs .
The newspaper stretched a long time with its courageous and honest labels , and sales and advertisements increased .
Reporters were keen to publish vigorous studies without fear of censorship and readers sleep in a print of which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect .
Eight years after Riodoce was established , the newspaper won the prestigious award of Maria Moors Caboti for his reports in Latin America .
In the same year in Valdez , the Committee for the Protection of journalists ( AKK ) won the Sakharov Prize for international freedom of the press for its courage to follow the Mexican drug creation wherever it takes .
He openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to move forward , &quot; he said that he adopted the AKK award .
Last October , in an interview given to the television channel Rompeviento TV , he said that drug trafficking is a way of life for you .
&apos;To take on board the challenge posed by journalists &apos; offices by Yemen &apos;s second chance to play the game .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not talk about what is going on . &quot;
Riodoce collelova strives Valdez , a joke who roppered like madrus , a friend who generously divided embryos and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
They gave their support to his stupidity .
He was always wearing his village .
He went across the office to El Wogau yabo baari and was always on the same desk .
Now they are asking whether his stubbornness became fatal to him .
His death has also cast them in doubt as to how best to do his job and stay in life .
&quot; They do not like the arrogance of their women , their children , their legitimate businesses , their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; These things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bojorquez .
The result , even in the best times , will be strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination .
Trusting your instincts .
If this is a matter of suspicions , it is a matter of rubbish .
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal , the problem is that &apos; fragrance can be deceived ... , and that is the case with JSE &apos; .
He and others are saying that you no longer have old rules , just as they do not apply in Tamaulik , Veracruz , Guerreros or other states , which are home to the poisonous composition of profitable smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
The landscape is constantly changing .
In the space in which Riodoce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only the button sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
In front of the house , two policemen sought a relaxation out of 40 degrees .
They were appointed by the government to host the offices in the Culiacan centre @-@ class neighbourhoods in a four @-@ day building .
Some of the reporters wondered in a half joke whether these police officers were among the 50 % of the police officers whose Governor himself hailed untrustworthy .
Several months have elapsed since the reporters had travelled to mountainous rural areas where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gangs .
Riodoce &apos;s publication this week dealt with three main features .
One of them was the murder in Yaloa of the former boxing legor Julio Cesar Chavez venna .
In addition , they had a revealing story of government funds being spent on the home city of the Governor .
One of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan was kidnapped by a group of people .
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened , so it was necessary to exercise caution when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of Leicrestauran is both a place for drug traffickers and for the authorities .
Reporter learned from public documents that a restaurant has been registered for the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling institution of the Revolutionary Party ( IRP ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
In recent times , a number of IRP governors have been indicted for a wide coverage of cases of corruption .
Villarline asked the reporter to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Guzman , who wear the name of El Chapo , escaped military betration .
In just a few months previously , readers would have been looking for a copy in Valdez in order to obtain information about kidnapping from the best sources .
&quot; In the past , we would have known what has happened , &apos; said 46 @-@ year @-@ old in Villark , who has had a bang of body construction for him , El Flaco .
&quot; Now all the channels of communication have broken down with our sources . &quot;
The Valdez office has become a reservoid of bridges and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the editorial workers have become something they could never wait for activists on behalf of the press .
Reporter Miriam Ramirez seized a couple of bridges and orientations next morning at the local Prosecutor &apos;s office for another journalist .
In the western state of Michoacan three days after the killing of Valdez .
There has been a burst in the body and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
Journalists from all over the country have become more vocal and underline the phrase &apos; SOS press &apos; as organised protesters on pavements and buildings .
On this day , President Bojorquez will be in Washington in an attempt to collect international support in the Valdez case .
A day after the death of Valdez , when he met with Your licence Governor , Mr Ramirez accused the authorities of crying out for journalists and killing them for telling the truth .
Since then , he asked for he to be diverted from government action elsewhere , concerned that hatred has affected objectivity .
Valdez had said on repeated occasions that Mexican journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ guilty state officials and an indifferent society .
In his last book entitled &apos; drug media &apos; , he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also carried out under the command of politicians and security forces involved in the fight against organised crime .
Articulo 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , awarded more than half of the attacks by journalists on the police and public officials last year .
&apos;In Mexico you happen , because you want to keep quiet , &apos; Ramirez said .
There will obviously be a bloody impact .
No one will forget the death of the blogger , Maria Elizabeth Macia , in the northern border state in Tamaulik six years ago .
She was found dead with a letter which probably had been signed by the cartel LOS Zetas : &apos; I am here because of my reports &apos; .
The computer glass offices and elephants hanged alongside his beloved head .
Some of the publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the northern border state of El Norte , Chihuahuahua , following the killing of their correspondent Aung slava BSoth in March .
Others will pass on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did following the murder of their president in 2004 .
In 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly to the drug cartel with the editorial &apos; What do you want ? &apos;
Some journalists have fled their home states , or even their country .
It is a nervous decision .
It is difficult to find a job in theory , and they still have to boast today in order to avoid dangers .
And sometimes behind them , as was probably the case with photographi Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered three months after Veracruz in 2015 , along with four women &apos;s people in Mexico .
Those who remain there and continue to work will have to refute risky decisions on a daily basis .
Someone who once wanted to become a poet admits that reflection of the drug business frightens him .
&quot; Mexico is on its way to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
At the midnight of one recent Friday , when the latest number had already been buried , Riodoce &apos;s editor swept on the office and beating beer when all phones suddenly started to be calibrated .
In Mazatlanis , a staunch monastery city , 19 people had been killed according to validated data in fire exchanges between rival gangs and the security forces .
The war escort continued , just as a number of messages retained by cartels found in the area also promised .
According to the same pavements , reporters issued news on the Riodoce site using a mobile phone .
In the front of next day there was a need to change .
The scenes seized another fire exchange in the Maghreb region .
Mr Bojorquez piilla stood up for the police to see whether they are vigilant .
If they feared , they did not at least show this .
Workers of Riodoce were posted in his footsteps under massive banknotion , where his average finger can be seen for the whole of your mother tongue .
&apos;How could you think about closure , &apos; said Bojorquez , &apos; on the same day that Javier Solana was killed , a traineeship asked me to report to the streets ? &apos;
Dinosaurus used protective colours in order to avoid enemies
At first glance , it looks like a form , albeit rather frightening .
Scientists have now unveiled the first findings in relation to the existence of unbelievable rubbish numbers discovered by a Canadian House , which has so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; dinosaences at Mona Lisat &apos; .
It has maintained so well that it was even possible to find out that the skin covered by his sooms was a red @-@ boy colour , and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
In writing . - ( DE ) The report published in the press published by diabetes described the status quo as &apos; the best preserved soomomalment that has ever been found &apos; , and if &apos; one of the best entries worldwide &apos; .
In the case of fossil fuels , it is a new category of nododge that lived in the middle of the seasond era , from 110 to 112 million years ago .
Its incredibly good retention in Raba was carried out by theatres who describe it as &apos; truly significant &apos; .
According to National Geotheory , this type of phosphorus , which has ever been found , has been best preserved by this charade .
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he extracted Suncor Millenium in Fort McMurray near Northern Albertas in Canada .
It hit something that did not recall the passion surrounding it and decided to look more closely into it .
Identified phosphorus was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology museum .
For the next six years , an animal was set up to extract 2 500 pounds ( 1100 kilometres ) from the land unit .
After all this hard work , the end result will now finally be ready to bring the public ahead .
&quot; If a little eyes are torn up , he can almost believe he is sleeping , &quot; said Caleb Brown , the editor Royal Tyrrell Museum , where he is stunned .
&quot; This goes down in scientific history as one of the richest and most brilliant dinosaur - dinosaur Mona Lisana . &quot;
When studying his skin , she found out that this vegetation session , which is covered by soaps and resembles divisive tank , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food compounds .
This compound dinosaur used a red and white sense of protection in order to deceive itself against predators and applied sheltering techniques , which are referred to as &apos; shelter &apos; and are also used by many of today &apos;s animals .
According to the experts , the dinosaurs said that it made it easier for a dinosaur to penetrate and the enemies to be prevented , as they were most likely to be hunted by major dinosaences .
For the first time in May , this figure , which belongs to the family of nodosatologists aged 110 million , arrived in news and is now visited in the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology museum .
The theatres have now looked at the existence and gave it the name of the Borealopelta Marmitchelli museum , mark Mitchell , who was part of a team that spent more than 7 000 hours in order to reveal the pain .
Thanks to the amazing survival of his father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to document the shape and size of Finns .
They found refuge - a common method of protection in the animal state - which meant that there was a dam on the outskirts side of statehood as lower .
Even though there has been a lack of objectivity , findings come as a surprise , since Borealopelta is much higher than those of animals with responsibility today .
This suggests that dinosaur pressure was sorely hunted enough by other compound compounds , that evolutions were preferable instead of prevarication as a tactic of survival instead of confrontation .
However , most of the animals used today , such as dams , pigs or meals , are far smaller and much more vulnerable , indicating that nodosaurus had to make a real effort to survive .
&quot; The vigorous cooling @-@ off of the dinosaur with huge and abundant acids shows how dangerous it might have been to predatory animals in the seasonic era , &quot; said Brown .
A chemical analysis of organic compounds of diabetes was also revealing that a dinosaur &apos;s skin was a red boom .
Scientists will continue to provide an investigation in order to get angles about this life , including retained content of this style , in order to find out what the animal would last a friend .
They believe that the dinosaur has fallen victim to brutal rivers , thereby entering the sea , where it turned its back into an ocean bed .
At the time , Albertas was the same soe as now in South Florence , and rivers and oceans were likely to extend far further to the internal land than they are today .
&quot; This nodosaurus is truly significant , since it has fully preserved soustic skin , but it has also remained three @-@ dimensional while preserving the original shape , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; As a result of this , the animal today looks almost the same as in the seasonic age .
To reconstruct it does not need to make much use of imagination - it is enough simply to put our eyes to it , and it seems to be like sleeping . &quot;
There was a time of crisis in the earth , when huge volumes of compound compound compound compound compounds - sweeteners - drowned .
Even though their Queen Tyrannosaurus rex lived many millions more years later than Borealopelta , some of his frightening predecessors could have hunted out of this astronomic dinosaur .
These include Acrocanthosaurus , 38 legs ( 11.5 metres ) , a long and six @-@ tonne monster .
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta uhuta was stunned after death in the sea , and that this muzine was muddled .
On 21 March 2011 , Shawn Funk was detected when he extracted from Fort McMurray in the Millenium mine to northern Albertas in Canada .
According to Muuseum , it is best preserved by soomomalsis in the world , including skins and Finns , and it is comprehensive from concentration to wood .
These percentages were on average 18 legs ( five meters ) long , up to GBP 3 000 ( 1300 kg ) .
There were two 20 customs queues out of it .
Scientists believe that , through the present Western Canada , this hijacked vegetation compound with sooms , the river that has been flooded flowing through the open sea .
However , the presence of dinosaur at sea helped to maintain its characteristics in an excellent detail .
The glaciers of this particular father , coal , have so well preserved that the mygarchical Homs are still covered by skin glaciers .
As Michael Greshko writes in the National Geosian magazine said : &apos; Such statehood is just as rare as lotovictory .
The more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
The burnt skin glaciers are still covered by mystery stores based on the yellow .
A better front is lying next to him , and the way in which five properties have been blown up .
I will be in a position to lecture Finns in his winter . &quot;
How did one activist find an answer to the question of &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell received complete shock .
Just a few days after the trip to New York , it was celebrated by St. Louka Airbnb on a leaked bed , travelling on Facebook on the phone .
He came on top of the post of his former school companions .
It said : &apos; The police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old adolescents , and he is still on the streets &apos; .
He was confused as to why nobody else had outsourced this information from his stream , so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
Pidega @ TheePMilah &apos;s user &apos;s mail had been handed over several times on his timeline .
Mr St. Syripequality from the region of Louise provided real @-@ time shuttling Michael Brown , on the death of an unarmed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by Mr Ferguson Missouris white police officer .
He gave an image of Brown &apos;s life as a body that was found in the street , living there for four hours .
&quot; It is crazy , &quot; said Ferrell additions .
However , death was nothing new for him or for the community .
He put his phone off , but later in the evening , he looked again at what was announced this time by people gathered in Canfield Drive .
Mr Jagati photographs of the police and the harsh people and a man who claimed to be the father of Brown and kept the &apos; Ferguson police killed just my unarmed son ! &apos; .
In real time , he watched a stream in which the policeman stood before a group of protesters with a hatching house .
In the second video , another policeman , according to him , called &apos; powder and potatoes &apos; : &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Mr Ferrell reminds him of the way in which he struck himself from the point of view : &apos; It is unusual &apos; .
&quot; This is not the kind of murder with which we are accustomed and which we could describe as typical . &quot;
At that point , I was horrified .
I was angry and advised . &quot;
He booked a return flight and went home next day .
Having buried at 23 o &apos;clock , she went to her father for her six @-@ year daughter and decided that they would travel to Ferguson next morning .
What took place next three years with Ferrelli and Ferguson will be central to a new documentary &apos; Whose strikes ? &apos; ( &apos; Whose thanks ? &apos; ) , which will be present in cinemas on 11 August .
It is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who have thanked them for asking for answers .
When Mr Ferreira , together with the daughter - who had a lipsy sticker in the supermarkets and a chat with it - went on to Ferguson , they once again talked about a subject that had come before them several times earlier this morning - the experience and the living conditions of musicians .
&quot; Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &quot;
&quot; We are currently travelling to Ferguson because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys , and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I was not able to participate in it , &quot; said Ferrell later .
&quot; What is happening now is the culmination of ... what happened in the past .
It needs to know and see this and grow in the middle of it .
It needs to learn about a activists and organisation and , at the same time , also know the different layers of experience and living conditions of musicians and what we need to do in order to get rid and free ourselves .
Even if I manage to raise him in such a way that he does not personally copy brutal racism , he does not differentiate from some other black girls .
I feel I would be doing him a disservice if I were to protect him from this world . &quot;
The first stop they did in the vicinity of Fergusoni was by the South Florissanti - the policeman in the filling ground , which had become a kind of camps where activists were waiting for news about the policeman Darren Wilson , who was not finally charged with charges .
There , Mr Ferreira and his daughter united forces with the local business owner , who drew up southern birds .
They brought together food homes and helped to spread them to the protesters .
For Ferrelli , a new type of activist was slow to take shape .
&quot; My activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that , when he was a student at Missouri @-@ St. Louise University , he was President of the Alliance for Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organisation .
All of this was just laissez &apos;être &apos; .
Over the weeks later , at the time of the Ferreira evening demonstration , she met a film co @-@ director , Sabaah Folayanan .
Mr Folayan said that he and the film operator , Mr Alvarado @-@ Farrar , simply wanted to document what is happening .
In the face of Ferrelli , there was a question : &apos; Are you trying to document what is going on or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
Such scepticism was due to countless cases in which people - often white ones - come to the community and try to take advantage of its generosity and resilience .
Folayan explained in a recent interview : &apos; We had heard that the voice of people born and growing in Ferguson would not be heard , and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Folayan had already put his hand in hand with Damon Davati , an artist in the region who was well @-@ known for activists in connection with prisoners sentenced to death .
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrelli and for the other six others , who were watched for years by Whose street ets .
&quot; In this documentary , no one will speak for us or for us , but talk to us , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; It was important for me how these people are portrayed , because that is how I am portrayed . &quot;
Even though the aim was not to focus on Ferrelli &apos;s experience - the intention was to show that the Movement is not a &apos; donor leader , but a community bringing together &apos; , as Mr Folayan said - he made the most open part of the film .
As a result , &apos; Whose Streets ? &apos; , surprisingly personal aspects of the life of Ferrell , such as ruthfulness and marriage with his wife .
&quot; I felt as if I had started , &quot; said Ferrell when he said that first time that he was ready to see the city .
&quot; However , I realised that there must be a certain vulnerability when it comes to doing this work and humanising black people . &quot;
What is more , Ferrell &apos;s story emphasises and puts the role of the black LGBT woman once again at the heart of the wider Black Sea Lives Matter movement .
Two of the three initiators of the movement , who thought in the social media in 2012 following the killing of the black teenagers , Trayvon Martin , the hashtag # BlackLivesMatter , are homosexuals .
&quot; In the leading role of black homosexuals , women in general have kept the movement alive , &quot; said Ferreira , and this is precisely because we must constantly fight on several fronts .
Mustanabad homosexuals must bear all this burden . &quot;
Folayan agreed , stating that &apos; movement will indeed keep black women alive , many of which are black homosexuals &apos; .
At the same time , he says that &apos; this is not something of a kind to create equal opportunities &apos; - Ferrell was not chosen as the centre of the film because of his identity .
&quot; He was a man of whom the right energy was evening , &quot; he said .
&quot; However , it is not a coincidence that he went directly on the frontline , because there is a great deal at stake as black LGBT women living in such hubs .
His energy can count on the screen . &quot;
At the same time , news cameras from Ferguson have long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police remain fragile .
The conditional sentences imposed on Mr Ferrell during his demonstration for blocking the road lasts for another 2.5 years .
He describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region he calls home simply as a &apos; huge free threat &apos; .
Nonetheless , it still attaches importance to the mantra that it has been eating memory since it took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago .
&quot; It is our duty to fight for our freedom .
It is our duty to win .
We must love and support each other .
We have nothing more to lose than our chains . &quot;
7 examples on how to overcome Weekise du potuathon
Some of the most stubborn mechangers will find help after a little bit of fat pipes .
Or on the basis of the words &apos; How a potaque &apos; , the cradle of the Nazis .
However , this is only an inevitable postponement and a decent blessing for health .
What can you do in order , after today and tomorrow &apos;s Weekise line - or other pipes - to feel better on this morning and to overcome poppy as painfully as possible ?
Joo Water .
For alcohol and vice versa , after a big pile in the morning ... or possibly even alcohol instead .
As the body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it must in some way be recovered .
Minerals will also be thrown out of the body together with water , and sestap is a good hair of mineral water .
Since , in the aftermath of the recession , sweeteners are often irritated , it is particularly good if it is bubble @-@ free , or only lightly regulated .
Let us walk away .
It would certainly not be a cost of splitting trees to the grandmother - it might prove fatal for the wrong decision .
However , an easy walk @-@ out helps the body to remember once again what the feeling is in life .
Sleeping and sleeping in Telgis is a more time @-@ consuming way of becoming a whole .
Give poor energy back gradually and cautiously .
If you are on the verge of overdrinking yesterday , it will certainly not be worth trying to hire a heavy fat cradle .
For example , a refreshant of fresh soya containing fruit fabricks is set up in silence as a body .
If health is already suffering in the South , for example weddings could be tried .
And a little later , it is clear .
An isolated coffee .
This diure tachom will free up the body from the last water .
As has already been said , water and volume are your friends .
There is a commitment to painkillers .
If you take a painkiller in order to prevent poppy in the evening , you will have to deal not only with alcohol , but you will also have to deal with paratsetal or ibuproprov , and you will lose so much .
So many of them will pay even more and , in the future , boys will be worse .
What is more , painkillers do not remain in the coffers for a very long time .
If you take a painkiller in the morning , let us do it with an empty piece - it annoys your already tired sweat .
Or if you do not have a partner , then you can do well with you .
There will be something like walking , but there will be no orgation when you walk .
However , too active a pace and an outrageous bet were excluded : The physical effort should be moderating during the poppy season .
The road joke .
The words of friends of the time , friends of friends of friends of friends of the past , paternalism and Nazis friendly about both himself and others ( suffering ) .
Nali and laughter may not do a pocket , but it is certainly easier for them to follow .
For once , the boy goes over anyway !
University of Northwestern professors and Oxford workers are sought as suspects in murder .
According to the police , a university professor at Northwester University and the University of Oxford who have received suspicions following the deadly petty petty petty wives of male people are being sought as one of Chicago &apos;s luxury records .
According to judicial documents by Cook &apos;s county , on Monday , arrests were issued for 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni , accused of being arrested at first instance on account of their alleged involvement in Trenton H. Cornell @-@ Duranleu .
According to the documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Duranhanu died after repeated seals .
According to the warning that Chicago &apos;s police station issued to the community , the deceased was found on 27 July .
Police officers received telephone calls and found a victim who had a number of tubes at the Grand Plaza Corterhouse .
According to the officials , in Cornell @-@ Duranhanu , there has been recognition to be dead , and investigators are treating rape as murder , while the police are actively looking for two suspicions .
Mr Lavid has served as co @-@ professors of micro @-@ biology and immunology at the University of Northwester since 2007 .
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations , said in a statement sent as an e @-@ mail that Ladows have now been temporarily removed from work and that he is forbidden to enter the towns at the University of Northwester .
&quot; This is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of Northwester works with investigators , &quot; said Cubbage .
Mr Warren is a senior assistant at the University of Oxford .
The representative of the University and Somerville College said in an email statement : &apos; We have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist US research authorities in every possible way &apos; .
In addition , the statement stated that Warreni colleagues were shocked and that they wanted him to present himself .
Anthony Guglielm , Head of the Communications Department of Chicago , urges the authorities , with suspicion .
&quot; The police have an idea of where they are present , but we are dealing increasingly intensively with defining the exact whereabouts , &quot; said Guglielm .
According to Guglielm , suspects will be helped both by local , regional and national authorities .
Guglielm said that the police had received a telephone call from the Grand Prix Corterhouse , who had just received a kryptic allude that there has been something happening in Corps No 1008 .
According to the police , it was a spectacular spectacle .
According to Guglielm , it is not clear whether the event itself was also taking place on 27 July .
He said that security cameras confirm the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building .
&quot; We believe that Professor Lathares and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
It sent a letter to the people : &apos; The police is currently working to find a background to events and victims , and will look at various motives , including the possibility of family litigation &apos; .
Firms that help your company avoid becoming the next UbB
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were unprofitable .
The responses were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
And even if he promised anonymity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; This system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Errett , who is leading the company Madison Reed , which sells e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees in San Franciscos .
Therefore , it called on external actors to help .
Start @-@ ups with new types of human resources are disappearing , helping businesses to find out what their workers feel .
By developing and licensing software to measure the involvement of workers , they enable companies to carry out flash surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , offer anonymity to workers and complaint hotlines and , in some cases , allow insurers to bypass the C level leaders and address the Bureau directly .
&apos;There are now tools such as Strava and Fitler , which are meant to monitor health , but where is Fitbi for your company ? &apos; Asked Jim Barnett , co @-@ founder and CEO , Redwood City start @-@ ups Glint , whose software analysts are used by companies to measure workers &apos; inclusion .
According to Erretti , he has received a much better overview of what he thinks and knows in the three years that he has used Glinti .
In addition to investigations and specific team studies , it provides for a company &apos;s heating card , which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support , enabling them to identify the causes .
Companies have begun to understand that they have to remain familiar with their professional culture so as not to become the next UbSR , which has been torn up in scandals ever since the former worker published a blog mail , which described the harassment of those who dared to take the floor .
For start @-@ ups such as Gpoultry , the desire to have an overview is a profitable business option .
Global governance , regulation and conformity can be worth more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020 , according to a website of financial ethics statistics .
Denveris Colorado , a start @-@ up firm in Denverit , designed to help companies prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , observed an interest and an increase in activity this year against a background of the dubious reputation of Uberia .
FIFcentil has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
Ubber has recently registered himself as a customer .
Just like Glinles , Ljubljana allows companies to send tailor @-@ made impulse polls , to collect in real time confidential responses and to look at the problem areas of heat cards .
It will also provide a anonymous message book which will enable workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
And when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; Public opinion is anchored by the regulatory authorities , &quot; Chris Quinlan , founder and Managing Director of Acccenti said .
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act unethically , it could face serious consequences , such as consumer boycotts , the departure of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ruby flu , restaurant , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of activity , has been used for more than a year , in order to ensure workers &apos; awareness of the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way of communicating with the corporation headquarters .
When an employee wanted to announce the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone telephone number or an email address at the corporation headquarters , he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously .
This was often a damning and inconvenient process , James Vitrano , the general adviser of Ruby theory , said that there was no good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
At the same time , however , now that a company is in possession of EMAS , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices , which did not end up in the past with leaders who acted more quickly in offices located in other cities or states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I have the opportunity to get closer to the hollow experience of workers of 360 degrees , &quot; said Vitrano , who chairs Ruby hood &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; And we protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and employee involvement more seriously in 2002 , after the collapse of the auditor Arthur Andersen as a result of ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal .
However , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they could not obstruct their black washing on the web .
&quot; Before using the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
Both Glint and Acccent offer their own software as a service by making companies pay periodically for the use of their products .
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supporting both start @-@ ups .
Acccenti financed USD 10 million in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by EUR 47 million .
Glinti invested USD 10 million in Bessemer Venture partners in November , increasing the company &apos;s total funding to USD 60 million .
Investments of this kind do not come as a surprise , taking into account interconnection between companies , culture and venture capital .
More and more research shows that today &apos;s workers expect more jobs than in the past .
In more competitive markets , such as Silicon Valley , high wages and interesting projects are mere contributions on the table .
The workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and devote their time to a company that has a positive mission .
&quot; If people are fortunate in the company , they feel they are listening to them and that the work they do is satisfying , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said Nina McQueen , Vice @-@ President LinkedInis , who has general benefits and staff experience .
Investors make a profit if their portfolio companies do a good job ; businesses do well when workers are committed and involved .
It is no wonder if analytical tools from the third party promise to increase the commitment and involvement of workers .
It is important , according to experts in the field of worker inclusion , to have data on worker inclusion .
However , these data will be useless if the company monitors do nothing with them .
In fact , when a company requests feedback from its employees , it can lead to expectations that change will occur .
And if the changes do not take place quickly enough or not at all , they could cause disappointment and decrease the involvement of workers .
&quot; When you ask 4 000 proposals , you need to be ready for 4 000 conversations , &quot; said Kotter International President Russell Raath , who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&quot; Because , if things do not stop , the workers think : &apos; Did you actually listen to me ?
Do you care ?
And if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
According to Erretti , the Madison Reeval , who is now carrying out six studies among employees , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via Glinti .
And , after receiving feedback from disappointed workers on the pace of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , he was able to reorganise a number of teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems .
However , Ruby Cameroon is collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will result in a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in industry known for its massive turnover .
&quot; If you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vitrano .
&quot; If you lose people , you will lose customers .
And if you lose customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
Euro area stagnating mark is Baltics : Incomes grow rapidly
Even though the crisis in 2008 and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on Bali , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , with reference to the report of the European Central Bank .
According to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania exceeded expectations .
There are low debt burdens , fast @-@ improving institutions and business @-@ friendly and free market @-@ friendly policies behind success .
&quot; The Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area , where the EU average has been substantially converted from the net per capita GDP . &quot;
Although the aim is that total economic output per capita compared to the richest Western Europe , in 2015 , the aggregate output of the Baltic economies amounted to only 2 / 3 / 15 of the average population of 15 countries belonging to the European Union prior to the enlargement of 2004 .
Low wages have led them to look for better wages abroad .
Although the European Central Bank sees Bali in a positive light and the economy grows this year too , the local population is not enthusiastic .
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies are going very well or rather well .
In the Czech Republic and Poland it was thought little less about the economies of their own countries than half of those questioned .
NCAA &apos;s decision to cancel two times a day @-@ to @-@ day trends will change the days of Bruinsi .
It is almost 23 o &apos;clock when thrombond UCLA footballers stop talking at the end of a new exercise at the University of the team .
Some of them have put a burden on the back of their company , revealing their efforts for the first day of the training camp .
For a large part of the team , these gang minutes offer midday couples .
Players taking part in cucurious courses will go back , after three hours , to classrooms , before going back to Wandarman &apos;s footwear at 6.30 next morning .
&quot; The next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mora , the Bruinsi treghter , a little earlier than on Tuesday .
NCAA &apos;s decision to cancel two times a day to reduce the burden on players has , in fact , made their days longer - at least until the end of the winds on one side on Friday .
For this reason , the UCLA was prompted to launch three first operations at 19.15 in order to fit players into an already tight timeline .
Moving from two strikes a day will mean more day - the beginning of the Bruinsi training camp was raised almost a week ahead compared with the previous season and , for the first time in Mora &apos;s six Westwood season , there will be visits during summer courses .
They intend to have 18 trends up to 20 August , before starting formal preparations for the launch in Texas A &amp; M in September .
According to Mr Mora , he is in favour of a change to the NCAA rule , even though it adds another item to the close schedules of players .
&quot; Three or four days have an enormous burden , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; And they break themselves through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that , when we arrive on Saturday and we have more time , it will be really a little bit . &quot;
When the camp is over , UCLA &apos;s tour operations will be closed , which is not an easy task at all , however , given a clear view of the parking record close to their fields and of the absent Luskini centre , a higher @-@ class hotel that has already escaped off the net of protection around the gates .
Since this weekend , hotel Bruinsi players are occupying , but Mora recognised that there could be problems with free tobacco during the season .
&quot; We are implementing security measures , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; This is a real cause for concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can portray a dose and a filter from there .
If the summer has a record leaflet , it can do quite a good deal .
However , we use a security team there and 8 parking stations .
Let us do our best by using our existing ones .
I am trying not to be very concerned about this .
We have a plan in place . &quot;
In the case of Saduare @-@ Ivanova electoral union born to the central political party , Kristiina Ojuland , who was evicted from the Reform Party , as well as from ECREG , we in Tallinn and the political parties , who are forced out of Maria Kaljorians , seem to be taking part in local elections at least as much as political parties this year .
Buses will , however , be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointing voters for them all .
Who will stay on the island ?
If the Support Office of Edgar Salevare reduced , events may be expected to honour his election union .
A member of a national assembly , a few former and present central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
And why is it that some of the supporters and sisters of Saduare evade candidacy in Tallinn , and why is it possible to look for a company &apos;s &apos; Saduare list &apos; to be turned into a reality at the head of corruption and suspected of corruption ?
In any case , the municipality &apos;s music cameras film to the Russian poem , in which she participates the elderly in the city of Lasnamäe ; and an initial computer game in which the prime minister , Jüri Rata , has to avoid lomnipe and hurricans who are on his way when travelling - will the central party , for the first time , seek votes to be allowed by the 1616 and 17 year @-@ old electors ?
We look forward to seeing other political parties &apos; vision of a youth @-@ based election campaign .
In the event that , from the beginning of August , there will be two options left to the Kanal 2 or TV3 viewers , instead of the beginning of August , there will be a black hole : To accept that , in future , there will only be an ETV , ETV2 , ETV + , Tallinn TV and English @-@ speaking France24 channels or to donate ten @-@ monthly TV operators .
There will probably also be those who openly rejoice about advertising @-@ free television experience at the start , but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and advertisements .
According music , folding people and rubbish left on the streets are unpleasant by almost every major musical plot .
However , if you do not want to be part of the honey yourself , it would be worth going home rather than being painted at home - and leaving the Coptic place of sleeping to the festivals .
Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
Media publications are quoted by President Donald Trumpi , who says that there is a plan for a new US immigration plan that amends the rules of the Green Card .
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people a year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ orientated visas .
The new rules have been proposed by Republican people , and the President supports them .
The draft law goes to the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; This law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money because it will change the way in which green cards are issued to US citizens .
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
The new application process provides an advantage to candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that come to benefit our economy , &quot; said Trump , according to media publications in the United States .
Siberia seto youngsters return to the city , retired people to the land .
Jevseyev Anatol continues the famous seto gold miners along the River Maana .
She works 140 kilometres away from home to Maana tributaries at Kuvai as a motor driver .
This is a hard job : Two months and months after rest , 12 hours of work and then only 10 days at home and again .
During the three years spent by the Archtel , Anatol has seen gold only once .
&quot; There is a resounding procedure : When we go into it , you will check thoroughly that you do not lead to it , and if you turn out that you don &apos;t take it , you will talk Anatol .
Mare Piho spoke in the village of Haida with the local seto Jaga , who has spoken a great deal to him about the memory of his family in Siberia .
The archaic culture still preserved by Siberian setos will also have an impact on homes , because it is just so shocking that Piho Mare , in most detail , believes in remote setos .
His first investigation trip to Siberia will pass for 30 years this year .
During that time , he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year .
However , how much went to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here ?
This is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took note of this according to the words of Siberia seto men , who themselves have thought about it .
It is difficult precisely to say , because at that time up to 30 people could come to one group , but the passport was only given to a man .
The passport was given only one thing , but was children , sisters , etc .
Look at how great this territory was here .
It was many times greater than that of the historian .
After all , it was necessary to educate , manage it in some way .
Motherhood came here as farmers , but their lives changed , because they came to areas that were not only involved in agriculture , but also in rivers ( palgiparation ) , gold mines , industry .
For example , in New @-@ Petseri , a large number of compounds arrived later in Krasnojarsk @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P. ) when it was formed .
Did the Seimas form the majority of the population in the region at that time ?
Yes , they lived on a paternalistic basis .
In addition , the tradition continued to marry for a long time with one another , and a great deal of child abduction .
Seven to eight children in the family was common .
How many cultures of Siberian mixtures differed and different from those of mother land ?
They are different , even though what has been said here was once the same there .
They gave rise to a great many kinds of popular ideas .
They then also made a difference ( ideas of peoples ) , but they always made a distinction between what had been brought about and what has been done here .
Climate change has had a major impact on the traditional rivalry of pigs , because there is plenty here .
The proposed changes have changed .
Setomaal , for example , was skinned , but it was simply frozen here .
Where are the villages of Siberian setopes and what life will live there ? / graphics : Alari Paluends
The link with the mother country was spiritually strong ; it was regarded as very important .
It seems to me that now it is going to give back the Setuony , it will affect them .
Those girls who have lived here in their families have listened to amazing stories .
Piho is thinking of the people of the Estonian delegation , who came to Haida visiting the Kingdom of Haida at the beginning of July and lived four days in homes - J. P .
What is still here is shocking .
&quot; It is all too easy to come and go , too , because the city has an excellent location : Railway hubs and roads at the crossroads , &quot; says Reigo Tamm , who comes from Tapy .
The city is no longer just a military capital , we have a great deal of creativity , sports and cultural places , and the bull gets anywhere .
Tapa is a tip @-@ pop in the city !
There is a small island along the current White river where the tablets tend to be hijacked .
&quot; This beautiful place does not seem to appear on the train window , &quot; don Reigo .
Anyone who is not afraid of cold water will be able to swim in the river , because the river is full of resources .
I have been swamped there ; you can do it !
The river &apos;s water can keep a long time and just do a romantics - it is possible to look at it and to think about life and behind it .
I , too , have come to grips with my kidnappings there .
Ooperisist Tamm has , apart from anything else , visited the river basin to get used to three bridges : &apos; That place lies along the city , no one can come to answer if I say my own stories &apos; .
&quot; There is a wonderful view of the Tapy mountain , but there are also wholesalers where you can drinks , skips and now , for example , Sgolf play - golf paths have been made , stores can borrow from sports centres . &quot; Says Reigo .
Of course , the old protagonists go there with their system , but I have not yet been able to play there .
Obviously , Mrs Rasmus Goll Tapale has to be invited , because she has experienced a discgolf fan , and she has chains in place .
Perhaps he lends to me .
Reigo and Männikull mountains were inseparable from the current nomineteen years of self @-@ operism .
At least during hours .
There have been a lot of tears left for this memory , disappointments , and you can in my sporting life .
Not to mention broken belts and slogans .
&quot; The entire city is now full of construction works , all of which will become unknown , &quot; praised Reigo .
However , the old and tired stick building is a very attractive place in which oral discoveries are being played .
I am pleased that , in 2012 in R.A.A.A.A.M , the head of R.A.M welcomed my idea and had to make an oral summer theatre with his theatre .
Even though this year &apos;s theatre entitled &apos; Alegai Karenin &apos; has just gone through , on 11 August , the railway station &apos; Elluwake &apos; , when the old building is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; From 11 to 13 August , the city of Tapa has Day , which has opened doors and clothes of cultural activities , among other things , will also mention Reigo , who is proposing to visit the city from 9 to 11 days .
In the tiny three houses of 1 May , the museum has already been in place since 1994 .
&quot; The house is small , but there is a great deal of publicity , and there is a huge amount of information , &quot; applauds Reigo , which is full of the history of the city of Tapa , most of which focuses on railways and sisters .
Reigo muds that , if you go through all of the recommended sites in Tapal , you will lose a lot of hot air , but , fortunately , the small city is full of coffers .
&quot; We have such good eating places and , when you sit in coffee offices , you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad , he describes him .
Educated and young soldiers coming to Tapy spend a great deal of time in bottles and cafés sitting there , a mixed feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home city , but it is an international company together .
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French people or the Americans .
Soldiers , yes , we have a great deal to do .
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering .
Telecanal bTV quoted the Foreign Department , which announced that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering .
In the morning of 1 August , the police arrested people who illegally ordered a group on the Sithonia Peninsula , including two Bulgarians .
They were released on the same day , but an investigation is under way .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulgarians were later released .
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing heavy fines on all those who do not provide for it .
Checks will continue throughout the season .
According to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
The wolves that teach the people are breaking up the sheep .
Breeders will once again have to give the wollahs their fur &apos; educational material after year - the wolves that apparently teach the wagons have already broken a number of sheep .
This year the wolves in Hiiu &apos;s county have broken sheep three times : 23 lamps and eight have been wounded ; Hiiu is writing page .
There were only three , one year before 124 .
There is also data from the Environment Agency in syndrome , where soil was not born on Hishells , and the information from the How hunting Council was obtained that this year , two wolves were fixed on the island .
Forty @-@ six @-@ day cracks were unleashed against the Ööl in the village of Emtens Kabuna from 15 lamps and injured the 18 survivors .
In the afternoon of Wednesday , the wolves in the village of Rehetolla hit one sheep and badly injured the other , who had to carry out an emergency killing .
Rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear .
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment ( GMOs ) and amending plant protection law .
The amendment of the law removes the creation of a separate collection of data both for genetically modified crops ( GM ) sites and operators , using the plant health register in the future .
In addition , it amends the obligation for GM farmers to have a prior agreement with the designated person dealing with beekeeping .
Although at the moment GM crops are not cultivated in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of non @-@ GM crops .
This is at least as long as there are no decisions to declare Estonia GM @-@ free , &quot; Sigmar Suu Kyi , President of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs , said .
&quot; At the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed need to be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and the public sector into account , in addition . &quot;
The draft law repeals provisions relating to the data collection and treatment of GM crops and operators , lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and for the start @-@ up of economic activities .
Specifically with regard to beekeeping , the current obligation to inform beekeepers of the cultivation of GM crops will be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeepers prior to starting cultivation .
The draft law has been sent to ministries for coordination .
All interested parties will have the opportunity to find out about this in the draft information system and , if they so wish , to present their views to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
The planned changes affect , in particular , those operating in the plant farming sector , beekeepers and the agricultural profession .
In the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 810 - has been authorised to grow .
Up to now , however , no Estonian farmer is interested in the cultivation of GM crops .
This is due to the fact that in Estonia there will be no sweeteners , no European media relaxation , on which mon 810 lines are resistant .
There are also the ordings of this landline for southern regions , and this in May will not be appropriate for our climate conditions .
In order to be secure , in 2015 and 2016 , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies to detect potential contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various suicides , maize and soya varieties cultivated in Estonia .
An analysis of the samples carried out showed that seeds were not included externally , and the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soya in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms .
In turn , one can conclude that in Estonia , GM crops are not grown consciously , and it has also been confirmed that there has not been random contamination .
Mr Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United in the form of Nemanja Maticu , &apos; genius &apos; .
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United Kingdom , in the form of Nemanja Maticu , has hijacked &apos; genius &apos; , after having made its debate on Wednesday evening against a central player .
A player bought over GBP 40 million from Chelmer in Dublin launched the most recent post @-@ birth game at UEFA Super Cupi line against Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 victory in the algorithology , while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on attacks .
However , having sidelined Mrs Fischer &apos;s seasonal ban on Asia , Maticl was in dire need of swimming and opposed to only 45 minutes , which , according to Mourinho , must be corrected by a firm prior to the start of Premier League season .
&quot; He needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genious nonsense - he has the courtesy of football , &quot; said Mourinho .
&quot; We will help him to achieve a form as soon as possible . &quot;
At the Aviva stage , other newly recruited Victor Lindelof and Romeva lu Diamandouros and Mourinho suddenly started to put in place a man starting at the beginning of the season .
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers , but confirmed that the club had already carried out &apos; excellent work &apos; by concluding contracts with three of its four priority languages .
&quot; I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four , &quot; he added .
&quot; I am even happier if they can carry out four of them , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
Yet another warm poet walked onto GSM Embassy on 1 August and this time in Muhus .
Mati Martinson , who lives in Shuves , has received the first battery pot in SCarves , and this washing cell is flying around , has left the washing ground and joined a large workload in the Mullutu @-@ Great Gulf .
This is because there are , after all , no fertility fields , the island &apos;s voice is written .
This Tuesday , in order to beat the Kurds a little too late , there was yet another boy to the fate of the perpetrator on the island of Muhu .
According to Martinson , the installation of embassies is , in fact , an international project carried out by Aundr Leito and Ivar Others .
Soil was supplied by a poet called Mati GSM Embassy in Turkey .
&quot; His activities on the internet are all visible : How he went to Spain in winter , back a little while on the border between Germany and Poland , and then Saareland came , Martinson spoke .
The British inventor was forced to install a microchip in his own body in order to gain access to a handful of houses and cars .
The British inventor became the first person in a country installed a microchip in order to be able only to open up his or her lead , to get to the office and even to launch a car .
33 @-@ year @-@ old Steven Northam Estoniam Estoniam &apos;s children to install a small chip between their fingers and their lists , and is now also offering this service to businesses and private individuals who wish to make their lives easier with technology .
He has combined forces with Dr Geoff Watson , a consultant @-@ anestesiologist at Hampshire &apos;s County in Winchester in Hanoi , in order to ensure compliance with medical standards with the installation procedure .
Technology is similar to that of microchip installed on cats and dogs , and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure .
The Northam company is also changing the locks of houses and cars in order for them to be compatible with chips by asking for GBP 300 for a snow .
The father of a child in a married life has stationed the technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4 , which will start when he has his hands on the wheel .
The White House &apos;s audit cost to the taxpayer for thousands
According to military documents made public to the magazine last month , the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicopter last month to the horror of the United States to the taxpayers of USD 24 000 .
Green and white colours Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , termed Marine One during the President &apos;s office , were central to the event that took place on 17 July in the White House on American construction programmes .
Vice @-@ President Donald Trump , Vice @-@ President Mike Pence , and senior officials of the White House , unveiled industrial products from all 50 countries on their move .
A helicopter built in Connecticutis was sponsored along with a clone from reputation , a fire @-@ fighting car from Wisconten and a walker made in Mississip .
Mrs Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX @-@ 1 ) , the chief office responsible for the operation of the HeliCopter , ordered the presence of a helicopter in the military office of the White House to take a little 36 hours before a helicopter for a &apos; unusual &apos; event in the southern Council .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an unusually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said HMX @-@ 1 komcommandör a day before the event , in an e @-@ mail , to your top naval officer in the field of aviation .
According to the message , the helicopter will arrive in the southern horror on 17 July morning at 7 : 00 : 00 : 00 : 00 , and will remain there as long as the war between 18 and 21 takes place .
What was included was the fact that , if the departure from the White House were supposed to take place , there would be a need for a return flight due to restrictions on working time , for a second agitation .
During the event , the original flight team was at helicopter level , and the security team of the estur remained close to the aircraft throughout that period of stay on the ground .
It was not possible to find out from the documents provided for in the magazine whether or not a second amusement was ultimately needed .
Hatch &apos;s law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political ends .
The documents indicate that HMX @-@ 1 examined whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; We asked whether it would violate Hatch &apos;s law , and we were told that there would be no break , &quot; the commander wrote .
&apos;It seems that you do not have the choice , &apos; responded to a senior officer .
The White House declared the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; event to be an official event , and Hatch &apos;s law would not cover it .
However , even official events have political undertones .
At that time , the President backed the efforts of the Health Reform in the Senate and praised attempts to keep government regulations in check .
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force for political gain is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
However , the requirement to use them purely as a photograph is unusual .
In February , his first campaign event in Floridas Melbourne attracted the President &apos;s flight to the background , and his account of Twitter comes across messages complaining about the way in which his predecessor used his flight .
&apos;White l Mal is very pleased with the exhibition &apos; made in America , where products were represented in all 50 countries made up of American workers from American materials , &apos; said Vice @-@ President Lindsay Walters , the spokesman responsible for the White House .
HMX @-@ 1 teams often carry tests around Washington and the southern horror in order to beat the white house of the President of the United States of America with a single cent of precision .
When at the beginning of July in Germany there was the G20 Summit , the HMX @-@ 1 White House held 58 samples .
According to the interpreter , flights to the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; flight crews were considered to be part of a six @-@ month workshop .
Eskaadr helicopters fly another eleven hours later in addition to that day for &apos; non @-@ presidency support missions &apos; .
According to the White House , none of the other sponsors of this event were cutting the taxpayers &apos; wallets .
According to Mr Sikorsky &apos;s representative , a helicopter was not involved in carrying out audit efforts on the southern horror .
HMX @-@ 1 does not maintain budgetary documents for President flights and it will be difficult to find out the exact costs of the event .
However , according to hourly prices by the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017 , VH @-@ 3D will be reimbursed at USD 24 380 per hour .
Monday &apos;s papers marked 30 minutes of its main base for a flight flight from e Quantico to Virginian airport in both directions .
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount .
&quot; It is very misleading to calculate taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated reimbursement rates , &quot; said Walters .
&quot; These estimated reimbursement rates include staff , maintenance and many other irrevocable expenditure , which will be taken into account for annual appropriations . &quot;
According to a study carried out in 2015 , the Ministry of Defence does not include staff costs , although they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
Sean Sharier , a former spokeswoman of the White House , defended the use of helicopter at that time at the event .
&quot; The point is to show things made in America this week , &quot; Sstoper said .
&quot; And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticuti are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds , if not even thousands , of people whose jobs depend on it .
And I believe that , just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on .
So of course it is right to highlight this . &quot;
It is not clear whether or not the Trump tied up a helicopter in the event in the south , but whether or not the fire @-@ fighting car was hiding behind the wheel .
Within the White House , Trump Sikorsky addressed the representatives of the Sikorsky by handing out media outlets about company products in his personal aircraft fleet .
&quot; I know Sikorskis very well , &quot; said the President , I have three of their products . &quot;
Gari Šadeiko - Very arrives for peace and joy .
The 2011 MMil Daetis hit Šadeikot in the last area , 800 mm beverted the footwear , and the back of the stage was taken away with the cannabis .
Shortly before that , he had received zero on China &apos;s litany in China .
In 2012 , the Helsinki Helsinki Wall was a breach of cheap injuries , but in London , it received 613 items 23 .
However , I have continued my misfortune .
After the opening day of 2013 , Moscow MF became a patronage in Estonia as a guide in a quantum leap .
Two years later , he took Beijing &apos;s 15th seat and fulfilled the Olympic Games , but that was even more than what he wanted for the athletes .
Sadeiko was still a bubble through the saddest cab , when it did not get the outcome of the Amsterdam Embassy at the very beginning .
I would simply like to put together one proper multi @-@ contest once or again .
Once &apos; , sprayed Šadeiko .
Worse still lies ahead : A month later , his Olympic contest in Rios on account of his resignation was already covered by the first obstacle .
The time had to be taken down - was it necessary to go ahead with 7 competitions at all ?
Is the two @-@ day effort still worthy of all this ?
Neiu thought long , but found peace itself .
Let me think twice !
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have wondered that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
Luckily , there was time for us to treat ourselves as a whole and to think twice .
&quot; I knew I did not put a cocktag on the pill , &quot; Šadeiko talks about his self @-@ determination .
I was able to go ahead with a clean hand and a new momentum .
Treener Anne hill said it was very difficult to look at the suffering of negligence , but he realised that , above all , the sportsman himself had to make his own sense .
After all , he had been locked down so much by everyone .
It was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; However , he said that he will not give up and he wants to prove what he is worth , says Welsh .
There is now some kind of peace for him .
It is doing so to joy itself .
The inauguration came back in May , when Šadeiko established 6280 items in Estonia in a series of competitions in Götzitself .
In a high @-@ level competition , he improved a personal top @-@ class tachocolate with almost a metre ( 13.89 ) and drinks a record @-@ close @-@ time barrier .
At that time , there was a feeling of multiple competition that this is not at all a ceiling , but only a hunger in the first competition was extinguished .
She has been instructed for many years by Nagories that Shadeiko is a Muslim student .
She is ready as a sportsman ; she is well trained .
If something does a problem or is wrong , then he says it right now .
He knows his own body and trust his or her sense .
That is what we need to do .
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and follow it .
A new approach has also been found in Šadeiko .
&quot; I am not the one who makes the most of the trend , &quot; he says and says that it is most important to be able to accept the right sense , because it also provides a good result .
Baby walkers of young children are happy to read .
Good emotion has also offered the words of close relatives to Šadeio .
Both his former teacher , Maris hill and sister Grete , has recently become grandparents and has received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;It has been rather interesting &apos; , says Šadeiko .
One alcohol whose drinking is equivalent to &apos; training &apos; .
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is an elephant of so great wine games that he believes that wine can do better than anything else in the world .
Sheperd is a neuroscientist of Yale University .
His message is not about alcohol , or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
When we stunned , wine was complex , enjoying it and perceiving aftertaste , we are putting our brain to work in order to create a taste for wine .
In the words of Sheperd , there is no real taste in the boxes , but a taste arises from the way in which wine stimulates the brain .
He points out how the brain &apos; sees &apos; colours &apos; .
&quot; Taste is not wine ; taste creates wine as sweet , &quot; says Sheperd .
Things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , the number of our age , summer and even sylje produced by man .
Sheperd is , of course , manageable that wine is not full of Jews .
&quot; There must be more , &quot; he says .
If you take too big a longer , the system will be overloaded .
Excess wine drinking can do no harm to the brain instead of benefits : According to a study in 2004 , people who drink more than three pieces of wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity .
10 % of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay from colleagues
Staff search company fund figures reveal that 10 % of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive lower salaries than their colleagues .
Thirty per cent of the pay gap is between men and women , writes the portal Geenius .
Some 59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay survey .
A total of 8 577 posts was examined .
63 % of posts were carried out by men .
&quot; Even though only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies considered there to be no pay gap , in reality , the average annual salary of men is 10 % higher than that of women and men aged 8 % higher than that of women on average . &quot;
&apos;Narcose &apos; : Now that Pablo Escobar has gone , Netflix hittsars is at the heart of Cali cartel .
Despite the fact that the killer of Pablo Escobari was exposed in the second season of &apos; Narcos &apos; , there is far from an end to Netflix sari &apos; .
The third and fourth season has been validated by the quota intervention service , and the first one has already been produced by a clip of advertising that is stranger with new scams .
In the third season , DEA will turn its attention to the richest drug business organisation in the world - the Cali cartel .
They are acting under the leadership of four powerful Christian fathers , such as Ford 500 companies , simply with more bribery to the government and more violent acts .
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , while Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) has its brain , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) is running links with Mexico and Chepe Santaţz London ( Pepe Rapazote ) operates in New York .
In the advertising clip thrown out , Pedro Pascali will return to Javier Penana as a person recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement assistance in the war against drugs .
Other new players include Matias Varela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt Whell , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .
&apos;Narcos &apos; will have the third wave on 1 September .
According to the United Nations , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the United Nations mission for Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
Nicholas Haysom , head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , said that hundreds of women stand in local Soviet elections , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; By underlining the importance of the role of women it is not possible to be exaggerated , &quot; he said in a statement made on Wednesday .
The elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
Local council elections in Afghanistan and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
The Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coincides with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
This year &apos;s elections celebrate for the first time that power will be calmly handed over from one democratically elected government to the next .
According to Mr Haysom , women play a strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
According to an independent Election Commission in Afghanistan , 1.2 million women have registered from 3.6 million registered voters .
The joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both for the large and for small .
There will always be too little common time , but the trend is a great opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
And what a convenient solution - no matter where in the summer you were wearing , living wills will always accompany the summer , and you will remember with your fine vote : &apos; Let us now also move to the wall ! &apos;
Aelta insulation - It is a very good thing to have a normal gold game , or to fly the flag along the coastline .
One is the basis for persisting in the form of footwear and darkens - who would then like to take the form of sleeping excesses over the summer ?
It is wonderful to use children instead of the chicken !
First of all , it is secure and comfortable , and the difficulty is gradually increasing at the same pace as the training staff .
It will also be possible to make batteries with quite large children .
The child teaches the balance , counts the sentences and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
Larger children may , at the same time , make their own villages .
The scope of the movement lies in the scarcity of the land and in pushing up your hands .
Keeping the fingers straight , the Palu miniablis properly .
A child will be able to read corps and feel like a lecturer .
The planet is an enormous but hopeless exercise for the child .
However , it is easy to do it .
Play @-@ plank : Go to a long planguColonn that is repeated .
In fact , it will be more difficult than usual , but it is much easier to do so if , in the meantime , a friend is able to hand his hands .
If you add the burden , you can keep a planade , you can keep a little on the market , and you can walk around it .
An additional difficulty may be put on the trees of a smaller child , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
While the crabs join the sand , the rock , the ash and the cane meat burden , such as the infection , will become triggers .
The child walks to the shoes in such a way that his or her body is distributed on an equal footing .
For security , you can keep your hands closed .
Overh legs and sister rows up directly .
It is possible to fly , bury , strike a balance and be difficult .
The life of a little lecturer is an exhortation if he gets a small deal in every fire .
There is an additional burden in front of your feet .
Checks will be carried out in order to keep the back on a neutral position .
It is much easier for children themselves to make crons and plagues .
A piece of work and wedding .
Following the child &apos;s safety , the burst , and the ban in a neutral position .
The favourite of all the children and the big fun !
For the elderly , however , there is a truly effective whole body trend .
Ott ( 10 ) , Säde ( 8 ) , happiness ( 4 ) were the sources of sport .
From the Philippines at the heart of mopeds in the wider world , the Anlgkot
Booked bags are the summer clash , which in recent years has become one piece of hitinerant which , even in one of the correct skies , has had to hang the hand and which traders , despite its modest origin , have been able to display a price label on the hijacket .
There is probably one such thing that has existed once in the life of the law and which has not been aroused much emotion .
It simply exists and , if it does not exist , there will be nothing at all .
However , it is now up to the lungs to make a real victory , and mopeds have switched their crown designers against simple bureaucrats for the summer months .
It is not only a coastdog , but today it is also just as popular as a street , and bolder women walk it even into the office .
At this point , however , it is worth making it clear whether this summer is still sitting up , or whether it is still worth postponing the stamp and laptops to a little more official .
However , women &apos;s real love of summer has been given by brewers .
For example , if you look at foreign mosques , the first thing is that movanoghurists will first bring their holidays to the local market and buy some beer bags , which will then be the mirror of entire holiday times , in the market and also as a friend on the city .
Some bloggers are even so generous that they are buying their bags on the market , selling more wolves and selling them or handing them out to their loyal readers .
In doing so , it is worth pointing out that there is a demand among readers so great that women ( and men ! ) in the real world would probably be involved in each other &apos;s fishing ground in order to obtain the happy owners of some dogs .
In some ways , this madness is also understandable , as it is rare if , in fashionism yesterday , it has been possible to buy a couple of pieces of haste for a few tens of euros .
It is true that white merchants have also discovered a simple way of earning money here , and in so doing more luxury brands will also sell bags for a few hundred days and -a thousand euros .
Obviously , in order for rich customers not to have to perceive themselves easy to die by propelling with some cheap dogs .
It is possible , for example , to buy Dolce &amp; Gabbana hand over EUR 1 000 .
However , there is an interpretation of the Changel bregkot that can be found in the circle of EUR 6 000 .
In contrast to most motive buildings , however , there are hardly a few big mosques , but their story originated in a far more distant way .
It is said that it is far removed from the Philippines , where they have been wearing them wide .
There is , first and foremost , the bundling of rubbish dogs there , and there is very often no mention of the export business , and there are local practices around them .
Admittedly , it comes from the 14th century , and it is quite a series of normal corps .
However , given that it does not need as much red tape as corps , they become muscles and other materials that make the copper more personalised and , by extension , more reactive .
In recent times , for example , there are particularly trendy dogs where paints or skins have been packaged .
However , copies can , above all , be sent by actress leader , Jane Birkini , the biggest bunch of copying beer bags that had not been seen before .
In particular , she sued the House of Lords with all sorts of clothing packages and did not have much to go to the Cannes Film Festival .
However , the popularity of the applicants today does not play a smaller role , either , because caring for them is a hot head and , unlike everything else , they do not have to care for them by means of special funds , but also because of water and martyr .
As is still the case when it comes to class robbers , brands have come out of all possible interpretations apart from classics .
For example , if they so wish , you can obtain a bunch of beers or a little bit of booths .
At the same time , it is worth bearing in mind that the classical beer will never come from a mosque , but from beer flu .
However , what is the classical beer , then ?
For centuries now , a bunch of copies has been classed to resemble repetition of its style has been opened up and short , as well as beers , crippers .

GMB is concerned about investments in the McVitie &apos;s Glasgow plant
The club is expected to reassure the CEOs on long @-@ term production plans in the enterprise Glasgow plant .
According to GMB Scotland , the company has remained silent at customs point on the future of the investment .
More than 500 people are employed in the case of Hobnobsi and the rich know @-@ how as well as other products .
The owner of McVitie in Plas said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million over the last few years .
Workers and trade union chairmen were employed there &apos; are the first to hear &apos; when something changes change in the operation of the factory .
In a letter sent to the manager of GMB Scotland , McVitie , he called on the company of GMB to &apos; allay its concerns in relation to the lack of funding to modernise production lines &apos; .
GMB &apos;s senior organiser Drew Duffy said : &apos; The fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the object on the customs / VIS business needs and the future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned .
Several generations of families have worked here and the labour force is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow , an essential pillar for ensuring proper employment in an area where there is high unemployment and social exclusion .
Against this background , Glasgow &apos;s Eastern jobs , wages and well @-@ being , Brexti , rising living costs and a steady drop in production , requires a thriving production company in McVitie . &quot;
The Pladise representative said : &apos; At that time , GMB Scott received a letter only yesterday and the company responds directly to him because we value active engagement with workers &apos; and trade union representatives .
Two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers in Rabat and the representatives of the GMB , which openly discussed a number of issues .
We then discussed with the workers that , like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we would review our activities now - and this applies to all of our businesses and objects - in order to ensure their competitiveness .
He added : &apos; In recent years we have invested more than GBP 5 million on the site of Customs , most of which went to production lines and improvements in procedures .
We fully understand the heritage of customs as a source of production , and if there should be any changes in the activities of the object , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach to Neyra ?
La li may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .
Paris Saint @-@ Germain does not sign up in its efforts to attract Neymar in its ranks by making an offer of GBP 189 million to be stolen , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for its record inauguration ?
This bold approach has opened summer as a transitional window , and Ligue 1 club is ready to demolish more than twice the current world record , which was set up during the previous season by returning Paul Pogba back to Manchester Unitetle for GBP 89 million .
Once the switchover has been completed , Neyra will , as a result , become the most expensive player in the world , but also the most well @-@ paid professional sportsman in the world , who will be paid more than GBP 500 000 a week after payment from PSG .
Barcelona is , of course , angry not only because of the approach , but also because of the liberation of Neyra , even though a source close to the leadership of Catalansi confirms that the club has always taken the best care for football since its arrival in Sanps in 2013 .
However , did the PSG President warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago ?
When Manchester City in 2014 showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blaise Matutis Agreement , the Nasser Al @-@ Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who think about recruiting some of the PSG &apos;s best players .
&quot; I am not worried , as they know that , when they concern some of our players , we will accept them and contact them , &quot; said Al @-@ Khelaif .
&quot; We respect all clubs .
However , if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appears to have moved beyond this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the PSG central player , Marco Verratti .
The PSG made it clear that they would not be allowed to leave the field under any circumstances , and that Barcelona could have repercussions as a result of this interest by abolishing one of its precious assets in the form of Neyra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexitit , not borders .
&quot; Brexit is in serious danger of breaking the wool between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Varadkar during his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
Cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods , said Varadkar .
&quot; This is our vision for the future : Building bridges , not borders . &quot;
She would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , since it fails , to remain part of Europe &apos;s common market .
It would maintain current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
Another way to make Britain &apos;s departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
Noting that there was such an agreement with Turkey , Varadkar said : &apos; Surely we could have this with Great Britain . &apos;
An alternative to this would be a return to customs points , which would declare historical division and political failure .
&apos;Building trade , prosperity and peace &apos; said Irish Prime Minister .
He called Brexitit &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that its result could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland .
The Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main political parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast .
The first half @-@ long triathon note , Avril : Ironman will be able to pass through everyone .
Today , in the winter capital , Otehanl , the biggest triathlors in the Baltic States were held , when nearly a thousand triathletes took over three out of ten countries into the quasi @-@ Ironman competition .
70.3 miles of entertainment consisted of 1.9 km flooding , 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling .
Among other things , the first triathlon of her life won a successful end to a note of Avbik .
&quot; I thought it would prove difficult and , in the end , difficult . &quot;
In spite of the complexity , Mrs Avher has shown that in reality the triathon is affordable for almost everyone .
&apos;It is not a dance killing , it kills the pace &apos; , it says , suggesting that , at a comfortable pace , almost everyone will reach the finishing line .
With the exception of Ott Sepp , &apos; It is OK , but unfortunately it cannot swim &apos; .
Avril had already taken a keen lead from February onwards .
At the beginning , 4 @-@ 5 hours a week , later ten hours a week .
Time 05 : 34 : 12 achieved 2760 in overall terms .
Even though Avand was lost to both Raio Piiro ( time 04 : 59 : 53 : 53 ) and Jürgen Ligale ( time 05 : 06 : 37 ) , she won other competing champions in the so @-@ called &apos; prominent classes &apos; .
Last year , Tanel Padar , a good example , lost Avanle in seven minutes ( Time 05 : 41 : 54 : 54 ) , journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes ( time 05 : 50 : 23 ) , Kalev Krnew and Raivo E. Tamm for about one hour ( times : 31 : 53 and 06 : 45 : 18 : 18 ) .
Ironman in Otepää , the general winner of the ranking for men belonging to Otepää , was chronic Germany , Johannes Moldan , for 3 : 58 : 27 : 27 , Estonians were the best Ivo plenr in 04 : 14 : 09 .
Among the women , the Danish woman , Helle Frederiksen , won 04 : 24 : 01 : 01 , Estonians , Maria Jänese , who lost nearly half an hour to Frederiksen and obtained 04 : 58 : 58 .
Avja went through 1.9 km of swimming with 42 minutes and 14 seconds .
She came out in 410 positions .
