four members of Cape Verde Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to Mr Posselt , the police in Spain detained the leader of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Kallirovo Group &apos; in Estonia , SpinGulevich , who is known as Sdra KCape KCape vski in the criminal world .
Gulevich arrested in Spain was arrested at the Court &apos;s trial .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
it is suspected that the so @-@ called &apos; Cape rovo &apos; criminal community is aged between 27 and 57 years of life , who commit mainly to drug crimes .
in Spain , the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained in Mala province Mijas .
in Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of which has been collected according to the criminal community &apos;s data , and two are members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicate that tasks and roles were clearly divided into the criminal community .
the purpose of criminal activities was to commit drug crimes and thus serve the proceeds of crime , &quot; commented on the head of pre @-@ trial proceedings , Public Prosecutor Vame Verte .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; added the Prosecutor .
it is people who have also been involved in the law enforcement authorities in the past , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become commonplace for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; commented on the Prosecutor Verte .
the head of the central criminal police service , ago in Leis , said that the detention was preceded by nearly half a year of preliminary examination .
&quot; in the first half of the week , we had a long history of work and , at the same time , in Estonia and Spain , suspected of committing crimes , &quot; said .
it added that central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have a good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil card .
these detentions are yet another message to criminals that we also get them in the hands of another Europe , &quot; said Leis .
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that , in the absence of a suspicion , men can continue to carry out new crimes , which is why the prosecution service requested their arrest and the Court also approved it .
the man arrested in Spain expects his surrender to Estonia .
in this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation .
the criminal proceedings are carried out by the Office for organised crime organised by the central police and led by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the city of Tallinn was convicted of blackmail by Gulevich in 2005 and punished him with a five @-@ year imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gulevi≈°it was held the second most important in the Estonian criminal world following the Alliance of Guelles , Nikolai Tarankov .
Gulevich , from Gulevich , from Cape Verde , came to the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Admittedly , he was taxing taxi drivers and prostitution and calling for a monthly rotation tax on businessmen .
international joint operations , the confiscation of criminal proceeds and the judgments in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest court rulings , the so @-@ called Dikai crime community , eight accused persons who seized EUR 80 000 of criminal proceeds , or the judgment against nine persons in 2006 , that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal community aimed at illegal trade in cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in East Viruland and southern Estonia .
there is a total of around EUR 71 500 of recorded criminal proceeds .
in these criminal matters , it has ensured that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and , if necessary , carry out operations in any country of the European Union .
civil rights group warns of Missourisse travel
the National Association for the Advanancient People of Colored People ( NAMA ) has warned people of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State of the State .
the Group &apos;s statement states : &apos; Missouri State in the NASR , which applies until 28 August 2017 , calls on all American travellers , visitors and sourians to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious when moving around the state , given the whole of the Roma &apos;s dubious racial events , which have recently taken place in the state and at this point &apos; .
according to NAP , the group urged the group to issue a travel warning both the recent Missouri law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that the state of law @-@ enforcement targets are largely minority targets .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
they are being drawn up because of their skin colour , beaten or killed , &apos; said NAla Missouri , President Rod Chapel , The Kansas City Star .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints before . &quot;
this is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for the US State .
the group referred to events such as racist insults of black students at Missouri University and the death of 28 @-@ year @-@ old black Sandersi .
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , after he had run through the state of benpetrol and the Missouri police captured him , without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the comment refers to the recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of the Missouri Prosecutor , which shows that the national flag state is likely to halt the cars of black drivers by 75 % more likely than those of white drivers .
&apos;The comment is for people to be aware and to warn their families , friends and collaborators for what might happen in Missouris , &apos; said Chapel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it is to be spent on bail @-@ in money or to inform relatives about the fact that they cross the state . &quot;
the latest figures from FBI hate crime were documented in the Missouris in 2015 at 100 hate crime , which puts the state in the state of 16 places similar to the number of offences in the country .
the travel warning is also a response to the new law of Missouri , which makes it difficult for the company to be brought to court for reasons of discrimination in search of housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( ACLU ) had previously issued travel barriers for Texas and Arizona , following the adoption by these states of immigration laws obliging local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences , because , according to the ACLU , it increases racial profiling .
usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Hepatitis : what could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
Hepatitis , or incineration , may be caused by five different - A , B , C , D and E @-@ hepatitis .
all these viruses provoke a fierce combustion of the liver .
however , the worst cost is chronic hepatitis B and C , which can develop further into the circus of the circus , and pay for cancer .
the epidemiology of the Health Agency , Kumarr , is saying that acute hepatitis disease events are the same for all types of liver incineration - fever , fatigue , plundering , Easperation , therapeutic emissions , horse mackerel , meat and sweeteners , and swine and limasters .
the last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of the liver burn .
children can go through hepatitis without disease .
the various types of heat can be determined only on the basis of laboratory research data .
tackling hepatitis can go to chronic hepatitis and for decades without disease phenomena , which means that man may not know anything about his or her dangerous disease .
Mr Kurel points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their culmination more closely .
hepatitis viruses spread from a disease to humans and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , seals , emissions of infected human beings and hands on food , soil , objects , sugar and drug consumption .
a hepatitis hepatitis was carried out by family members and carers , people who suffer from chronic pay , sex people with men , sex men , drug users , countries with hepatitis A high levels of hepatitis .
the infection can be prevented by vaccination , in particular by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot of travel and hepatitis A .
in addition , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to wash or disinfect hands , before eating food , to wash all fruit and vegetables .
hepatitis viruses spread sick people in contact with blood , drug injection , therapeutic treatment , augmentation , blood @-@ contaminated sites ( toothpaste , pregnancy tools ) , the use of donating blood , hepatitis hepatitis , sex sex and hepatitis sufferers / hepatitis .
the hepatitis hepatitis infection is accompanied by drug addicts , the sex partners of infected human beings , sex men , the mother @-@ born , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , and passengers visiting the health , rescue workers and police officers and countries with hepatitis B high disease .
in order to prevent hepatitis , it is possible to vaccinate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vaccinate people from risk groups and , in addition to chronic pay @-@ related diseases , HIV infections , sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes .
hepatitis is other preventive measures : avoiding the hygiene and manure of strangers , other sharp resources and systalgic @-@ councillotteries , and the use of therapeutic and augiliation , and the use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection , or preventing sexual risk @-@ taking .
vaccination against hepatitis is part of the national immunity scheme and free of charge for children in Estonia .
Hepatitis C viruses spread sick people in connection with blood , drug injection , therapeutic , augmentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated sites , donor blood , hepatitis hepatitis , person sex and hepatitis disease to animals / newborn babies .
C @-@ hepatitis @-@ hepatitis @-@ infected infections are accompanied by drug users , sex partners of infected people , sex men with men , infant infants , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , health care , rescue and police officers , HIV @-@ infected infections , and passengers travelling to countries with hepatitis C .
prevention of hepatitis C is : non @-@ refraining from hygiene and manageable devices , other sharp resources and systalstalgic @-@ councillotteries , lyrication and augmentation , and the use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infections .
there is no vaccine against hepatitis C .
the hepatitis hepatitis virus is caused by the Dhepatitis virus , which is growing in the presence of hepatitis B .
as a result , Dhepatitis B infections , combined with hepatitis B or superinfants , occur in chronic hepatitis B .
the hepatitis virus is spreading exposure to blood and other body liquids , contaminated with needles @-@ counters , sexually and seldom infected animals .
the hepatitis risk group is chronic hepatitis B infections and people who do not have immunity from hepatitis B .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against hepatitis B , which also protects people from infection with hepatitis D .
hepatitis viruses spread by feeble means of drinking water and food , including little hot @-@ treated beef , fish and marine carbons , donor blood , joint sychesses and more infected animals .
passengers can be infected with high levels of E hepatitis in countries .
Ehepatitis preventive measures are the enforcement of hygiene requirements : to wash or disinfect hands after slaughter , prior to food production and feed , after hospital care .
Fruits and vegetables are washing before consumption , avoiding eating little hot @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , only safe drinking water and avoiding drug consumption .
although the last round of competitors tried to printing four times the Olympic winner , 34 @-@ year @-@ old Farah final hub took power and won 26.49.51 .
the Farah did not mean long , bringing the husband Tania and children into the road after the finalists .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much support my family .
being with them was wonderful , &quot; said Farah journalists .
Farah intents in London the fifth edition of 5 000 and 10 000 metres of a golden dump .
everything is possible if it is believed .
despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connorm in Daam gold , Gustav Klimti , Adele Bloch @-@ Baueri , the extraordinary story of the birth of one art of the 19th century and Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century .
but even more in the history .
the inflammatory information on the subject would perhaps have been watered down , a narrowly subject would have been allowed to have more influence on the extraordinary nature of the title .
at the moment , there would be a patchwork of two books : Gustav Klimti and his painting &apos; Daam gold &apos; , the story of Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri , and a much larger and more comprehensive history of Honourable families and the German occupation , along with its subsequent effects in Austria .
the first third of the book leads to a thriving cultural life in the middle of Vienna , and who is himself in the capital of Austria , may well imagine the way in which more than a hundred years ago , life around Ringstrases went around , or how all the head of the Centrali coffee turned when the climate invaded .
the concentration of cultural characters was high in one of the richest cities in Europe , and the name familiar with the book was known as a gram of cultural heritage .
at the same time , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where untreated innocence and the highest level of suicide in Europe will not add anything to development .
or perhaps , however , every couple of couples are adding to the cultural life of the 20th century in Vienna .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in the last decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
the Sajandig was almost one in ten inhabitants of Vienna .
parents were also newcomers in Vienna , but by then , when the Arad marriage itself was opened twice by the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Blochevery and the customer in his famous painting , his father had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire .
however , the whole life of Adelet has not been drawn up .
if you look at the &apos; Daam gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end @-@ of @-@ life infection was a kind such as socialism and dream of a trip to the Soviet Union .
for 1903 , when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband &apos;s luggage from the Klimmer , the last moment was the painting maker in Vienna .
a subscription paid at that time 4 000 kroons , a quarter of the price of a good @-@ place rural house .
the fact that there was a suspicion of the modelli of the masters of sugar in the case of some sportsmen was not discouraged .
as far as the deletion is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between the modelli and the artist created in the course of work continued to reach the end of life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connor - &apos; Daam gold .
Gustav Klimti Cup , Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri , the extraordinary story , &quot; &quot; Varrak 2016 , &quot; Aldo Randland , who translated into English .
shortly before the start of the work with Adelem , the climate had been visited by Ravenna San Vitale , and the investigators think that it was precisely there that the wonderful mosaic countries of the Grand front na Theodorf , Theodort , gave an artificial idea of making a golden portfolio called Adeledeledeler .
the Klimt presented his &apos; Daam gold &apos; in Vienna in 1908 and at the same time ( 1907 @-@ 1908 ) , one of the golden land &apos; Snovel &apos; was born .
art historians did not notice the similarity of two women .
how is Hitler connected with nature ?
&quot; I think I owe it to him to make his work available to the public , &quot; said Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer a few years after the departure of the artist ( Klimt died in February 1918 ) to the Director of the Belvedere museum and wanted their family to go to the Klimti collections of museums .
six years before the death penalty , the Kliml had produced each other .
he also asked for her husband to leave her two sports courses and four Gustav Klimti &apos;s landscapes to Austrian Galspecial .
his founding fathers , Mrs Mariana and Mr Luda , are marvellous .
one year after the climate had completed the &apos; Austrian Mona lisa &apos; , Viini Kawart de Akademine had attempted to escape 17 @-@ year @-@ old Adolf Hitler , but failed in the drawing up .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ Semitism is considered to be the reason for the fact that Jewish professors did not accept him in the academine , none of his culminers were actually Jewish .
in any case , the Austrian Galerii task , referred to in the case of the Austrian Galspecial , had changed considerably by 1939 , which had become important for the rich Jewish arts in Vienna to find decent work .
Hitler &apos;s personal art musicians also had some work at home , but not that of the Klimti .
Sixty years after the night of Nazi art , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute between the Austrian Government and Bloch @-@ Baukers was born .
it should be noted here that if &apos; Snovel &apos; sees the Belvedere Castle in Vienna , Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer , the &apos; Daami gold &apos; , must be seen as a trip to New York Neue Galspecial .
and before the Vienna War , the aforementioned book will also be read .
even if you do not plan to look at the climate &apos;s work , because at least my emotion , after the closure of the book , the subject of laughing and Jews was sold more than USD 135 million and modell Adele del Bloch @-@ Bauer .
so there is not so much entertainment , but rather a very moving story - and a very moving story .
Worryingly , in the event of events , the sex of Bauer was facilitated by the start of the book .
17 @-@ year @-@ old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonia .
in Eelucheese , gold was very close to the personal record of its own 200 m , which was swamped by 2.16.62 .
the Tippmark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ old piles every week since the Canadian cheese Championships received 2.1616.58 , the Priit Aavik Ujugation blog .
gold last escaped , or a decade , A @-@ finalist .
in Finally , she went through a distance of 2.15,76 and achieved a good 7th seat with a new powerful peak .
Alina Kendziorn , a Estonian rebate ( 2.15.13 ) , remained a little over half a second .
in Estonia &apos;s ever @-@ old Scoreboard , gold rose and its fresh personal top @-@ mark is the fifth ever result of Estonia .
the young hope of the future lies in the launch of Canadian adults &apos; championships of 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in balfire , and 200 mm and 400 m in bundling .
last week in Toronto , Canada took place at the University of jewellery , and gold was also successful .
he won 200 m in a silver medal in 2.03.22 .
so quickly , it was swamped by a distance leader in 2008 .
the Golf has gone through more quickly than ever , in Estonia , only a record Estonian Belt , Elina Parevika .
in Canada , a vibrant champion won a wonderful personal record of 100 m vouchers and 56.66 of the new Estonian season .
for example , his year &apos;s old Kertu ly Alnek has distanced it by just one century more quickly .
in his personal excellence , he arrived at another 100 m in the opening of a notice of 1.03.69 .
on a longer distance , he gained only the seventh seat when he became a finalist 2.17.31 .
gold is currently leading the Estonian momentum to four different distance .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics insured teeth
the holiday season is in the hands of the US President , Donald Trumple .
however , as the Trump has so far been one of the President who has taken the most holiday days , critics are already wearing teeth .
according to the US VIS and the CNN , the President intends to have 17 @-@ day leave in the Bedminster , which is located in New Jerseys .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , the anti @-@ Trumpi leave has already been spoken for weeks .
they are asking the Olympics for too much treatment .
it is precisely the President who is entitled to spend a week in his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey in cotton .
by the way , the Trump has not cleaned the President for its 196 working days .
for example , Mr W. Bush was able to have 67 days on holiday in this period , Barack Obama , but only 21 days less than the Trump .
however , the Olympic Games tend to forget things quickly .
a few days after becoming President , when he received the Trump , he said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; that there will be no time left for a long holiday in his wife , because there is a great deal to be done .
he also expressed his outrage about Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
the current President wrote on Twitter : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , plays golf , the brakes and the jargon concerts are on the street , journalists from the sun &apos; .
according to the officials of the White House , 17 @-@ day golf club visit was not a betrap .
it is officially referred to as &apos; labour leave &apos; , during which Trul has no time to read or other forms of action .
in addition , there was another reason for working leave .
in particular , the White House will be replaced by a special system for the western part of the White House , and that is why all staff had to leave it .
the West Bank is also located in Ovalkacabinet and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West in August , if there are 38 degrees and no conglomerates , &quot; said Lindsay Walters , who stressed that the President will continue to work during the holiday period .
where President Trump will spend 17 days , you will get an idea of video .
blocking of critics from Facebook to do not stand for the state of office if you do not tolerate the criticism of the voters .
the father of our country knew a great deal about the unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans loved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to bully him for everything from internal politics to his political principles .
of course he was annoyed by the criticism .
but he did not forced his critics to remain silent .
because , in the year 1783 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and , in darkness and silence , we could be chaired by sheep in slaughterhouses &apos; .
this brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan , who is struggling to be more in Washington .
the organisers &apos; submissions have blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their views on their official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the Union for Freedom of American Civil Liberties ( ACLU ) is therefore to court .
the Kuberner officer &apos;s office paved the action empty and web commentates slide from reactions in a style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos; .
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many .
but that is what counts .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan .
it is an amazing popular Republican state of the democratic state .
his approval percentage is the second highest ranking among the country &apos;s 50 months .
Hogan is not an unwise reaction .
it has led the state firmly and remains strictly firm in its principles .
in addition , he has used a major tool in communicating with his constituents quite deliberately Facebook , for example , after the first time in chemistry , after the first time he presented his or her ugly head .
it is therefore a public forum with a formal label that is managed by the staff of taxpayers &apos; dollars , who are paid by the Cubans , which is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in the interview given to Washington Posselt , the spokesperson of Hogan , defended the behaviour of the Governor , arguing that blocking comments was nothing other than modeling .
however , it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet clouds online , spawers or people full of hatred .
the post spoke to a number of people who were blocked by Hogan .
and that is precisely what they are really the people who are in contact with their elected leaders , the teacher , the owner of the company and the pastor , not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were disrespectful , thought @-@ out and not ropts .
Pastor quoted milk in his post , by oppressing the Khogan Catholic movement .
the lawyer from Marylan Bowie , Lakshm Sarma Raman , did not instigate hatred , but rather hate crimes .
&quot; I was politely that I am disappointed , because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &apos; he wrote a news story in the Annex to the Email .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , when many people comment on the same subject , some of them are inextricably calling it a collective effort , rather than acknowledging that this is a great deal of concern with citizens . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s officials called &apos; targeted spam attack &apos; would probably call others &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era allows messages to be easily matised by simply blocking criticism or deleting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than the old one when the workers had to be sent out to do the same , so that they gather newspapers with critical editorial editorial newspapers and burn them or arrest protestors and forced them to remain silent .
however , that is exactly what is happening now , just digitally .
the Hogan is not the first public official to criticise the tooth of Facebook and other social media .
President Trumpi has brought to court Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter .
one of the first signs of court rulings on this matter was made last week in Virginia .
Judge James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the Chairman of the Managing Board of Loudouni land violated the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the voter on his Facebook page .
in Ktucky , ACLU Facebook and Twitter also visited the Governor Matt Bevinit ( R ) .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar impact on the Internet .
between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers and anonymous writers dared in his way of leadership .
and even then Washington had to deal with anonymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers such as Juricola , Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , Washington decisions .
according to the historical documents that have been compiled in the framework of the Water @-@ based George Washington magazine project , he burns a cabinet under the petitions criticising his views on the British friendship , trade and shipping agreements .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , special opinions and debates are the foundations of our country .
and proper management means acceptance of this .
Ronan Rafferty hopes of the comfort of Renaissance Clubis
the former European Chairwoman , Ronan Rafferty , hopes of comfort in the next three days , when the East Lothiani Renaissance Clubi golf courses take place 25 .
the Northern Ireland , which was in the vicinity of Archerfield in Linony last year , ahead of the last round of Mr Paul Ealsinger &apos;s resignation , is a new feature of the new scene and is playing the role of the club founder and executive leader , Jerry Soledi , rather than the exclusion of the club .
&quot; I saw Renaissance Club built , and now we see how the club is pulling in full glory , &quot; said Rafferty .
&quot; the players see the path in their best shape , it is in an excellent state .
Jerry has done an excellent job in building this place .
he is a keen supporter of golf games and is proud of what has been achieved here .
this will allow an excellent presentation of the path . &quot;
Ingan ever looks forward to the first time being able to defend the title , even though the man has won both European Toubon and European challenge Touril during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this is a very special feeling , &quot; said Sethportis &apos;s beating player .
&quot; I could not defend my Extremadura Orange &apos;s title because it was taken away from my competition calendar one year after my victory .
it is magic to come back to this chicken .
this is an excellent place to play a golf .
I remember the memories of last year , and my wife , Mrs Sharon , was a special victory for last year .
this was a very special time , which we will always be at the heart of the day . &quot;
on the soil of the country , Gary Orr , who joined the European Works Agency later this year , will return to the competition once he received 50 .

poverty and death in the land of Indonesia
when Barina Degei is preparing dinner , he does not use lead .
he seldom uses even boys .
the Indonesian authorities , in the capital of Papua province Paniai , in the capital of the Municipality of the province of Paniai , places the house in the house in the place of a house in the direct replacement of a nota in the local language .
in a half hours &apos; time , the coal @-@ fired sludge will be taken from fire and skinned with unbearable hands .
Degei is sitting on the brink of ancient Birniture and , at the same time , he is also doing his daily homework , for example , washing the bath water of a nearby sex .
the role of the baby is played by unscrupulous support .
since he is the four women of his husband , he is not allowed to take care of any contempt .
Polygaamia is common here on May .
it may be dangerous to work late , however , most of the men of the village are unemployed and many of them are running hard , and there are still soldiers here .
&quot; no one dare to go around after five o &apos;clock in the village , &apos; he says .
this is a rare piloquery in Papua mountainous , which is a former Dutch colony , which was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that was triggered by controversy in which only 1026 older people were forced to vote in front of the troops .
the movement in the direction of the Dutch supremacy of the Netherlands , which has urged the movement of its ravies to the Jakarta Government , which is still holding the region under its strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into the Pope and the Western Pope , so that independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island .
the majority of the Roma is both remote and abandoned , and in order to arrive here , 90 minutes from the capital of the province , Jayapuru , and then through a five @-@ hour journey with a rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city of approximately 19 000 inhabitants is made up of wood , surrounded by roofs and cover lainous iron rocks , which have been transformed by different tone into the tricks .
very few indicators have taken place here , not to mention journalists , and there has been almost no foreign matter here .
prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries , Mee Pago paints a God called Tamee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing such clothes , &apos; says Degei , referring to the marketing of your colour coded hand , the fire to the plug and the private sector .
&quot; before that , we have only had a plant cow . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
however , it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
just 100 km away from the Paniao , which is the mountainous province with 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey , is the world &apos;s largest and most profitable gold mine , Grasberg , which belongs to the Fbete McMoran company operating in Phoenixis .
in 2015 alone , Fbete extracted approximately USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copies .
in addition , it can be reconciled with the supply of raw wood , which is estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these riches are a source of suffering for boats , as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army .
the New York Times study in 2005 showed that Freexport payments in the years 1998 to 2004 to local military and military units amounted to approximately USD 20 million , including USD 150 000 to one of the officers .
the attempts of the Pope to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden and is seamlessly betrayed .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army .
according to the Asian Committee on Human Rights , the mass killing of the genocide in the 1970s was a measure of genocide in the 1970s .
last year alone , more than 3900 peaceful protests were arrested by the Iranian police in the region .
the 2016 report of the Grand bishop of Birsbane , entitled &apos; We lose all &apos; , contains testimony to the atrocities committed last year , such as non @-@ judicial executions , torture ( one of the other reports , rape and electric shock ) and the brutal suppression of peaceful protests .
&quot; the number of victims is difficult to read , because such incidents will take place every week , &quot; says Andreas Human Rights Watch &apos;s Indonesia investigator and Andreas Harsono .
the nuances are even more strongly closed because Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demographics are changing because of the Muslim economic migrants arriving in the islands of Indonesia , Kalimantan , Sumatra and Sulawes .

&quot; migrants started selling a chicken and vegetables from local boats on the traditional market , &quot; explains the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Italians born in the Paniais who worked in the province of Jayapura .
&quot; Syrians Fronmama @-@ Mama &#91; women &#93; will lose their market share in Papua mama . &quot;
the President of Indonesia Joko Widodo , who is well known among the people as Jokow , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Pope .
the former puppet won the presidential Palace of Jakarta in Papua 29 constituency 27 , including Paniai .
however , the Pope has changed very little and the local feel cheated .
&quot; our hearts have been broken , because in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jokow in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes in terms of restoring justice , &quot; says .
in fact , only two months after the resignation of Jokow October , the Paniai was in a low position .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the Swedes singing on Christmas , when two Indonesian soldiers woke the darkness of the darkness .
children who have met told them that they should be included in the front lights .
according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai Tebai , one of the soldiers insulted the tone of their votes and later returned to four soldiers .
according to the victims and spectators , in drink @-@ driving soldiers , children were driven by children and beaten them with their guns .
then one of the soldiers shot among children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yulianus Yeimot , was beaten so cruel that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , the building of the near electoral Commission was burnt down , and the next day things escalated further .
about 1 000 young people , women and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police and military management centre to claim justice .
they were wearing horrendous buses and putting in place a leaflet in Papua mee pago , a waita @-@ tantsu in which poultry songs were buried and buried .
some protesters started to lecture the police and the military .
&apos;If the crowds show more than three times resistance , let them down , &apos; the official document , which has seen a magazine for time , but which has not been issued to local media publications .
the city of Kego Koto , the city of Yeremias Kayme ( 56 ) , felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained , asking for a crowd to go home .
nobody had the will to listen .
&quot; turning me back to the left , I was suddenly shot into the left , &apos; he said time at the time of a tree in his German colours on the verge of the cage .
we still do not know who the fire was , but it says that the soldiers &apos; rigs gathered in the month came from .
&quot; there was a lot of people , a lot of children in the House , &apos; add him .
the local man , Alfius Youw , has been shot at the wall three times .
&quot; I would like to wait for him and in his body to make sure that it is her , &quot; said a magazine at a time of birth in Yohanes , who uses only one name in many of the indicators .
&apos;I saw that he has died ... Snovel lew . &apos;
the Chief Supervisor of Papua police , Yotje Mende , said to reporters that he was subjected only to the security of his department , as it was attacked .
&quot; we need to protect ourselves if we are threatened to kill , &quot; said Vice @-@ President Pudjo Sulistiyo , the spokesman of Papua police , in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protesters were killed and many injured .
the news about the killings reached Jakartail only on the next day .
three weeks later , Jokowi Jayapuras made a passionate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses to be dealt with by the Pope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
the security minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an ADR mechanism to tackle human rights crimes .
however , almost immediately the excuses were also followed .
&quot; most of the crimes happened a long time ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and the early 2000s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
on 5 June in Jakartas , however , Wiranto withdrew his words by saying that he had no intention of creating a Pope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything will be resolved according to the law &apos; .
the Wiranto , who has been accused by the UN of committing more than 1 000 deaths in the context of the bloody independence referendum in East Timor in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Pope , including what happened in Paniais .
the families of the victims of the Paniai have adopted such statements with a gloomy mistrust .
&quot; I have been heard four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Yohanes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he is still living in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I am afraid that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I am shot . &quot;
his brother d Yacobus confirmed his opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid of this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after helping to bury four victims .
&quot; after the burying of the bodies , the army had to look at me , &apos; he says .
the celebrations have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the inhabitants of the Egyptian police were shot in Deiyais , a neighbouring Paniai .
one person was killed and 17 injured , including children , when he went to the head of the village and the construction company , who refused to transport an unconscious man to hospital .
this man &apos;s people , 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ravianus Douw , who drowned into a nearby sea , died on the road to hospital .
the recent inhabitants of villages protested at the construction site of a company office .
according to the police , the people of the village were storing the police , which the latter responded with warning visits .
however , according to the local authorities , mobile British people ( Indonesia &apos;s military police ) were shot at the people , killing one person .
&quot; we were a great panic , we are afraid of revenge , &quot; said 29 @-@ year @-@ old Domingda Badii , who lives close to the hospital and saw the insect of those injured .
&quot; I have beaten myself two days in my own house . &quot;
the Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of police mobile brigades from the region .
Paniac has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government .
the lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the meals , moni , dann and dammal tribes living in Papua bad .
many of them have signed up to the army of Papua geneity ( VPL ) , which , according to its own , protects the rights of boats , by organising attacks and kidnappings among the Indonesian soldiers .
some of the VPL &apos;s leadership comes from Paniao , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
in response to this , over the last few years , under the pretext of protecting national sovereignty , the army has arrested the Paniais and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them never appear again .
Panians are known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; among the people .
poverty feeds dissatisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
the Leib is the same unavailable .
people are growing all their food themselves , mainly from the Bah√° , in addition to some fruit and vegetables .
farming is women &apos;s work , each of whom is able to care for four or five bailouts .
they usually keep most of the receipt of the family , the rest is sold on the local market .
ten Baha &apos;s cost only 10 000 Indonesian sites ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have been exacerbated by heavy boats and new migrants , who have arrived in a wide range since the opening of new routes for the Nabire airport .
the few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
the speculators themselves often do not have the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the village because there are no jobs and no money , &apos; says John Gobai , President of the Council of Paniai tribes .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from the Pope .
in addition , strict restrictions on foreign media remain .
French journalists Franck Escudie and Babridge Longchamp were sent to the Pope at the beginning of this year , because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they had been given a rare film licence .
the Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch , Pcomm Kine , said that the election pledges made by Jokow have not been implemented to lift the restrictions on transparency and development reports .
&quot; in Indonesia , journalists from the most eastern provinces and Western Pope reports are threatening new threats to the rejection and blacklisting of a visa , &quot; said in his statement .
the lack of a satellite watch on the press means that international pressure on the government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua near neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries were encouraged by Tonga , Nauru , Belau , Tuvalu , Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands to examine the &apos; various wide @-@ ranging crimes &apos; in the UN Human Rights Council , including the shooting of Paniai .
the same countries have historically supported the VPL .
Arrmanatha Nasir , the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , threw out the accusations of a group by saying Jakartas to journalists : &apos; there is still a democratic regime and freedom of the press in Indonesia , so that evidence of human rights cases would be difficult to bury &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to notice .
when the Dutch official delegation visited Jayapurat on 4 May , the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , Mr Van Baric , the local people were cut off at the meeting , but the anonymous source said they wanted to remain silent , urging : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , there will be new presidential elections in 2019 , but boats do not believe that they will vote in favour of Jokow again .
&apos;Jokow is a man with good intentions , but surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of Paniai &apos; says &apos; Hobai , President of the Council &apos; .
he wants to give Jocowen to realise that , in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army , they are suffering from poor education and health services .
according to Gobai , the people of Paniai , like other boats , regard their voice to Jokow as a debt that has to be paid .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and intimidation , the families of the victims of the fire in Paniai were able to cope with the last symbolic objection to Madagascar , which swept one victim to the death of a police unit and the army to the country in question .
knowing that justice can never be put on its feet , they will not at least allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Yacobus .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
needing Dubai Torch &apos;s pilots for the second time
on Friday , hundreds of people in the world &apos;s largest housing storm in Dubai had to be eaten , forcing hundreds of people to escape from this 337 metre and 79 crazy buildings .
this is the second fire that has been ravaged in just two years from a high level , which is called the case for Turin , or Tusvikur .
the building was evacuated , none of the injuries were reported and no direct fire @-@ related causes were submitted .
&quot; we sleep and wake up to the fires and people &apos;s fears .
we would wait for the tour and we had about 10 minutes to get down to the 50th order , &apos; said to the Reuterans one person who called himself a George .
according to Dubai &apos;s civil protection officers , fire fighters were also deleted at around 4 o &apos;clock this morning at local level ( 00.00 GMT ) and jaked the building .
the government said that they were working to ensure shelter for those affected .
this incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on high @-@ level external soil throughout the world .
during the investigation carried out in the aftermath of the Torch Management Board 2015 , it was found that the most damage was suffered by a fa√ßade , decoral panels and insulation .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenportfolio Tower and a fa√ßade could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fires in June , which killed around 80 people .
see : these phones are likely to receive sales cards in the autumn
language and synage are a waste of time for technology , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony Xperipheral a XZ Premium , are expected to be expected in the autumn in the autumn .
according to the Tele2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Semother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by innovative design , eye @-@ fast shandnner , serser @-@ servani 4K resolution on the screen and the ultra @-@ fast process .
Samsung Galaxy S8 , which is also at the top of Estonia &apos;s smartphones &apos; sales table , gave rise to a high degree of visibility in the world .
the autumn will allow clerty people to be even more tired , more resilient , better cameras and more water and customs security .
he added that , on the basis of rumours , there can already be assumptions and predictions of four top @-@ level models , which are likely to be conquered by the streets .
these four smart phones top @-@ up models will reach the shop in the autumn of this year .
the long @-@ awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach boys by mid @-@ September .
however , the rumours that the new Apple model looks like , and what can be done , are spreading .
if the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences between the iPhone 6s , Apple &apos;s tenth birthday is expected to be a new model completely different from previous ones .
there has been talk of four colours : black , white , rock and chromium .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the entire telephone front , has been lost at home and the fingerprints are built on the screen .
Apple &apos;s design director JonyIve calls for the new iPhone model to look like a glass .
there has also been talk of the iPhone version .
in addition to the elephant , the unmanageable charging and a more high @-@ quality cameras can be expected to accelerate the A11 process .
this is certainly one of the most expected smart phones in the year .
the outsourcing of a new model , Galaxy , begins on 23 August .
however , there have been many rumours of what new Galaxy are going to see .
Admittedly , even more business users are meant , and the S will allow even greater functionalities .
the Telefont should have two camera , one of which is the lax and the other with a narrow view of television content .
at the moment , no one knows what the two reconfigurations are capable of , but in any case it is the first test of Samsung , which is certainly comparable to the iPhone 8 .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August .
although Nokia has sold three smartphones in this year with Nokia 6 , there is still a lack of their flag vessel , Nokia 8 , which is already being presented on 16 August .
we are looking forward to a screens stretching from 5.3 to a bottom @-@ up screen and ultra @-@ fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processes and more resilient avenues .
Nokia also talks about aluminium corps and a significant level of water and customs security IP68 .
like Samsungevery , Nokia &apos;s new model has two camera , which is produced by an optimist company Zeiss .
if Sony &apos;s firm flag has been XZ Premium so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future , with even more innovative functions .
we expect a smartphone that is slightly more modest than XZ Premium , but at least the same good or better cameras .
there has been speculation on the new Sony model that its screen is at least hot .
what the reality is , we can already see the right thing , as traditionally the Sony of its autumn flag vessel has published IFRS , which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September .
according to transcripts leaked by telephone calls , Trump Mexico pressed for the payment of the border wall .
the Washington post unveiled the telephone calls between US President Donald Trumpi and Mexican and Australian state leaders .
on 27 January , Enrique Pena Nieto , the Mexican President , went to the President of Mexico , to stop public proclaiming that he does not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President , with him , warned of the public condemnation of the wall , saying : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the Trump was set up in his presidential campaign to build a long @-@ term wall and age on the southern border of the United States , so that Mexico is paying for this project .
transcripts were also published in his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turmes , which reveals a tense debate .
the Trump told Turnbull that the agreement whereby the United States of America takes on refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; nervous &apos; and &apos; stupid &apos; , claiming that the agreement that was made during the Obama Government would give him the impression &apos; guide &apos; , because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the Trump ended the speech by announcing to the Turunele that &apos; this was the day &apos;s most unpleasant speech &apos; .
the Court of Justice did not take a complaint on the matter of the OC MRP in which the city of Tartu rejected their offer for bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 2029 .
this is a letter rejecting the OC MRP in the town of Tartu buses , as the offer did not meet the requirements , Anneli Aputin , the President of the Tartu City Legal Service , explained .
this is the procurement of public transport within the Tartu city for the period 01.07.2019 @-@ 30.06.2029 .
MRP city Liine referred to the Court of Justice of the Municipality of Tartu .
the national court did not act .
although many people in the social media complain that the Weeky Festival is disrupting their night and the entire city is full of the brakes , there are many who do not have any bad words on the subject of a lasting festival .
I am even positively surprised that the brakes were so polite in the shop .
I did not see any ambiguity or courtesy .
even the Gulf I saw &apos; says a nice wave .
&quot; it is nice that it is coming , and it is known to be happy to have the Persian , which is a winter like winter , &apos; , he will gladly add .
the cumbersome wave of a dose is not a disgrace .
if , in the middle of a city , he was still listening to musicians playing on the beaches , then the music has not yet arrived at his home .
&quot; but I hope I hear , &quot; he says .
the Agnes , too , talks that the Grand Festival is a good thing for the Perrer , which will make a significant contribution to the VAT of local merchants .
in addition , it welcomes the fact that the summer capital has come up with such a large number of paints .
the woman of Peolives does not .
although I am no longer on the coast , it is nice that rand has revived .
and it is good that the people are moving , and this has been the case three times , a woman says .
in the first time , I think it was a little worse .
&apos;They there were complaints &apos; , he is wondering .
however , what is happening on the ground is normal , according to him , for the summer capital cities .
&quot; this Weekise is a very good prophmo for our small city , &quot; says Harri , who is on the park .
life and m√∂ll have not been sounding his life .
but for that ?
we should all pull together .
think about how it would be better to communicate between nations .
after all , the music man is not wearing .
that is not the case , although I live close to there .
&apos;Well people can save and there is no pause &apos; , he speaks .
the guests coming to the Persian are , according to him , visas .
&quot; with the bottles they have , of course , joined a little , but young people are young people and the issance - give you a hand , but be people and we can do ! &quot;
the people on the island have travelled to somewhere by then , whether to relatives or to acquaintances .
&quot; however , in general , the festival will have a positive impact on people like this medal , talking to children as Tiina .
the Festival of his family , too , does not disturb , even though it was even further removed from this street last year .
last summer , we heard more .
we are living outside the city that , in fact , there is a long way away from the River Persian , &apos; he is speaking .
Pearson cuts 3 000 jobs and reduces dividends to revitalise business
the British educational company Pearson said on Friday that more than 3 000 jobs are being cut and reduced by 72 % , by launching another restructuring programme to tackle the challenge of business .
the jobs that are being sacrificed , according to John Fallon , are likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , will be accompanied by 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring .
Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs by another GBP 300 million ( USD 394 million ) in the framework of the third reduction programme , in order to try to revive business that has been hit by the transition to high @-@ speed digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell last month &apos;s participation in the Penguin Random House to its partner companies Bertelsmann , said that their expectation in relation to the year has not changed since the 1 % increase in sales revenue was announced to 2.05 billion in the first half of the year .
on Sunday , the rainy season continues to sow !

Kabul : suicide attacks killed by NATO soldier
the suicide bomber , according to officials , attacked military convoys in the capital of Afghanistan , Kabul , killing one NATO soldier and injuring several of you .
in the NATO statement , five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to local reports , the city of Qarabaghi was also killed by three civilians .
this bombing is the last acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herati mosque attack on Tuesday .
on Monday , two people were killed by suicide bombers in Kabul .
the NATO statement said that an explosion took place on Thursday evening when the Afghan army of Joint patrol was attacked by &apos; man @-@ made explosives &apos; .
according to the statement , everything has been injured in a stable state and is treated in the US military hospital in Bagram airport .
according to the Correspondents , the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( in Chad ) , are a serious source of concern for the forces of NATO in Baghdad .
according to the UN , at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital city .
at the end of July , the car bomb in Kabul was killed mainly by at least 30 people in Kabul .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the central city , which has led to the most deaths in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while Donald Trump , President of the United States , is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country and the police .
according to the Correspondents , the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf Ghan .
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the regulation after the sharks .
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA ) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama @-@ Time Regulation , which obliges states to limit their emissions , one day after 15 states complained to the Court of Justice due to its conduct .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday 2015 , saying that it shows the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our national partners and listen to them , &quot; said the President of the EPA , Scott Pruitt in his statement .
the Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the rates of ostility content in the Sahel , which measure pollution in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year by one year in order to meet the highest standard of air quality .
15 mainly democratic states , together with Columbia , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
the government of President Donald Trumpi has tried to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to Mr Trumpi , is part of a more comprehensive agenda for growth .
however , these efforts have led to reactions among the democrats and nature protection groups who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that the breathing of ozone @-@ containing air &apos; could reduce the ability of Copts to work and increase the risk of a respiratory disease , such as asthma .
German pigs can come to a pipe .
Germany &apos;s pigs and cattle can come to a pipe , as heavy rains threaten the yields of the European Union &apos;s second largest wheat producer , writes BSE .
this year , it can be said that weeks of saturation before harvesting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry can only be fed to animals .
&quot; the quality of the content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said Agravis Raiffeen &apos;s analysis of Mr Bernhard Chilla .
this year , up to 40 per cent of German nicotine can be used for animal feed , which is fed by feed compared with the usual forecast in Agratis .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have been exposed to all the weather this year .
first of all , it was too dry .
then came the cold spring , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
in July , Germany was hit by the German volcano , which has also continued in August .
many eyes have been placed on northern Germany , where the rain is an obstacle to harvesting .
so far , only five per cent of nicotine has been repeated .
the majority in the region has not yet been harvested , and the local harvest buried in Ceravis .
&quot; this is a very difficult day , &quot; said Frank Deckert Rendsburg , a senior trader in Ceravis .
consistency in everything , in other words , the royalty of the internal design of Finns
nature plays a part in the internight of mesh homes because , through large windows , Saimaa &apos;s finite views reach many ( life ) rooms .
every step will be marked by our attempts by our northern neighbours to create both shellfish and perfect ( energy @-@ saving ) homes .
Iwolence and also respect for the use of wood for Finns as building and finishing materials , furniture and beauty .
Virgudable techniques and smart solutions can be found in mesh houses , both as a builder and ( home ) .
it is clear that the theft of the black , white and grey fields , if they are supplemented by wood tones and vegetation , can be very enterprising .
good ideas can still go for a week , as the Fair will run until 13 August .
Tarvies and spices suggest that this kitchen is often copied .
the √ñ√∂l adopted today &apos;s line on the Weekise Festival Balticen and Martin Garrix did all he can to remember the last speaker .
the people were really in the middle of Mr Simpson &apos;s speech - a song , a humble , a dance of tankers .
when lunch ended , a common mass of protein was dispersed from the city of Persian .
we will bring you to the gallery , with all the pictures that our photographer attempted in the space of three days in Weekise .
you are certainly also in some of them , in search of yourself !
M√ºry Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
Mr Vasyl Lomachenko and Mr Garcia , who should be on a collision in order to face up to 66.7 kg in the most attractive shop in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in the ESPN office in LOS Angeles , until Garcia , the unwinning World Boy Council lightweight champion the other side of the corridor , to welcome Lomachenkot , World Boassies , to the Conguszationi sulgweighch .
following the unanimous decision by Garcia , the victory of the former four @-@ time world champion , Adrien Broner , on Saturday in Showever , both combatants belong to the top of the ranking .
Mr Garcia extended his hand better and said : &apos; how do you go , champion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
Lomachenko will protect his belts against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 19 ESPN .
when a couple of photographs appeared , Lomachenko &apos;s memory , Eg Klimas , said that there would be a &apos; perfect yardstick &apos; between combatants .
&quot; I am former sultative , &quot; said Garcia .
&quot; I called for Bronger &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 63.5 kg .
I want to move downwards .
and he needs to move up to half the easy weight &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the F√§nds have asked for this .
let us give them the help . &quot;
Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
in the climate , the question raised was whether it should be worthwhile looking at it , which is part of his strategy , which he wants to allow the Lomachenkol to debate the end of this year at 61.2 kg in order to make it possible for the next summer to meet with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 novans ) , who also have an interest in fighting Jorge Linarese Linarese and Luke Campbelli &apos;s match with the winner of the Embassy , following their lighter weight on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as fans have called for this confrontation , &quot; said Garcia , saying later that he is open to fighting any channel offering the best financial package .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name is able to attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Mrs Garcia said that she considers Lomachenkot &apos; a &apos; force fighters &apos; and can go to his desk on Saturday .
however , Lomachenko was modest in praising Garcia , saying that in his opinion , three divisjon champions from the Riverpool were &apos; very slow &apos; ; I apologise , Mlony ... you wanted this nodistant &apos; .
according to Garcia , the aim was to show strength and then to bow .
both confirmed that they feel that the tension is growing in order to reach them .
&quot; this is a fight that looks forward to realising .
no other confrontation arouses so much attention and slander .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Garcia .
Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters and Maey is exactly that .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
what world sinks are going to Estonia ?
it extended and issued a record of more than 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia , study or family .
if , for example , the soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit to 6702 foreigners , then the figure was 4928 .
the agencies cannot say how many immigrants will finally remain permanently in Estonia , but such an analysis will be drawn up by the Ministry of the Interior .
while nearly 500 Ukrainians per year in Estonia ten years ago , this figure will be close to 2 000 in recent years .
the number of applicants for authorisation rose dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis , with 1087 people in 2014 receiving fixed @-@ term residence permits , up from 675 in 2014 .
in Estonia , we have the highest number of Ukrainian citizens , with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia in excess of their generosity .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been very high in Estonia all the time and , due to difficult circumstances , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already in front of the family , the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior , Kristin Ramallah .
the number of Ukrainian citizens who had fixed @-@ term residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens , even though the longest @-@ term residence permits have been issued in ten years .
if Ukrainians come to work mostly here , Russian citizens will have family migration .
&quot; given the historic Russian community , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with the people living in Russia , &quot; said Helina Meuse , the Internal Protection Academy .
&quot; if you look at where the Russian citizens who have been able to live in a residence permit in Estonia , Harjumaa is now in East Virgland , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them have been married by the European Union &apos;s citizens .
soil was granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permits decreased .
&quot; compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested for a permanent stay in Estonia , &quot; explained by the press spokesperson at the Ministry of the Interior , Mr Ramon , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years .
a new residence permit for Estonia will be able to apply for at least three years for foreigners who have lived here .
its aim is to encourage the attraction of people who have been adapted .
however , the long @-@ term residence permit requires five years , for example .
the extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased as a result of the new residence permit .
for example , soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to change their work and the Estonian state will no longer be pointing the finger at whether the pay criterion has been met .
this residence permit was popular for the lever - the holders of the grey passport ( 1029 ) , the Russians ( 487 ) , the Indians ( 54 ) and the nigerans ( 36 ) .
a total of 1968 people , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese , were able to live in Estonia .
with the first half of this year , the total number of applicants is already 1269 .
in 10 years , surprisingly , Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residency .
when three residence permits were issued in 2007 to Finns , soil was 200 .
Nigeria is coming to learn from this university .
the Estonian higher education institutions are also popular , for example , among Georgians , the Chinese and the Turks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has been rising largely thanks to learning games .
for them , too , the rule is that where there is a community in front of the community , there will be others more easily , &apos; added Ramallah .
in ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , just as much from Laos and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four Uruguay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , this is about 0.46 % of the total population .
even if we look at the citizens of the European Union , migration will remain around a percentage , &quot; the mafia commented that the figures are , in fact , small .
in total , according to the statistical office , 14 822 people died in Estonia , 13 792 .
this means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration .
most of them are Estonian citizens , but more are among those who leave them .
that is why Estonia &apos;s citizens &apos; migration secret , with 2 000 people , was in decline .
Estonians are particularly emigrating between Finland and Estonia .
Mlong Couture Princssimde with sats , chickens and tarrogance
however , in the North West of ideas , Mrs Tammeoru , there is a history - old paints and defendants : &apos; I can dream of a few hours somewhere in the museum and admire the old thieves and crats .
if you do something with a piece of stone , you will study and learn about it every day .
this is a pleasure !
the modern world of Mouture Couture may seem to be some alien , but the designer does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much soul is in your life !
as a friend , I have a whole sail full of the wounds of couture that I have created .
because , and it is not his fault , he does not live in the Hollywoos and does not go on a red @-@ shirt every day , he wants to wear the most beautiful brokers , and that is what it is suffering .
you will be able to live your life special !
the Moeartificial artist does not recognise the gap between the brilliant events and the grey day .
it is this reasoning that put the rolling stock in Estonia into rural areas , between forests and fields , people who often do not reach them .
for example , the collections were presented , for example , by comparison , Jair and Perlo moealleel , where 45 modell Royal defilee filled the whole street .
in Tallinn , there is often a hang , a novelty , but there is more emotion elsewhere - slogans , bars , stand up , you want to thank you .
a large part of the audience came just as news , but now they are the fans of Mammu Couture .
if you overshoot people &apos;s expectations , they are spirited !
and I like the feeling that I am with my motive like the summer .
Pernus was a 50 @-@ metre red carpet , a whole @-@ day brokers full , it seemed that they would not come to an end .
Mrs Maria does not recognise the motive that nature must be presented by a superficial superficial , she will be happy to bring ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always been happy .
after all , this is the lax of experience , the island of the iceberg !
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own play , I am always behind the ground to give a glimmer of hope as a mercy to things .
my nervous would not allow me to look calmly on the floor .
Mrs Maria is this kind of motto , who does not just want to play a representative role , but to be involved in everything .
I have my sister in the wind , most of the collections I myself carry out .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to discover .
I am never far from my animal and I am not afraid of work .
the only thing is not limited , but also the style , logistics , organisation , organisation - all the women of one temperment have to reach the day .
these hours of work are still huge for the fanatics .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a day full of joy !
I am still very lucky - it is like an unstoppable joke : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compliments .
it has been said several times that my brokers have a land of land - they make themselves feel like a printing .
the guise of the guerrillas , which Maria talent made known overnight , has long been a signal to the Senate of Couture .
Martin Myrsep U18 boys , a weapon of Estonians alagre , now turned against us .
the damage , the fairytale , was running out .
the first thing was that we were not able to get our table .
and if there is such a big difference in the table , there is nothing to do with the Estonian U18 corvpallipos 61 : 75 in the UK , our only basketball in NBRA , BC Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsep .
opponents of the attack took 28 Palace and received so much more attacks as a result of it .
we were also not prepared to protect them aggressively and not attack , it created .
many of the attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
in defence , however , they were able to keep their hands between them , we could not combine .
it created the team from the bottom .
the anti @-@ home work was better done .
according to Myrsepa , Estonia would have had to make more tactical mistakes in order to withdraw the anti @-@ missile fire .
the last quarter - we had a zero error , but the opponents have already received a number of quick harvests .
Atlessness and a close offensive , which was our weapon on the alagre turnines , now all of us were opposed .
today we did not have the power against their aggressiveness .
the Myrnap remained satisfied with its negligent Kalevis , Matthias Tass .
security in general can say good words about the whole team , to date there was a united shock .
it is a pity that such an aggressive response had not already been met before .
it has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but it seemed that he was tired - he has borne a huge burden .
but he made some of the fine gestures that I have seen earlier in the trennides , adding a guide .
horrendous figures : EM @-@ turniiril threw three quarter fewer than 10 points ...
the U18 age class does not only apply to the young men &apos;s B @-@ divisjon corvpallitinir in Tallinn , she started over yesterday in Dublin .
and Estonia &apos;s game with Poland was , unfortunately , an area of antiquity .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but even after the third quarter , the state of play was 9 : 49 , or only in the last ten minutes , opponents took their feet and the period remained at 16 : 16 .
both in the first and the second quarter , Estonia dump 4 , third point ...
at the same time , in the first two minutes , the Estonians caught two pieces of four minutes , but there are 25 pieces of play , then one yellow , and then another 21 to wait ...
perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 fingers were found .
in addition , 2 points came from four non @-@ negotiable rooms .
there was a reasonable number of losses in this time , 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland was hit by 33 % and Estonia by 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , with the opening day to be recognised 83 : 56 on the right of Portugal .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement supplies
today , on 1 October , NATO arrived at a permanent port visit to Tallinn for a week , in order to complement the stocks of ships and prepare for pre @-@ presumed habits .
in the course of the visit , ships are preparing for the landing of the sea , giving crews the opportunity to holiday on a daily holiday .
following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonia &apos;s waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations for historic explosive remnants .
&quot; the participation of children in the NATO unit and the co @-@ operation in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the alliances , &quot; said the chief captain Arto Reinmaa , the overseas operation and planning department in the Compliance of the fleet .
since 29 June , NATO will be led by the Latvian naval capter , Gvido Laudups , who took over the team &apos;s duties from the Estonian naval officers Johan @-@ Elias Seljab at a ceremony in Riga .
the group &apos;s flag vessel is LVNS Virsaitis , a Latvian naval force , which also operates as a group leader .
this semester is also part of the Estonian naval mine mine mine hunt .
as one of the four groups of NATO naval forces in NATO , NATO is a permanent group of landmines in the primary speed response unit , which may be sent to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - On 13 August , the Pirita knife will once again become a place where Burma has been carried out by Maestro Eri Kards 13 years ago .
this year , Mrs Festival can be a beautiful , powerful and unprecedented leader of the Risk to Joost ( 36 ) of the city of Tallinn .
the risk of Joost : listening to the people of the world &apos;s class classroom , &apos; Traviita &apos; and &apos; Tosca &apos; , balletilae answers by the club of Bolerost &apos; , &apos; Karlssonin &apos; , as well as its own production , this time Joseph Haydni Aastase , is not lacking , is the response of the same international team of creators who brought him to the Hague in 2015 . &apos;
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre answers .
it is more than any music theatre in its normal form .
it is a festival that takes power and never gets rid of .
because the experience that the listener receives in this superior and salvable environment puts human soul ringing and concerns human beings in a way that cannot be described .
the risk is the first year of Birgitta Festival &apos;s art leader .
did the Maestro Eri Klaskins not feel a little big ?
of course , as I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , there has been a lot of help .
I am going through a whole of my student career and also supported the restoration career at the beginning .
perhaps it is thanks to me that it is easier for me to continue his work .
in Klas , so much good and , of course , all of this is passed on to Birgitta Festival .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going .
it is the great heart of Eri Klasts who also gave me the strength to go ahead well with the Mayor of Tallinn in harmony with Birgitta Festival .
and here I am and I can do it .
what could be brought to the public at today &apos;s festival , what special offer do you offer ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , as a surprise , the first baller , written on Mrs Lindgreni &apos;s cheese , will be the first .
this is &apos; Karlsson lb &apos; .
and one of the notorious nuances in this regard is that the author of this balleit is the composer of Latvia , Juris Karlinning , who himself expressed a desire to write it .
apparently she has already lived in the breath of Karlsson .
to the risk , how are you all the nuances ?
thanks to my support for life , I am sure .
such work requires a system of support and a lot of love , and that is something that I am fortunate to have .
and I have noticed that my personal emotion does not depend so much on other people as I myself , in other words , how I am going to go against every new day .
and this awareness of the tone , the keeping of the positive and , in fact , smiling ourselves into the mirror of the morning , has made a significant increase in my happy percentage .
especially now this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen on this and it is working .
the naming of itself is an act of amusing and raising the tone .
it is not just a word .
I think that people do not yet know the things of their own body , which the universe offers them , but it is one that everyone will be able to do so slowly .
now , it is an important moment .
is there any kind of ritual before the dirigend took place ?
it is still true that clothing has to be replaced more convenient .
this is a small moment for itself .
however , in general , I do not have the opportunity to make a pump or a little cool before .
in fact , I even like to engage with people actively , even before the dirigendium took place .
but come to Birgitta Festival , what is also to be discovered here is not particularly large @-@ scale and ballet friend .
see a startling video with the risk of Joostiga !
new results of tests on the age of Swedish asylum seekers were published
in Sweden , the latest results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the constitution was assessed as a parent than 18 % , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for Legal medicine ( Reletsmedicinalvert ) started with the tests at the beginning of this year .
the tests were set up in order to assess the age of age more accurately when the Swedish Authority for Migration ( Migransverket ) was criticised for failing to correctly define the age of a number of allegedly minors .
to date , Jordan has sent a test of 80 cases and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 24 81 tests between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July 2017 .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed for 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older cases , and in 25 cases , the Institute of medical medicine assessed that the &quot; test &quot; could be 18 years old . &quot;
the 432 cases concluded that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if the age of man is questioned .
according to Johan G√∂ransson , who works in the Institute of medicine , the results are consistent with those of previous months .
&quot; we do not see a great difference in comparison with the statistics of previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &apos; he said to the newspaper The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been able to choose their age .
the Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that in 442 cases &apos; there are references to the fact that the person examining is 18 years old or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson ska Dagbladet investigated the results of these 581 tests , it became clear that in 243 cases , the person had stated directly that it would be 18 this year .
the method of assessing the age of medical age , which makes smart meters and rubber @-@ geniids , and then allows dental doctors and radiologists to analyse them , has been criticised in some circles .
one of the sceptics is the Karolinska Institute &apos;s endokrinologist Claude Marcus , whose task is to assess people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through the normal audience sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measuring method currently being used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very precarious .
if we cannot say firmly , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he said to the newspaper , &apos; .
but Johan G√∂ransson &apos;s trial of the Institute of medicine defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that the risk of a child being inaccurate to adulthood is low .
most of the 10 % risk is perhaps the case if you are a little under 18 . &quot;

the 20 @-@ year @-@ old newer , Anna Maria Orel , made a nice debate in London , receiving 67.37with a good 18 seats .
after that , MM noorim was a woman &apos;s wife and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for medals in the future .
the contest went well and received a good experience .
with the first test ( 64.80 ) , I immediately took away my medium @-@ term result , the second ( 62.80 ) risk too much and the third ( 67.37 ) I was able to keep it clear , &quot; said after the contest .
I had my own emissions and I am very pleased that I found it .
Anna Maria Oreli MM &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 seats .
the Vihmasadu Oreliu did not mix , as he will be training the winter through the TEC .
&apos;I am afraid &apos; , he said a little bit .
the London Olympics had almost a full house of the people , did the Orel reintegrate people or have been able to turn off ?
I came to Tajani , but in a positive sense .
everyone says that this will add - that is the case !
if you compete , then you can experience it .
he then confirmed that he will be satisfied with the MM &apos;s debate , and he is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 32nd outcome of this year &apos;s season , the last one , I closed 18 .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and Mil - that is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of the medals .
Western Virgina kuberner announced party exchanges
the Western Virginia Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President Trumpa , that he would change political parties .
&apos;Many it or not , but the democrats walked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today , I say to you , having vetoed and thought ... today , I say to you , the Western peaches , that I can no longer help you as a democratic Governor . &quot;
explanations of joy were glued in the mixing .
&quot; so I will be a Republican tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a engineer , I would say to you that it is time to play a second game . &quot;
the Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Virginia .
Trump won 42 points in Western Virginias and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats , Hillary Clinton .
justice , which is the only billion star in the state , according to the Ford , proved to be elected in 2016 .
in the wilderness , it notes that it has coal mines in five states , and the coal business is quite his father .
his value is approximately USD 1.59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday evening , the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) published a statement that &apos; the party exchange of Governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic parade that would rather prevent the country from improving again than working for it &apos; .
&quot; only 15 of the 15 months and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent saying to you , which is a guide to the end of the day and cannot find a positive and united message , &quot; said RNC representation , Ronna McDaniel CBS Newsi .
it is not surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
the Weekise medical practitioner , Urmet , said yesterday to a leaflet that they have had to share a lot of posters .
the mountains and brands are fundamental , excuses and easy fall .
of course , the main , absentia and shoes .
according to Urmeti , visitors come to the festival with false footwear and so the problems come .
the media have also had to help those who are visiting a few major injuries - there have been some scaremongering and also one of the footballs .
we have also made a blessing when a person has put a hand or a finger at the finger .
we are doing away with less nurses here , we are sending more to hospital .
see video on whether the brakes on the media would also ask a painkiller .
Coe praised the honest apologies of the Russians for the anti @-@ doping scandal .
the international rallies of Kergeania , Sebastian Coe , praised , according to his words , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apology &apos; on Thursday , but repeated that it is not time to allow sport to be allowed back .
on the eve of the World Cup on the eve of the International Council on the eve of the Shyry Shycehtin frivoltaum , Russia has said that the competition ban imposed on its country is right and has a firm aim to combat doping .
he apologised for &apos; all the lightweight classes who have been thrown away in competitions by golden and silver medals &apos; .
despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on entry into force , which was introduced in November 2015 after the report by the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think it was a very honest answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said to the IAAF President Coe journalists .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognised that they had had quite difficult times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Union . &quot;
according to Coe , he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for self @-@ determination .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the proposal for a working group that it is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; we must do everything possible in the next few months to normalise the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want to have clean sportspeople separated from the system , &apos; he added .
one of the hundreds of Russian bosses who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete with neutral athletes in London on Friday .
the head of the IAAF working group , Rune Andersson , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of criteria for forecasting .
following a presentation by the IAAF to the Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that the trained engineers who have been banned are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution makes a significant difference to the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
little of the fact that the revolution in electric cars significantly changes everything from the fuel market to infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market .
although mining giants like Glencore can say that they will win from one place and lose another , smaller mining companies will not help .
Glencore coal and oil are currently serving , but in the age of electric cars , there will be a growing demand for cobalt , lithium , copper , aluminium and nickel .
this year , the decisions of the UK , France and Norway , which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades , have contributed to the spread of electric cars .
therefore , Volvo has already knew that they are planning to abandon the combustion engine and Tesla will bring to the market a cheaper country of 3 electricity vehicles .
Banimal berg , according to the New Energy Finance predictions , electric cars are already sold over two decades , more cars than those used by oil @-@ produced fuels .
&quot; for some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Simona Gambranin Banimal berg , the raw materials analyst of the Capital economy .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium , which have increased demand for years .
in electric cars , there are approximately three times more copies than in the ordinary car , the Glencore announced .
more answers are needed in the charging stations , which is why the Exane BNP Paris estimates that this will increase the demand for copper by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional lithium , cobalt , graphite and manganese demand .
Glencore can be obtained from rising electricity from copper prices and from the fact that it is the world &apos;s largest producer of cobalt , the forecast Jeffila Group .
according to this broker company , the winners of the Fbete @-@ McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals are the winners .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of the London metal stock exchange line has been mixed .
the price increases in the soil were 37 % .
the answer has also been 14 % this year , mainly due to economic growth .
the Glencore excise duty rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the rival in Rio Tinto Group , BHP Billitoni and Anglo , respectively .
on the side of the losers , lead companies are like Recyclex and Campine , who have to adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ use of the Plii is the batteries supplying the start @-@ up of cars with petrol and diesel engines .
electric cars use filter mines .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael Widmer Lynch , Governor of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch .
the impact of the Plii price movement has not yet been seen in the form of a seamless trend .
the Plii has grown by 17 % this year , with the best methane metal in London among the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems for the metals in the future .
&quot; I am not sure that it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil is keeping ordinary cars competitive , &quot; said Herwig Schmidt , the head of the metal broker Triland Metals .
if lead demand falls , it will be slow .
perhaps this will happen in about ten years &apos; time .
meanwhile , more stringent emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which is more frequent dependent on advanced lead @-@ based batteries , will be assessed by international lead and by the research organisation .
Kergmetal , like aluminium , is replaced by steel , as a lighter car can drive less electricity .
this explains an additional EUR 1.6 million tonnes of closed minimum demand between 2013 and 2016 .
this represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s total output .
this trend is likely to grow , says Widmer .
Aluminium is responsible for 13 % this year , as the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to market deficits .
steel producers do not .
the blockade is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful cars .
ArcelorMittal and SlanEurope are also trying to develop a lighter meltdown from steel in order to withstand the minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris , Sylvain Brunet .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to a plate .
the soil took around half of this precious metal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , and was announced by the metal refiner Johnson Matta .
&quot; many of the raw materials , such as oil and plate , may not have high demand in the future , &quot; said Natixourselves &apos;s raw materials analyst Bernard Dahdah .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will change in 15 years .
Plaatinatmakers believe continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Mr Marc Grynberg , leader of the Uncore , said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 .
the great hope for Plaatinatmakers in the 10 years perspective is Toyota Motors and Hymuni Motos , based on hydrogen @-@ based cars that depend on a plate to produce electricity from hydrogen .
until now , however , this technology has not yet justified itself commercially .
&quot; it seems to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris from Brunet .
German car manufacturers received a major setback in July , as Stuttgart &apos;s court banned diesel in the city of Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche .
how the monetary rules of football affect the transition of Neyra to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the rampant spending of European football clubs do not prevent the world record transition from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona club Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences for UEFA , the governing body , which dominates the European game and in which it is possible to ban teams from the prestigious League of Meisters from participating in the Security Council , are still awaiting the Paris Saint @-@ GerMay .
the financial rules for the fair play of UEFA in 2011 ( FFP ) mean that the PSG will have to prove at some point that Mrs Neyra &apos;s transition was funded without a huge loss .
EUR 222 million were paid to Barcelona ( USD 262 million ) alone for the fact that the Brazilians were able to buy their contract , and Neyra &apos;s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars per year .
here there are some aspects of the transfer of Neyra to the French club .
the PSG will undoubtedly be able to take up such money for the recruitment of Neymarry and to include its stars in the wake of the fact that the team is funded by the ruling family in Katar &apos;s energy .
clubs have been allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players , but they have to balance it with the legal sources of income that allow them to come out of a football business .
FFFP was set up by Michel Platini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that the clubs , which are falling into debt in search of success , are actually engaged in fraud and risk buying when banks or owners should give up support .
from 2011 , the FFP club will focus on monitoring their losses instead of their debts .
this change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich was first used in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then to spend heavily to improve the team and to create a global brand - is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of the FFP , which runs until 2018 , the clubs will be able to bear the losses of up to EUR 30 million .
and despite the fact that Platini was dismissed in 2015 , the successor of UEFA , Alexander Ceferin , is still committed to preventing excessive overspending .
&quot; FFFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said last week The negotiator , Andrea Traverso , who is UEFA &apos;s FFP Supervisor .
although the PSG tag for the overpurchase clause of Neyra , it will be possible for them to distribute this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the agreement .
Mrs Neymar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it is possible to demonstrate a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years .
for the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , the PSG , together with Abu Dhabi , received the most severe penalties .
the PSG was fined EUR 60 million ( currently 82 million dollar ) , which was reduced later to EUR 20 million , and the club was required to limit the team of the League of Meisters to 21 players during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of 25 .
UEFA is looking at clubs who can try to overturn the financial institutions , blowing their income through companies connected with the owners of the club .
the Katar company may sponsor the PSG , but if the value of sponsorship is recognised as standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
this was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Qatar tourism Authority &apos;s PSG support was inflated .
it has been said that a certain part of the PSG service of Neymari can come from Kainfrastructures through contributions from the World Cup Management Committee for 2022 years .
however , the PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Mrs Neyra could become a world championship and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulators are capable of easily exposing such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not been proactive in discussing the transition with the PSG .
they talked about the associated PCongress , provided that their anonymity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PSG .
the latest reports show that the PSG 2015 @-@ 2016 will generate more than ‚Ç¨ 10 million in profits from around ‚Ç¨ 542.4 million in turnover .
the figures for the last financial year have not yet been published .
the PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions , trade and snus .
the club looks forward to an increase of at least 30 per cent of turnover in relation to the agreement .
Spain too , having clearly upset the departure of one of the largest football stars , sought to block the move by claiming that the PSG is in breach of the FFP .
&quot; this is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with a club and a country , &quot; said La vie President Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS , referring to the fact that the PSG belongs mainly to the Katarias .
Arsenal m√§neer , Archger Wenger , whose club belongs to the American sports magnate , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights and has changed completely the whole football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger on Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to the state , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , since the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player . &quot;

today , 50 years ago : an anachronistic storm in Estonia , which was ripped off from houses and windows .
the orchestra of the century , which took place on 6 and 7 August , caused major damage in particular to the West , Harjuland and Raplaland .
in the course of these days , the wind was more than 30 m / s in the north @-@ west of Estonia .
in my old guest , a handful of bottles ran from one card to another , and they had to be backed up with them .
everything was blind and ragne , like the world stage .
the mother has already cut off the houses , reminiscent of the old Linda Kurova hospital magazine in 2002 of the Estonian nature in this interview .
the wife of Linda spouse saw how his planted tours collapsed .
however , what are you going to support with your hands , where you are receiving such a storm ?
the sea came under the window , the windows of water , &quot; said Haapsalus Kalda today , Mrs Linda at the time .
the fact that the roads were full of trees and the seroon of the railway station had been flying to 20 @-@ 30 metres , Linda most of the sharks , just like next morning .
according to the local , Paralepa &apos;s trees were behind the story , some of which were completely lengthy , some boys .
everyone saw very depressing , the storm went through the beautiful old trees as a radar and pragmatism as a war .
Western Viruland was not particularly severely affected by August 1967 , compared with Western Estonia , but the losses were large there , the Virumaa theatre wrote in 2007 .
Batsalu Lfossil Park and Padise Park were swept away from the ground , but also our own parks were severely affected .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured by up to 35 metres per second , or about 130 kilometres per hour .
in Tallinn , Merioutal was one of the few lead chambers in the evening of 6.August : &apos; mother , mother !
the Canaries are in the air and no longer , &quot; wrote Virumaa Official Journal .
the generation of the earth in Viljandiland was so destroyed during the storm that it was decided to dismantle it later .
the design of the T√ºri ski mountains , which was no longer restored later , was not opposed to August .
the newspaper Red Tblt wrote on 12 August in 1967 that the refurbishment of cities and settlements has been slow down and their vehicles are progressing slowly , and the inhabitants could be involved in corrotation works .
in Turin , fertility crops were also severely affected , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party organisations must be both on corps and on fertility corps and on the road map &apos; .
Orkaanides can be talked about if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s .
the watertight wind in Estonia stands at 2 November 1969 , when Ruhnul was measured as a speed of 48 m / s .
in the island of Vaindstory , a sword of measurements , so it was not able to record the speed of the strong wind .
secret of holiday beaches : night corps and poor coastline
more expensive summer ills also mean lower corroments in the beaches of Tallinn .
&quot; if there is no , people are on the rank , and if there are no people , then there are also no people &apos; , the beacle will say .
the city of Northern Tallinn in Stroom &apos;s rankings is stubborn .
they are offered mechanical competition by a tractor on low @-@ turn competition , which is a threshold for a plainant tripe .
in fact , the last seven cent of metre goes through the sand , picking out the seafood and people left behind : bottles , cigarettes and so on .
people are still coming to rank , regardless of whether water is warm or not .
if there is a beauty , then people are on the rank , and if there are no people , there are also no people , &apos; the management of the private company hospital hospital &apos; will be said by Alexander Usov , Mr Usov .
there are 6.30 p.m. and there is a bitter corrotation on the coast , because at 8 p.m. the posters must be in order for the people .
the Usov is already at four o &apos;clock .
apart from Stroom , he is still watching on the coast of Pirita , Harta Lake , Kakum√§e and Palaraare Pikakari .
the amounts of Pr√ºm have fallen .
years ago , it was much more .
people are now entitled to assess what is being done for them , &quot; the Usov , who has repeated the 15 years of migrants .
before it was that , when something new had been put up , it was the next day .
now , what is on the coast is already being kept .
price of clean beach
one of the biggest jobs in the Estonian beaches is the repetition of the rubbish , the adru .
for example , in the Pirita coast , it must be transported by 400 000 tonnes of coastline .
&apos;This is an incredible amount &apos; , notes the Usov .
the second major category is municipal waste , or all that people leave behind .
there are eight major rubbish lines in Stroom coastal zones , which need to be watered down three times a week .
so much is the waste .
however , cold summer weather has meant that rubbish is a fifth less than otherwise .
the third category is abandoned .
in most cases , they are children &apos;s TV stations .
as a result , Usov is pulling out of the sand of ten metres of slump .
these are the owners who are waiting for the underground timber route .
&quot; they usually come out more , but it is a normal harvest , &quot; Usov knows that it will soon find them back in the sand .
children come to rank and take the toys to reinstall them .
landfill is broken down
Erika Scholler , a representative of administrative services , admitted that the work of the tractor is disrupting local communities .
noise , which lasts from hours to hours , is mixed up by people living in the neighbourhood .
on the day , however , this work is impossible .
in one month , rand will have to travel twice .
&quot; if we do not do this , the city will be fined , &quot; notes Scholler .
however , like Pirita , Pikakr and Savary , the aim is also to get Stroom rand below the quality of the international flag .
&quot; compared with Europe , there is much more work to be done in Estonia to care for the beaches , &quot; says Scholler .
we have more addar and more kids , and it is more difficult to join the sand .
however , our beaches have less rubbish than elsewhere in Europe .
listening to the fact that there is talk of rubbish , the conversations between Mr Martin , who is living near the Stroom coast , are taking place inexorably in the interviews of the journalist and corrogation staff , highlighting the current bottlenecks .
there is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is birds and bottle slaves , who have pulled the rubbish bags , &apos; Mr Martin .
although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the city Government will do something about the rubbish and , for example , put them on the fringes to prevent at least birds in the news .
in general , however , Martin Stroom is satisfied with developments .
it can be seen that the city is taking care of this .
it has become more pleasant , enlightened and fresh asphalt roads .
it was never the case that only one way could be taken in the event of a roll @-@ out , &quot; said Martin .
findings of Stroomis : coins , only coins
a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Dimitr , who , as a treasurer , is sailing the coastline with metallic depression , has had to be used .
he does not believe that , today and in the future , nothing will be found in the price .
marine God is not generous enough to do so .
&quot; I have been dealing with this for one year and has not found anything worthwhile so far , &quot; says Dmitry .
as a refrigeration , the Dmitry Islands have some euro coins , bottles and also dangerous pounds which later throw in the dustbin .
normally , there are still coins .
&apos;Golden , the finger and other such practices are usually not &apos; , &apos; they are owned by the treasuries .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain on the previous level , as unbearable growth and inflation relief have cushioned speculation on the increase .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain a loophole , because household incomes have put interest rates on expectations .
decision makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MPC ) have voted 6 : 2 in favour of 0.25 % retention and fewer members this month require an increase , as slow economic growth has weakened the support for growth .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank cut its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 and from 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also signalled that the increase in rates for the next few years is necessary to curb inflation from Brexon from Brexmen , and that the expected increase in lending costs in the financial markets could be necessary .
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package , which was launched as a result of Brexti a year ago .
the Bank will terminate its fixed @-@ term cash scheme in February , which provides banks with cheap funding , even though it said that it is now GBP 15 billion to wait for the scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; the central forecast of MPC will remain gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the near future , as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption . &quot;
as regards the rates of inflation , it was reiterated that a &apos; fiscal effort &apos; is needed to alleviate inflation , and this &apos; somewhat higher &apos; than expected in the markets .
the Eurostars is now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any jump is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % for the next year .
the forecast for 1.8 % growth in 2018 was maintained .
after this news , the pound of the dollar and the euro fell .
women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.31 and 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to growing hopes of an increase in GDP in the second quarter , from 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will be able to collect a little momentum .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave rise to little reason to rejoice in the households suffering from rising inflation and abject wage increases , saying that the situation would go a little worse before an improvement .
it has been added that the monetary policy cannot prevent a fall in income in the next few years , but the three @-@ year forecast is expected to result in a marked recovery of wages .
as a result , the economy is also encouraged by the growing demand for British production , which is partly compensating for lower costs for consumers .
the decision comes one year after the rates were taken by 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to breathe life into the prices and to the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last decision , there was a growing demand for higher levels , as inflation had increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak pound .
Andrew Montlake , leader of Coreco mortgages , said : &apos; in the light of the recent downturn in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market will again become increasingly competitive , as creditors want to work and hope to end the year in a positive way .
the B√∂rs seems to be particularly favourable to those whose transactions are coming to an end , as refinancing , often without service and low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
10 000 people have been written out by the NHS as a drug of HIV conflict .
patients have since September had access to &apos; transformative &apos; HIV @-@ preventive treatment after the battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the medicine .
NHS England announced that public health care is now estimated to make 10 000 people available during the initial three @-@ year clinical trial for pre @-@ eminence ( PrEP ) - a tablet that is manned before the incident and has shown a reduction of approximately 86 % of the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people .
the NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the Court of appeal supported the ruling of the Supreme Court last year , according to which the NHS is able to pay for the PrEP , despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Stevens , the Executive Director of NHS England , welcomed this Thursday as a &apos; new large @-@ scale intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NAT ) described it as a &apos; pivotal moment &apos; .
sexual health clinics in London , Bright ton , Manchester , Liverpoolis and Sheffield are among the first to register people in October , and further clinics before the programme is introduced in England by April 2018 .
the pre @-@ PrEP is a hotline for HIV drugs , which will be taken before the incident , in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that PrEP will significantly reduce the transmission of HIV among people with a risk of infection .
the PrEP &apos;s adoption before the mid @-@ term means that there is a sufficient number of certain medicines in order to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure .
the right candidates include LGBT men , transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment .
they identify suitable people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , transgender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their participation in the local sex health clinics in the programme .
the programme will cost GBP 10 million and NHS England signed an agreement to get medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the clinical test aims to assess the actual potential of the PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who is treated and how it is consumed and implemented .
Steven said : &apos; this new large @-@ scale intervention should complement and enhance the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV proliferation .
this is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of the greatest health problems facing humanity . &quot;
Deborah gold , the Managing Director of NAT , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
the PrEP , if targeted correctly to those who need it and belong to the risk line , offers an opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic .
since September , people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
the Managing Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation , ian Green , said : &apos; now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is launched quickly and that no HIV risk group is excluded .
now that the PrEP clinical trial has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of HIV infection .
the Minister for Public Health , Sharon Hodgson , said : &apos; PrEP clinical trials are very welcome and very late after months of delay and the census of government shoes .
evidence shows how much changes this drug can bring to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical trial will lead us a step closer to full understanding of the benefits of the PrEP .
it is now important for a clinical trial to be introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV and lead us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
in July , the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.94 , compared to EUR 7.71 in June this year , Elering .
the main reason for the price difference is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , the electricity average was ‚Ç¨ 34.33 per megawatt hour last month and the price arose by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 34.17 , and the electricity exchanges in Nord half of the systemic price was EUR 26.37 per megavable hour .
prices rose by 12 and seven per cent respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity was mobile by 75 % last month from Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine per cent of the two @-@ hour transactions between the two countries did not take place .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity reached 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the hours had the full transmission capacity .
according to the last trading day of July , Nasdaq OMX on the market may turn into an electricity exchange price of 34 and ‚Ç¨ 37 per megavable hour in August .
the price of carbon dioxide produced by electricity prices came up last month and transactions took place at 5.04 @-@ 5.47 per tonne .
life of higher life - half @-@ order and smart designers have made it a small Earls of the Court of Justice in the home
Joanne Leigh , a former banker who is a passionate property innovator , switched his home to the Grand Knightsbridge in 2014 against the Earls Court of Justice .
it is in the first order of Queen Anne Ter≈£i , and that Joanne has not brought his bags together and sold the flats , is a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived together with a former compass in Knightsbridge , &quot; said Joanne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tantamount to the price that I offer .
it was shown to me by the Earls Court of Justice and had the same high waves .
I am wondering about this and I made an offer on the same day . &quot;
since the first visit , this 93 @-@ metre has passed a full innovation gap .
at the beginning , it was a sleeping and a complex sleeping cort - a sleeping wall had to go through kitchen , and Joanne wanted to add space and quasi @-@ regulation to exploit high levels .
&quot; I wanted high , big windows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he is asking Erfan Azad Notting Hillis , the architectural and designer of Duck &amp; Order , to take advantage of 3.8 m ears and to create a home that is not just a development site but a place where Joanne could live .
it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a quasi @-@ order in which to stand up .
the Erfan was supposed to be a creative approach .
&quot; aquaculture is quite complex , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to reorganise the premises so that they are located on each other , without having to bow to each other .
it was not just about building a platform , but we used steel construction to ensure that both the upper and lower space is right . &quot;
this place allowed the Erfanil to create two full @-@ blown elements in the room , with a great deal of dramatic elements .
one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ one @-@ stop @-@ shop is opening up the old @-@ fashioned light of the Retrouvius window to the glacidity of Retrouvius .
the golden furniture of Peegelli , silver details and retrospective Serge Mouille , highlight the style of space .
the use of mirrors plays a role in the inclusion of theatre , space and lighting .
both sides of the short corridor have been included in the mirrors that this would appear to be longer .
in the Knight , the mirror is giving the impression of another accompanying window .
in the course of a return , the snapshot of the deposit of all Joanne &apos;s and glass claims will be reflected .
housing is accompanied by a false possibility of shutting down the vegetables if it is not used , creating a more dense space .
the cumbersome kitchen is nothing new .
however , with this kitchen , there is a unique fact that this is a plug of uprisings of the type of garage .
&quot; this went a little in the design , &quot; explains the presence of Erfan terasstronger spouse of MDF .
&quot; this has a counterweight , which is why it is very simple to reject it . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage , Joanne now has 16 additional metres , additional sleeping rooms and a better harvester plan .
&quot; after all , the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to property , &apos; says Erfan .
&apos;Kinnisa takes an outdated form and makes calculations on the basis of land area &apos; .
here they have been able to increase the surfaces , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to the space .
&quot; materials are what you are missing and thus help to create an emotional link with the home , &quot; says Erfan .
&apos;You are not in the electricity cables that are in my sein .
it is important , but it does not put the heart of the languages ringing . &quot;
this shows that a good design and an increase in the area will help to make something astonishing from a rather normal corps .
in fact , they can even create a desire not to leave , as was the case with Joanne .
the main figure , Jensen Jensen , is Chicago &apos;s pill @-@ maker , who is competing with my colleague for his professionalism .
no more than the amount of money that has been earned , apart from which any ethics is forgotten .
his wife and three children can only see a man on his property and late this evening .
in the first half of the film , I find myself in the idea that this is a version of the business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler &apos;s speech is similar .
what the film goes on , however , the less well @-@ established element remains , and the moralising intention of film @-@ makers is beginning to appear more and more .
a life @-@ changing experience will be the main player in cancer .
a choice must now be made between work and family life .
the poet of poppy census makes a father look at the big buildings in Chicago &apos;s big buildings , just like religion , welfare , love ... , without even the disaster of the twin towers .
after the third , where the son &apos;s father &apos;s eyes are opened , there is a feeling that the film @-@ makers have certainly been able to obtain the audiences of the purpose , because even the most predatory view of the heart is unable to keep tears back in the face of the suffering of the cum cancer patients .
if the poet falls and his situation seems to be hopeless , the father will once and for all understand the moral nature of his work and do a good job for the elderly .
now , in a sense , I am lucky with myself - if a film has been in possession of it , then I will reward my sense of vision after the film coffee , if I am wrong , then at least one surprise may be rewarded .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ice coffee will be lost - when the husband calls a sick man and a man drives a motorway along the road map .
however , the Poeg has been amazed at all , and although his father has just lost his job , it is also positive , because it is now time to deal with the family .
I can also feel well - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well .
in truth , film is well constructed , all the necessary elements are in place .
it will be the Council , it will be a laughing actor , it is a good and moral beauty : money is not the most important thing in life .
this film is well introduced by surprise .
the new Staff Commander is planning to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly will actually be able to do so .
in that case , it would be the first .
Politico writes that the new staff chief of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President Trumpin , including news , in the hope that it will keep the upper hand in a more balanced way .
there is a full report here from Josh Dawseylt :
&quot; when the new staff chief of the White House , John F. Kelly , met with high officials on his first day of work , he highlighted the key problem of President Donald Trumpi Valges Main , which he intends to address in the hands of the President Assad .
Mr Kelly said to the officials that information must be carried out , whether on paper or in meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried to do so and have failed to tame Trumpi by monitoring its media consumption .
President Trumpi &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades , and now that he is in Valdis Main , his television observation habits have not gone anywhere .
&quot; when the candidate Trump was dishonest about dishonest media coverage , he had to show him that he was also fairly reflected in the publications affecting him , &quot; said former campaigner Sam Nunberg in February to Politico .
Politico tara Palmer wrote at the time that &apos; according to the six former campaigners , Trumpi Twitter is a key tool for controlling the behaviour of the Trumpi Twitter , to ensure that his personal media consumption also has a stable record of praise &apos; .
good .
however , the idea that the habits of using Trumpi Twitter have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know that the vouchers of Trumpi would have been even more heartening without their intervention .
we will probably never know about the vouchers that the Trump did not postal .
if he was helpless able to save him or a couple of times , his efforts were worth doing so .
however , no one has been able to prevent the Trumpi from constantly creating controversy .
part of the problem is that , in the White House , which is composed of competing clicks , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception , by transferring material to the Trug , which supports their global views , but may not always be credible .
the whole story of policy @-@ making policy tico wrote in May the tendency of advisers to the President of feed @-@ related information with a strategic question .
one of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows :
&quot; the current and former Trumpi will say that Trump can react to the negative press , particularly the harmful effects of the leaflets , explosive , taking as a obsession with the identification of their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone gave the President a cheerfully copy of the Internet provocation to Charles C. Johnson &apos;s website , GotNews.com , which accused the staff deputies Katie Walshi , that he was a white house for a number of leaflets . &quot;
it does not matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked by Twitter , or that he did not provide any specific evidence or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
the Trump read the article and started to ask Walshi . &quot;
Goldmacher added that Rob Porter and the head of the White House , Rob Porter , have tried to set up a system for managing and documenting the documents reaching Trumpin . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but Trump is still an impulse and his assistant will continue to compete on the basis of influence .
these unchanging factors make the mission very difficult .
street musicians who have come from abroad to the capital of the capital will not be able to obtain permission to do so .
there is a lot of foreign affairs in the city of Tallinn .
those with whom the leaflet came to recognise that they played in the old town without the permission of the urban government .
the first thing we found was the three street musicians who had taken the same cocktail in the vicinity of Viru .
it was clear to see that musicians with rockets and broken rigs were the musicians of absentia , who would be taken away by one of the deserts .
in spite of the humiliation , the only woman in the company played a ferry in the apartment , while one man , alongside him , was in gestation with three balls and furniture .
the third man was sitting in absentia alongside them , and he himself smoked a warm @-@ hearted wagon .
their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people of passing .
Mr Bob , who has played with Mr Noemi and the palliates , has said that he is wearing the streets both for fun and for money .
the purpose of the event was to collect ticket money for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day .
on the question of whether or not they asked for permission from the town for rotation , Mr Noemi and Mr Bob have shaken their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never remain in one city for more than a day or a few and , in most cases , permits for a month or something like this .
there is no point in paying for this , &quot; explained by Bob .
when we returned to the gates of Viru some 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in musicians and are going to go .
this paperwork for the Viru crossing of the virtual centre with sacks and bags in absentia .
Viru street has also represented three Polish young men , one of whom played a fifth , another knife , and the third had even been transported by electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people entertainment in order to spread music and joy , and to earn money for fuel and living , &quot; trio pipe Mivosh explained .
according to Mivoshi , they are aware that there must be permission from the City Government .
&apos; of course we do not have this &apos; , he said it joke .
but we hope that if people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
of course , if the police comes , we will go elsewhere , but we must try &apos; , he added .
in July , the Estonian bank bought bonds worth ‚Ç¨ 149 million in the public assets programme of central banks in the euro area , with a bank bond portfolio of ‚Ç¨ 4.36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Hardo Hansson , has explained in the past that the assets of the central banks of the Eurosystem are covered by three different purchasing programmes : the bonds covered by the financial sector ( VIS ) , the bonds guaranteed ( ABS ) and public debt ( PSPP ) .
the Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases will fall in the production of lower @-@ risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks .
as a rule , in the framework of the public bond programme , each Central Bank buys its own government bonds , and the bonds of other countries are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank will make a so @-@ called &apos; replacement shop &apos; within the limits allocated to them .
the central banks also shop in those countries where the provision of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian bank generally buys the bonds of the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian bank will buy bonds under the asset programme from March 2015 .
in the meantime , Eleround bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian bank of June 2016 will no longer buy bonds from June 2016 .
in the name of the central banks of the euro area , both Eleround and Estonia will buy energy bonds from the Bank of Finland from June .
migrants are ignoring degrees and returning to the &apos; millions of business &apos; .
some of the West Midlands &apos;s most affluent owners have once again found themselves in a fierce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the unelected bureaucrats of the Council in order to win back their walls .
the migratory movements have parked their 20 trailers to the brink of a wealth of millions of business in the vicinity of the Solihulli street .
they have returned , together with horses , children and lorries , to the army , after they were thrown out in May , without being thrown out of a degree of bureaucracy that was complaining to the Council to prevent their invasion .
an activist group found a weak place in defence limits , turning its vehicles through unblocked parts that were left to poke .
the people of Maruangry have contacted Solihulli Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless in dealing with the problem &apos; .
one anonymous person said : &apos; they copied there on Monday evening after their exclusion from Bentley Heathfrom , where they were storing the furniture .
the Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migratory movements were there in May , they were delayed and now they are back again .
they came to last night , probably more today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect their parks .
I live on the road of street etsbrook , and I am not happy that I must continue to pay the full charge if the Council is unable even to prevent such a thing . &quot;
one local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said : &apos; it is ridiculous , and we saw the last of these migratory movements left , and there is already a new offensive .
this time , there has been an increase in the number and even a horse has been seen in the grassland . &quot;
the Solihulli Council representative said : &apos; we are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the land near the street etsbrook , and we are working with the Solihulli police , and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
the gathering of evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling the number 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the Weekna Festival will also visit the Minister for Culture , Indrek Saar , who is pleased to have been able to bring real world top names to Estonia .
the question of why the Weekise festival is so important for the Estonians , Saar , that it should be asked of all those who enjoy three days at the festival .
however , he is aware that the real players in the area of Persia have come to pass .
&quot; looking at the level of artists , which has been brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music director will be brought home - often not in our hands , the Minister for Culture is speaking .
however , what festivals are the artists of Saart himself all the most telling ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person , and it is certainly one of the most experienced doctors , Armin van Bnewren , who stood up last night .
after all , all of us are at some point in their own feet , &quot; he says .
however , he also highlights a number of names , such as Chainthia , Deadmau5 , Knifebels .
of course , our own Estonian players : starting from NOx , and they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , this renowned concentration of names is very high , &quot; he says .

Audi upgrades up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of criticism by car manufacturers
the day before the Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of BMW , the company believes that &apos; there is a smarter option than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the BMW home city of Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles will be upgraded to reduce emissions from diesel engines in Europe .
no company has described them as a call for withdrawal .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma .
at the same time , the cost of equipment installed for neutralising vehicles emitting diesel vehicles is increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under a thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of ringing powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to prevent Volkswagen from repeating the mistakes of the Volkswagen , who was silent about the use of so @-@ called petrolery devices , which allowed emissions to be adapted to regulations when testing a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former president of the Audi engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi in Germany was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen , when the authorities accused the installation of the audit system in order to evade the requirements for European gas emissions by extending the investigation , which was previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Audi in the investigation may be a major blow to the Volkswagen , a producer of luxury cars , a disproportionately large proportion of Volkswagen &apos;s profits .
Estonian schools will have 20 000 euro of EU flags .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency .
a total of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union &apos;s flag will be 570 education institutions .
flags are intended to install indoor doors , they must be carried out in high @-@ quality printed techniques with a sense of quality assurance in indoor communications , the ERR news portal .
there is a text on the label : &apos; Kingitus Estonia &apos;s schools for the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , or one flag will cost EUR 35 .
murder of journalist highlights growing threats in Mexico
the workers of the weekly newspaper , Riodoce , usually gather on Wednesday , in order to review plans for the most recent chaos in the State of Yaoa , which sows organised crime , corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars .
however , today they have gathered to discuss their own security in the shadow of a personal tragedy .
they are told that it is important to change their routine .
two of the parents will be discussing which seems safer : either to bring children into office , which was the target of the grandioattack in 2009 , or to leave them home .
security experts have written three words , &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutral &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask reporters to be able to provide the names of the river basket , and they do not need the impressions and internal feelings .
the presence of government or cartels is suspected of being drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists , a whole list of people who are making it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
violence is not a breath , and the more the bodies of the country accumulate , the majority of which are journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists , from President Enrique Pena , to the appointment of at least 25 in December 2012 , 589 journalists under public protection following attacks and threats , and this year , at least seven journalists have been killed in seven state states .
the most recent deaths include their editor and inspiration , Riodoce co @-@ founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Valdez one of his many reports on drug @-@ related violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though his presence can be felt anywhere in the theatre of the River Riodoce Building , a great picture of Valdezan , which shows an average of the finger at Valdezist , and two of the 30nines reporters , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , carries T @-@ shirts , which have been portrayed by his wife @-@ sleeping glasses or the face of the amateur .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death , Reporters will be discussing a common trauma , their nightmare , their hopelessness , their paranoia .
although in 2010 , a separate public prosecution service was set up to address journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee on the Protection of journalists .
as in the case of the most annual drug trafficking and organised crime , the number of murders amounting to thousands , the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
the editorial in Riodoce will continue to reflect the violence in Sinalina , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and justice of the murderers , there is a lot of benefits , according to Ibarra .
&apos;It is very nice to waste your time here at the meeting &apos; .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , there will be a mistrust of everyone . &quot;
Valdez left the office of Riodoce , the capital of the State , Culiacan , on 15 May morning .
he was able to travel only a few quarters before two men stopped the red Toyota Corolla , forcing him to go out of the car and shot 12 times , and this is expected to be because of the name of the newspaper , which means &apos; the twelfth river &apos; .
the armed man travelled to Valdez &apos;s car and made an accident in the vicinity .
Valdez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adults .
the Culiacan freely spread freely .
however , the Valdez issue is essentially dominated by silence .
since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of the United States in January , one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country , since rivalries are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
there is no difference that a person or even a number of people are dumped every day on the streets of your oa , or that the dead are wrapped with the gruesome two @-@ fold sweeteners of narcotics , which are more than many homes .
let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one cartel is headed by the state of the sea with valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Riodoce and the President , IsMay Bojorquez ( 60 ) , have a huge innocence that he was unable to defend his friend .
he believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
the first was the publication in February of an interview with Guzman &apos;s sons with a competing and military cartel .
this piece of correspondence could have been alluded to by the wealthy members of the suspect who bought all the copies of the publication as soon as these newspapers were reached .
the second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for its own security , after the ravage took place in one of the other &apos;s newspapers , which has been reflected in the same story .
Valdez was legalised both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had remained in life for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he existed forever .
he served as a veteranreporter in the newspaper Norol in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce , sold 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bojorquez said that it was impossible to deal with the media without touching on the drug problem . &quot;
the quantity of time spent by its courageous and honest publicity , and sales and advertising increased .
Reporters were keen to express vigorous studies without fear of censorship and readers , in which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Riodoce , the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Caboti Award for the demonstrations in Latin America .
in the same year , the Committee for the Protection of journalists in Valdez ( AKK ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow the Mexican drug creation wherever it takes .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said the AKK award .
last October , he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in the Your .
&quot; the mayors will accept the task that the journalist office is accompanied by a second chance to play .
I do not want to ask me that what I did in the face of so many deaths , or why I did not talk about what is going on . &quot;
Riodoce collectives will miss Valdez , a joke who roppered like madrus , a friend who divided embryos and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their support to his routine .
he always weed his own village .
he went across the office to El Guatemyabo bar and was always in the same desk .
now they ask whether his routine love became fatal to him .
his death has also cast them in doubt about how best to do his job and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the arrogance of their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bojorquez .
the result , even in the best times , is strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination .
trusted your instincts .
if it is a matter of suspicious fragrances , the hotel .
Riodoce editor Andres Villarreali said that the problem is that &apos; fragrance can be deceived ... and this is the case with Jempera &apos; .
he and others say that you no longer have old rules , just as they do not apply in Thailand , Veracruz , Guerreros or other states , which are home to the toxic combination of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in a space where Riodoce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only a pupil sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in front of the house , two police officers were seeking a relaxation of 40 degrees of heat , hiding behind the pumps .
they were appointed by the government to the office of Riodoce , which is located in the middle of the Culiacan centre class in Culiacan .
some of the reporters wondered whether these police officers are among their 50 % of police officers , whose Governor himself has been unreliable .
several months have passed since reporters have been travelling to mountainous rural areas where controls are de facto drug gangs .
Riodoce &apos;s edition this week addressed three main pillars .
one of them was the murder of former poxlegs Julio Cesar Chavez venna in Sinalo .
in addition , they had a revealing story of the spending of government funds on the home city of the Governor .
a group of people was kidnapped from Culiacan , one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , and a public Prosecutor &apos;s cabinet .
there was no formal announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened , so there was a need to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of a restaurant , both of drug dealers and of the authorities .
the Reporter became aware of public documents that a restaurant is registered as a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Party ( IRP ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
in recent times , several IRP Governor has been accused of corruption in the context of widespread cases .
in Villarline , the reporter asked her to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Guzman poet El Chapo was saved by the army .
just a few months earlier , readers would have been looking for the Valdez cocktag to obtain information on kidnapping from the best sources .
&quot; in the past , we would have known what happened , &apos; said 46 @-@ year @-@ old Villarline , whose broker body construction has earned him a slogan El Flaco .
&quot; now all channels of communication have broken up with our sources . &quot;
the Valdez office has become a reservoir to bridges and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the editorial workers have become something that they never expected to wait for activists on behalf of the press .
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few eyes and direction next morning to the local Prosecutor &apos;s office for another journalist .
Mr Salvador , in the western state of Michoacan , three days after the killing of Valdez .
it has been found to be a dead body and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists have become more popular across the country and are crippling the phrase &apos; SOS press &apos; in the form of organised protesters and buildings .
on this day , President Bojorquez is in Washington , trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case .
a day after the death of Valdez , the Ramirez authorities accused journalists of the bullying and killing of journalists because of the truth .
after that , he asked him to be diverted from the government &apos;s activities elsewhere , concerned that hatred has affected objectivity .
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ culprits and indifferent society .
in his last book on the &apos; drug press &apos; , he wrote that the reporters are not only killing drug gangs , but also under the command of politicians and security forces who are at the mercy of organised crime .
Articulo 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , awarded more than half of the attacks by journalists on the police and public officials last year .
&quot; in Mexico , you are going to be silent , &quot; said Ramirez .
there is obviously a bloody impact .
no one will forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state in Tamaulipasis six years ago .
he was found dead with a letter , which was probably signed by the cartel in LOS Zetas : &apos; I am here for my reporters &apos; .
in addition to his beloved head , computer glass and elephants were found .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state , Chihuahuahua , following the killing of their correspondent in the Virslava Bohh in March .
others will pass on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the murder of their President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with the editorial &apos; Mida do you want us ? &apos;
some journalists have fled their home states or even their country .
this is a nervous decision .
in theory , it is difficult to find a job and they still have to get to the streets in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes they are being persecuted , as was probably the case with photographi Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered three months after the arrival of Veracruz in 2015 , together with four months after Veracruz .
those who remain in place and continue to work will have to refute risky decisions every day .
Ibarra , who once wanted to become a poet , recognises that it is frightening to reflect the drug business .
&quot; Mexico is on the road to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
one of the recent midnight of Friday , when the latest number had already been snatched , was the editor of Riodoce &apos;s office in front of the office and plundering the beer when suddenly all phones started to be calibrated .
19 people were killed , according to confirmed in the fire exchange between rival gangs and security forces in Mazatlanis , 19 people .
the war escalated , as did a number of messages from cartels found in the region .
according to the same pavements , reporters made news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone .
in the front of next day , a change was needed .
the massacres were seized by another arrival in the region .
Bojorquez piilus towards police officers on the alert to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not at least show this .
workers in Riodoce , who have fallen on the ground under the massive cabin of their fingers , where their average finger is to be seen as a whole , were carried out by Riodoce workers in his footsteps .
&apos;How can you think about closure , &apos; said Bojorquez , &apos; whereas , on the same day , Javier killed , a traineeship asked me to make a report on the streets ? &apos;
Dinosaur used to protect enemies
at first sight , it seems like a form , albeit rather frightening .
scientists have now unveiled the first findings in relation to the presence of unbelievable rubbish numbers detected by Canada , which has been so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; dinosaurs Mona &apos; .
it has been so well preserved that it was even possible to ascertain that the leather covered by his Finns was coloured with red lignite and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the report published in the magazine Biology described the status as the &apos; best preserved soomunit &apos; , which has ever been found , and if &apos; one of the best parts of the world &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new nodosaurry that lived in the middle of the seasons , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
its unbelievably good retention in Raba , which describes it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
this sorely covered plant feed is the best preserved , according to the National Geosian magazine , on the type of phosphorus that has ever been found .
it was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk , when he extracted Suncor Millenium in Fort McMurray near Northern Albertas in Canada .
he has struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into it .
the phosphorus found was sent to Royal Tyrrell Paleontology museum .
for the next six years , it was developed to extricate the animal from 2 500 navies ( 11.100 @-@ kilometres ) .
after all this hard work , the end result will now finally be ready to bring the public to the public .
&quot; if a little eyes are torn up , almost believe he is sleeping , &quot; said Caleb Brown , the leading author , Royal Tyrrell , in the museum of the Royal Tyrrell .
&quot; this goes down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaurs - dinosaurs Mona Lisana . &quot;
when he looked at his skin , it was reported that this vegetation , which is covered by soaps and resembles a dirty tank , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food dinosaurs .
this high @-@ level dinosaur was used by red and white defence colours to hide from predators , and applied sheltering techniques , which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
this allowed experts , according to the dinosaur , to enter into better surroundings and avoid enemies , as the major dinosaurs were likely to hunt him .
this was the first time in news in May and is now visited by the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology museum in the Royal Tyrrell Palace .
the theatre has now investigated and given it the name of the Borealopelta Marmitchell Museum mark Mitchell , who was a team that spent more than 7 000 hours to expose more than 7000 hours .
thanks to the amazing good survival of the father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the sooms .
they found disapproval - a common method of protection in animal species , which means that the intrusion of the status was a dam as a aluter .
although there is widespread disapproval , the findings come as a surprise , as Borealopelta is much greater than those who are currently living in the shadows .
this suggests that dinosaur pressure was sufficiently actively hunted by other musicians , so that the evolution preferred to be overshadowed rather than the confrontation of the survivors .
however , most of the animals used today , such as fear , seals or armadills , are far smaller and more vulnerable , indicating that nodosaurus had to really work to survive .
&quot; the strong hunt of the dinosaur , which is covered by huge and abundant soaps , shows how dangerous the predatory of the infancy of the seasons could be , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds of organic compounds also revealed that the dinosaur &apos;s skin was red .
scientists will continue to set up an investigation to get angles about this life , including the retained content of this gender style , in order to find out what the animal would have for its last summer .
they believe that the dinosaur collapsed in the death of rivers , thereby entering into the sea , where it turned its back to the ocean .
at the time , Albertas was just as soe as it is now in South Florence and rivers and oceans were likely to go far beyond the internal land as they are now .
&quot; this nodosaurus is truly remarkable , as it has been fully covered by sodden skin , while it has also remained three @-@ dimensional , maintaining the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal today sees almost the same as in the age of the stunning .
to reconstruct this , there is not a great deal of imagination to use - it is enough simply to preach bridges and it seems to be a sleep . &quot;
the era of crisis was the time when the enormous two legs of meat feed into the countryside - heterohants .
although the Queen Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta , some of his horrendous predecessors could be hunted out of this soddled dinosaur .
these include Acrocanthosaurus , 38 legs ( 11.5 metres ) , a long and six tonnes monster .
scientists whose recent findings have been published in the Journal in Biology believe that Borealopelta was killed after death in the sea and that this mutuality was muted .
on 21 March 2011 , Shawn functional , when he extracted from Fort McMurray near the mining of Millenium in Northern Albertas in Canada .
according to the Muuseum , it has been best preserved in the world &apos;s soomomalment , including skin and sodoms , and this is a comprehensive concentration up to the puppet .
these assumptions were on average 18 legs ( five metres ) long and up to GBP 3 000 ( 1300 kg ) .
there were two 20 customs queues on this shoulders .
scientists believe that this sorely covered vegetation compound through the current Western Canada , until the river flooded through its opening sea .
however , the landing place in the sea of the dinosaur helped to maintain its characteristics in an excellent detail .
the glaciers of this particular father , coal , have so well maintained that the headlines of the mystery soomnis are still covered by the headlines of the dinosaur .
as Mr Greshko wrote in the National Geosian magazine : &apos; such statehood is as rare as a loophole .
the more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
the skin @-@ leaded leavers still cover the creation of mysterious sodium stores .
a better front is lying alongside him , and the way in which he has been stolen upwards .
I will be able to list the soyings of his winter . &quot;
how did one activist find a response to the question of &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell became a full shock .
just a day after the trip to New York , this St. Louka resident , via Airbus , was rented in a towed bed , travelling on Facebook on the phone .
he came to the post of his former schooling companions .
it said : &apos; the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old adolescents and he is still on the streets &apos; .
he was confused as to why no one else was writing this information on his stream , so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
the Pidega @ TheePsucah user had repeatedly been divided on his timeline .
Mr St. , Mr Brown , who was killed by Mr Ferguson Missouris , the death of an unarmed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by a white police officer in the Ferguson region .
he gave a picture of the life of Brown , which was found in the street , for four hours .
&quot; this is crazy , &quot; said Ferreira .
however , death was nothing new for him or for the community .
he put his phone off , but later this evening he saw the tag of people &apos;s assembly in Canfield Drive .
Jagati photographs of the police and the people of fear , and a man who claimed himself to be the father of Brown and kept a label with the &apos; Fergusoni police killed just my unarmed son &apos; .
he watched in real time a stream in which the police officer stood up to the protest group with a group of graves .
in another video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Mr Ferrell will remember how he struck himself from the nonsense : &apos; it is unusual &apos; .
&quot; this is not a murder of this kind , which we are accustomed to and which we could describe as typical . &quot;
I felt frightened at this point .
I was angry and I had to say . &apos;
he booked a return flight and travelled home on the next day .
having buried at 23 : he went to his father for his six @-@ year daughter and decided that they will travel to Fergusoni next morning .
what the Ferrell and Fergusonga took place over the next three years is a central issue in the new documentary &quot; Whose street ? &quot; ( &quot; whose thanks ? &quot; ) , which will be presented in cinemas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who have thanked the answers .
if Mr Ferreira , together with the daughter - who had a lipsy sticker and a chrock in this way - has travelled to Ferguson , they once again talked about a subject that had come before them several times before this morning - the experience and living conditions of black people .
&quot; remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &quot;
&quot; we are now travelling to Fergusoni because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on board , &quot; said Ferreira later .
&quot; what is happening now is the culmination of what happened in the past .
it must know this and see it and grow in the middle of it .
he must learn about a activists and organisation and , at the same time , feel the different layers of experience and living conditions of the Muslim people , and what we need to do to be free and free .
even if I manage to raise him in such a way that he does not personally copy the brutal racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel I would be doing him a disservice if I would protect him from this world . &quot;
the first stop they did in the vicinity of the Fergusoni was by South Florissanti - a police station in the middle of a certain kind of camp , where activists were waiting for news about the police officer Darren Wilson , who did not end up being charged .
there , Mr Ferreira and his daughter joined the local business owner who prepared lunch .
they put together food homes and helped to divide them to the protesters .
for the Ferrell , a new type of activist was slow to take shape .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at the Missouri @-@ St. Louad University , he was the President of the Union for Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organising .
all of this is simply abhorrent . &quot;
weeks later , Ferreira met a film director , Sabaah Folayani , at the time of the festival .
Folayan said that he and the film operator , Mr Alvarado @-@ Farrar , simply wanted to document what is happening .
in the face of Ferrell , the question was : &apos; are you trying to record what is happening or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to reap the benefits of this generosity and resilience .
Folayan explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Folayan had already put his hands on a co @-@ director Damon Davati , the artificial father of the region , who was well @-@ known for prisoners who have been sentenced to death by activists .
his involvement made the project attractive for Ferrelli and the other six local groups , who were watched by the film &apos; Whose street &apos; for years after the shooting of Browni .
&quot; in this documentary , nobody is talking about us or with us , but we are speaking to ourselves , &apos; said Davis .
&quot; it was important for me how these people are portrayed , because I am also portrayed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrelli - it was wanted to show that the movement is not a &apos; donor leader &apos; , but a community &apos; , as outlined by Folayan - it was the most open participant in the film .
as a result , &apos; Whose street ets ? &apos; , surprisingly personal aspects of the life of Ferrelli , such as ruthlessness and marriage with their wife .
&quot; I felt as if I were to be , &quot; said Ferreira , the first time that she was ready to see the city .
&quot; however , I realised that the human vulnerability of this work and the people of black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the story of Ferrell emphasises and refocuses the role of the black LGBT woman in the wider Black Sea Lives Matter movement .
two of the three initiators of the movement , who thought in the social media about the killing of black teenagers Trayvon Martini in the social media in 2012 , are homosexual .
&quot; the leading role of homosexual women has kept the movement in general , &quot; said Ferreira , and this is precisely because we have to fight on a number of fronts .
Mustanabad homosexuals must bear all the burden . &quot;
the Folayan agreed , stating that &apos; movement really keeps alive black women and many of them black homosexuals &apos; .
he says , however , that &apos; this is not a matter of creating a level playing field &apos; - Ferrelli was not chosen as a film centre for his identity .
&quot; he was a man who evening the right energy , &quot; he said .
&quot; however , it is not a coincidence that it was directly located on the frontline , as black LGBT women are at stake when living in such hubs .
his energy can be perceived as a screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news cameras Fergusonist has long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the conditional sentence imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the road lasts for another 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region he calls home , simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
nonetheless , it still attaches importance to the mantra which it has been eating memory since the time when she went to the streets of Ferguson for three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose apart from our chains . &quot;
7 nips on how to overcome the Weekise du potuel
some of the most frequent meters are found , after a little bit of time , that they are suffering from , and also help .
or in the light of the words &apos; Beyond pot &apos; , the cradle of the Nazis .
however , this is only an inevitable postponement and a decent blessing for health .
what can you do to ensure that , after today and tomorrow , Mrs Weekise &apos;s trend - or other pipes - to be better felt this morning and to overcome poppy as painfully as possible ?
Joo water .
to alcohol , after a great deal of pipe in the morning ... or , if possible , even rather than alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when using alcohol , it must somehow be recovered .
with water , minerals are also being thrown out of the body , and sestap is a good hair of mineral water .
since the sweetener has often been irritated , it is particularly good if it is soil @-@ free or easy to legislate .
let us walk .
it would certainly not be a cost to go to the grandmother to bury trees - it may prove fatal for the wrong decision .
however , a simple footwear will help to remind the body once again what the feeling is in life .
Telgis and sleeping boys are a more time @-@ consuming way of getting healthier .
give poor energy back slowly and cautiously .
if you are on the verge of overdrinking yesterday , it will certainly not be worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
for example , a fresh pipe in which the lion &apos;s share of the trees can be quietly placed on the market as a body .
if the health of the South is already suffering , it would be possible to try , for example , weddings .
and a little later .
a coffee .
this diametric tag will be released as a body from the last water .
as has already been said , water and volumes are your friends .
there is a commitment to painkillers .
if you were to be painkiller in order to prevent pot on this evening , you must not only deal with alcohol , but also paratseals or ibuproum and lose so much .
so riders are paying even more and , in the future , boys will be worse .
in addition , painkillers do not remain in the coffers for a long time .
if you take a painkiller this morning , you will do it with a blank cheque - it irritates your already dirty mails .
or if a partner is not to be taken , it will be well with itself .
it is just like walking , but walking does not get a orgary .
however , too active a pace and an outrageous bet were avoided - the physical effort should be moderate .
a joke .
the story of the friends of the friends of the time , the easy topes of the road and the naera of the Nazis , both for themselves and for others ( suffering ) .
Nali and laughter may not make a pot , but it is certainly easier to tolerate them .
once again , the poet will go over anyway !
University of Northwestern and Oxford University workers are being sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , the university professors of Northwester and the University of Oxford , who have received suspects after death row wounds , are being sought as a result of a single university of Chicago .
according to the Cook County Trenton H. Cornell , a 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni were issued on Monday for arrest , accused of death in the first instance of their alleged association due to the death of Trenton H. James Cornell @-@ Duranleu .
according to the documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Duranleu died after repeated seals .
the warning that the Chicago police station issued to the community was found on 27 July as a dead body .
police officers received telephone calls and found the Grand Plaza Corterhouse in arrival for a victim whose body had several torturers .
according to the officials , the Cornell @-@ Duranleu event was recognised dead and investigators in the murder , while the police are actively seeking two suspects .
I have been working as a co @-@ professor of micro @-@ biology and immunology at the University of Northwester since 2007 .
in a statement sent as e @-@ publishing , Alan K. Cubbage , Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations , said that Lake has now been temporarily removed from work and has been banned from entering the city of the University of Northwester .
&quot; this is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of Northwester will work with the investigators , &quot; said Cubbage .
Warren is a senior assistant at the University of Oxford .
the representative of the University and Somerville College said : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist US research authorities in every possible way &apos; .
in addition , the statement stated that the Warreni colleagues were shocked and wish him to present himself .
Anthony Guglielm , President of the Cicago Police Department , urges the authorities to give themselves to the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea of where they are present , but we are increasingly engaged in defining the exact location , &quot; said Guglielm .
according to Guglielm , suspects are helped by local , regional and national authorities .
Guglielm said that the police received a telephone call from the Grand Plaza Corterhouse , who had just received cruelty rain , that there has been something happening at Corvel No 1008 .
according to the police descriptions , it was a magic spectacle .
according to Guglielm , it is not clear whether the event was also taking place on 27 July .
he said that the security cameras confirm the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
the Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police is currently working to find a background to events and the background of the victim &apos;s background , and will examine the various motives , including the possibility that this was a family dispute . &apos;
companies that help your businesses to avoid receiving the next UbB
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were lucrative .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised anonymity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Errett , who is headed by Madison Reed , a company selling e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees in San Franciscos .
he therefore called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups with new types of human resources , which will help businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software that aims to measure the involvement of workers , they enable companies to carry out flash surveys , to target firm teams and demographic groups , to offer anonymity and the submission of complaints to workers and , in some cases , to allow manufacturers to bypass the leaders of the C level and to turn directly to the Bureau .
&quot; there are now tools such as Strava and Fiters , which are designed to monitor health , but where is Fitbi for your company ? &apos; asked Jim Barnett , co @-@ founder and CEO Reding City start @-@ up Glint , whose software analysts use companies to measure the inclusion of workers .
according to Erretti , he has received three years in which he has used Glinti , a much better overview of what he thinks and feeling .
in addition to surveys for intervention and specific teams , it offers a company &apos;s heat card , which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , enabling them to identify the causes .
companies have started to understand that they have to stay in touch with their culture of work , so as not to become the next Ubbar , which has been insurmounted in scandals since the former worker published a blog , which described the harassing environment for those who dared to speak .
for start @-@ ups such as Glint , the desire to have an overview is a business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and conformity area can be worth more than $ 118.7 billion by 2020 , according to the website of financial ethics statistics .
the Denveris Colorado start @-@ ups , which will help businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , noted this year in the light of the dubious reputation of Ubber , an interest and an increase in activity .
the coalition has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
the Uber has recently registered himself as a customer .
like Glinles , the label allows companies to send adapted impulses , to collect real @-@ time confidential answers and to look at the problematic areas of heat cards .
it also offers anonymous messages in a way that allows workers to report unsuitable behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has been anchored by regulators , &quot; Chris Quinlan , founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan .
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act unethically , the company may face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts , leaving workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ruby flu , restaurant , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of activity , has been used by more than a year in order to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and offer easy ways of communicating with the corporation headquarters .
when a worker wanted to report the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email addressed by the corporation headquarters , and I hope that it will be taken seriously .
it was often a deterrent and inconvenient process , Mr Vitrano , a general adviser , who said that there was no good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , now that the company is used census , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices , which did not lead to more rapid identification and treatment in other cities or states .
&quot; I have the opportunity to get closer to the hollow experience of the workers &apos; 360 degrees , &quot; said Vitrano , who is headed by Ruby &apos;s &quot; Risk Management Group . &quot;
&quot; and we will protect our shareholders from litigation with workers . &quot;
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and employee involvement more seriously in 2002 , after the audit company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in the Enron scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; , companies realised that they cannot prevent their black wash from being hijacked online .
&quot; before using the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; said .
both Glint and the Rhine offer their software as a service , taking advantage of companies &apos; periodic fees for the use of their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors who have been in favour of both start @-@ ups .
the FIFA was funded in February 10 million dollars by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and the Capital of Customs , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by 47 million dollars .
the Glinti invested USD 10 million in November , Bessemer Venture partners , increasing the total funding of the company to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise if we take into account the interdependence between companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more research shows that today &apos;s workers are waiting for more jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high wages and interesting projects are just on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy in the company , they feel that they are heard and that the work they do is satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said Nina McQueen , Vice @-@ President LinkedInis , who has a general benefit and experience of staff , in both the censor and the Glinti .
investors earn revenue if companies belonging to their portfolio do well ; businesses do well when workers are committed and involved .
if the analysts of the third party allow us to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , we are not sure that they will be supported .
the possession of data on the involvement of workers is important , according to experts in the culture of work .
however , these data will be useless if the company &apos;s supervisory authorities do nothing to do with them .
in fact , if a company asks its employees for feedback , it can create expectations that changes are ahead of us .
and if the changes do not take place quickly or not at all , it could cause disappointment and decrease the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conversations , &quot; said Kotter International President Russell Raath , who has seen how companies are making a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&quot; because if things are not brought to the end , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Erretti , the Madison Reeval , which is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via Glinti .
and , following the speed of decision making and the quality of the communication , it was possible to reorganise several teams in the company and to provide communication training to deal with the problems .
however , Ruby @-@ by @-@ Procedures will collect new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will lead to the longer @-@ term commitment of workers in the industry , known as its large turnover of labour .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vitrano .
&quot; and if you lose your people , you will lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
euro area bench star is Baltics : incomes are growing rapidly
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , BSE , referring to the report by the European Central Bank .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
there is a low debt burden , fast @-@ track institutions and business @-@ friendly and market @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , in one of Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where a reactor @-@ GDP @-@ per capita has been significantly approached by the EU average . &quot;
while the aim is to ensure that the overall output of the economy is equal to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2 / 3 of the average of 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led the balloans to seek a better wage abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are going very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was slightly less than half of those questioned about their economies .
NCAA &apos;s decision to lift two times a day &apos;s trends makes Bruinsi &apos;s days long
at almost 23 o &apos;clock , it is almost 23 that the football club of UCLA stops talking at the edge of a new exercise in the city of a team .
some of them have been burdened by a company , revealing the efforts of the first day of their training camp .
for a large part of the team , these gang minutes offer midday pairs .
the players taking part in cucumbers will go back after three hours to the common sense of life , before returning to a meeting at 6.30 p.m. next morning , to the WWman football front .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Bruinsi treer , Jim Mora , shortly before the Monday was Tuesday .
the NCAA decision to cancel the burden of players on a two @-@ day basis , has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end of the day - to one side of the bargain on Friday .
for this reason , the three first operations of UCLA were prompted to start at 19.15 , in order to fit into the already tight timetables of players .
the transition from two to two strikes a day means more than one day - the beginning of the Bruinsi training camp was increased almost a week ahead of the previous season and , for the first time in Mora &apos;s six Westwood season , there are workshops during summer courses .
they are scheduled to have 18 trenching until 20 August , before starting formal preparations against the Texas A &amp; M , which will be launched in September .
according to Mora , he is in favour of a change in the NCAA rules , although it adds another item to the close schedules of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; and they break up with this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that if there is a Saturday and we have more time , it is really a little bit . &quot;
when the camp is closed , UCLA will be closed down , which is not an easy task , given the clear view of the parking record and by @-@ standby from the Luskini centre , a higher class hotel , which has already escaped the gateway from the net of protection from the gates .
since this weekend , hotels are occupied by the Bruinsi players , but Mora acknowledged that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&quot; we are implementing security measures , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; this is a real concern , and it is not exaggerated to think that people can get a dose and a filter from there .
if you have a record of a train , you can do quite a good deal .
but we are using a security team there and 8 parking stations .
we are doing our best to use it .
I will try not to be particularly concerned about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
in the case of Saduare @-@ Ivanova , who has been expelled from the Reform Party , Kristiina Ojuland and the ECB , Maria Kaljs , who has been forced to leave the forces of the central party , will be able to show the business union of businessmen in Tallinn - it seems to be the same as the political parties that have been set up this year in the local elections as much as the political parties .
however , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether they are all too disappointed by voters .
who will remain in Saduarega ?
if the support office of the Edgar Saduare has been reduced to a small extent , he can anticipate the events organised by his electoral union .
one of the Member States , some former and present central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and is there any reason why some of the seaweed faithful faiths and sisters are prevented from standing in Tallinn , and why is it that the list of &apos; Saduare &apos; , which is the subject of corruption and corruption , is becoming a reality ?
the municipality of the city &apos;s music cameras to the Russian pog , which takes part in the city of Lasnam√§e , and in every sense the original computer play , in which the Prime Minister , J√ºri Ratas , has to avoid lomnipe and orchests who are on the road to the ballot boxes for the first time , will the Central Party seek votes to be promised by the 16th and 17th year old voters ?
we look forward to seeing the views of the other parties on the youth election campaign .
if the Kanal 2 or TV3 look at the black rally , instead of the beginning of August , there will be two options : to accept that , in the future , only ETV , ETV2 , ETV + , Tallinn TV and English , France24 channels or to surrender each month to a few TV operators .
there are probably also those who , at the beginning , openly rejoice in advertising @-@ free television , but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and advertisements .
the deafening music , the black people and the rubbish left on the streets are the unpleasant side @-@ effects of almost every major musical .
however , if you do not want to be part of the meal , it is worth helping to move home rather than being painted at home - and leave a sleeping place for the heroes of the festival .
Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
media publications are quoted by President Donald Trumpi , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan envisages a reduction of the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by Republican and supported by the President .
the bill goes to the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , as it will change the way in which green maps are issued to citizens of other countries in the US .
the law reduces chain migration and will replace the current programme .
the new application process will provide an advantage for candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Trump America &apos;s media publications .
Siberian young people move to the city , pensioners back to the land .
Jevseyev Anatol continues the famous tradition of gold mine along the River Maana .
she is working 140 kilometres away from home to Maana , an additional nurse in Kuvai , as a motor driver .
this is a tough job : two months in a row without rest days , 12 hours of work and then only 10 days ago at home and again .
during the three years of the Artel , Anatoly has seen only one time .
&apos;There is a resounding procedure : there is a thorough check of the way in which you go , so that it does not lead to a viral , and when it comes to doing so &apos; , Anatol is speaking .
Mare Piho &apos;s conversation in the village of Haida with the local seto Jaga , who has spoken a lot about the memory of his family in Siberia .
the archaic culture of Siberian seals is also beginning to influence the homes of the home , because it is simply so shocking , thinks the most far @-@ sighted mixtures of Piho Mare .
his first investigation trip to Siberia will be 30 years since this year .
during that time , he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year .
how much was the case for Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8000 .
I have taken note of this in the words of Siberian seto men who have also thought about it .
it is very difficult to say , because at that time up to 30 people could come to one group , but the passport was only given to a man .
the passport was given only one thing , but it was children , sisters and so on .
look at how much this territory was here .
it was a number of times greater than that of the historian .
after all , it was necessary to educate , manage it in some way .
Setinos came here as farmers , but their lives changed , because they came to areas that were not only involved in agriculture but also in rivers ( palgiparation ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New Petsert , many pigs went to work later in Krasnojarsk @-@ 45 ( where the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P. ) when it was formed .
did the doses form the majority of the population in the region at the time ?
yes , they lived in a compacket .
in addition , a long tradition continued to marry between one another and a lot of childhood .
seven to eight children in the family were common .
how much is the culture of Siberian seins different and different from that of mother land ?
they are different , although what was said here was once the same .
they brought about a great deal of money .
they then made themselves ( the shadow ideas ) , but they always made a distinction between what had been done and what was done here .
climate change has been severely affected by the traditional rivalry , because there is a cold cold here .
the proposed changes have changed .
for example , Setomaal meat was skinned , but here it was simply frozen .
where are the villages of Siberia and what life is living there ? / graphics : Alari Paluends
the link with the mother country was spiritually strong , it was considered very important .
it seems to me that this Setuony is now going to return to it , to influence them .
those girls who have lived in families have listened to amazing stories .
Piho must bear in mind the people of the Estonian delegation , who came to the Kaida village Seto Kingdom in early July and lived four days in homes - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is very easy to come and also go , because the city has an excellent location : the railway link and the roads at the crossroads , &quot; says Reigo Tamm , who comes from Tapy .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a great deal of hope , sports and cultural places , and the carrot can become a joke .
Tapa is a tip of the city !
there is a small island along the River White , which is running through the Linera , where the tablets tend to be hijacked .
&quot; this beautiful train window does not seem to be &apos; , haggles Reigo .
anyone who is not afraid of cold water can flood into the river , because the river is full of resources .
I have been flooded there , you will be able to do it !
the water of the river can be regarded as long as it is just romantic - it can look at the flow of the river and think about life and behind it .
I have also been there with my brilliant .
Ooperisolist Tamm has been travelling between the three eyes of the river basin and the three other bridges to be used : &apos; that this place is in the vicinity of the city , no one may come to answer if I say my own stories &apos; .
&quot; there is a wonderful view of the Tapy mountain , but there are also health professionals where there can be drinks , winter haste and now , for example , to play a golf course - golf courses have been carried out , chains can be borrowed from sport centres , &quot; Reigo .
old processors are , of course , there with their own system , but I have not yet been able to play there .
there is obviously a need to invite Mrs Rasmus Tapale , because she has experienced the Sgolfimgame and she has the chains .
perhaps he lends me !
Reigo and M√§nnikug were inextricably inseparable from childhood .
at least during hours .
there are many tears , disappointments and you can be found in my sporting life .
not to mention broken bells and squares .
&quot; the entire city of the city is full of construction works , all of which will become unknown , &quot; praises Reigo .
however , the old and tired building is a very attractive place where oral discoveries are being played .
I am pleased that in 2012 R.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.M , the head of the theatre of Meos adopted my idea , and the summer theatre had to be made by his theatre .
although this year &apos;s theatre season &apos; AlekseKarenin &apos; has just been carried out , on 11 August , the railway station &apos; Elluwake &apos; is moving around in the old building in the 1980s .
&quot; between 11 and 13 August , Tapa City Days have been held in Tapa , in addition to the Open house of the Svage Building and the clothes of cultural events , including the People &apos;s Day , will speak of Reigo , who recommends a visit to the city of 9 days .
the museum of 1 May on 1 May is already a museum from 1994 .
&quot; the house is small , but there is a great deal of publicity and information , &quot; praises Reigo , which is full of the history of the Tapa town , most of which focuses on the railways and sister .
Reigo muds that , if all the sites recommended by Tapal were to be carried out , a long distance will be empty , but fortunately the small city will be full of coffee .
&quot; we have such good eating places and sometimes , when you sit in caf√©s , you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad , he describes him .
educated and young Tapy soldiers spend a lot of time in pubs , sestap there is a curious feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town , but that is the international community together .
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans .
the wars , yes , we have a lot !
two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tendering in Greece
Telecanal bTV quoted a foreign minister who announced that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering .
in the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of people who illegally ordered a group on the island of Sithonia , including two Bulgarians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulgarians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing heavy fines on all those who are caught in a place where there is no provision for it .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
the wolves that teach the professionals are breaking down sheep .
the finite farmers have had to give the wolves once again the carpet &apos; educational material &apos; - the wolves that have taught the wolves , apparently , have already broken a number of sheep .
this year , the wolves in the Hiiu County have broken sheep three times , with 23 sheep and wounded eight , the Hiiu page .
soil was the number only three years before 124 .
there are also data from the Environment Agency in syndrome that the soil was not born in the Hitel and the Hiiumaa hunting Council &apos;s information that this year , two wolves were fixed on the island .
in the √ñ√∂l on Monday , the wolves unleashed 15 sheep in the village of Emmes Kabuna and injured the 18 survivors .
in the early days of the morning , the wolves in the village of Rehemas have broken a sheep in the pasture of one sheep and wounded the other , who had to be made an emergency .
rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment ( GMOs ) and the amendment of the plant protection law .
the amendment to the law removes the creation of a separate data collection for both GM ( GM ) crops and operators , using a plant health register in the future .
in addition , the GM crop management obligation will be amended to have prior agreement with the designated radio apparatus .
although there is currently no cultivation of GM crops in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as there is no decision to declare Estonia GM @-@ free , &quot; said Sigmar Suu Kyi , President of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
&quot; however , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both private and public sectors , in the Annex .
the draft law repeals the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of GM crops in the EU &apos;s GM crops and operators , establishes requirements for the management of GM crops and the requirements for starting economic activities .
specifically , with regard to the beekeeping sector , the current obligation to inform beekeepers of the cultivation of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeepers before starting cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to ministries to coordinate .
all interested parties have the opportunity to access the draft information system and , if they wish , to present their views to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , those operating in the area of plant farming , beekeepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 810 .
so far , however , no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops .
the reason is that in Estonia , there is no mammoth , a European media Observatory , on which mon 810 is resistant .
it has also been extended to the southern regions , and it is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
in order to obtain certainty , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect potential contamination of GM organisms in Estonia in seeds , maize and soya varieties .
the analysis of the samples carried out showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soya varieties in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms .
in turn , it can be concluded that in Estonia , GM crops are not deliberately cultivated , and it was also confirmed that there has been no random contamination .
Mr Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United in the form of Nemanja Maticu in the form of &apos; genius &apos;
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United Kingdom has recruited &apos; genius &apos; in the form of Nemanja Maticu , after the central player , Samlov , made his debate on Wednesday evening .
a GBP 40 million player bought from Chelmer started in Dublin in the last seasonal game in the UEFA Super Cupi line in Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 , with an impressive role in defence , while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on attacks .
however , having been left behind in the White Year of Asia , Maticl was badly needed to bury and only 45 minutes , which , according to Mourinho , must be corrected before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genious thinking - he has the courtesy of football , &quot; said Mourinho .
&quot; we will help him to achieve a form as soon as possible . &quot;
as is rare , the Aviva stage also started other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romeva lu Lukaku , and Mourinho began to put his novel man in place at the beginning of the season .
the Independent public this week said that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers , but he confirmed that the club has already done a &apos; excellent job &apos; by concluding contracts with three of its four priority choices .
&quot; I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three out of four , &quot; he added .
&quot; I am even happier if they are able to deliver four four , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
another warm son received a shog on the GSM Embassy on 1 August and this time in Muhus .
Mr Martinson , who is living in Sfragile , has received the first batson with the accompanying Sfragile , and this washing cell is already flying around , and has left the washing ground and joined the great night of the Multi @-@ Grand Gulf .
this is because Sfragile does not have fruit crops , the voice of the islands is written .
this Tuesday , in order to bury the Kurds , is already relatively late , and yet another son of the Embassy came to the island of Muhu .
according to Martinson , the installation of embassies is , in fact , an international project carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojete .
Soil was supplied with a son called Mati GSM to Turkey .
&quot; his activities are all on the internet : how he went to Spain in winter , coming back to the German and Polish border , and then Saaremaa came , Martinson spoke .
British inventors to install microchips in their own body in order to get their hand in houses and cars .
the British inventor became the first person in a country to be installed microchip in order to be able to open up its prerogative , to get to office and even to launch a car .
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Steven Northam children will be able to install a small chip between their fingers and their fingers , and will now provide this service to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier through their own company .
he has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson , a consultant @-@ anestesiologist of the Royal hospital in Hants in Winchester in Hants , to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards .
the technology is similar to the micro @-@ chip installed in cats and bags , and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure .
the Northam company will also replace houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chip , asking for a lump sum of GBP 300 .
this child &apos;s father has installed a technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4 , which will start when he has his hand in the wheel .
the White House &apos;s audit cost to taxpayers of thousands
according to military documents announced in the magazine , the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter last month to the southern American production event cost taxpayers as much as USD 24 000 .
the green and white colours Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , termed Marine One , during President pardon , was a central feature of the event that took place on 17 July in Valdis Main .
President Donald Trump , Vice @-@ President Mike Pence and the White House were news of industrial products from all 50 countries in the world .
the helicopter built in Connecticutis was sponsored by a banner of reputation , a fire @-@ fighting car from Wisconten and a Miscellutaum .
according to the Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX @-@ 1 ) document , the Helicopter Squadron , the Helicopter Squadron , the Helicopter Squadris , called for the presence of a helicopter in a military cabinet , or FARGO @-@ ga , a little 36 hours before the helicopter for the &apos; extraordinary &apos; event on the southern horror .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an unusually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said HMX @-@ 1 komcomand√∂r , day before the event , in the e @-@ mail , the chief officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
the message stated that helicopter arrives in the southern horror on 17 July morning at 7 : 00 at 15 : 00 , and will remain there until the clock between 18 and 21 of the same evening .
the fact that , if the departure from the White House were to be present , a return flight is needed due to the restrictions on working time .
the original flight team was at the helicopter at the event and the escillary security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its entire time .
it was not possible to read out from the documents provided by the magazine whether or not the second ethos were eventually needed .
the Hatch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes .
the documents show that HMX @-@ 1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked whether this is a violation of Hatch law , and we were told that it would not rice , &apos; the commander wrote .
&apos;It seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to a leading officer .
the White House declared the &apos; official event &apos; in America , and the Hatch law would not have covered it .
however , even official events have political undertones .
the President supported the efforts of health reform at the time in the Senate and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in check .
the use of the aircraft known as &apos; Marine One or Air Force &apos; for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them purely photographs is unusual .
in February , the Trump came to the attention of his first campaign event in Floridas Melbourne , President of the President , and Twitter from the messages that complain about how his predecessor &apos;s flight was used by his predecessor .
&quot; the White Mal is very pleased with the exhibition &quot; made in America , where products were represented in all 50 states made up of American workers , &quot; said the White House &apos;s press spokesman , Lindsay Walters .
HMX @-@ 1 teams often carry out tests around Washington and the southern horror in order to exercise the US President &apos;s White House with a centimetre .
when the Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , the HMX @-@ 1 White House held 58 samples .
according to the official , the flight flight was considered to be the norm for the &apos; American &apos; flight crew of a month .
the Eskaadr helicopter was flying for another 11 hours , in addition to that day , for &apos; non @-@ support missions &apos; with the President .
according to the White House , none of the other forms of this event were burdened by the taxpayer &apos;s wallets .
according to the representative of Sikorsky , the company was not involved in carrying out filtering on the southern horror of the helicopter .
HMX @-@ 1 does not maintain the budgetary documents of the President &apos;s flights and the precise costs of the event are difficult to find out .
however , at the time of the defence Ministry for the financial year 2017 , the VH @-@ 3D compensation rate is set at USD 24 380 per hour .
in the Eskaadr documents , the flight was extended to 30 minutes for the main base of the flight from Quantico to Virginia airport in both directions .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using helicopter is well below that amount .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading , &quot; said Walters .
&quot; these estimates of compensation include staff , maintenance and many other irrevocable costs , which will be taken into account in annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 winter study , the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation rates for staff costs , but they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
Sean Spicer , former spokeswoman of the White House , defended the use of helicopter at the time .
&quot; the point is to show the things that have been made in America this week , &quot; said Spicer .
&quot; and I know that the State of Sikorsky and Connecticuti is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds , if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the Trump was a helicopter in the southern horror of the event , or not , but the fire @-@ fighting car was hiding behind the wheel .
in the White House , Trump Sikorsky was approached by representatives of the media outlets on the company &apos;s products in his personal aircraft fleet .
&quot; I know Sikorsk√° very well , &quot; said President , &apos; I have three products . &quot;
Gari ≈†adeiko - Very arrived in peace and joy
the 2011 MMil Daetis hit ≈†adeikot in the last area , 800 m beverages and a stadium was taken away from the stadium .
just before that , he had been able to go away from a glass of zero in China .
the Helsinki Helsinki formula in 2012 was a violation of cheap injuries , but in London , it received 60 13 points 23 .
however , I have continued to do so .
in the wake of the Moscow MMil 2013 opening day , Estonia received a ferry injury as a guide in a remote way .
two years later , he became the 15th seat of Mil in Beijing and fulfilled the Olympic Games , but this was more than a disappointment to sportspeople .
Sadeiko was only a bubble in the past , when the outcome of the Amsterdam Embassy was not received at the beginning .
I would just like to put together one proper multi @-@ contest once .
once &apos; , sprayed ≈†adeiko .
worse still lies ahead : a month later , his Olympic contest in Rios reievigastery was already covered by the first barrier .
time had to be taken down - did the seven @-@ year competition continue ?
is the two @-@ day effort still worth all this ?
Mrs Neiu wondered at length , but found peace .
I had to think about it .
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time for us to treat ourselves all and to think about it .
&quot; I knew that I am still not putting a cool on the picture , &quot; ≈†adeiko is talking about his self @-@ determination .
I was able to go ahead with a clean hand and a new momentum .
Treener Anne hill said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of negligence , but he realised that , above all , the sportsman himself has to get to the bottom .
after all , he was so repressed by all .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; the Gard said , however , that he is not giving up and he wants to prove what he is worth &apos; , says remember .
now there is some kind of peace .
he is doing so to my joy .
the contest came back in May , when the ≈†adeiko set a 6280 point in the new Estonian Reports in G√∂tzitself .
in a high @-@ level competition , he improved his personal top @-@ class synthesis with almost a metre ( 13.89 ) and drinks a record @-@ close @-@ time barrier .
then there was a myriad feeling that it was not at all possible , but only a hunger in the first competition .
she has been instructed for years by Nagorno , that Sadeiko is a Muslim student .
she is ready to be sportsman , she is well trained .
if something is wrong or wrong , he says it immediately .
he feels his own body and he is confident in his sense .
that is what we must do .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we follow it .
the new approach has also been found in ≈†adeiko .
&apos;I am not the one who is going to make the most of the trend &apos; , he is talking and saying that the most important thing is to get the right sense , because it also guarantees a good result .
baby baby walks will be happy to see !
the good emotion has also been offered by close to ≈†adeikou .
both his former teacher , Maris hill and Grete , has recently become grandparents and has received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;It has been quite interesting &apos; , says Sadeiko .
one alcohol whose drinking is equivalent to &apos; training &apos; .
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is a father of so great wine games that he believes that wine can be trained better than any other thing in the world .
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University .
his message is not about alcohol or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
when it comes to the foolishness of wine , in the complexity of wine , in the enjoyment and the sense of aftertaste , we are putting our brain work in order to create a taste for wine .
in the words of the Sheperd , there is no real taste , but taste in the way in which wine is stimulated .
he will bring about a comparison between how the brain &apos; sees &apos; colours .
&quot; taste is not wine ; taste creates wine as a taste , &quot; says Sheperd .
things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , our age , gender and even sylje , which man produces .
Sheperd , of course , is that wine is not in order to be full of Jews .
&apos;There must be more &apos; , he says .
if you are too big a longest , the system has been overcrowded .
excessive wine drinking may be detrimental to the brain , rather than the benefits of the 2004 survey , people who drink more than three glass wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced spiritual capacity .
10 % of staff in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less salaries from colleagues
the figures reveal that 10 % of Estonian ICT workers receive lower salaries from their colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , the portal Geenius writes .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay study .
a total of 8 577 posts were examined .
63 % of posts were male .
&quot; although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies considered that there is no pay gap , in reality , the average salary of men is 10 % higher than that of women per month and men per year is 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said Foncrates analysts Ilmar North .
the clip of the &quot; Narcos &quot; season 3 : now that Pablo Escobar has gone , Netflix hittsark is at the centre of Cali cartel .
despite the fact that in the second season of the &apos; Narcos &apos; , the killer of Pablo Escobari was exposed , the Netflix sari is far from over .
the third and fourth season has been confirmed by the quota , and the first one has already been produced by the clip of advertising , which is strangling the horns with new pathogens .
in the third season , DEA will pay its attention to the world &apos;s richest drug organisation - Cali cartels .
they are acting under the leadership of four powerful Christian fathers , such as Ford 500 companies , simply with more bribery to the government and more violent actions .
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is a leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) , his brain , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) and Chepe SantaH z London ( Pepe Rapazote ) .
Mr Pascali &apos;s return to Javier Penana , as a person recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement aid in the war against drugs , is seen in the advert released .
other new players include Matias Varela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .
the third season of &quot; Narcos &quot; will be open on 1 September .
according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
on Wednesday , the head of the United Nations Mission for Afghanistan said that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , Nicholas Haysom , said that hundreds of women are standing in local Soviet elections , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women in stressing the importance of women cannot be exaggerated , &quot; said in a statement on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have , for their part , threatened the electoral process , which coincides with the transitional period , when the role of international military operations is becoming advisable .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is given calmly to one democratically elected government to the next .
according to Mr Haysom , women &apos;s strong role will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the Afghan Independent Election Commission , 1.2 million women have registered from 3.6 million registered voters .
the joy of sharing is making every thing more acute , both in large and small .
there is always too little common time , but the trend is a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
and what a convenient solution - no matter where you were stupid in the summer , living wills are always accompanied by the summer , and you will be impatiently reminded of your fine voice : &apos; let us now also be trenching ! &apos;
Aelta insulation - It is a very good thing to play a normal gold game or to bypass the flag of the coastline .
one is the foundation of permanent footwear and tuna , who would then like to take the form of sleeping sand from the waves during the summer ?
it is nice to use children instead of a chicken .
firstly , it is secure and convenient , the difficulty is gradually growing at the same pace as the training and the forces .
it is also possible to do batteries with quite large children .
the child is training a balance , counts the flats and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
bigger children can do their own villages at the same time .
the extent of the movement lies in the scarcity of land and in order to foolish you .
keeping the fingers right , the Palu minimised properly .
the child can read the flats and feel a lecturer .
the planet is an extremely exciting , but hopeless exercise for the child .
but it is easy to do it .
in the game @-@ plank : take a long plank to the puzzle .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much more amuster to do if , in the meantime , a friend can hand his hand .
if you add the burden , you can stay in the planade , you have a small market , and you can walk around it .
an additional difficulty may be placed on the hip of a child , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
at the same time as the crabs join the sand , the triumph , the ash and the monastery meat burden , as was contagious .
the child walks to the shoes in such a way that his body is distributed equally and wants .
for security , you can keep your hands .
all the shoes and the ruins are pulled out .
I will be able to fly , cut off , strike a balance and be difficult .
the life of a small engineer is an exhortation if it gets small things in every fire .
the extra burden will be put before the feet .
check that the back door would remain in a neutral position .
children themselves have a lot to do with cooking meat in a couple and a plate .
a bull with work and wedding .
follow the child &apos;s safety , the burst , and the hotel in a neutral position .
all children &apos;s favourite and big fun !
for the elderly , however , the whole body trend is truly effective .
the sources of sport were Ott ( 10 ) , S√§de ( 8 ) , happiness ( 4 ) .
from the Philippines to the heart of the mopeds of the broad world , the Anlgkot .
Booked bags are the summer classroom , which has become a peanuts in the last few years , which , even in one of the time , has to be hanging at the top of the hand and has been able to display a price label in the shop , despite its modest origin .
there is probably one such thing that has existed once in the life of the law , which is one of the things that has not been aroused at all times and has not been given much emotion .
that is simply there , and if there is no , there is nothing at all .
however , there is now a real victory for beer bags , and moefists have switched their mushrooms against the summer months instead of simple copies .
it is not only a coastline , but today it is just as popular as a street , and more courageous women are doing it even in the office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear whether this summer &apos;s summer is sitting , or whether it is worth postponing the stamp and the laptops to a more formal summer .
however , the wealth of tolerance has made a real summer love for women .
for example , when we read foreign motives , the first thing is that the moeyoghurts are going to be the first thing to do with holiday travel on the local market , and to acquire some beer bags , which are then the truck of entire holiday , and which are accompanied by rigour , on the market and also as a friend to the city .
some bloggers are so generous that they are buying from the market a bigger wolf and selling them to their loyal readers .
in doing so , it is worth pointing out that there is a demand for readers so that women in the real world ( and men ! ) are apparently involved in each other &apos;s fishing zone in order to become a happy owner of some homes .
in some ways , this madness is also understandable , because it is rare for them to be repeated when , in the fashion of yesterday , it is possible to buy just a few of the ten euros in the hijacket .
it is true that white merchants have also discovered a simple way of earning money here , and so more luxury brands are sold for a few hundred and a thousand euros .
obviously , the richer customers should not feel easy to feel that they are propelling around with some cheap bags .
for example , it is possible to buy Dolce &amp; Gabbana , for example , over EUR 1 000 .
however , for the interpretation of Changel bregkot , 6 000 euros can be found in the circulation .
in contrast to most of the motives , however , lotteries do not inherited some of the great mosques , but their story originated in a far more distant way .
in particular , the brewers are allegedly coming from the Philippines , far from where they have been subjected to a wide range .
the bundle of red bags is there , above all , the export trade , and there is very often no room for the local authorities to do with them .
Admittedly , the 14th century of the Trushing technique has been born and is quite a whole series of normal corps .
however , as the beer does not have to be as hard red as corps , they can be accompanied by musicians and other materials that make their homes more personalised and , by extension , more active .
in recent times , for example , there are particularly trendy bags where paints or skins have been installed .
however , the full print can be sent to the beer , in particular , to send an actress , Jane Birkini , the largest red beer of whom was not seen before .
it was precisely that she sued the beer with all sorts of clothing packages and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival .
however , the popularity of the applicants today does not play a smaller role , but also that caring for them is a hot head and , unlike all other summer productions , they do not have to care for them with special funds , but also water and martyr .
as is still the case with the trend robbery , the brands of the classical force have come out with all possible interpretations .
for example , if you want to have a red rice , you can buy a red rice or a little bit of a lax .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classical beer is never going to be a mockery , but a beer .
but what is the classical beer , then ?
for centuries , there has been a classic capping of red @-@ shirts , which resembles a repetition of its style , is open , and it is short , as well as beer , crippers .

GMB is worried about investment in the McVitie plant in Glasgow
the trade union expects the leaders of the mature producer and McVitie to confirm long @-@ term production plans in the Glasgow plant .
according to GMB Scotland , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment .
more than 500 people are employed in Hobnobsi and rich knowledge of the mature and other products .
McVitie , the owner of McVitie , said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years .
the workers and the trade union chairmen who have been employed there are &apos; the first to hear &apos; when something changes in the operation of the plant .
in a letter sent to the company &apos;s site , GMB Scotland , McVitie , called on the company of Scotland to &apos; allay concerns about the lack of funding for modernising production lines &apos; .
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the object on the customs / future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely made up of local communities and the people around Glasgow , as an essential pillar in ensuring decent employment in a region where high unemployment is high and social housing .
therefore , in the context of jobs , wages and welfare in the east of Glasgow , and Brexti , the rise in living costs and the chronic damage to production , a thriving production company in McVitie is badly needed . &quot;
the Pladise representative said : &apos; the head of the customs seat only received a letter from GMB Scotch yesterday and the company responds directly to him because we value active interaction with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers and the representatives of the GMB at the time , which discussed a number of issues openly .
we then discussed with workers that , like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we look at our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested over GBP 5 million in the object of Customs , most of which have gone to production routes and improvements .
we fully understand the heritage of customs as a production site , and if there should be any changes in the activities of the object , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago for convergence ?
la li can regret its interest in Marco Verratti
the Paris Saint @-@ Germain does not give up in the attempt to attract Neymar to his ranks by making an offer of GBP 189 million , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquest ?
this bold approach has opened summer as a transitional window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of buying , which was set up during the last season by Paul Pogba returning to Manchester Uniteba for GBP 89 million .
if the transition is completed , Neyra will become the most expensive player in the world and , at the same time , the most paid professional sportsman in the world , who will be able to pay over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from the PSG .
Barcelona is also an indication of the way in which we approach it as well as of the liberation of Neyra , even though the source close to the Ctalansi Board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of its arrival in Santoise in 2013 .
but did the PSG President warn the football world for such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manchester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blaise Matutis Agreement in 2014 , the Nasser Al @-@ Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who think about recruiting some of the PSG &apos;s best players .
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that if they are concerned about some of our players , we will accept them and contact them , &quot; said Al @-@ Khelaif .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have taken over this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the PSG central player , Marco Verratti .

according to the former , he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as this cannot be achieved , he will remain part of the European single market .
it would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .

the alternative to this would be to return to customs points , which would be a historic division and a political failure .
