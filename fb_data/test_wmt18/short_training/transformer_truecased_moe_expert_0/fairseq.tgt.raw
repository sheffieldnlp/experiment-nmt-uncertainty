Estonia and Spain had four members of Cape Verde Group detained
According to Consorily, in Spain the police captured Slava Gulevitn, the so-called leader of the Guinean group in the Estonian Union, who is known in the criminal world as Slava KCape Kemerovski.
In Spain, Gulevich was arrested by court.
Yesterday, the Court also took three suspects arrested in Estonia.
It is suspected that Cape Verde is a criminal community of between 27 and 57 years old, who commit mainly drug-related crimes.
In the province of Malaga in Spain, Mijav was held the alleged head of the criminal organisation.
In Estonia, three men were deemed suspects, one of which is collected according to criminal organisation and two are members of the criminal organisation.
The data collected indicates that the criminal community clearly assigned roles and roles.
Criminal organisation was designed to commit drug crime and thereby generate criminal proceeds, "commented the head of the pre-trial criminal proceedings, Public Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out that the circle of suspects in this criminal case will increase" added to the Prosecutor's.
These are people who have previously become law enforcement agencies' interests, and some of them have served sentences for drug crime.
She stressed that throughout the investigation cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high on the agenda.
"International cooperation has become common for us, and this week's operation shows how successful the cooperation has been,"
The head of the Central Criminal Police Service, ago Leis, said that the prisons were preceded by nearly one and a half years of preliminary investigation.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work was realised and, at the same time, we held criminal offences in Estonia and Spain ', he said.
In Leis, central criminal police officers were assisted in Spain's detention.
For years now we have good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can also get them from another European end, "said in Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that, in free stay, suspected men can continue to commit new crimes, leaving the Prosecutor's office to request arrest and approved by the court.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
This criminal case has seized properties, vehicles and cash to ensure confiscation.
The criminal case is conducted by the central criminal police organised crime office and is led by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The City Court in Tallinn sentenced Slava Gulevitch in 2005 to blackmail and punished him by five years in prison.
In the mid-last decade, Gulevitv was held in the criminal world by Nikolai Tarankov, the then Managing officer, as the second man.
Gulevich from Cape Verde grew up in Estonia in the early 1990s, when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
It was claimed that he would tax taxi managers and prostitutes operating in different hotels and ordered businessmen to pay monthly roofs.
International joint operations, criminal proceeds confiscations and the entry into force of court decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For instance, the recent court rulings, the so-called Dikactivist criminal community, on eight suspects of criminal cases, who were confiscated on criminal proceeds, or the sentence against nine individuals in that Igor Aleynikov established in 2006 a criminal organisation aimed at illegal trade in counterfeit cigarettes and commit trafficking-related crimes in Eastern Virgland and southern Estonia.
The confiscated proceeds from crime are worth nearly â‚¬71 500.
In these criminal cases, progress has been made by police officers changing information and prosecutors on a daily basis, exchanging external colleagues with evidence and, if necessary, carrying out operations in any EU country.
Civil rights grouping warns Missouriss travel
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned the people of Missourisal air conditioning against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The Group statement states: 'The NAACP travel link issued for the State of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, calls on all aAmerican travellers, visitors and souls to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the whole state, given the whole range of Roman suspects race-related events which have been occurring in the recent state and are also pointed here'.
NAACP said that it was urged to issue a travel warning both the recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to obtain court cases concerning discrimination, and also the fact that the state's record protection targets are disproportionately targeted at minorities.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are hung on the road serser because of their skin colour, beaten or slaughtered, "said NAACP Missour, Rod Chapel, President of The Kansas City Star.
"We have never been so closely complained before."
This is the first such warning that an organisation has issued to the US State.
The group referred to events such as racial insults against black students in Missouri University and the death of the 23-year-old black Lady Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year under suspicious circumstances after being able to cross the state in a flight from petrol to the floor and the Missour police took her to arrest without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missour Prosecutor indicating that black car drivers' cars are less likely to be stopped in the state than priests.
"The comment is intended to make people aware and to warn their families, friends and collaborators for what could happen in Missour," said Chapel.
"People need to be ready, whether it means taking away bail money or informing their relatives that they are passing through the state."
According to the latest information from the FBI hate crime programme, 100 hate crime crime was recorded in Missoura in 2015, placing the state in a cross-section 16 place in the state in terms of similar offences.
Travel warnings are also a response to the Missour new law, which makes it more difficult to refer a company to court for reasons of discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Association Confederation (LAEC Armenia) had issued earlier travel concerns for Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws obliging local people to arrest immigration infringements, as ACLU says it will increase racial profiling.
Normally, travel warnings are issued by the Foreign Office for other countries, but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain intra-US laws and trends.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver burst, may result from five different diseases: A, B, C, D and E hepatitis.
All these viruses are a liver-sounding pond.
However, with a bad cost, there is chronic B and hepatitis C, which can continue to develop the lip, i.e. the liver to the rock and the liver.
The epidemiology apples Kuksr of the HRC says that acute hepatitis diseases are the same for all types of vegetable activity - fawinemaking, tigue, birth, ocation, soul, paint, paint, paint emissions, pile and lidal pain, and meat and lidal rainfall.
The last disease is also caused by the liver's popular name of the trophy.
Children can exercise hepatitis without disease.
Different species of the organic can only be identified on the basis of laboratory study data.
Do not bachever can turn over to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without disease phenomena, which means that a person may not know about a harmful liver disease.
The audio Kutsar highlights different hepatitis forms and describes their course in more detail.
A hepatitis virus is spreading from a sick to humans and infected us in feeding contaminated food or drinking water, scoring in seals, beach and hands on food, soil, objects, pollination and drug consumption.
A hepatitis was a risk of infection - that is to say, the risk group of sick family members and carers, people suffering from chronic liver diseases, sex offenders, honey sex men, drug addicts, hepatitis high-performing countries - travellers are visiting countries.
Fever can be prevented by vaccination, in particular, it recommends vaccination for people travelling to a large number of people and at A hepatitis risk group.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: To wash or disinfect hands, before using food, to wash all fruit and vegetables.
The hepatitis virus is spreading to sufferers when they are exposed to the blood, when they burn drugs, treat induced, hourly dishourly, use of blood-contaminated dichives (tooit, tuals), donation blood, hepatitis bisnut in the sex and hepatitis foetal foetal foetal foetal foetal foetal.
The hepatitis heiny-associated drug-related HIV-induced drug addicts, the sex partners of infected people, sex men with honey, new HIV inmates, sick family members and carers, health care, workers and police officers, and travellers visiting high-inflammatory countries with hepatitis B.
B hepatitis prevention is a potential vaccine for people to vaccinate; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as people suffering from chronic diseases, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis (b) are: Avoiding alien and manyroyatry devices, other sharp tools and systalgic-chrosis, abytation and honour donation, and condom use in dangerous mixtures or avoiding sexual risk-taking.
Antipatitis hepatitis is part of the national immunisation scheme in Estonia and children free of charge.
Hepatitis C infections spread sick people to face the blood of a person, to inject drugs, to fine-drinking, to hire hourly dishes, to use blood-contaminated dicheshallings, to sex with hepatitis idiotic agent and to hepatitis foetal foetal foetal / infant.
The hepatitis heiny-related drug addicts, HIV sex partners, men sex with men, newly infected mothers, hospital family members and carers, blood and other body fluids are exposed to health, personnel and rescuers, HIV-infected persons and to high levels of hepatitis C are visited by travellers.
Hepatitis C preventive measure is: Avoiding alien and manyroytis, other sharp tools and systalgic-chrosis, abytation and honour donation, and condom use in cases of hazardous mixtures of infection.
Hepatitis C is not a vaccine.
Hepatitis D is causing hepatitis virus, which is acutely contained in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Accordingly, a D hepatitis Flamp, together with hepatitis B or superinfer hepatitis patients, is present in a cacle B.
Hepatitis viruses are spreading in exposure to blood and other body fluids, contaminated with systalgic-like, sexually and rarely infected animals.
Hepatitis hepatitis at risk is chronic hepatitis B virus elements and non-chemical agent of hepatitis B.
An effective preventive action is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccines, which also protects humans from hepatitis D virus infection.
E hepatitis viruses are spreading feeds on drinking water and food, including little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, donation with blood, open-use heart stalls and infected animals.
Travellers can be infected with hepatitis E high in the country.
The hepatitis prevention measures are hygiene requirements: Washing or disinfecting hands after coping in rockets, before eating and cooking, after sick care.
Fruit and vegetables are laundered before consumption, to avoid the low-treated heat beef, fish and seafood, to drink only safe drinking water and to avoid drug consumption.
Although at the last round, competitors tried to extradite four-fold Olympic winners from the race, the 34-year-old Farah finally found strength and won 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long, having finished the final phrase pulled on the path of wife Tania and children.
That was a particular moment for me.
I am very much taking my family.
They were on a wonderful course, "said Farah to journalists.
Farah is targeting the fifth edition in London of the 5-and-5-10 000-metre grade roll.
Everything is possible if it was believed.
Despite the title, she is dying in 'Daam gold', in spite of her book book, in Gustav Klimt's masterpiece of literature, in the love of Bloch-Bauer's portfolio, she is much deeper than the birthday of a works of art in the early 19th century and the early 20th century in Vienna.
But more thoroughly in history.
A disgusting information load would have been cultivated, that is to say a bit more steam in the north, and a more limited topic could be taken out of the title book book book book book book to have more influence.
At present, one would have two books between one news: Gustav Klimt and his painting, the 'Daam gold' story of Adele Bloch-Baueri, and a much larger and more comprehensive historical office from respected Jewish families and the German occupation, with its follow-up effects in Austria.
The first third of the book is in the middle of a wedding Vienna cultural life and who himself became the capital of Austria, can hardly imagine how over a hundred years ago he went around life round Russtrass or how the Centrali cake all the head turned when the customer was in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities and, seeing the name I know in the book, seemed to have been more culturally famous for a gram.
However, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a town where he took the pile of indefapitable guilt and was Europe's highest suicide level is something that seems to be worth nothing.
Or perhaps, however, each couple's beautiful benches adds colour to the 20th century's cultural life in Vienna.
Dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In recent decades of the 19th century Jews had exploded in Vienna, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
The timing exchange was almost one in ten Vienna.
Visitors were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time the helpless for Adele was able to open twice the Czech sugar magnado Ferdinand Klimt for his famous painting, his bank had already become the seventh-largest bank in Habsburg Empire.
But the whole glalar life in which he was famous was not brought.
If you look at 'Daami gold', you cannot believe that life was stopped by this heinous antiSocialist and forgot from travelling to the Soviet Union.
In 1903, when Ferdinja Bloch decided to order his husband's athlete from Klimlus, the last moment's commander in Vienna was a paintouch.
The climt ordered the price at the time of USD 4 000, a quarter of a good house.
For some marches, a master's modelle was suspected, sugar magnate did not deterred.
As far as the brain is concerned, the only certainty is that the relationship that has been established in the course of work with the model and the artist continued to life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - 'Daam kullas'.
GKlimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Baueri portm, "" Varrak 2016, translated Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the start of the work with Adelega, the climt had been in San Vitale and the researchers think it was there that the gullible emicna Theodoran artificial initiative to make a golden Port of Adeleree a mosaic.
The customer was presented in Daami gold in Vienna in 1908 and at around the same time (between 1907 and 1908) was born in another golden land called "Svellus."
Artists did not notice the similarity of two women.
What about creativity, Hitler?
"I think I will remember my friend Klimt to pay him to make his hand to the public," wrote to him Bloch-Bauer a few years after she left the artist (Klimt died in February 1918) to the Director of the Belvedere Museum and he wanted their family Klimhu to go to Museum.
Six years before the death, the customer was born in Adelest one portfolio.
In his testament (Adele left in February 1925) he also asked that her spouse retain two sports courses and four Gustav Klimt terrain to Austria Galway.
She delivered her statues to oyuclever Mariana and Luda.
One year after the customer had finished "Austrian Mona lisa", Viin Kaath had attempted access to Akademine Adolf Hitler, 17 years old, but failed the drawing period.
Although Hitler's late anti-Semitism is sometimes seen as the reason that Jew professors did not accept him in the Academy, no one of his execters was actually a habit.
In any case, the Austrian Galway mission, referred to in Maria testament, had changed considerably by 1939, had become a major factor in finding benches of the Vienna rich Jewish arts.
Hitler's personal artistic wealth was also sorely fed by some work at home for Aones, but not by Klimt.
Sixty years after the Nazi arts were kidnapped, a 10-year-old court dispute began between the Austrian Government and the heirs of Bloch-Baumian.
It should be noted here that if 'Snovelanism' sees Vienna in Belvedere Castle, Adele Bloch-Bauer's image of 'Daami gold' must be viewed in New York's Neue Galway.
And before Vienna, it was also worth reading through the aforementioned book.
Even if you do not intend to look at Klimt's work, because my emotion, at least after the closure of the book, went beyond the Nazi and Jewish issue of the town and modell Adele Bloch-Bauer sold USD 135 million.
So not so much a portfolio, but rather a very moving story of a tribal fate.
The events provided a significant channel to the relatives of the Bauer who was originally mentioned.
17-year-old swimmer in Canada very close to Estonia's record
In life, gold was 200 m pork into a personal record, very close to the rum of 2.16.62.
The label comes from a 17-year-old pipe celebration of the moment the Canadian Jutan Champions championships were awarded 14.58, the Priit Aaviku Fjumisison is brokered.
Gold ended, in other words, by the tenth A final.
He went across the finish with a distance of 2.2.68 and achieved a strong 7th prize with a new top-level mark.
Alina Kendzioris (2.15.13) left Golden in a little more than half a second.
Estonia's total annual ranking gold increased by 3, with its fresh personal top ranking accounting for all its fifth time.
The young hope for the future is to start at the Canadian football championships 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in balpings, and 200 m3 and 400 more complex.
Last week in Toronto, Canada held the ceremonies championships and gold rolled out there too.
He won 200 m in pipe oil with a silver medal time 2.2.3.22.
So quickly, this was swamped by the arrogance of the former in 2008.
The Golden site has been completed more quickly by the time-out in Estonia only by the Estonian Elina Park.
A Canadian-based champion won another 100 m-slum in a fatuten address with excellent personal records and a new Estonian season with 56.66 top stars.
For example, his year old Kertu ly Alnek has distanced this distancing by only one century.
He reached the top personal mark by finding a further 100 pigs in the swimming season in the opening of the theatre of 1.03.69.
For half, she only gained the seventh seat when she stunned in the finals 2.17.31.
Gold is currently running the Estonian sowings ranking with four distinct distancing from the top four benchmarks.
President Trump goes on holiday, critics cheer
The holiday time has come - that is to say a smile to US President Donald Trumpin.
However, as Trump has so far been one of the most deprived President of leave days, critics are already hammer.
The US's "Today and CNN" announced by the President as being 17 days' leave in the liquid golf clubs in Bedminster in New Jersey.
Even though the President's leave began yesterday, the anti-Trup issue has been speaking for a week now.
They are throwing the LTTE out of business as a result of a wave of carelessness.
Indeed, the President has the standard practice of having a weekend's time in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey cotton.
By the way, Trump has not pumped the President most in 196.
For example, George W. Bush had already reached 67 days on this holiday, Barack Obama half as much as Trump, but 21 days.
But the Tath tends to quickly fail.
The days before becoming President, in Trump's tree, '60 minutes', it was said that your man would not be in the long term for rest holidays because there is a great deal to do.
He also objected three years ago to Barack Obama's leave.
The current President wrote on Twitter then: 'While Obama is on holiday, golf is playing, the brakes and Judaashatty concerts, in Thailand, journalists are walking their heads out of the wind.'
According to white house officials, 17 days of golf course visits to polled have no undercut.
It is officially called employment leave, during which the Tirker has no time to read or any other pro-active activities.
In addition, working holidays had to have another reason.
Indeed, the White House's Western balance sheet system is being replaced and therefore the whole staff had to leave.
The West Bank also has Ovaalchkar and other presidential offices.
"I do not think anybody would like to be in the western wing in August if you have 38 degrees and no balance pensions," said the speaker of the White House, Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the President would continue to work during the holiday period.
Where President Trump will spend 17 days' time, you will get an idea of video.
Blocking critics on Facebook not to stand for a national office unless you tolerate voters' criticism
Our country's father knew a great deal about unfavourable media reports.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not take long to start racking him on everything from internal politics to his political principles.
The criticism naturally annoyed him.
But she did not force her critics to silence.
Because in 1783 Washington said that 'freedom of expression could be taken away from us and more quickly and in silence we could be led by sheep, by fire.'
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to struggle to be more Washington.
Under Hogan, at least 450 people have blocked and deleted postal services, giving their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And early this week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ECLIE shield) therefore took it to court.
The Siberner official's office acted as empty and web comments were broken by counter-reactions' who interests? '.
'That is just Facebook 'said many.
But that matters.
And that is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an astonishing popular republican Governor of an overwhelming democratic state.
His discharge rate is the second most important among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a thoughtler.
He has firmly drawn the state and remains firm in his principles.
Furthermore, she has used her as the main tool to deal with voters quite wisely on Facebook, for example, after chemotherapy, to display her bitter head.
So the Governor's body Mercedes Bresso is a public forum with a formal label, managed by a staff who is paid on taxpayers' dollars and who are stranded in an unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with Hogan press representative Amelia Chasse, The Washington Posselt was protected by the Governor's conduct, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it is too easy to paint a picture of online screening, spammers or people with anger.
The post was held by a number of quite people whose Hogan blocked.
That is what they are, precisely, Mr Barrot, people who communicate with their elected leaders, the teacher, company owner and pastor, not online controls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, well thought-out and not at all rose.
The Pastor quoted milk in his postal, underlining Hogan's Catholic traffic.
A lawyer from Maryland in Bowie, Lakshm Sarma Raman, not encouraged hatred but rather hate crime.
"I politely explained that I was disappointed that he had not reacted to hate crime or other recent news," he wrote The mail news story in the heading.
"I also dislike the idea that if many people comment on the same subject, some will suddenly call it an indifference to collective effort rather than admit that it is a lot of concerns."
What the Governor's official called 'targeted junk fire attack' would probably be called on by others' public support '.
The Facebook era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much cleaner than in the past, when to do the same, it was necessary to send out staff to gather critical editorial papers and burn them or arrest protestors and force them to silence them.
But that is exactly what is happening now, just digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media abound.
President Trumpi has been sued by users of Twitter who have been blocked from Twitter's bed.
One of the first formal sentences on this subject with symbolic meaning was made last week in Virginia.
A US interlocutor James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the Board of supervisors of the Loudounn Region was infected by the first amendment to the Constitution if he blocked a constituent on Facebook page.
Ktuckys also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter by the Governor Matt Bevint (R).
That should not be so difficult.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar impact to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, newspapers were multiplied by newspapers and anonymous writers interviewed by their management methods.
And even then Washington had to face anonymous controls.
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseudo-Orricola, Valerius, Belisariu and Portius, grappling Washington decisions.
In the wake of the book-based George Washington project for collecting letters, he buried a cabinet petition criticising his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain.
But she did not force them to stay silent.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debates are the very foundations of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes of comfort in Renaissance Clubus with the home territory
The former European representation Ronan Rafferty hopes for comfort in the home territory in the next three days, when East Lothiani Renaissance Renaissance Clubi golf takes place on 25 Scottish Senior Open.

It was a very special time, which we will always be at heart. "
On the soil of the home, Gary Orr also returned to the competition, joining the European Youth Association at the beginning of this year, when she got 50.
This is her first event in Scotland after Aberdeen Management Scottish Openil in 2013.

I have enormously enjoyed playing again and I have shown a fairly decent golf game.
I am happy to see progress so far. "

Poverty and death in Indonesian gold land
If Bardina Degei is preparing, he will not use lead.
She seldom uses the poet.
The Indonesian army in the capital of the Paniai Constable province in the Morotali will put the housewife in the local language in place direct replacement of the bar called 'nota'.
In half an hour, coal-fired sludge will be taken from fire and beaten with unfettered hands.
Degei is sitting on the ancient beach of PrÃ­ncipe without rance, and yet it is also doing its daily household work, such as beating a washing with nearby agony water.
The baby's role is played in undose room.
Since she is a fourth female noorist of her wife, she is not condemned to care for any generations.
Polygaamia is common here on May.
Late work could be dangerous dangerously kiusmost of the village's men are unemployed and many of them drink hard, plus soldiers.
"No one dares to go around after five o'clock in a morning," he says.
It is a rare sight in Papua mÃ¤ki, a former Dutch colony that was added to Indonesia in 1969 after the polemic referendum, where only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote hand in hand with the army's eyes.
The move from the Dutch suppressant power has been inciting its rage against the Jakarta government, which continues to keep the region under strong control, away from foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province of Paapud was officially distributed to the West Pope, so that Papua New Guinea, independent, was left in the eastern island.
The majority is a similarly remote and deserted place, and here we have to fly 90 minutes from the province's capital, Jayapurl, to Nabida and then pass a five-hour journey.
There is no public transport.
A city with around 19 000 inhabitants consists of cages surrounded by bars and cover lainous iron roofs, whose rocargo has turned a different tone into yellow-Brown.
Very few Indians have taken the route here, not to mention journalists, nor have hardly any foreigners been here.
Before Christian missionaries were arriving, Mee Pago's papapaved God, with the name Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to its colourful handbook turbine, dark to pluusus and private.
"Before that, we only carried a plant's paper."
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia.
But it is also a Indonesian gold country.
Just 100 km from Paniato, the New Jersey size of a mountain with a population of 153 000, is the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, a Freeport McMoran, in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone Freeport emitted around USD 3.1 billion of gold and coph from this place.
In addition, Papua can be smuggled with consumer timber stocks, which are estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of pathogen suffering, as they are a result of the stranglehold of the powerful Indonesian army.
The New York Times study in 2005 showed that Freeport paid around USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150 000 per victim.
The Paado's attempts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden hour and is ruthlessly disconnected.
Human rights activists have been saying that since 1969 more than 500 000 killers have been killed and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the massive killing of the New genocide in the 1970s in Papua tribal lands was a metre of genocide.
Last year alone, over 3 900 peaceful protestors were arrested in the Indonesian region.
The Birsbane Archbishop report 2016 "We lose all" contains testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (another report says rape and electricity shock is particularly widespread) and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to read the figure because such incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, the journalist of Human Rights Watch.
CERs are even more strongly shut down, because Papua natural resources have caused new settlers to cross in from Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demographics are changing because there are economic migrants coming from the Indonesian crowds Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes islands.
Live canteens sell beat and blending vegetables gado-gado, which are serted with sheer land grab.
Local cannot compete with them.
"Migrants started selling hens and vegetables in the traditional market more cheaply than local shields," explains the 24-year-old Embassy born in Paniai who worked for the name of the city of Jayapurs.
"Indigenous pawns rance Scheme'Ivoire Papua mama-mama [Women] will therefore lose their market share."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, known to the population as Jokowi, promised in his election campaign in 2014 to tackle their inequalities and human rights abuses in Pope.
The former purest won on its way from the Jakarta presidential Palace to the 27 Papua 29 constituents, including Paniai.
But the Pope has changed very little and the local feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokow in the expectation that he would live up to our hopes of restoring justice," said You will.
In fact, Paniai barely experienced a downfall two months after Jokow took office in October.
On 7 December 2014 11 children in the Morotali songs on Christmas Christmas, while the blind eye motorcycle was filled by two Indonesian soldiers.
Met children told them they should include the front lights.
After local pastori Yavedt Tebai, he reported insulting one of his soldiers to their tone and subsequently returned to four soldiers.
According to victims and witnesses, under-age soldiers chrucked children and beat them with their own devices.
Then one of the soldiers shot among children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was so cruelly beaten that he fell into the home.
A few hours later, the loved electoral Commission took the floor and the next day the estuary went further.
Around 1000 young Pamen, women and children gathered to demand justice at the local police station and military command centre football.
They carried out horse-repair buses and presented Papua mee pago without-tantsu, during which a beer was beverted and a mong was buried.
Some protestors started to lure the police and the military.
When the anger was raised, a soldier was sent to his troops via a guest by an guest. 'If the crowds show resistance more than three times, let them down,' the official document, which has seen a magazine time but which has not been issued to local media reports, was said.
The Mayor of Kego Koto, Yeremias Kayame (56), was deemed to be a threatening threat and called for peace by asking for the crowd to go home.
Nobody wanted to listen.
"All around I was shot at the left suddenly," he said time in his private colour the disability house blood.
Kayame still does not know who was shooting, but says that month, the soldiers came from the ranks.
"There was a lot of people, the industry was full of steam," he adds.
Alfius Youw, a local man, was shot on his chest three times, says the man.
"I would like to come back to him and inquire through her body to make sure that it was with him, 'said the magazine synonymous in Yohano, who, like many Indians, uses only one name.
"I saw she dead... Snovel she."
The Papua police chief inspector, Yotje Mende, told reporters that he was only responsible for ensuring his own Parish's security because it was attacked.
"We need to protect ourselves if threats are to be sent," said the Trushman Pudjo Sulistiyo, the Trushar of the Pakian police.
"That is a matter of life and death."
Human Rights Watch said that five young protestors were killed and there were many injured.
News of killings arrived in Jakara only the day after.
Three weeks later, Jokow Jayapura held a passionate speech, giving the victims' families sympathy and allowing them to deal with the maltreatment in the Pope.
"I want to resolve this incident immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the security minister, Wiranto, said that he would set up an extrajudicial mechanism to tackle human rights crime.
But almost immediately, the excuses were also followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them were in the 1990s and in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to tackling these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes, 'he said.
Speaking at the time in Jakarta on 5 June, Wiranto took off his words, saying that he had no intention of setting up a Pope mechanism to deal with complaints.
Instead he said 'everything would be resolved by law'.
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights, over 1 000 people killed in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999, said that 11 human rights crime had already been solved in Paapua, including what happened in Paniai.
The victims' families of the Paniai took such claims with a gloomy belief.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I am tired."
He says he is still afraid years later.
'I am afraid 'he says.
"I am afraid the army is arresting me, I am afraid I am being shot."
She brod Yacobus confirmed the view that the Paniai people were afraid to slander this incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bury four victims.
"After the body was buried, the army had to look at me, 'he says.
Arrests have not stopped.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot the village residents of Paniai in neighbouring Deiyais.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when it went on to talk about the town's head and the head of the building company, refusing to carry an unknown man to hospital.
This man, a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drown into nearby rivers in the search for fish, died on the road to hospital.
The frequent village residents protested to the site office of a company on a construction site.
According to the police, the village residents stoned police stoned, with the latter responding with warning bullets.
But local would argue that mobile British people (the Indonesian army police) started shooting at the population, killing one person.
"We were very panic, we are afraid of revenge," said to the magazine the time-limit of 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives close to hospital and saw the injured person being infuriated.
"I have deceived myself in my own house for two days."
The Deiyi Parliament has called for the relevant police officers to be held accountable and the police to be redrawn from the area mobile phone.
Paniania has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the honey, moni, dancing and dar in Papua Delhi's land.
Many of them have joined the All Free Paapua D (VPL) Congolese army of rebels, which, in its own words, protects the rights of boats by carrying out casual attacks and abduction campaigns among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL drivers come from Paniya, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, in the name of defending 'State sovereignty', the army has in recent years arrested Paniai and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them never appear again.
Among the Congolese people, Panias is known as' tragic forgotten '.
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The little rip that the majority is selling is too expensive to buy local.
The b is equally unattainable.
People are growing their entire food self-food fabric mainly on the bath, plus a little fruit and kitchen fruit.
Farming is women's work, each managing to maintain four or five objects.
They usually keep most harvests to the family, the rest being sold on the local market.
Ten bars only cost 10,000 facilities (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality between incompetent pated boats and new migrants who have come to a great deal since the opening of new flight routes at Nabire airport has deepened.
The few jobs that exist go to better trained and wealthier migrants.
The Paats themselves often lack the skills needed to conduct a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in leaving a fridge because there is no jobs or money," the Chairman of the Paniai tribal Council, John Gobai, says.
The unbundling keeps the world's eyes off the Pope.
In addition, foreign media are subject to severe restrictions.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basilth Longchamp were expelled from the Pope because 'they did not follow the relevant practices', although they had been given a rare film authorisation.
Human Rights Watch's Deputy head of Asia, Phelim Kine, said that the Jokow electoral promises to remove the limits imposed on reports to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia, journalists trying to report calmer and the Western Paputan provinces are facing new threats to the rejection of the civilised visa and blackmailing," said in a statement.
The lack of a media glance means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to Papua neighbours.
In March six Pacific countries totalling 152, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands were encouraged to investigate 'a series of large-scale crimes' in the Paapua, including the shooting of Paniai.
The same countries have historically supported VPL.
The Indonesian Foreign Minister, Arrmanatha Nasir, has dismissed a group's accusations, saying to the press: 'In Indonesia democracy and freedom of the press so that evidence of human rights cases can be decried'.
Local people want more foreign governments to be taken into consideration.
When the Dutch official delegation, headed by the country's human rights Ambassador, Kees Van Baari, visited Jayapurat on 4 May, the local people interrupted the meeting, but anonymous with their silence, saying that they had his silence, urging him to 'we want freedom'.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but pathy trees do not believe they will vote again for Jokow.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but the people around him who are involved in shooting Paniai say" he is President Hobai of the tribal Council.
He wants to make Jokow understand that, apart from the fact that the people of Panii are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are suffering from misery because of poor education and health services.
According to Goita, people in Panian, like other boats, consider their vote to Jokow as a debt to pay.
'They need no money, they want justice, 'he says.
Despite the threat and intimidation, the victims' families of Panian fire were coping with the latest symbolic counter-action in pirates matching the victim's body of police stations and military bases in the land.
Knowing that justice may never be done, they at least prevent those responsible from forgetting their crimes.
'One of our family members was killed 'says Yacobus with a headline.
'What can we do else? '
Nenev nepoi Torch's Hurricane, already in his second phase
On Friday, one of the world's highest housing blocks in Dubai was slaughtered, forcing hundreds of inhabitants to escape from 337 metres of heat and 79 storey buildings.
It is another fire that has, in just two years, devastated the high ranking that happens to be called Torch, the TÃµrvik.
The building was evacuated, no injury was reported and no direct fire was caused.
"We sleep and woke fire hoods and people shouting.
We would get fewer people in school and we needed about 10 minutes to get down to the 50th time, 'Reuterna was a single man who called himself George.
In the words of Dubai civil protection officials, fire-fighters also suspended fire-fighters at around 4 a.m. in the morning at local time (00.00 GMT) and jailed the building.
The government said they were working to provide the victims with shelter.
This incident may once again raise issues around the world about the safety of high-calibre materials used on external grounds.
A follow-up to the Torch Bureau in 2015 found that the most damage was caused by fastaics - foreign surface decorned panels and isolation.
The British police have said they believe that the London Grenfell Tower isolation and fasteners could contribute to the fire chaos there in June, with nearly 80 deaths.
See: They are likely to be on-line sales boards in the autumn
Kenya and autumn are a time-span for technical sports, because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia Premium have been sold, and in the autumn there will also be a new hitt-phones for boelephire.
According to Tele2 marketing and sales Director, Christian Seema, street ships are characterised by an innovative design design, a live sleep, a serse-servani resolution 4K screen and ultra-fast delivery process.
The technology world of Samsung Galaxy S8 has shown great excitement, which has also reached the top ranking of Estonian smart phones.
In autumn, smart foetal can be allowed to be loaded with even more rapid, more resilient batteries, better quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that, as far as I am concerned, rumours can already be made and forecast four top models which will probably modernise sales tables.
These four smart phones' top-edge models will reach the bogeyelling operators in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone Plus should reach shops as early as mid-September.
The grumours about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are going to be much.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences between iPhone and 6s, Apple's 10th birthday is expected to distinguish the new model from the previous one entirely.
Four colours have been mentioned: Black, white, rosÃ© gold and chromium.
One element of the new design is probably the screen, which covers the entire telephone panel, has lost the dockle and fingerprints are built on the screen.
The Apple design leader JonyIve demands that the new iPhone model look like a glass.
There has also been talk about an iPhone ceramic version.
In addition to the windows, wireless charging and a higher-quality camera, faster A11 process can be expected.
Certainly that is one of the most expected smart phones for a year.
The brand Galaxy note 8 will start on 23 August.
There are a lot of rumours about the new Galaxy note 8 starting to look.
It is worth hearing that even more business users are being rewarded and the S pen will allow even more functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one being lainpressure and the other a television field with a narrow view.
Nobody is yet aware of why two retardants are capable of tapping, but in any case it is the first test of the same same force, which is certainly of value for money compared to iPhone 8.
However, we are looking forward to 23 August.
While Nokia has brought sales this year with three smart phones, led by Nokia 6, there is still a shortage of their flagship - Nokia 8, which is already to be presented on 16 August.
We are waiting from well to 5.3-dust screen and ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processes and a more robust ag.
Nokia is also talking about aluminium koruna and significant water and dust resistance (IP68).
Like the code, Nokia's new model has two nurtures of ambia, an optimist produced by the Zeiss.
Once Sony has been a secure flagship ship, XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smartphones will have even more innovative functions.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
The new model for Sony has been speculated that it is screened at least heat.
What the reality is, we can see it very soon, because traditionally at the Sony's autumn flagship International Technology Fair (IFA), which is expected to be published this year from 1 to 6 September.
Telephone leased transcriptors, Trump forced to pay the border wall
Washington signed a call between US President Donald Trup and Mexican Heads of State for telephone calls between the United States.
On 27 January, Mr Nietta pressed the Mexican President, who ordered him to stop announcing that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American President pressed him for a public condemnation of the wall, saying 'You must not say that to the press'.
The Trump has lent its presidential campaign a commitment to build a stretch of the United States' southern border walls and vanity, to make Mexico pay for this project.
Transcrilers were also published in their first speech with Australia's Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals intense debates.
Trump said to Mrs Turner that the agreement that the United States would take on a migration path to Australia would be 'ridiculous', 'nervous' and 'foolish'; he said that an agreement that was made during the Obama Government would leave him with a 'head' impression, because he has proposed a ban on refugees in the United States.
The Trump closed by announcing to Turnbull that 'was the most unpleasant speech of the day'.
The Supreme Court did not prosecute the ss-MRP City of Liinid in the case of Tartu City rejecting their offer for bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 2029.
It is a handbook rejecting the OÃœ MRP site of the Liinid company in Tartu bus procurement because the offer was not compliant, Anneli Apuhtin, Director of Tartu City Law Service.

His family's goodwill also does not disrupt the festivals, although last year's chamber was still further afield than this year.

Beijing cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revive business
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that he would cut another 3 000 jobs and reduce his interim dividend by 72%, thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with the mentoring burden of business.
The jobs that will be covered, which will most likely be concentrated according to CEO John Fallon, at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will add to the 4 000 posts lost in previous restructuring.
Beijing announced in May plans to cut costs under the third cost-cutting programme by another GBP 300 million (USD 394 million) to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid digital shift.
A company that agreed to sell a share last month to the Penguin Random House for its partner company, Bertelsmann, said that their expectation with respect to the year has not changed since sales revenues were announced at 1% to 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Kabul attack: Suicide bombarded by NATO soldier
The suicide bomber attacked the officers, according to the officials, the Afghan capital, Kabul, military convoys, killing a single NATO soldier and wounding several others.
The NATO statement stated that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
Without declaring local reports, the town of Qarabaghi also found three civilians killed in an incident in the line.
This bombing is the last acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month, with Herat's moschrogena killed over 30 people on Tuesday.
On Monday suicide bombing in Kabul killed two people close to the Iraqi Embassy.
NATO's statement said that an explosion on Thursday was carried out when the Afghan army was united in patrol with an attack on "man-made explosives."
The statement states that everything is injured in a stable state and is treated in the US military hospital at Bagram's airport.
According to correspondents, the Taliban and group known as the so-called Islamic state (TEEK) are an increasing force in Qarabh as a serious source of concern for NATO forces in Bagrage.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilians have died in Afghanistan, some 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people in the line of Shi'ite rays.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a major bomb attack in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, which has resulted in the most deaths in a military attack in the country since US-led forces were reluctant to carry the Taliban in 2001.
This violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the country's army and US troops helping police forces.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA repealed the decision to postpone the Regulation following actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (UNStates Environmental Protection Agency EF) repealed the decision to delay the establishment of a Obama-time regulation obliging states to limit emissions of emissions from the summer, one day after 15 states were sued by its action.
The EPA announced the decision to proceed with "the decision to decide on the eligibility of 2015" late on Wednesday, saying that it would demonstrate the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe we need to have a dialogue and listen to our state partners," said the EPA leader Scott Pruitt in a statement.
The pipeline had announced in June the plan to put in place shareholder rates at H. Dalli, which measure pollution in various parts of the country, in order to determine where this level should be reduced to compliance with the stricter air quality standard by one year from malaria to 2018.
15 mostly democratic states, together with the Colombian community, filed a fixture on Tuesday, saying that this decision was unlawful.
President Donald Trumpi's government has tried to retract a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, and I think that is part of the broader growth plan.
But these efforts have led to reactions among democrats and nature conservation groups concerned about the effects of increased contaminants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhaling the ozone layer "can reduce lung capacity and increase risk to respiratory diseases" e.g. asthma.
German pigs can come from a pitch.
German pigs and cattle can come in pain, because heavy rains threaten the EU's second-biggest wheat producer catch, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it may be the case that weeks of precipitations before harvesting can mean that the products intended for the bread industry are only fed to animals.
"The content quality is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeisen analytics Experil.
This year, up to 40% of German wheat can be fed fed, which is twice as bad as conventional, in Agravis.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have been exposed to all weather this year.
First, winter was too dry.
Then there came cold rockets, which were replaced by heat waves in June.
In July, Germany was hit by a ragbag which has continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned on northern Germany, where rain hinders harvesting.
So far only five per cent of wheat have been cleared.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible confrontations
Mr Lomachenko and Ms Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face the most attractive poxing poxing of the near future in the poppy up to 66.7 kg weight, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in Ligulearly Mens's special rooms in the ESPN office, until Garcia, the unwon World Boxing Councili lightweight champion, walked to the other corridor to welcome Lomachenkot, the World Boxing Times tably consulting the sulgrasram.
Following the unanimous decision of the Garcia, the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner won over Saturday in Showtime will both militia in the headwel.
The Garcia extended its better hand and said: 'How will you go, Naempion?
I wish you well. "
Lomachenko is defending his belt, Miguel Marriaga, on Saturday evening, 19 in ESPN.
When a few photo photos were named, Lomachenko's mountain jer Egis Klima pointed out that a possible "perfect exercise" between opposing fighters would be a.
"I am former sultative," reminded Garcia.
"I have switched to Broner [63.5 kg] but I am not so big.
I am a little for 63.5 kg.
I want to move downwards.
And it must move up the trail [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fanatics have asked for it.
Let us put it to them. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world needs that fight."
The clima raised the question of whether it should be worthwhile, as part of his strategy of wanting to allow Lomachenko to book the midnight of this year at 61.2 kg class to make it possible for next summer to meet with Garcia (37-0, 30 hassle), who also has an interest in combating Jorge Linda and Luke Campkkich, following the athlete celebration of the primand prizey commemorating on the Forradar commemoration on 23 September.
"Looking at this fight could be worthwhile, because fans have asked for it," "said Garcia, later, saying that it was open to fighting any channel providing the best financial package.
"We are the main actors.
No other name can attract so much attention.
Whenever they are ready... '
Garcia said she was considering Lomachenkot as a 'force fighter' and could go on to his Saturday bug.
However, Lomachenko was modest in praising Garcia saying that he thought the three champion of Riverside was' very slow; I am sorry, Mikey... you wanted it a nose. '
"Garcia" said the aim was to show swingeing and then boy.
Both confirmed that they felt that tension would increase to try to get them between them.
"That is the struggle for realisation.
No other confrontation arouses so much attention and scorn.
I am more than willing to work on that, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: 'I have been on the best fighters' list, and Mikey is just that.
That will be a good struggle. "
What world rays will be relocated to Estonia?
Soil was extended and issued by the Police and Border Guard (PPA) in record terms over 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, soil was chosen to issue an open-ended residence permit to 6702 foreigners, whereas Laval was 4928.
The agencies cannot tell us how many migrants will eventually stay in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
If, ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians were knocking on Estonia a year, in recent years this figure is approaching 2 000.
The number of residence permit holders soared during the Ukrainian crisis, with 1087 people in 2014 having fixed-term residence permits, compared to 675 in the year before.
Statistics from the Agency show that the highest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is growing - the cost of the past being more than a civilian population in Estonia was more pronounced.
"The Ukrainian community has been very high in Estonia all the time, and it is natural because of the difficult circumstances in the country that work and study opportunities are being sought in a country where the community and many families already had their own, Christin Rammus, the spokesperson for the Home Department.
Soil and opium had a fixed-term residence ratio even higher than the number of Russian nationals, although in 10 years total temporary residence permits have been granted to them.
If Ukrainians get into work here predominantly, Russian citizens are moved into domestic migration.
"Given the Russian historical community here, they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Meuse, the Internal Security Academy.
'If you look at where the Russian citizens who have been granted Estonian residence have moved, after Harjuno, East Flue is immediately attached 'and pointed out that around 40% of them are married to an EU citizen.
Soil was granted to 1.696 Russian citizens for fixed-term residence, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the residence permit to extend the number of Russians who wanted to enjoy it fell.
"" Hype is the result of requests for a new residence permit to be permanently located in Estonia, "said the Home Affairs press representative Rammus, who said that the Russian citizens' interest in Estonia's residence permit has remained stable for years.
The new residence permit for a permanent stay in Estonia can be applied for foreigners who have been here for at least three years.
It aims to encourage the survival of adapted people.
A long-term residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The new residence permit has apparently also led to a reduction in the old residency permit.
Soil, for example, was given such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years.
Now Ukrainians can exchange their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be able to point the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular in the courtyard - the holders of the liver's passports (1029), Russians (487), indicted (54) and nigers (36).
In total, 1968 people were granted residence permits to reside in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese.
This year's first half has already seen a total of 1269 such applicants.
In 10 years, Nigeria has become a surprisingly active country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three life permits were issued to Finns in 2007, the soil was 200.
Nigeria comes to study here at universities.
In addition, Estonian higher education institutions are popular, for example among Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian citizens has risen mostly thanks to study games.
For them too, the rule applies that there is a community in advance, that is to say more easily to others', added Rammus.
In ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 South Korea, 40 Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If around 6 000 third country nationals receive a residence permit a year, it is about 0.46% of the total population.
Even if you add to the European Union's citizens, migration will stay to about a percentage, "
A total of 14 822 people were exposed to soil according to the statistical office, while 13 792 were coming out of it.
That means that immigration has exceeded emigration for a second year.
The majority of relocated and outgoing workers are Estonian citizens, but more are among those leaving.
As a result, Estonian citizens had a migration secret with 2 000 people in the red.
Estonians are particularly familiar with the difference between Finland and Estonia.

It was this reasoning that led to the rolling stock plan to move higher grades to the Finnish countryside, between forests and fields, between people who are often not reached by the fashion.
Mammu-long collections were presented on the basis of comparison, JÃµhvis and LT moealleel, for example, where 45 modelles were performed by Royal Refilee throughout the streets.

That is the way experience, the charade on the verge of a wonderful hole!
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen what I have been watching, I am always behind the scenes to give hopeless parade to things that are the last butcher.

Martin Myrrrat of U18 boys: The Albanians' weapon of alagpiturniÃ© was turned against us now
Alas, fairy tale ran out.
The first thing was that we could not get our desk.
And when there is such a difference in the table, 'there is nothing to do', Estonia commended U18 corvball boxes 61: 75 dislephors to Great Britain have played our only paradball, BC Kalev / mo RAabitreener Martin Myrrrreleer.
Opponents took 28 pounds from the offensive wave and so suffered so many more attacks.
We were also not prepared to protect them aggressively and not to attack them, that created.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds; we were unable to build protection.
In defence, however, they managed to keep their hands everywhere, we could not combine.
That was the team's feet.
Anti-terrorism was best done.
A lawyer estimates that Estonia should have made more tactical errors to remove the anti-terrorist momentum in the bud.
Last quarter - we had a zero error, but opponents have already passed a few quick records.
Proximity and intense insistence, which was alagpiturlic for our weapon, have now turned against us all.
Today we had no power against their aggressiveness.
The youthest remained untenable in Kalevi, Matthias Tass.
In general, a whole team can be said to be well-worn, to date united in shock.
It is a pity that such aggressive opponents had not been met before.
Task has been confident all the time and has played it out today, but it seemed to have been tired - she has carried a pretty great burden.
But he made some fairly nice moves that I have seen in the past trends', added a mentormer.
Terrible numbers: Nefresh coral corps flooded the visutilize with EM-turnial three quarters less than 10 points...
In the U18 age class, only the emi B-divisjon corpound in Tallinn will not apply to the younger men's class, she started the day yesterday in Dublin.
And Estonia's games with Poland were, unfortunately, a jealousy zone.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but even after the third quarter, 9: 49, or only in the last 10 minutes, opponents took the floor from the gas family, leaving the period at the level of 016: 16.
In both the first and second quarters Estonia threw 4, point 1, third...
Then at the beginning, two pieces of the four-minutes from the first to the box, then the ball was played around 25 bits, then one yellow beacon and then 21 are passed down...
Perhaps in almost half an hour, 47 creatures were caught out of a single.
In addition, 2 paragraphs came from four free yardsticks.
Many pay losses were a reasonable figure with that time, 12.
The game ended with Poland's catch-up rate of 33% and Estonia 13% (68 / 9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on opening days Portugal had to be recognised as 83: 56 better.
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to supplement stocks
Today NATO has arrived for 1 permanent mine steering group for the weekend to visit Tallinn to prepare for the stock of ships and for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit vessels are preparing for release into the sea, giving crews the possibility to take a couple of day holidays.
Following the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a series of exercises and be prepared for future historic explosives-searching operations.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO contingent and the co-operation in local waters is a good illustration of our integration into allied capacity," said KIC chief of the overseas military and planning station, Captenore Arto Reinmaa.
Since 29 June, NATO will chair the 1 permanent mine warship group of Latvia's Captain Gvileitnaium Laudups, who took over from the Estonian navy officer, Johan-Elias Seljaa.
The group's flagship ship is LVNS Virsaitis, a naval support vessel in Latvia, which also operates a group's motto.
This semester includes the Estonian Navy mine hunt and Sakalas as part of an international unit.
As one of the four groups of ships subject to NATO's Maritime command, NATO's 1 permanent mine group is a primary installation unit that could be deported within five days to different places in the world.
4-13 August the fairytale retardants of Pirita's monastery will once again become the place where the Alestro Etat, in the Birgitta Festival, was decepted 13 years ago.
This year's Birgitta Festival will become the Charlemagon's art leader of the Film in Tallinn, at the Jooto (36), a beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
At the risk of the Renaissance: 'Traviata' and 'Tosca', balletilalalavellas' saturated 'by' Karlssonin ', and neither the scheme lacks its own production, this time Joseph Haydni's maiorum Contrict,' Aastaajad ', as the equivalent of the international team who brought Piriyni to Haiti's design into the courtyard in 2015.
Birgitta Festival has much more than just concerts and theatre replies.
That is greater than any music theatres in their normal form.
It is a festival whose snow is gaining ground and never totally disappears.
Because the experience that the user gets in this unjust and mysterious environment gives people souls more calmer and concerns human models in a way that cannot be described.
At the risk, you are the first year of Birgitta Festival's artistic leader.
Did the maestro Ek Cant feel a little bit as a gift?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klaus, it has been a lot of help.
She went through a whole pupil career and also supported the dirigisme at the beginning of my digisme careers.
Perhaps that is why I am easier to carry on with her work.
In Klas, Burma has been absorbed so much by the Festival's team of benches and, of course, all of this also spills me over.
It was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going.
Eri Kese, a great heart, also gave me the strength to thrive on the Tallio Festivaly in harmony.
And here I am and I can!
What could public opinion on this year's festival be given what you are offering in particular?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and surprise, among other things, to presentation in the first balleum written on Ms Lindgren's speech.
That is' Karlsson ends'.
And one notorious nuance in that is that the Balleti author is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write on this work.
Apparently, she has already had a child's carrot in the centre of Karlsson.
At the risk, how do you bright all that?
Thanks to my supportive life partner, I certainly believe.
Such work requires support and much love, and fortunately I have a lot of stack.
And I have noticed that my personal emotion is not as dependent on other people as I myself might be, so how I will go against every new day.
And such awareness of tone, of neutrality and de facto smiling on ourselves in the mirror this morning significantly increased my happy percentage.
Especially now this week, when the most important tests are the ones, I have been particularly keen to practise it and it works.
Smiling itself is boosting brain and raising it.
That is not just fine words.
I think people do not yet know about what their body is providing for them in the universe, but by everybody will find it gradually.
Right now, an important moment.
Also has a ritual before dirigendi pulls were taken?
It is time that clothing should be exchanged for more comfortable reasons.
That is a small moment for itself.
But generally, yes, I do not have the opportunity to cool before I can speak a lot or to make a little smile.
In fact, I even like to actively communicate with people, even before dirigendidrag is taken.
But come to Birgitta Festival, here too, not a very big ous and a ball friend!
Watch the protests with Risto Jooga!
New results of Swedish age assessment tests for asylene applicants
In Sweden, asthma tests were carried out among asthmatics, which evaluated their age-old novel approach in medicine, with the latest test showing that over 80% of theory was considered to be older than 18%, but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute for medicine (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) started the tests this year.
Tests were created to better assess age in the asylum application after the Swedish migration agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly identify the number of the alleged age of refugees of the under-age of several minors.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 68 cases to the test and the Institute for Justice has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March 2017 and 31 July.
Eighty per cent (2002) were assessed as 18 or over and another 25 cases were assessed by the Court of Justice Institute that 'may be a 18-year-old or older'.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that man was' probably younger than 18 '.
The tests will only be used if the human age is in question.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson, the Institute of Justice (PL), results are consistent in relation to those in the past months.
"We do not see any major differences in the statistics over the past months, the numbers are fairly consistent," he said The Local Journal.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were judged to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that applicants have been misguided by their age.
The institute issued in May the results of the 581 test and said that 442 cases "there are indications that the person examined was 18 years old or older."
But when she studied the results of the 581 test, she said that in 243 cases she had directly claimed she would be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, whereby wisdom-hampered rÃ¶ngeniimages and corn MRT fields, are carried out, is then allowed to be analysed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some quarters.
One of the sceptics is the Karolinska Institute endokrinsciengist Claude Marcus, whose tasks include an assessment of human biological maturity to find out whether they went through the usual audience early or later.
"I have had reason to think about that and I do not think that the measurements that are currently being used should be used.
The designation of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say for sure, we should not pretend we can, 'he said to the newspaper in Metro.
But John GÃ¶ransson from the Institute for Justice backed the accuracy of tests: 'Generally speaking, the child's inaccurate adulterated adult risks are small.
Perhaps the biggest 10% is in danger of being a little under 18. "

The 20-year old vasser, Anna Maria Orel, did a nice debate on the BBC with her 6.376.birthplace.
The leader was the MM noorium female champion and a happy woman confirmed that she hoped to fight for medals in the future.
The contest went well and gained good experience.
I did my first test (64.80) right away to mine my average performance, the second (62.80), and the third (67.37) I could almost keep it clear, "said Orel after the contest.
I expected my emissions and I am very pleased that I found them.
Anna Maria Oreli MM's discourse ended with a good 18 seats.
Hate les Orelio did not blend because he is training in winter through the LTTE stage.
'I am afraid, 'he said with a little muddle.
At the London Olympics, almost a full House had a population, did they buy people around them or was they able to put themselves off?
I did, but in a positive way.

If you compete, you can experience it.
After all, he confirmed that he would be happy with the MM debate and that he still has many good competitions: 'I came here with the 32nd last result of this season, the last one, I finished over 18.
That is a very good result.
I am 20 years old and Mil - that is the only thing that counts.
I will take on a good experience and, some days, I want to compete on behalf of the medals.
Western Virgina Governor announced party change
The Western-Virginia Democrat Governor, Jim Justice, announced at the gathering of Thursday evening with President Trumpi that he would change political parties.
'Why it or not, the democrats walked away from me, 'The Governor, Justice, said.
"Today, having grazed and admired a lot of... today I say to you, the Western Tyre, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
The assembly was filled with celebrations of joy.
"So I will be Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a lawyer, I would say to you that it is time to play a different game."
Trump had previously committed a major announcement at the West-Virginia gathering.
Trump won in Western Virginia on 42 points and Justice did not support a Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billion rule in the state of Formal State, was elected in 2016.
The Ford notes that it has coal mines in five states and coal trading in quite its own country.
It has a value of approximately USD 1.59 billion.
At the same time, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) published an announcement that 'the Governor, the Justice party change, is yet another blow to the democratic party that would prevent the country from getting better, rather than working for it'.
"Just 15 stars and controls on the lowest number of states in history - the Governor, Justice, 's announcement is just the most recent thing to say to the parks, which are in a hurdle and cannot find a positive and unifying message," said RNC Manik Ronna Ronna Mc's press.
It is hardly surprising that there are many people, there are many injured.

Of course, there are also statements in the past, in abyss and history.
Urmeti said that visitors will come out to the festival with false footwear, and so the problems will come.
The media have also had to assist a few more injured visitors - there have been some scaremongering cases and there has been also one foot in the foot.
We have also made bogs when a man has gone hand or turned a finger.
We are doing fewer nurses here, sending more to hospital.

Coe congratulated the Russians for their fair apologies for the Dushic
The international force rÃ©lite Sebastian Coe praised him for 'Russia's four-day apology' to the Doping scandal, but repeated that this is not the time to allow sport back.
Russia's grind to the athletes Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the athletes' World Cup that a competition ban imposed on his country is right and has a firm objective of combating doping.
She apologised 'to all light-minderers who are stranded at the gold and silver meals.'
Despite his comments, IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban on the contest introduced in November 2015, following the WADA report, which found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today was a very fair answer, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the press.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that Russia itself admitted that they had had had quite difficult times and that they would do everything possible to reorganise the UU."
Coe said she was also pleased that Russia accepted its own forecasting criteria.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the time for Russia to resign," said Coe.
"We must do everything we can in the next few months to bring the situation back to normal.
We have always based on the principle that we want to separate clean sportsmen from the system, "he added.
Ninteen Russian athletes meeting the strict criteria of IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World Cup championships starting in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF Group Rune Andersson said on Monday that Russia is not yet meeting a number of criteria for reconstruction.
After the IAAF Council report, she told journalists in London that doping controls were still insufficient and that the banned mills were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution is making a significant difference to the honey demand.
Who are winners and losers?
Not least that the electric car revolution will make a significant difference from the fuel market to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers on the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that they can win from one place and lose the other, the smaller mining companies will not help.
Today, Glencore is being served by coal and oil, but in the electric car era the cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nicity demand will increase.
This year, in the area of the spread of electric cars, contributions have been taken up by the UK, French and Norwegian Governments, which will in the coming decades allow new cars to be banned.
So Volvo has already knew that it was planning to abandon the combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper 3 electricity vehicles on to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that over two decades, electric cars will be sold more than cars used using oil-generated fuels.
"For some metals it changes everything, Capital Economics" said the raw material analyst Simona Gambranini Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as code and lithium, which have been growing demand for years.
Electric cars have about three times more adverse effects than the normal car, Glencore has announced.
More repudiate is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paris estimates that this will increase demand by around 5% by 2025.
The increase in the demand for electricity cells will mean additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore will be able to generate a growing power-driven car-wing income from sowing and from being the world's largest cobalt producer, predicting Jefferies Group.
This broker company estimates that other electric cars will be winners of Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market reacts to a already changing trend.
This year, the London metal code has gone up by 70%.
The bubble price rises were 37%.
The wheat has also risen to 14% this year, mainly because of economic growth.
As a Glencore excise, London increased 20%, above the price increases to the Rio Tto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo Americas.
On the side of the distributors, lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine are operating, which have to adapt to a new era.
Pole's basic end-use is the supply of levers for cars with a petrol and diesel engine.
Electric cars use lithium cells.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome demand downturn" the Bank of America Merrill Lynchi's MeMeteorological Market analytical leader Michael Widmer.
The brand movement has not yet noticed the impact of the drifting trend.
Cotton has been cut by 17% this year, with it being the best metaphor in London for the price rises in the main industrial metals.
Investors can only see problems on metals in the long term.
"I am not sure that is so bad for lead because cheap oil is keeping the normal cars in competition" said Metarlic Metaller Triland Metalllas, Herwig Schmidt.
If there is a lead crunch, it is slow.
That may happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, stricter gas emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, which are more frequent to trigger engines from developed lead-based batteries, will be assessed by the international lead and the Kuni research organisation.
Lighten metals like aluminium replace steel, because a cheaper car can drive less electricity further.
This explains as early as 2013-2016 the additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes.
It represents 2.7% of the world's total output of aluminium.
That trend is likely to intensify, Widmer said.
The Aluminium has risen to 13% this year, as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel manufacturers do not.
The ak holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnologies to produce miracles.
ArcelorMittal and Strob Europe also seek to develop a lighter meltdown in order to withstand a minimum.
"A very strong message should be the answer to this development," Exane BNP Paribasi analytical: Sylvain Brunet.
Europe has some success.
An end to the oil era could also bring suffering to the plate.
The cost of soil was about half of this precious diesel engine catalysts for cars, says Memosaicist Johnson Matthe.
"Many of the raw materials with high demand today, such as oil and platinum, may not face much demand in the future," said Natixise raw materials analysts Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but they are becoming important within 15 years.
Plaatinatinatatfarmers believe that there is continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars.
The leader of Uncore, Marc Grynberg, said that in 2025 more hybrid cars would continue to be sold.
The great hope of Plainatinatinee manufacturers in the 10-year perspective is for cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motod on a hydrogen element that are dependent on posturing to produce hydrogen electricity.
So far, however, this technology has not yet commercial proved itself.
"On the road to electric cars," the Divas seems to be a clear loser, "said Exane BNP Paribasi from Brunet.
The German car manufacturers suffered a great setback in July, as the Stuttgart Court banned diesel in the city of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football's monetary rules affect the Neymark's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the excesses of European football clubs do not prevent the EEA from entering the record global conversion from the Spanish football clubs to the Paris-Saint Germain in Barcelona.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that governs Europe and has the power to block teams from taking part in the prestige of the Meisters League, are waiting until Paris Saint-GerMay.
The Financial Regulation for a fair game (FFFFFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 will mean that PSG will have to provide some evidence that the Neymark transfer was funded without massive losses.
Barcelona was paid â‚¬222 million ($262 million) alone for buying an Brazilian from his contract, and Neymark's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars per year.
Here there are some Neymar's financial aspects of the transition to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to pay Neyra and put his staple missile in such a way, given that the team is financed by a family dominated by the Katar's Energy unit.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the recruitment of players, but they have to balance it with legal income sources that will enable them to get out to football business.
FFP was first opened up by Michel Platini after he was elected as President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that would be successful in finding a lot of debt would actually be involved in fraud and risk ruin if banks or owners had to give up support.
From 2011, FP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of remaining in clubs.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich first in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a potential club and then carry on with a lot of expenditure to make a team better and create a global brand - will be harder to implement.
FFFP during the current three-year evaluation period, which runs until 2018, can cause clubs up to â‚¬30 million of losses.
And despite the humiliating nature of Platini's office in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander ander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excessive waste.
"FFFP is certainly not dead and we will continue to reinforce these rules," said The associated PC Andrea Traverso, the chief of UEFA-FP ranking.
Although PSG Neymark's buying-up clause will be able to provide a single payment for a single payment, they will be able to allocate this amount to the full extent of the contract's duration.
Neymar signed a five-year agreement, so it will be possible to show the transitional levy over the next five years as a sum of EUR 44.4 million.
In 2014, the first wave of FFP sanctions was accompanied by the most severe penalties, in a quarter of Abu Dhabi, Manchester Cityga.
The PSG was fined â‚¬60 million (at this moment at â‚¬82 million), which was subsequently reduced to â‚¬20 million, and was required to limit the MePolicy Code's team during the 2014-2015 season to 21 players instead of business as usual 25.
UEFA is seeking clubs that can try to rock over regulatory institutions by pouring their income into the club via owners.
The Qatar company may sponsor PSG, but if the sponsorship value is deemed to be above standard market rates, UEFA would not accept it as official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Qatar Tourism Authority's value was blown up.
It has been said that a certain part of the Neymark PSG services could come from Qatar via contributions from the World Cup Board of 20 years.
But PSG and Katar 2022 deny that Neyra could become a world championist and claim that UEFA's regulators could easily reveal such an manoeuvre.
The early sentences against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation on Thursday said that UEFA had not addressed the PSG-Neymark transition proactively.
They spoke with The associated PCongress, provided they are guaranteed their anonymity, because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
Recent reports show that the PSG service will generate more than â‚¬10 million in profits during the 2015-2016 season at around â‚¬542.4 million.
The latest financial year data has not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the Neymark's arrival will have a positive effect on sponsorship transactions, commercialisation and sales marking.
The club is waiting for at least 30% of contract-related sales.
Spain, being clearly irritated by the departure of one of the largest football stars, sought to prevent the Neymark from going, claiming that the PSG is in breach of FP.
'That is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and country ',' President of La liga Tebas told the Spanish newspaper ', indicating that PSG is mainly in Katar.
Arsenal KmÃ¤reper, Arsene Wenger, who belongs to the American sports magnate, shares the attitude of La with the state financing by the club.
"That is the result of ownership rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If a club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the state can have other ways or interests to represent such a major player. "

In fact, the last seven-metre warf through sand, pulling out of it the marine litter and the people-deprived rishing circle: Pumps, swine delinquents and others.
People are still coming on the coast, whether water is poor or not.
If it is nice, people are on the coast, and if not, there are no people, "the Private Company (SPR) 's administration will be used by Alexandr Usov, the Managing Director of the beetle.
The clock is 6.30 and a ball is still in the beach, because eight o'clock must be in people's order.
The job compares already at four o'clock.
Besides Stroom, she is still keeping a check on the village of Pirita, Harku Lake, KakumÃ¤e and Paljasais Pikakr.
Landfill quantities have decreased.
Years ago there were many more.
People can now already assess what is being done for them, 'Usov who has harvested the vessel for 15 years.
Before it was that when something new came up, it was already over the next day.
Now what is in the field is kept.
Price of clean beach
One of the biggest work on Estonia's beaches is to close the wash, or defrog.
For example, in the Pirita coast it has to be transported 400 000 tonnes of coastline.
"That is an incredible amount, it is a sign of Usom.
Another large category is municipal litter, or all that people leave.
One and a half kilometre at the coast of Stroom, there are eight large rubbish seiners that need to be disposed of three times a week.
So much waste arises.
However, the cold summer weather has meant that waste is five fewer than it was.
The third type is deserted things.
Most of these are cargo products.
As a result, Usov has grabbed ten quarters out of the sand.
They will leave owners to wait for a trail-on-board timber route.
"Normally they will come out more, but it is normal harvest," and it is already a discovery that they will soon find them again in the sand.
Children come on to shores and take toys to slide them in.
PrÃ¼m is spread
The management agent Erika Scholler concedes that tractor driving is disrupted by local authorities.
Noise, which runs from night to night to steak, is disrupted by the breeding of the people in the vicinity.
On the day, however, that work is impossible.
One month's head has to be driven twice.
'If we do not, the city will fine us', Mr Scholler will note.
But the aim is, like Pirita, Pikr and Persia, to get Stroomi rand below the international sinin mark.
"There is much more work in Estonia to keep beaches" says Scholler.
We have more segregation and straw and it is more difficult to war.
But there is less rubbish on our beaches than there is in Europe.
When I hear that there is talk of litter on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroom's beside, indiscriminately follows a round of talks between journalist and corroborate workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks.
Hommimint is a sight everywhere in the gallery.
The problem is with birds and pumps who have pulled rubbish bags', Martin reports.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour so far, Martin hopes that the city's government will take action with breaders and, for example, will impose on them a carve blanche to at least stop birds flooding there.
Overall, however, Martin Stroomi's level of development is satisfied.
We can see that the city takes care of it.
Children's sals, enlightened and newly phantom roads have become more pleasant.
It was never the case that it was only possible to go on one way on roll-out, "
Aardemic discovery in Stroomis: Coins, only coins
The morning sword has had to be used by a 40-year-old Dimitr who, as a proxy fuel, hampers a metal-made wheelchair.
He does not believe that he will find anything valuable today or in the future.
Marine gasoly is not sufficiently generous to it.
"I have been working on this year and so far have found nothing worth," Dmitry is announcing.
As a capeach, Dmitry's treasure is a few euro coins, bottles and also a dangerous pound that will subsequently dump in the breadter.
Normally there are coins.
'They, finger and so on are usually not ', says Treasure village.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
Bank of Engant is expected to announce interest rates remain at the same level as weak growth and inflation mitigation have cushioned speculation on the upturn.
Bank of England has warned that growth will remain sluggish, as household-tight incomes have set interest rates on hold.
Bank Financial Policy Board (MPC) policymakers voted in favour of keeping their rates at 6: 2 0.25%, and fewer members will require a rise this month, as slow growth has weakened support for growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank has cut the annual growth forecast to 1.7% in 2017 and 2018 at its 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain, as inflation is still expected to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank signalled that the rate increases are necessary to contain the inflation of the Brex in the next few years and that financial markets could have the necessary rise above the expected borrowing costs.
Members also voted a year ago to partially rewrite the deckant stimulation of the SMP in Brext.
The bank ends in February a fixed-term financing scheme that provides banks with cheap financing, although it said it would now be worth up to GBP 15 billion, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: 'In the MPC central forecast gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future, as the real income situation in households will continue to have an impact on consumption'.
On rates, it was repeated that inflation mitigation would be required 'to make some adjustments to fiscal policy', to some extent ', if markets were expected.
The BÃ¶ge margin is currently predicting the first increase in next year's third quarter and the second in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any anthem was gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
2018's 1.8% growth forecast remained.
After that news, the pound fell the course against the dollar and the euro.
Women fell 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have reduced growing expectations of rising GDP growth in the second quarter from 0.2% to 0.3% in the previous three months.
The bank says that growth is likely to stay at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to gain some momentum.
The Bank's most recent inflation report provided little reason to rejoice inflation and pitiful wage rises to households suffering from the abundance of population, saying that the situation would go a little further.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income from hitting the income in the next few years, but a significant recovery is expected for the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak payout also encourages the economy to increase British production, which partially compensates for lower consumer costs.
The decision comes one year after the rates were reached last August 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years to breathe full life into the prices and the economy.
Before the bank's final decision, there was a growing demand for raising the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on pressed households; in July, three policy-makers were demanding an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell from 2.6% last month, up from 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected to pick up again and again over the coming months.
The bank said that excessive growth compared to 2% was due to a completely weak pound.
The CEO of Coreco mortgage lenckers, Andrew Montlake, said: 'In light of the recent decline in exchange rate courses, the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again, as lenders yearn and hope to complete the year's positive work.
The BÃ¶ge rs seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are about to be completed, because refinancing, often service absorbed and low rate have become increasingly popular. "
NHS is writing a 10 000-strong HIV drug against a contradiction
Since September patients have had access to transformational treatments after a battle had been held in the Supreme Court to assess whether NHS should finance a medicine.
NHS announced that public health services would now make an initial three-year clinical trial available to 10,000 people during an estimated 3-year clinical trial, a pre-rough alert (PrEP) tablet, a tablet that is pre-routed before the recess and has shown a potential risk reduction of around 86% for high-risk people.
The HS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the appeal Court supported last year's Supreme Court ruling that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the Authority's own assertions that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
The Managing Director of NHS England, Simon Stevens, welcomed the release on Thursday as' major new meddling ', while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as' turning moments'.
Irhowing clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpol and Sheffield are among the top to register, and in October there will be further clinics before the programme is introduced throughout England by April 2018.
The pre-HIV infection (PrEP) is a HIV drug tree, which is undertaken before an interim arrangement to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk.
PrEP's introduction prior to the incident means that there are a sufficient number of medicines in the human body that prevent HIV infections.
Such medicines can be taken on a daily basis or at the latest two hours before the recess.
Eligible candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people who are HIV-infected and cannot receive treatment.
Clinical persons identify suitable people who agree to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those with an HIV-related partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clinical trial participating in the programme.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed the Treaty to get medicines this week after international procurement procedures.
The clinical trial aims to assess the actual potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who is destined for treatment and how it is consumed and implemented in a big picture.
Stevens said: 'This new massive interference should complement and leverage a comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of the fight against one of humanity's greatest health problems. "
Deborah gold, NAT CEO, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted correctly at those in need and at risk-class groups, offers an opportunity to transform Britain's HIV epidemic.
Since September, through this clinical attempt, funded by the high-HIV-risk people in England, access to a powerful new tool which is individually managed and is not dependent on dialogue with the partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome that announcement. "
Ian Green, Executive Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is quickly pushed through the country and that no HIV-risk group is excluded.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been obtained, we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of HIV infection.
The public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delay and lectures on government shoes.
Evidence shows how much this medicine can bring to HIV prevention and to stop the spreading of life-changing infection.
This clinical attempt will take us one step further towards fully understanding the PrEP advantages.
It is now important that a clinical attempt is implemented across the country as soon as possible to protect people with HIV exposure and to move us one step closer to halting HIV transmission in society. "
Electricity prices in Estonia increased by 12%, Latvia and Lithuania.
July July, the difference between electricity stock exchange prices between Latvia and Lithuania fell to 1.94 euros, compared to â‚¬7.71 in June this year, Elering announced.
The main reason for the difference in prices is the wealth of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia the average electricity exchange rate last month was â‚¬34.33 per megawatt hour, and the price increased by 12% from June.
In Latvia and Lithuania the price fell by 5% to 36.27 euros per megatt.
In Finland the price was â‚¬34.17 and the Nord half of the electricity exchanges had a cost of â‚¬26.37 per megawatt hour.
Prices rose by 12% and 7% respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, the electricity moved to 75% of the previous month's hours towards Estonia and 16% from Estonia to Finland.
The other nine% of the hours two did not go on to two countries for the following day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity moved from 99% of the time to Latvia and 73% of the hours had the full transmission capacity.
According to the transactions on Nasdaq OMX, the August electricity stock exchange rate could reach approximately â‚¬34 and â‚¬37 per megawatt.
The carbon price of electricity production increased last month, and transactions were at a price of between 5.04 and 5.47 â‚¬per tonne.
Living in higher education - half-hearted designers and clever design devices have made it a little Earls Court cork house
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with passion for a building revaunder, replaced her great Knightsbridge home in 2014 against Earls Courti.
It is in Queen Anne Terrace's first order and that Joanne has not combined his bags and has sold the block on is an honour to a new design.
"Before that, I lived with a former life-partner in Kightsbridge on much stronger soil," said Joanne.
"I expected something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was given that statement by Earls Courti and had similar high levels.
I was wearing that and making a deal on the same day. "
Since the first visit, this 93-square metre corps has passed a full innovation plant.
At the beginning, it was a sleeping cork and a complicated stack: To get a sleeping ball, it had to walk through the kitchen; Joanne wanted to add housing and quasi-order to exploit the high levels.
"I wanted high, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands, 'he said.
She ordered architectural and design diot Duck & shed from Erfan Azadi in hill to exploit 3.8 m of desert and to create a home that would not be just a development site but a place where Joanne could live.
As far as the Treaty was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so architecture was the challenge of creating half-way order where it could stand.
Erfan had to approach the matter in a creative way.
"The Metalbuilding is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to reorganise facilities so that they are on one another without having to sit back.
It was not just about building a platform, but we used a steel structure to ensure that the top and lower space would be right. "
This emphasis enabled Erfano to create in the room two full-blown rooms with a number of dramatic elements.
The half-way will be opened with lighting from the old age to the other glamour housing in the Retrouus window.
The golden furniture, silver details and retrobbornful Serge Serge Mouille light highlight space.
The use of mirrors will play a role in the introduction of theatre, space and lighting.
Both sides of a short corridor have been added to make them more attractive.
In KÃ¶Ã¶g, a mirror gives the second tuna window in the open.
On the move, the reflection will provide a care-side to all Joanne feed-bearing and glass claims.
Life-bearing clothing is accompanied by the possibility of closing vegetables if not used, creating a more fluent space for the image.
The curiously eaten kitchen is nothing new.
However, there is a unique piece of cuisine that it is a grinding shop of art.
"It went a bit towards design," explains the contribution of Erfan in a strengthened spoilt MDF.
"It has a counterweight, which makes it very simple to push it."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage, Joanne now has 16 additional metres, additional sleeping permission and a better flat plan.
"After all, underground surfaces are what you sell - or what gives property value - 'says Erfan.
"The detention land is in an outmoded form and makes calculations on the basis of a beach area."
Here they have managed to increase underground access, using high-quality materials that add luxury status to the premises.
"Materials are what you touched and thus help to create emotional links with your home," says Erfan.
'You are not wearing electricity to pig electricity.
That is important, but it is not a question of mind-root language. "
This shows that good design and increased surface areas are helping to do something quite amazing about the normal corps.
In fact, they can actually cause a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
Allemagant Jensen is the main Arahahamem operating in Chicago, competing with her colleague for a professional reputation.
It is not worth considering the amount of money that is earned, with all ethics in the world.
She and three children only see the man in the early hours and late.
On the first part of the film, I am leaving myself in the idea that it is the 'Kaardihouse' version of the business world - even in Spacey and Gerard Butler's address is similar.
The further film, the less the cells will remain, and the film-maker moralising intention will increasingly appear.
Life-changing experience will mean a key figure in boy cancer.
Now there is a choice between work and family life.
The poet dreaming from the Architect profession makes fathers think in the riots in Chicago about really important things, such as religion, charity, love... without even affecting the twin sectors.
After a third stole where a son opens a eye, there is a feeling that film-makers have certainly been driven to the goal of getting the pump, because even the most priest spectator is unable to hold tears back in the face of the plight of a army cancer sick boy.
If the son falls into the home and his situation seems to be very hopeless, father will ultimately understand the moral morality of his work and will do a charity to an ancient man seeking a job.
Now I am putting a strata on my own - if a film has a happy film, I reward my own discernment after a film coffee, if I am wrong, then one figure could be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that the ice will not be a coffee - when the husband calls a sick person and a man is rushing through a corridor Palace in slow motion.
The baby has instead been breathed and, although his father has just lost his job, it is all very positive because now, after all, there is time to deal with the family.
I can feel well too - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well!
To be honest, film is well designed, all the elements are there.
You can drink, you can laugh, actors are good and morale: Money is not the most important thing in life.
KÃ¼llap brings it into the film well.
The new staff chief of Trup intends to limit the President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps Mr Kelly can actually do that.
In that case, it would be the first.
Politico writes that the new top of the White House's staff will limit the flow of information that President Trumpin reaches, including news, in the hope that it will keep the upper hand in a more balanced balance.
Here the trial is from Josh Dawseyi:
"On his first day of office, when the new chief of the White House, John F. Kelly, met senior officials, he brought forward a key problem President Donald Trumpi White in the UK, which he intends to address the poor information of the disease in the presidential hands.
Kelly said to the officials that information must go through him, either on paper or in meetings, because the President would do better decisions if he was given good information. "
Mr Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried to do so too, and they have failed to track Trup in his media consumption.
President Trumpi's relation to television goes decades and even now that he is in the White House, his television television television broadcaster has not disappeared.
"When the candidate, Trump, was annoyed for the unfair media coverage, he was proved to have been reported in the prestigious exts," said the former campaigner, Sam Nunberg, to Politidge.
Politico tara Palmer wrote at the time that 'six former campaigners said Trumpi to be the key to driving the habit of ensuring that his personal media consumption also stabilously contains praise.'
Well.
But the idea that the habits of using the Trumpi Twitter have ever been 'controlled' is ridiculous.
Perhaps those campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know tÃµhustab me that Trup would have been even more encouraging without their interventions.
We probably never know about the remains that Trump did not.
If he could rescue helpers a couple of times from a scapegoat, their efforts were worth doing that.
But no one has been able to prevent Trup from continually poisoning.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which makes competing clicks, people are trying to promote their own interests, without exception, by sending Truh material that supports their world view but is not always credible.
Politico, the whole story story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to feed to the President with strategic information.
One of the examples of reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Today's and former Trup will say that Trump can react to a negative press, particularly to malicious information, explosive thinking in identifying their source.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone was lucky enough to give the President a copy of the copy to an online provocative, Charles C. The website to Johnson, Gots.Newcom, accusing the staff chief of the staff Prosecutor, Katie Walshi, that he was the 'source of a series of information' in the White House.
It makes no difference that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of mocking or has not offered any concrete evidence or has mischarges in the past and withdrawn them from it.
I read the article and asked the subordinate Walsh. '
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of personnel Reince Priebus and the White House's Head of the Cup Rob Porter "has tried to establish a system for managing and documentation the documents that are ending in Trumpin."
How did it succeed?
Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebt, but Trump will remain impulsive and his assistants will continue to compete for influence.
These irresistible factors make the Kelly mission very difficult.
Street music from abroad will not be allowed to go on display.
In Tallinn City, there is a lot of foreigners muscle.
Those with learning the message have admitted that they are playing in old towns without the permission of the city.
The first was found at the gates of Viru, three street musicians who had taken the same dose with them.
It was clear that rally patrons and chopping musicians were empty chemisers, to whom a dull would take the brunt.
Despite being so, the only woman in the company in the Acordiz was playing a fun tale with lame, while one man, next to her, was playing a gesture in the contests and pulled the furthest.
The third man had stood in his bags alongside them and smoking the hearty brother himself in a ready-prepared ploughing.
Their three chambers prevented themselves from being disturbed by a passing population.
The priest of the Akordium, who had served with the pallet, Bob, said he was kissing on the streets for fun and money.
The explanation's presentation was aimed at collecting the ticket money on a ship travelling to Finland day after night.
In the old town of muscle, they asked for permission for muscle, Noemi and Bob shamed their head.
First of all, we did not know.
Secondly, we will never stand for more than a day or a few in one town and, in most cases, permits will be granted for a month or something like that.
It makes no sense to pay ', explain Bob.
When we went back to Viru's gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the mercy of musicians and are going to go.
The team pulled on to the convicting sights and bags of the Viru centre.
On the Viru streets, three Polish young men were also present, one playing the fence, another chat and the third had even passed the electronic glass curve.
"We are here to give people entertainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living" wrote trio from the Mivosh.
Mivoshi said they were aware that there must be a city government permit to be present.
"Of course we do not have it," he said by joking.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music there is no problem.
Of course, if the police comes, we go elsewhere, but try ', she added.
The Estonian bank purchased EUR 149 million in July as part of the euro area's public asset programme for central banks, the Central Bank's bonds portfolio increased to a total of EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank does not publish detailed information on purchases.
Estonian Governor Hardo Hansson has previously explained in response to the question of the members of the Estonian National Council that the Creasury Plan would include three separate purchasing programmes: Covered bonds from the financial sector (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public debt bonds (PSD).
The Central Bank buys bonds from the market to encourage bonds selling money to invest elsewhere.
The impact of the purchase is lower risk of asset generating and encourages investors to take on greater risks.
Normally, in the framework of the public debt programme, each central bank buys its national government bonds, other countries' bonds are not purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds, the Estonian bank is making so-called "caking" within the allocated capacity.
The PC also deals with central banks in countries with limited purchasing power.
The Estonian bank, confirmed by Hansson, generally buys the European institutions' bonds, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and EIB bonds.
The Estonian bank will buy bonds under the early purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were also obtained, but in June 2016 the Estonian bank would no longer buy bonds.
On behalf of the euro area central banks, both the Estonian Energy Bank and the Finnish Bank of Energy will buy buy buy from June.
Migrants ignore degrees and come back to 'millions of business'
Some West Midlands owners have once again been bulled into fierce confrontation once again with the decisive notions that have ignored the tasked ditch of the county to win back the bag from their cotton.
Migrants have booked 20 of their trailers on the path to a prosperous "line of millions" along the streets of Solihull.
They have returned with horses, children and trucks' wretched armons after they were pulled out of the army in May, without being distracted by the degree tasked with preventing their intervention by the Council.
The activist group found weak positions in the protective limits, turning its vehicles into a non-deterred part of a football factor.
The furious residents have been contacted by Solihull District Council, saying that councillors are 'useless' in addressing the problem.
A anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday evening after their withdrawal from Bentley Heath, where they were stoned by furnitors.
Council must be ashamed to take action, because they are useless to deal with the problem.
Migrants were there in May, they were pushed to go and now they are back.
They came to the end yesterday evening, probably more so today. "
She added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on the strike and I am not happy to continue to have to pay the total tax if the Council cannot even stop this. "
A local resident who also wanted to stay anonymous said: 'That is ridiculous; we have only seen the last of these travellers left the scenes, and a new offensive is already under way.
This time the number has risen and in grassland even the horse is seen in ruins. "
The Solihull Council said: 'We are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the land close to the streetsbrook and we are working with the Solihull police; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
Gathering evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police, calling the figure 101.
This will help to create a factual picture for the Court if we present the case to them. "
The Weekend festival will be visited by, among others, the Minister for Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased that Estonia has been able to bring genuine world excellence.
The question of why Weekend is so important to the protagonists at the festival is answered by Saar that it should be asked from all those who are enjoying the prize's three-day call.
He says, however, that in Persia, real players in his area have arrived.
"Looking at the level of artists that has been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music jargon are brought home - often not in our body ', the Minister of Culture speaks.
Which festival artists, however, are most telling themselves?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person and for old people of me certainly one of the most experienced doctors, Armin van Buuren, who stood up yesterday evening.
She has said that all of us have at some point been beacon ourselves by all ', she says.
But he does raise a number of other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifebi.
Of course, our own Estonian players too: Starting with NOBelder, they can be read through a whole series.
In reality, this famous concentration of names is very high. 'Says,'

Car manufacturers: Up to 850 000 diesel vehicles, amid criticism
The day before the Auti announcement, BMW said that it provides software applications for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to BMW Chairman, companies believe there are "smarter options than driving restrictions" with reference to European cities, including BMW, in Munich, which has been considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that she would renew diesel engines to reduce exhaust emissions to three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe.
No company described these operations as being recalled.
European car manufacturers have been actively promoting diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitting diesel engines is classified as carcinogenic and could cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to neutralise diesel emissions from diesel vehicles will increase, making it difficult to keep cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation, the Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is also accused of harshing the weight of the automobile manufacturers and of ignoring the signs pointing to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid a Volkswagen repeating the mistakes that was silent about the use of so-called haemorrhaging devices, which made it possible to adapt emissions-bearing cars to the regulations when tests were carried out, but which were back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic inquiry.
Last month in Germany, the head of the Audi motor Development Division was arrested former head of the Thermonuclear unit.
The former President, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and can be prosecuted in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was placed in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany, when the authorities accused the introduction of an Audit System to circumvent Europe's emissions performance requirements, thereby extending the investigation, which had previously been concentrated in the United States.
The inclusion of the Auti in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen by the creators of luxury vehicles disproportionately generates a large proportion of Volkswagen's profits.
Estonian schools are acquiring â‚¬20 000 of EU flags.
The Education Ministry intends to buy Estonian schools to hire EU flags by 1 September.
Taken together, the measurements will be 105x158 sentimetres of the European Union's 570 educational institutions.
The flags are foreseen for misappropriations in indoor spaces, which must be carried out in high quality printed devices formations with an hour declaration, will be facilitated by the ERR news portal.
A flag label has the text: 'Kingitus to Estonian School of Estonia for the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The supposed cost of 570 flags is â‚¬20,000 in the education Ministry's price price, with a single tie costing â‚¬35.
Journalist's murder highlights the growing danger in Mexico
Weekly newspaper Riodoce's staff normally gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the State of SSinaloa, sown crime, corrupt officials and continuous drug wars.
But today, under the guise of personal tragedy, they have been gathering their own security discussions.
They are told that it is important to change their haste.
Two parent writers are discussing which seems safer: Whether to bring children to an office that was targeted for a personal attack in 2009 or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words to the top of the space: 'Enemies', 'neutrality', 'allies'.
They ask reporters to provide any water names with proof of the whole, impressions and insights alone.
The government or cartel's pay is suspected of being a black list of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are hazardous to reporting the chaos in Mexico.
Violence is not a pile in the breath and the more the bodies over the country accumulate, the majority of which are reported by journalist victims as members of the Committee for the Protection of journalists, have been since the inauguration of President Enrique Pena 1980s to at least 25: 589 journalists have been killed in a state governed by public protection following attacks and threats, and so far in the course of this year, at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
The latest casualties include their editor and-inspiring source, Javier Valdez Carden, co-founder of Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many reports on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, even though his presence can be felt anywhere in the Salafranca version of Rio's great picture of the average, with a headline Valdez, 'Justice' and two 30ken reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, broadcast T-shirske, depicted as a litany face or a characteristic pool of his limorous prizealy.
The meeting will take place less than two months after her death, and Reporters will discuss a collective trauma, their nightmare, oblivion, paranoia.
Although in 2010, a separate national prosecution service was set up to address the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on Political Defence, only two cases have been brought to justice.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders, the number of which reaches thousands, the journalist killers rarely reach justice.
Riodoce's editorial continues to reflect violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without murderers' data and justice, security is not very helpful, as Ibarra said.
"It is very nice to waste our time here in the meeting," he says.
"As long as the reason is not known, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left in Culiacan, in the capital of the State of Lahti, on the morning of 15 May.
She managed to drive only a few quarters before two men arrested red Toyota Corolla; she was forced to leave a car and was shot 12 times because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated into the 'twelve-teenth river'.
An armed man drove the Valdez car and made an accident close to it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left her with her wife and two adults.
The images are circulating freely in Culiacan.
But on Valdez there is basically only a silence.
Since the Guzman was arrested last year and the US issued in January, the Blue authorisation has been one of the country's most bloody battlefields, because rivalries are fighting to fill a power vacuum.
It is no difference that in the streets of Sinaloa, a few people are suddenly being shot daily or even several people are suddenly being expelled, or the dead are grossly being glossed over the double-snatched matode drug briegays, which are bigger than many homes.
Let us not forget for a moment that the peace period indicates that valuable ports and drug routes to the United States are led by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the risks of his work, Riodoce is feeling, as co-founder and chairman Ismail Bojorquez (60), a huge compunction that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that murder was favoured by two errors.
The first was to publish an interview with Guzman's son on a competitive and warring cartel clique with Damaso Lopez in February.
This piece of mail could also be labelled by suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived in newspaper carcasses.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after a crackdown took place in another newspaper news story.
Valdez legalised himself in Mexico and abroad and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
She had been alive for so long that her friends and colleagues had expected her to exist forever.
She worked as a veterreporter in 2003 at the Noroeste newspaper, when she joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling USD 50.
Bojorquez said that 'it was impossible to deal with the press without drug problems'.
The newspaper was collecting a period of time with its bold and fair coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
The reporters liked to have forceful studies without having to be censored and heard in a sounding print, which they could read stories that no one else could dare to report.
Eight years after Riodoce was established, the newspaper won a prestigious award for Latin American performances, Maria Moors Cabot.
In the same year Valdez, the Committee for the Defence of journalists (AKK) won the International Prize for Freedom of the Press for their courage to follow the Mexican drug addicts wherever it leads.
She openly admitted she was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said by adopting the AKK prize.
Last October, he said in an interview with the television channel Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Shaspace.
"Our head is to accept the role that the journalist's office has in another way to play.
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not talk about what is happening. "
Riodoce collektiiv strives a Valdez, a joyman who rowed like madness, a friend who generously bore embatings and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported him in his haste.
She always wearing her hat.
He went from the office to El Guatemeiyabo bar and was always sitting in the same desk.
They now ask whether her routine love was fatal for him.
His death has also left them to question how best to do their work and stay in life.
"They do not like to see how rigiddled their women, their children, their legitimate business, are with their secret landing plates used for drug transport."
'These things should not have been touched 'said by Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best time, strong self-censorship and self-respect.
Entrenched their instinteries.
When it comes to the scapegoat, the hotel is out.
Andres Villarreal, the editor of Riodoce, said the problem is that 'odour can be cheated... and so it was a case of Javier'.
He and others say that Sinaloas no longer applies the old rules, just as they do not apply to the 1985, Veracruce, Guerreiro or other states that are home to the toxic combination of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a space where Riodoce workers were gathered for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted; a few days before, it was revealed that only a buttress sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Front in front of the House two police cook sticks to a 40-degree month bullet.
The government has ordered them to elect the Riodoce office, which is based in the four floor building in the Culiacan central class neighbourhood.
Some reporters were quanocerning whether these police officers were among the 50% policemen whose governors themselves have been discredited as unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have moved to mountain areas where controls are de facto drug gangs.
Riodoce's announcement this week covered three key levers.
One of them was former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez venna murder in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had an uncovered story of spending government money on the Governor's home town.
And the Culiacan kidnapping group of people from one of the most expensive restaurants, which is located away from the Prosecutor's office, which is from the quarter.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution had to be exercised when it was time to write what everyone in the town knows about Danoran is a liked place for both drug traffickers and the authorities.
The film was revealed in public documents that restaurants are registered with the names of a politician in power in the Institutional Revolutionary Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all policy levels almost throughout the previous century.
Recently, several IRP Governor have been accused of widespread coverage of cases of corruption.
The Villarline has asked the reporter to write previous incidents in the same place, including how the name El Chapman's son, Guzman, was escaped from military broadcasting.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have sought Valdez's coca to get information on kidnapping from the best sources.
"In the past we would have known what happened," said 46-year-old village where body building had served to give it a slogan called El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels have broken our sources."
The Valdez office has become the space for labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and editorial workers have become something they could never expect in the name of the activists' press.
Next morning the Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few bridges and went to a local Public Prosecutor's office to protest for another journalist.
Salvador Akah disappeared in the western Michoacan State three days after Valdez was murdered.
The body has been burnt down and, according to officials, it is in DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more audible and are crippled as organised protests to scorn roads and buildings the phrase 'SOS press'.
On that day, President Bojorquez will be in Washington trying to gather international support for justice in Valdez's case.
The day after the death of Valdez in a meeting with the Sinaloa Governor, the Ramirez authorities accused journalists of spying and killing them for truth.
After that, he asked him to shift government from being mirrored to other, concerned that hatred has affected objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were 'in step with organised crime, complicit in national officials and a half-hearted society'.
In his latest 'Drug press' report, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs but are also carried out at the hands of policymakers and security forces who are in an organised crime treasure.
The Media Monitoring Group Articulo 19 issued over half last year's attacks on the police and civil servants.
"In Mexico, you want to keep quiet," said Ramirez.
Murder is clearly verafadoid.
Nobody will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipasis six years ago.
She was found dead with a letter she had probably signed in cartel los Zetas: 'I am here for my reports'.
His mapped beside his guns was blending computer glass and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahuahua after their correspondent LefranÃ§ois slava Breach was killed in March.
Others will continue to do as the El Manana de Nuevo Laredo newspaper did after their President's murder in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a headline 'What do you want us?'.
Some journalists have fled from home states, or even from the state.
It is a nerve decision.
It is difficult to find work in the wrong zone and they still have to grab the streets in order to avoid risks.
And sometimes they are driven, as probably happened in the photograph Ruben Espinosa, murdered in 2015 with four women in one of the Mexican apartment three months after she was fleeing from Veracruzon.
Those who remain in place and continue to work have to refute risky decisions on a daily basis.
The Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that reporting drug trafficking intimidates her.
"Mexico is on the road to hell and that is why I will report," said.
On a recent midnight of Friday, when the latest figure had already been sounded, Riodoce editors sat on the way to office and beer the batteries, suddenly starting to telephone on all phones.
In the Randinatial Great town of Mazatlani 19 people had died in fire-fighting campaigns between rival gangs and security forces.
The war was still suspended, as were a number of messages from the area's cartels.
On the same line, reporters uploaded the websites using a mobile phone at Riodoce.
Next day's front required change.
The Hutu mite was further arresting in the region.
Bojorquez piilÃ© towards guard police officers to see whether they are vigilant.
When they were afraid, they did not at least demonstrate it.
A founder who has fallen into his shoes under a massive book, where his average finger is to be seen in all Sinaloia, was taken on his copy by the workers in Riodoce.
'How can one think of closing at all ',' said Bojorquez, 'whereas on the same day Javier died, the apprentice asked me to send him to report on the streets?'
Dinosaur used a defence colour to avoid enemies
At first glance, it seems like a form, albeit rather scary.
Scientists have now revealed the first findings concerning the unbelievable wave size found in a Canadian minable mine, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as' a Lisa Mona added '.
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to recognise that the leather covered by his soybean was a red-Brown colour and had had a somewhat 'complicated' past.
The report published in the Journal 'Horizon Biology' described usurping the term 'the best preserved soomhupeom resource that has ever been found' and the 'one of the best dinosaur characteristics worldwide'.
Fossil is a new type of nodosaic that lived in the middle of a storm, between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good storage in raison was awarded to researchers who describe it as' truly remarkable '.
This vegetarian hero covered by soya is the best preserved in the National Geographic phosphate of this type ever found.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk found it when he extracted the Ã˜ceor Millenium mine in Fort McMurray in North Albertas in Canada.
She hit something that did not recall the surrounding stone and decided to look more closely.
The discovered phosphorus was accompanied by Royal Tyrrell's paleonate museum.
The next six years were designed to expel the animal from 2 500 women (1 100 km).
After all this tremendous effort, the end result is now finally ready to bring to the public.
"If you bent a little eyes, you can almost believe she is sleeping, 'said the leading author Caleb Brown, theatre Royal Trelli in a museum where presence is being played out.
"This will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurbias - dinosaurs Mona Lisana."
He found in a skint that the vegetation worker, while covered by soybean beach tanks, was likely to be significantly threatened by meat feed dink.
This high-volume dindinosaur used red and white forms of protection to burn himself against predators and applied shadows techniques, which are called 'naming' and are also used by many modern animals.
It allowed dinosaur to better cross into the neighbourhood and to avoid enemies, as major dinosaur pressure probably found him to be hunt.
This figure of 110 million nodosaic families, which is now in the news for the first time, is now available in the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The dairies have now investigated and given that name to Borealopelta Marmitlor's museum, mark Mitchell, a famous team that spent over 7 000 hours to uncover a demanding animal.
Thanks to the astonishing good preservation of the father, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of brain supplements.
They discovered a retreat - a protective method in animal states, which means that the superiority was the dark party.
Although the buck is widespread, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than today's unsacrosanct animals.
It suggests that dinosaur hunting was sufficiently actively motivated by other meat feed dinosaurs that evolution was preferable to overshadowing the failure of the survival tactical against confrontation.
But most of the animals who use today's remittances - such as fears, skins or bars - are much smaller and more vulnerable to harvests, which indicate that nodosaurus had to struggle to survive.
"A strong cooling of the dinosaur virus, covered by massive and high levels of soya, shows how dangerous the wheels could have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of Soomers' organic compounds also revealed that dinosaur skin was a red screen.
Scientists will continue to explore to get indications about this life, including the content that remains in this warm form, in order to find out what an animal would be the last to history.
They believe that dinosaur pressure fell into dead rivers, thus reaching the sea with a stream of wrestling in the ocean.
At that time, Albertas was the same soya as is now the case in South Floriquan, rivers and oceans are likely to reach far beyond inland land.
"This nodosainity is truly remarkable as it is fully covered by soomy skin, while it has remained in three dimensions, preserving its original form," Brown said.
"As a result, today the animal finds itself practically the same as in the underage.
To reconstruct it, there is not much to be imaginative: It is enough simply to preach our eyes and it seems to be like a sleep. "
The time for the crisis was when enormous red-foot meal infections - terogeneous butchers - stunted.
Although their King, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, it could be hunted by some of his formidable predecessors.
These include Acrocanthocontamination, 38 feet (11.5 metres) in a long and six tonnes of chat.
Scientists whose recent findings are published in the current Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta was sunk after death in the sea and that mutation was multiplied.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk discovered tenacity when he mined the Millenium mine in the region of Fort McMurray in Northern Albertas in Canada.
The museum says it is best preserved in the world, including skin and soya, and is complete in the form of a causom up to the bottle.
These inputs were on average 18 feet (five metres) long and rope up to GBP 3 000 (1300 kg).
It was passed on by two 20 customs ora.
Scientists believe that this breadcrumbed vegetation plant fitted through the present Western Canada until the flooded river was swamped into the open sea.
But the sequestration site at sea helped to preserve its measurements excellently.
The coal residues of this particular father are so well preserved that the mythical waffomerang of soy storage remains covered by skin residues.
As Michael Greshko magazine National Geographic wrote, 'this survival is just as rare as a lotovictory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The wave-in parts will continue to cover the creation of yellow-based mythological soomers.
Better first wear next to him and five assets are sited upwards.
I can read the commitments she has on her own. "
How did one activist get an answer to the question 'whose streets?'
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a total shock.
Just days after New York travel, it was published on a towing from Louisi's inhabitants, Airbb, on a doorstep line, in Srings, Facebook.
She got on to her former school fellow Member's post.
It read: 'The police killed a very 18-year-old youth and still hosts the streets.'
He was confused as to why nobody else had posted this information on his bed, which led to him closing Facebook and opening Twitter.
The Pidemega @ TheePharoah users' postal services were repeatedly transmitted in line with his line of time.
The KrÃ¤ppar from the Louan region provided real-time sÃ¤da Michael Brown, a 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Fergusonis Missouris.
He posted a picture of the Brown's habitual site that was circulating on the streets, remaining there for four hours.
"That is crazy," thinking of Mrs Ferrell's.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
She cut off her phone, but later this evening saw the rest again, which this time announced people were gathering in Canfield in Drive.
Jagon photographed of police and potato people and a man who claimed to be in the hands of Brown's father and kept a label 'The Ferguson police killed just my unarmed boy!'
He looked live in a bed where the police officer stood in front of the grave protest group.
In the second video, another police officer, he said he was paste and shellfish: 'I killing you all... animals'.
Ferrell is a reminder of how she was looking at the thought: 'That is unusual.'
"This is not a murder of this kind with which we are accustomed and could call a typical."
I felt atrocities at that time.
I was angry and I was complaining. '
She booked a return flight and next day she went home.
Having sworn at 23 o'clock, he left her father with his six-year-old daughter and decided to travel to Ferguson next morning.
What happened to Ferrelli and Fergusonel over the next three years is a key issue in the new document entitled "Whose street Exchange?" (Whose streets are on 11 August).
It is a story of survival and protest, love and defeat, strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who have fulfilled the streets by demanding replies.
When a ball, with a tyrant - who had a flower tag and a good kroon with it - walked out of Ferguson again, they spoke about a subject that they had repeatedly heard before this morning - the experience and living conditions of black people.
'Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights? 'He is recalling to ask himself?
"We are currently travelling to Ferguson because the police killed 18-year-old boys and that is not right."
"I could not take him along," said Ferrell later.
"What is happening now is... past culmination.
It must know and see that and grow in the middle.
She must learn about activist and organisation, but also feel different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we must do to become free and free.
Even if I can bring him up so that he does not experience personally blatant racism, he does not differ from another black girl.
I feel I would do him a disservice if I defended him against the world. "
The first suspension they made in the Ferguson was on the South Florissant - from a police station to a place of crossing the way, which had become a sort of camp plague where activists were waiting for news about the police officer Darren Wilson, who was not even charged at the end.
There, the Ferrell and her daughter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared South-Landers.
They put food bags together and helped them to spread them to protesters.
Ferrelli slowly took the form of a new type of activist.
"My activist changed completely after 9 August," he said, 'When he was Missouri-St. Louisi at the University, he was a student of a minority Association of Education students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in the non-performing communities.
"I had no organised experience.
That is all a flat. "
After weeks, during a spiritual demonstration, Mrs Ferrell met a film co-chair Sabaah Folayani.
The prize was said by him and the film operator, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted simply to document what is going on.
The Ferrelli question arose: 'Are you trying to document what is going on or do you try to find a story that can be exploited?'
Such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to profit from its efficacy and resilience.
The prize was explained in a recent interview: 'We had heard that the voices of the people born and born in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do so in a different way'.
The prize had already beaten hands with co-feed Damon Davin, the region's art, known for a activist in relation to the sentence of death sentence.
His involvement made the project heated by Ferrelli and another six for the local communities that were followed years after the Brown shooting.
"No one in this documentary film talks for us or for us, but we speak to ourselves, 'said Davis.
"It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because I am portrayed as being as such."
Although the aim was not to focus on the Ferrelli's experience - it was to show that the movement was not about 'head of salvation but about community collusion', as the Folayman said, made it the most open film.
As a result, 'Whose street' documents' surprising personal aspects of the Ferrelli's life, such as mercy and marry with her wife.
"I felt I was wrong," said Ferrell, naming the first time he was ready to work a town.
"But I realised that doing this work and humantising black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
Moreover, the Ferrelli story highlights and puts the role of black homosexual women in the wider Black Alliance movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who thought in the social media in 2012 of the black teenager Trayvon Martin's hashtags # BlackLivesMatter are gay.
"Women of black age in leadership have kept movement across the board," said Ferrell, "and that is because we have to fight on many fronts all the time.
Mustanac homosexual women must bear all this burden. "
The photo accepted, noting that 'The Movement is indeed kept in life by black women and many of them are black gay women'.
He says, however, 'This is not a kind of equal opportunity' - the Ferrelli was not chosen as the focus of a film because of his identity.
'he was a man who used to drive the right energy '.
"However, it is no coincidence that he is right on the frontline because there is a lot at stake as a black homosexual woman living in such novels.
Her energy can be perceived through the screen. "
At the same time, news cameras from Fergusonel have been lost a long time ago, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The suspended suspended sentence imposed on Mr. Ferrell during the course of the repression against road blocking will last another 2.5 years.
She describes the social policy climate in the area she calls home simply as' a huge threat to freedom '.
Nevertheless, she still attaches great importance to the mantra she has eaten since the memory began to the streets of Fergusoni only three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "

Ms Northwesterni professor and Oxford University worker are sought as suspects in murder
According to the police, professors from the University of Northwestern and a Oxford University are sought nationalized by a sorcerer who has become suspects of a death-free cruelty for a man's population, from a single chicago luxury corps.
According to the Cook District judicial documents, on Monday, an arrest warrant of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathemi and 56 years of Andrew Warreni were awarded on account of their alleged performance in Trenton H. Cornell-Durleu's death by the prizeation.
According to documents, a 26-year-old Cornell-Duranu died after repeated havocabling.
The warning that Chicago police station issued to the community found the dead on 27 July.
Police officers received telephone calls and found a victim on arrival of the Grand Plaza Korterrand, whose body had several pipe-type programmes.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranu was recognised as dead on the site and researchers treat seating as murder, while the police actively seek two suspects.
Lawit has been working as co-professor at Northwestern University of micro-Biology and Immunology since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for Public relations, said in a statement sent as e-publishing that Lahad now been removed from employment temporarily and that he had to be prevented from entering the town of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal act being investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University will work with the investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior assistant at Oxford University.
A representative from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: 'We have been in touch with the British Police and ready to assist US research authorities in any way possible'.
Moreover, the statement stated that Warreni colleagues were shocked and wish to extradite themselves.
Anthony Guglielm, Head of the Police Department of Chicago's Communication Department, urges the authorities to give in to the authorities on suspicion.
"The police have an idea where they are present but we are increasingly busy in defining precise location," said Guglielm.
Guglielm said it would help to seek suspects both by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielm said that the police received a telephone call from the Grand Plaza corps cript, who had just received chryptic rain that something had happened in flats N N 1008.
According to police reports, it was a magic spectacle.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself was on 27 July.
He said that camera would confirm the stay of Lathemi and Warreni.
"We believe that Professor Lathamil and victim had a relationship," added Guglielm.
The management of the Grand Plaza sent a letter to the inhabitants: 'The police are currently working to identify the scene of events and the victim's background and are examining various motives, including the possibility of a family dispute.'
Start-ups that will help your company to avoid the next UV
Mr Errett wanted to measure his e-commerce start-up company's satisfaction with workers, but the poll was futile.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some workers distrusted the process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who is leading an e-commerce company with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called non-actors to the aid.
New types of human resources are being started up to help companies find out what their workers feel.
By developing and licensing software that aims to measure employee involvement, they enable companies to commit cells, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide staff anonymity and a bull for complaints and, in some cases, allow empeers to bypass the level C managers and address directly the Bureau.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health but where is Fitres for your company?" Said Jim Barnet, co-founder and CEO Poliwood City at the Glint, which software analytical tools use to measure employee participation.
In the three years she has used Glinti, the Erretti report says she has got a much better overview of what her workers thought and feel.
In addition to app studies and dedicated consultations for certain teams, it provides a company's thermal card which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support, allowing them to identify the reasons.
Companies have begun to realise that they need to keep to their working culture so as not to become the next Ublishside that has been riots since a former employee published blog surgery describing a harassing environment in which those who dared to speak were penalised.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and conformity can be respectively accompanied by financial Caspary statistics on the Let's speak Payments website worth over USD 118.7 billion by 2020.
Denveris Colorado's firm's equivalent, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, has seen an interest and an increase in activity in the face of Uber's dubious reputation this year.
Convercentil has almost 600 customers, including Airbus, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a client.
Like Glintki, objective enterprises will be able to send adapted incentives to embassies, gather in real time confidential answers and look at problem areas in the heat cards.
It also provides an anonymous mesh-type model enabling workers to report unsuitable behaviour.
And where the executive manager is concerned, complaints go directly to the Bureau.
"Public opinion is entrusted to regulatory authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company was found to treat its workers ill or act unethically, companies could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, workers leaving and court cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, restaurant eu, which has more than 25,000 employees in 500 sites, has used the Convergence centi for over a year to ensure workers know about rules and procedures and to provide an easy way of communicating with the Corporate headquarters.
If an employee had to report a problem earlier, he had to find a corporation's hotline or email address, then to make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, Ruby Ruby Tuesday's General Adviser James Vitrano, who said he was not well advised to monitor workers' complaints.
Now that a company uses the Convercensor, however, there are problems, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices, which did not previously end up with managers who were operating in other cities or offices in states, to identify and engage more quickly.
"I can get closer to a holist 360 degree experience of workers," said Vitrano, who will head Ruby the South-East Risk Management Group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers."
Quinlan said that companies had to take ethical conduct, values and worker involvement much more seriously in 2002, that is to say, after the audit company Arthur Andersen failed in the face of ethical irregularities in the Enron scandal.
But only when 'social media became coon-ahead' did businesses realise that they could not prevent their black washing from openly online.
"Before technology is used to monitor ethical behaviour, people used to use technology as a strategy hope," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as services, taking a periodic charge from companies for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been able to rely on both start-ups.
The Convert was funded in February by USD 10 million in companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Capital, thus raising the value of the capital collected at USD 47 million.
Glinti invested USD 10 million in November in Bessemer Venture partners, increasing the company's total funding to USD 60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise if we consider the interconnectedness between businesses, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that modern workers are waiting for more than ever.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely stakes on the table.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be entrepreneurs, feel they are heard and the work they do is reassuring, they are more committed to ensuring business success," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President LinkedInis, of the Labour Government, which uses both convergence and Glinti.
Investors will earn income if companies in their portfolios do well; companies will do well to have employees committed and involved.
If analytical tools from the third party allow workers to be more committed and involved, it is no wonder that they will find support.
Data collection on employee participation is important, as experts in professional culture have said.
But this data is useless if the company's supervisors do not start doing anything with them.
In fact, if a company asks its employees for feedback, it can generate expectations that it will be changing.
And if changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all, this could cause disappointment and reduce worker involvement.
"When you ask about 4000 proposals, you need to be ready for 4 000 conversations," said Kotter International, President of Consultative and Business Administration, Russell Raath, who has seen companies fail to rely too much on data collection.
'because if things are not brought to the end, the workers think 'You actually listened to me?
Do you care?
And if you do not care, why should I care? '
In the Erretti's words, Madison Reeel, who is now carrying out six studies among the workers, has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glinti.
And after receiving feedback from workers frustrated by the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, it was able to reorganise several company crews and provide communication training to address the problems.
Ruby ures are collected, however, for employees, and it is hoped that in the long term, this will lead to workers' longer-term commitment to an industry known for the high labour turnover of its own workforce.
"If you are not committed to transparency, you lose people," said Vitrano.
'and if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses. '
Euro area shining Star: Income growth rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade concerns with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic, three Baltic States are rapidly approaching Western European rich countries' income, Bloomberg is writing a European Central Bank report.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999 total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
The success is underindebted, fast-off institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic States in one of the few euro area countries with a high-GDP per capita, have significantly closer to the EU average."
Although the objective is for total economic output per capita to be equal to Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2 / 3 of the 15 national average, which was part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led to Balots seeking better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees Bali as a positive light and the economy is growing this year, local people are not at all enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies would be very or rather well off.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it was slightly less than half the respondents who thought about their economies.
NCAA's decision to cancel two times a day trends change Brumes over a long term!
It is almost 23 o'clock if trocyond konventsiooniga football fails to stand on display at the end of a new school-based training display at the University of a team.
Some of them have tightened their jigsaw by revealing their treasuries' rubber stamp on the first day of the FDP.
For a large proportion of the team, these Christmas minutes provide a paint from midday.
Participating participants in courses will go back to study after three hours of collective marriage, before returning to 6.30 meetings in Wevman's football.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," said Bruinsi treer Jim Mora a a a little before Monday became Tuesday.
NCAA's decision to cancel biennial trends to reduce the burden of players has in fact led to longer days, at least until the end of the day, to one side on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA was the first to start training at 19.15 to fit into the already intensive timeline for players.
Moving from two to two training days a day means more trendy days - the start of the Bruinsi training camp was increased in the order of almost a week, and for the first time in the Mora's six-tonne season, training takes place at the summer courses.
They will have an 18 trenches agenda until 20 August, before formal preparations begin for the September opening game against Texas A & D.
Mora said she was in favour of the amendment of the USSR, although it adds another item to the tight agenda of players.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days, and that is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they break themselves through this challenge; they are struggling, they are wonderful young people.
I believe that when we come Saturday and have more time, it is really a bit of a bit. "
Once the camp has been closed, UCLA training will be closed, which is no easy task given a clear view of their nearby base and remotely located Luskin centre, a higher class hotel that has already been discharged from the portal around the gate with the portal, with a football patch.
Since this weekend, hotels are occupied by the Bruys players, but Mora admitted that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco.
'We apply security measures', 'said Mora.
"That is a real concern and it is not exaggerate to think that people can rent and train from there.
If you have a record on a training, it can do a pretty good deal.
But we are going to deploy a security team there and on board 8.
We do our best by using our existing ones.
I will try not to be very concerned about that.
We have the plan in place. '
To pay the Prix-born Confederation of Savisaare-Ivanova, the Lib-Ivanova electoral alliance, the converted from the reformist party, to Ms Kristiina Ojuland and the ECB to the occupied authorities of Maria Kaljers, the founding businessmen's electoral federation of Tallinn, seems to be to have at least the same level as the local elections as the parties that have been set up this year by the party.
However, buses are counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether enough frustrated voters are available for all of them.
Who will remain with Sajohy?
If the Edgar Savisaare reduced to a assistant, it can anticipate events organised to honour her electoral union.
One Member of the Council, some former and present members of the centre and many unknown faces - will that be the composition of the electoral union?
And can any reason why a few Savisaare standing in the town of Tallinn circumvented by willing and sister sufferers be looked at by the 'Savisaare list' of exploitative actors, led by corruption and corruption suspects, becoming a reality?
On the town's roofs of the municipality, a film-based music fever to the Russian plague involving the parent of the town of LasnamÃ¤e; and in every sense a primitive computer game where the Prime Minister, JÃ¼ri Rata, must rablef avoid endless and oraceur in the course of his drive - is that way the EPP seeks, for the first time, the votes of the authorized 16th and 17th year-old voters who are to be elected by the ballot bog?
We look forward to other parties reflecting on the youth campaign.
If a viewer from Canal 2 or TV3 looks against a black square rather than August's entertainment, two options will remain: To accept that in future, only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV and Francefranchise media will be able to donate in a 10-month period of time or surround a TV operator.
There are probably also those who initially rejoice in advertising television experience, but eventually, albeit reluctant, they will pay for television and advertisements.
According music, a disgusting people and the rubbish left on the streets are almost every major musical ploy.
If you do not want to play part in the seas, it is worth visiting the homeland rather than getting a grip at home - and leaving the place of sleeping for the lungs' money at the festivals.
Washington changes green card rules
Media publications are cited by President Donald Trup, who said that a new US immigration plan is planned, which changes the Green Card rules.
The plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year for 50 000 people, stricter rules on temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republics and the President supports them.
The draft law will go to Congress in two chambers.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, because it will change the way that US citizens can be given green cards.
The law will reduce aheler migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process gives priority to candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, according to US media publications.
Siberian seto young people move to the town, pensioners return to the land.
Yevseyev Anat. continues to have the proverb of the former Maana basin of gold miners.
She works 140 kilometres from home, a Maana tributory leap along the Silz gold station as an driver of the car.
It is tough work: Two months without rest days, 12 hours' work and then only ten days' work at home and again.
In the three years of Artel work, Anatoli has only ever seen gold.
'There is a hard procedure there: Going in in in depth, checking that the viral does not lead to, and turning out to be out ', Anatoli speaks.
In the village of Haida, Mare Piho will speak local seto Jaani, who has spoken to him a great deal about the memory of his family in Siberia.
The still benign archaic culture of Swine will also affect home-pigs, as it is simply so shocking, the most advanced ventures will be Piho Mare in the most comprehensive position.
His first investigation visit to Siberia will be 30 years later this year.
During that time he has been there 14 times and has lived there for one year.
How many were still expelled to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the start of the 20th century to land here?
That is an unresolved issue.
I would argue that 8 000.
I took note of that in the words of the Siberian seto men who have themselves thought about it.
It is hard to say exactly that, because at that time up to 30 people could come in a group, but the passport was given only to a man.
The passport was given only one, but it was children, nurses and suchlike.
Look at how vast this territory was here!
It was many times larger than historical Setomaa.
After all, it was needed to educate, manage in some way.
Greetings came here as peasants, but their life change, because here they arrived in areas that were not only related to agriculture but also to the river (palpable parking), gold mines, industry.
For instance, in New-Petseri, many pigs went into work later in a classified town Krasnojarsk-45 (where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.), when it was formed.
Did pigs represent a majority of the population in the region at the time?
Yes, they were playing in a bit.
Moreover, a long tradition kept married and had a lot of children.
Seven to eight children in family were normal.
How much does Siberian Setode differ and different from mother country to pig?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same.
They brought a lot of popular ideas.
They did so themselves (popular ideas), but they always made a difference that had been brought about and what had been done here.
Climate change has had a major impact on setosis's traditional clothing, because here it is cold.
The tables changed.
For example, in Setomaal meat, meat was sown, but it was simply frozen here.
Where are Siberian setode villages and what life life life there lives? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The link with mother country was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that it is now starting to give Setumaa back to it, they will be affected.
Those girls who have lived in families have listened to astounding stories.
Piho is thinking of the Estonian setode delegation, who came to Haida's Royal day at the beginning of July and lived four days in homes - J. P.
What is here is shocking.
"It is extremely easy to come and go away as well, because the city has a wonderful location: Railway hubs and roads at the crossing point," says from Tapalt operisolist to Reigo Tamm.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and culture, and a pound gets on every side.
Tapa is top-throp!
Along the River River Two through the coast, there is a small island where the Tamil hails are used to keep crings.
'There is no such beauty as a train window ', mules Reigo.
Those who are not afraid of cold water will be swallowed into the river because the river is full of sources.
I have been there to flood, I can manage!
On river water, a long-distance and simply a romantic can do so - the river flows can look at it and think in advance and behind life.
I too have been walking there with my breeders.
She has, apart from anything else, been a river racing between her three bridges in her brain: 'That place is in the town, nobody can come into the same struggle if their stories are cold'.
"The carrot is a wonderful sight for Tapa, but there are also health patients who can run, farm virgin and now, for example, discgolf f courses - golf courses have been done, labels can lend to sports", is governed by Reigo.
Old profiteers are, of course, going there with their own caesword, but I have not yet got to play there.
Obviously, my colleague, Rasmus Kull, must be invited to Tapale because she has experienced distilleries and has a chain.
Perhaps she lends me!
Reigo and MÃ¤nnig were indivisible during the current operino period of childhood.
At least for hundreds of hours.
There are many tears, disappointments and you can count on that mountain in my sporting life.
Let alone broken rose and smells.
"The city as a whole is currently full of construction work, all of it becomes unknown," Reigo praises.
The old and tired building of Tapa, however, is a very attractive place where bathing discoveries are played.
I am pleased that in 2012, R.A.A.M's leader, note in Meos, adopted my idea and had to make a textbook with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season 'Aleksei Karenin' has just passed, on 11 August, the railway station is undergoing a 'Ellucinisation', while in an ancient literary building, it is moving around in the 1980s.
"11-13 August is the day in which Tapa City has not only encouraged open-ended housing locks but also cultured cultural events, including in the form of a popular monastery," Reigo, who is calling for a visit to a city of 9 years in nose days.
In the small yellow farm of 1 May on pumps, museums are already 1994.
'The house is small, but the misstatements are vast and vast ', Reigo is praised for a place full of the history of the Tapa town, most of which focuses on the railway and military.
Reigo mubr is that if you go through all recommended sites, the summer will go a long way from being empty, but fortunately the small town is full of coffee.
"We have such good eating places and when you sit in coffee, sometimes you get the feeling that you are abroad."
Well trained and young Tapale soldiers spend a lot of time in pubs, a tidal tunnel where they sit there is a gigantic feeling that you are in Estonia and your home town, but there is a world community of such things together.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we are going a lot!
In Greece two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tendering
Television broadcasting quoted a foreign Ministry telling us that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tending.
On the morning of 1 August, the police arrested a group of illegally ordered people, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but an investigation is taking place.
The Foreign Ministry told the TV channel that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have stepped up free-phone restrictions and are already imposing tough fines on anyone who is caught in a holiday place that is not intended for doing so.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry says that the court may impose fines.
The arbiers teach the wolf to burn sheep.
The Greek farmers have to give the wolves their herds' lessons again after a year's break - apparently the pump-grappers have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, lamb in the idiot region have been burnt down three times, 23 sheep and eight injured, the Hiiu site writes.
The figure was only three, years before 124.
In the synthesis of Murvines, the Environment Agency's data is also that the soil in the Hik land was not pawashers and the butterfly button was informed that two wolf detergents had been fixed this year on the island.
On Monday night, the junta broke the Emvest Kenny village from 15 sheep and injured 18 of the survivors.
In the morning of the morning of the morning, the wolf broke the Reheselja village's grazing in the country of one sheep and badly injured you who had to be subjected to an emergency killing.
Rules on GMO must be clear
The land Department of the EU has sent a coordination front a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOs) and plant protection law.
The amendment to the law gives up a separate collection of data for both genetically modified (GM) crop locations and operators, using a plant health register in the future.
In addition, GM crop operators will be modified to have prior agreements with the beekeeping agent.
Although there are currently no GM crops cultivated in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops.
That would be at least as long as there were no decisions to declare Estonia GMO-free, "said Sigmar Suu Kyi, Head of the plant health department at the Kuelucht.
"However, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens of both the private and public sectors,"
The draft law repeals provisions on GM crop location and management training for GM sites and operators, lays down requirements for the handling of GM crops and for starting an economic activity.
Specifically for beekeeping, GM crops growers will be replaced by a current obligation to inform beekeepers about the cultivation of GM crops by a commitment to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeepers before cultivation is initiated.
The draft law has been sent to Ministries for coordination.
All interested parties will have the opportunity to examine it in the information system and, if they wish, present their views with the world Department.
The proposed changes will particularly affect those operating in the plant farming sector, beekeepers and the agricultural profession.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize mon 810 - is allowed to be grown.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has taken an interest in growing GM crops.
This is because Estonia does not have a magic pressure, a European corn, which has a lead line called mon 810 resistant to.
It is also breeding its maize leather on the southern regions, and it is not appropriate in our climate conditions in May.
To provide this certainty, the Hague Department has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible GM pollution in the seeds of various summer rape, maize and soya cultivated in Estonia.
The samples analysed showed that seeds were not included in a foreign wave and the survey concluded that the seeds of the burnt seeds in Estonia were not accompanied by GMOs.
This is to conclude that Estonia is not deliberately cultivating GM crops and it was also proven that there was no accident contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United colbas Nemanja and Maticu, in the form of "genetic"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited in Nemanja Maticu as "genetic" after being midfield player Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
GBP 40 million from Chelsea bought in the last quarter of Unitedi in Dublin, in a previous seasonal match in front of UEFA Super Cup's real performer against Madrid on Tuesday, in the primitive rigging, giving the impression of defence, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to attack the decarpet.
But, aside from the Bluesi Asia wave, Maticon was badly needed ashes and he only spoke up for 45 minutes, and that is something that, in fact, must be improved before the Premier League season began.
'she needs time, but she has experience, intelligence, genius thinking - she has football mentality, 'said Mourinho.
"We will help it to achieve a form as soon as possible."
Like the inextricable in Aviva, other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romeba and Mourinho began to put in place a man starting from their own ranks at the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football clubs, but he confirmed that the club had already done "excellent work" by concluding contracts with three of four of its four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four" he added.
"I am even happier if they can deliver four concrete actions, but they have worked hard for me."
Another salt poet had his feet on 1 August and this time was beaten by GSM Embassy.
The Swiss observer, Mati Martinson, has already been given the first baby-patient in Shof, and this washing basin is already walking, walking and signing the Mullutu Bay with a massive overnight bag.
This is because murder does not have any fruit fields, writes the island's voice.
This Tuesday, to snowy the Kurds, the accompanying person received another pump, on the island of Bou.
Martinson said that sending devices are, in fact, an international project, run by Aivar Leito and Ivar Oji.
Soil was supplied by a pump called Mati's accompanying SÃµrves TÃ¼rjul.
"His activities are all online: How he went to Spain to farm, back in the German-Polish border toppour for a long time, and then to Saaremaa," Martinson spoke.
British inventors to fit their body with microchips to get a hand-hand house and a car arm
The British inventor was the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip to be able to open a line with just handful of people, to access the office and even to launch a car.
Steven Northam, aged 33, has been able to install a small chips between his pÃ¶la and the distinguished finger, and is now providing this service through its own company, BioTeq, to companies and individuals who want to make life easier by technology.
She has joined forces in Winchester in Hall with Drhire-anestesic, Royal hospital in the county of Hampshire, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
Technology is similar to microchips and cogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company also exchanges houses and cars with the possibility of matching them with ambulances, asking for a lump sum GBP 300.
This married father of one child has now installed technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start if he has a hand in the rostrum.
White House failure to cost taxpayers thousands
According to the military documents published for the magazine, the White House's decision to close a naval helicopter last month has cost taxpayers a total of USD 24 000 in the southern American production event.
The green and white colour Sikorsky VH-3D, called the President's parity of Marine One, was the centrepiece of the play of the US construction programme in White on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior house administrators reported industrial products on their circulation from all 50 states.
The helicopter built at Connecticut was rolled together with the repute jahi from Wisconham and the Missister engine fuel fitted from the Porsuda.
According to the documents of the Escakar Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), who is responsible for the deployment of Helikopter, the Helicopter's office has been called for by the cell's cell office, or FARGO, to a minimum effect 36 hours before the helicopter's' extraordinary 'event was swept on the southern side.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually high-profile event," said HMX-1 comandÃ¶r a day before the event in an email to his chief, the leader of the navy, to the deputies in aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at a southern commission on 17 July morning at 7: 00 for an event starting at 7: 00 and stay there until the night was cleared at 18: 21.
The added point was that, should the Valgest leave the House, you need a second ekier flight because of the limits of working time.
The initial air crew were at the helicopter during the event and the first-class security team would be stationed near the aircraft throughout its terrain.
It was not possible to read in the documents given to the magazine whether the other epaatation was needed at the end.
The Hatchi Law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political ends.
The documents show that HMX-1 was investigating whether this event could violate that provision.
"We asked whether it was a violation of Hatchi law and we were told that it was not, 'wrote the commander.
"It seems you have no choice, 'responded to the leading victim.
The White House announced the 'American-prepared' official event and Hatchi's law would not have covered it.
But even formal events have political subterfuges.
The President supported the health reform efforts at the occasion in the Senate and praised attempts to keep government regulations under threat.
The use of the Marine One or Air Force-known aircraft for political gain is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them merely as photocopy is unusual.
The Trump was brought to attention in February when the first campaign event in Floridas Melbourne was triggered by a President's plane on the watershed, and she is slipping from Twitter's account with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the plane.
'The White Matel is very pleased with the 'American-made' exhibition, where products were represented from 50 states produced by American personnel, 'said Lindsay Walters, the media officer in the White House.
HMX-1 teams often perform tests around Washington and at the southern hemicycle to get the US presidential white house to be disentanged with a metre of precision.
When Trump was at the G20 Summit in early July in Germany, HMX-1 was organising 58 tests in the White House levers.
According to the official, the flight to the 'American-made' flight flight was included in the standard for this time-end flight flights.
On that occasion, the Eskar helicopter fly another 11 hours for 'presidential support missions'.
The White House says that no other displays of this event cried taxpayers' purses.
As Sikorsky representative said, the company was not involved in carrying out an expontor at the helicopter's southern power.
HMX-1 will not retain the President's budget documents and the precise costs of the event will be difficult to identify.
However, at the Ministry of Defence's rush for the 2017 financial year, the VH-3D will be able to pay compensation at USD 24 per flight hour.
The Escar papers specified a flight length of 30 minutes from its main base line, Quantico, on both routes.
The White House says that the actual cost of helicopter use is well below the sum.
"It is very misleading to calculate taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates," said Wales.
"These estimated compensation rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs which will be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 "rand study," the Department of Defence "will not include compensation rates for staff costs, but covering fuel, maintenance and contracts.
The former journalist for the White House Sean Spicer defended helicopter at that time.
"The point is to show America's own affairs this week," said Spicer.
"I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut state are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are expected hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of that helicopter and other military equipment, which so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So it is of course right to highlight that. "
It is not clear whether Trump was infected by a helicopter in a southern factory, or not, but was sitting behind the fire-fighting car.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky addressed representatives by throwing out the media and complaining about company products in his own aircraft park.
"I know Sikorski very well," the President said, 'I have three of their products'.
Grit Å adeiko - Things carried out through tears were peace and joy
Mil Daegus in 2011 hit shale in the last area, 800 mdrinks went on foot and the stadiums were taken out with a weed.
Just before that, he had received a juice oych from the Universitor in China.
In 2012, Helsinki was damaged by cheap injuries, but in London, the debate camp was awarded a seat in 23rd place of 60 13.
I am afraid, however.
After the opening day in Moscow, Moscow MW received a record from Estonia in the timetable for a cross-fertiliser injury.
Two years later, she won Beijing Mil 15 seats and held the Olympic orium, but it was more than a sports disappointment.
The cynicyest hurricane passed through Å adeiko only had the cost of not getting the first Amsterdam EMW letter from the top.
I would just like to put a fine multi-contest once.
Once, ', spray Å adeiko.
Worse than that, a month later, his Olympic contest in Rios was already broke at the first barrier due to the Renaissance.
Time had to be cut down - did seven competitions go ahead?
Is the two-day effort really worth all that?
Yesterday thought a lot, but he found peace.
I could almost think clean.
It is relatively difficult to describe such an experience, but I have thought that the previous season and Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen.
Fortunately there was time to cure ourselves and think very quickly.
"I knew I would not incur a mouse yet," Siko is talking about his self-cleansing.
I could turn a clear page and go on with a new momentum.
She said she, Mrs hill, that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of carelevity, but she realised that, above all, the athlete himself had to get it right.
After all, she was so buried by everyone.
It was hard to tolerate.
"The keeper said, however, that he would not give up and he would want to prove what he is worth, says no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, he would like to give himself.
Now it is about some sort of peace.
It is doing that in its own right.
The competition came back in May, when Å adeiko raised a new Estonian record in a multi-competitive competition in GÃ¶tzise.
At the high level competition, he improved the personal top stag at a heat price with close metres (13.89) and ran on a record-close-to-time race.
Then a competition felt that it was not a level of capabilities, but only lost in the first competition.
She has been guided by mountain for years by saying that Å adeiko is a black student.
She is ready to play a sporting role, she is a good master.
If something is wrong or wrong, he will immediately say so.
She knows her body and entrust her sense.
That is what we must follow.
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we follow it.
The new approach has also found Å adeiko.
'I am not one who makes the maximum 'he says and says that the most important thing is to get the hour in the room, because it also provides a good result.
Baby baby baby milk to be happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Sadeikos by lovely cheers.
Both her former trainer, Maris hill and sister Grete, recently became parents and several rivals have received new weather support from citizens.
'It has been quite interesting ', says Å adeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking is tantamount to brain-to-training.
Livestral writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is a full-blown belief that wine can be trained on a brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
She says it is not a matter of alcohol or how it affects our feelings and ideas, but rather of the 'very active' process of taste for wine.
By buttering Klauses, playing wine, enjoyment it and a follow-on perceptions, we are putting our brain on the job to create a taste for wine.
Sheperd says that bovine beacles do not actually contain taste, but that taste arises from the way wine stimulates brain.
She leads to a comparison between brain image and brain dread.
"Taste is not wine, taste creates wine by taste" Sheperd says.
Things that still affect the appearance of wine are, for example, our old age, gender and even syllam, which humans produce.
Sheperd certainly feels that wine is not full of hair.
"There must be more," he says.
If you take too big a plague, the system has been overloaded.
Excessive wine drinking can be done not to benefit the brain; according to a 2004 study, people who run over three glass of wine, memory loss, rebalancing and reduced mental capacity risk.

The UN says that Afghans' democracy depends on women's political role
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can represent the people only if all members of society, including women, play a role.
The head of the UN aid mission, Nicholas Haysom, said that hundreds of women would stand for municipal councils, three women would stand as Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"Underlining the importance of women's role, it is not possible to exaggerate," said in a statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can represent a genuine people and be credible only if women participate fully and participate in all phases of the electoral process.
The Afghan local council elections and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have, for their part, threatened the electoral process, which coincides with a transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is calmly handed over from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Hamas, women's strong role in Afghanistan is increasing democracy's success.
According to the Afghan independent electoral Commission, 3.6 million registered voters are 1.2 million women.
The distribution pleasure makes every thing more acute, both large and small.
Common time is always too little, but a trend with small names provides a good opportunity to combine meetings, play, clothes and burdens.

In fact, it is more difficult than usual, but much more amusing to do, if in the meantime a friend can hand over.
To add burdens, we can have a load in the field of plank, a small peat, and there is a walking.
A further aspect could be to plant a minor child on the hip, but this exercise offers fun arrogance to all children.

Philippines' journey to the heart of the world's various technologies, the learning tresse
Trapped copies are the summer class, which has in recent years become a single piece of paper in its own right, one of the Sudanese people even has to hang on to their hand and have been able to use a football label, despite its modest origin.
A top-down copy is probably one of the things that has existed in life at the same time and which has not been very emotive in having heard.
That simply exists and, if it does not exist, there is nothing.
Now the jump bags are taking a real grand slide, and momophile beetles have changed their top-top design bags for months instead of simple beer-red bags.
It is not just a coastal zone, but today it is just as popular as a street dog and it even puts bolder women in the office.
It is worth making it clear here whether the upper-day summer payment is still sitting or worth marking and the laptop computer is still a little more formal.
However, the affinity has been made by beer havoc by women.
For example, reading foreign motives, the first thing to do is to see that mogurus people are first to claim a holiday trip to the local market and acquire some beer bags, to which a whole period of leave is a priest and which is in the tree, the market and also as friend-makers in the town.
Some bloggers are so generous that buying bags from the market is selling and selling larger wolves or giving them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that there is such a great demand for bags that in the world of play women (and men!) apparently have to involve each other in order to be able to host a few homes happy.
In a sense, such madness is understandable, because it is the rare of these regimes when, in the mock of yesterday, you can buy something that has risen to a slot for just a few tens of euros.
True, skippers have discovered here a simple way of making money, and so beer luxury brands sell a bowl for a few hundred and a half thousand euros.
Obviously, in order for richer customers not to feel as easy dying to get round some cheap bags.
For example, Dolce & Gabbana can buy over EUR 1 000 coffers.
However, for a Changeospatial interpretation, 6,000 euro can be moved into circulation.
Unlike most motor buildings, beer bags do not inherit a lot of great fun, but they did so far.
Indeed, copies are said to be far from the Philippines, where they have been transported.
Trapping from a bunch of trains is primarily export business there and very often do not see them happening around the local community.
It is said that the drinking technology dates back to the 14th century and is quite a series of normal coral-jubbit.
However, since beer does not have to be red as strongly as basket, they can be labelled and other materials that make homes more attractive and, by extension, more acoustic.
For example, recently, there are particularly trendy bags in which red paperers or skins are billed.
However, the full letter may in particular be sent by accessors to actress Jane Birkini, the biggest red beer beer game of which had not been seen before.
She did fit beer at any possible garment series and did not have to go much to even the Cannes Film Festival.
What is less popular today is that, in contrast to everything else, they are not played a role, but that they are taken care of by a carte head and, unlike all the sexes, they are not to be cared for with special resources, but also cause water and a target.
As always with trends robbery initiatives, in addition to classical appearance, brands have emerged with all interpretations.
For example, if you wish you can get a red juice or a tiny straw.
It is worth remembering, however, that classic beer bags will never be out of fashion, while beer fuel does.
But what is the classic beer's courtyard?
For centuries, such beer-red bags have been classified as "strapped" and rear-pressed and rehash in their style, are on the sidelines, as well as beer ones.

GMB concerns investment at McVitie's Glasgow plant
The Trade Union is waiting for mature producers in McVitie to be reassured by long-term production plans at the Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent on the future of customs land investment.
In a theatre producing Hobnolid and rich know-how and other products, more than 500 people work.
McVitie's owner, Pladi, said they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years.
It employed workers and trade union chairs' are the first to hear 'when something changes in the factory's activities.
In a letter to the company's leader, GMB addressed the McVitie company's request for "scash concerns about the lack of funding to upgrade production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: 'The fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the head of the site on the business needs and future investment plan is a source of deep concern for our Members.
Several generations of families have been working here, and the workforce is largely made up of people from the local community and the Glasgow region, as indispensable pillars for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social housing.
So in the eastern Glasgow, for jobs, wages and welfare, and in the face of Brext, the rise in living costs and the chronic fall in production, the thriving McVitie company is badly needed. "
The Bureau representative said: 'The Director of Customs Borders was only receiving a letter from GMB Scotting yesterday and the company replies directly to him because we value active interaction with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between workers in customs and GMB, which openly debated a number of issues.
We then discussed with workers that, like all other businesses operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our operations on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: 'In recent years we have invested over Â£5 million on the Customs crossing site, most of which has gone into production lines and improvements of operations.
We fully understand Tollcross as a manufacturing site heritage and, should the object be subject to any change, the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago of being a sympathetic approach?
La liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in the attempt to attract Neyts to their ranks by making a USD 189 million offer to evade him, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record March?
This benign approach has opened the summer's transition window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of buying, erected in the previous season by returning Paul Pogba to Manchester Uniteus for GBP 89 million.
Once the changeover is completed, Neymark will thus become the most expensive player in the world and also the most highly remunerated professional global player, who will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from the PSG.
Barcelona is also a hint, of course, because of the approach and the free burst of Neymar, although the close source of the Catalansan Bureau confirms that the club has always been best off for football since its Santotou arrival in 2013.
But did the PSG President warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City took the interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuka in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who thought of recruiting some of their best-performing PSG players.
"I am not concerned because they know that when they are dealing with some of our players, we will stand down and contact those players," al-Khelaif said.
"We honour all clubs.
But if they try to conclude contracts with some of our players, they will have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this border, as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow an Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer setbacks as a result of this interest by removing the Neymark from one of its precious assets.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brex, not borders.
"Brex is seriously threatening to strike a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," warned early on a first visit to Northern Ireland since it took office in June.
"I cannot imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible to move freely to the current people and goods, says Varadkar.
"That is our vision for the future: Building bridges, not borders," he emphasised.
According to the fact that he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, as it is not, he would be part of the European common market.
That would preserve the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the UK.
Another way of making Britain's exit smoother would be to set up a European Union-United Kingdom Customs Union, explained by the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, the Varadkar said: 'Surely we could have that kind of Great Britain'.
The alternative would be to return to customs points, which would herald historical separation and political failure.
'Let trade, prosperity and peace ', the Irish Prime Minister said.
She called Brexitit 'a challenge for our generation' and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's everyday life.
The Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the Irish parties in Belfast.
