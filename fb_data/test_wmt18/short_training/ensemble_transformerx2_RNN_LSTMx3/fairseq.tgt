four members of Cape Verde were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to Mr Posselt , the police in Spain detained the leader of the so @-@ called K@@ Cape ro@@ vo Group in Spain , S@@ pr@@ vo Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , who is known as S@@ pin@@ K@@ Cape ro@@ v@@ ski in the criminal world .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch arrested in Spain was arrested in the Court of Justice .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
according to suspicion , the so @-@ called &apos; Cape ro@@ vo &apos; criminal Community members aged between 27 and 57 years of life , who are mainly committed to drug crimes .
in the province of M@@ ala in Spain , the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained .
in Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of which has been collected according to the criminal community figures , and two are members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicate that tasks and roles were clearly divided in the criminal community .
the purpose of the actual Community action was to commit drug crimes and thus serve the proceeds of criminal activity , &quot; commented on the head of the pre @-@ trial procedure , Public Prosecutor Va@@ gio Ver@@ te .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; added the Prosecutor .
it is people who have also been involved in the law enforcement authorities in the past , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Ver@@ te stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common@@ place for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; commented on the Prosecutor Ver@@ te .
the head of the central criminal police service , ago in Le@@ is , said that the detention was preceded by nearly half a year of pre @-@ trial .
&quot; in the first half of the week , a long @-@ term work was realised and , at the same time , in Estonia and Spain , we have been suspected of committing crimes . &quot;
Le@@ is added that central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have a good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil card .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are yet another message to criminals that we can also get them from another European search , &quot; said Le@@ is .
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that , in the absence of a suspect , men can continue to commit new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office has requested their arrest and the Court also approved it .
a man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
in this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized in order to ensure confiscation .
the pre @-@ trial procedure of the Criminal Court will be carried out by the central criminal police Office and led by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the city of Tallinn was convicted of blackmail in 2005 by the Mayor of Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch and punished him with a five @-@ year imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ š@@ i was held as the second most important man in the criminal world of Estonia , following a broad T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v , Mr Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch from Cape ro@@ vo@@ s rose in the beginning of the 1990s in Estonia when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Ad@@ mittedly , he taxed tax@@ i drivers and prostitution and ordered a monthly tax on business@@ men .
international joint operations , confiscation of criminal proceeds and the entry into force of judicial decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest court rulings , the so @-@ called &apos; D@@ ik@@ a@@ ye@@ v &apos; criminal offence of eight accused persons who have been confis@@ cated by EUR 80 000 in criminal proceeds , or the judgment against nine persons in 2006 , that Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v created a criminal community aimed at illegal trade in cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in Eastern Vir@@ u@@ land and in southern Estonia .
there is a total of EUR 71 500 in confis@@ cated criminal profits .
in these criminal matters , it has ensured that police officers exchange information and prosecutors every day with foreign colleagues and , if necessary , carry out operations in any country of the European Union .
civil rights group war@@ ns of Mis@@ tral travel
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ er of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ Ps ) has warned the people of the Muslim State of C@@ olo@@ red People for discriminatory policies and racist attacks .
in the statement of the Group , the &apos; Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i State &apos; NA@@ P , which applies until 28 August 2017 , calls on all American passengers , visitors and sou@@ ri@@ ans to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious when moving around the whole state , given the suspi@@ cious racial events that have taken place recently in the state and at this point . &quot;
according to NA@@ Ps , the group urged the group to issue a travel warning , both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that the state of law targets for the purpose of the state of the State &apos;s law is largely minority .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
they are being drawn up because of their sk@@ in colour , they are beaten or killed , &apos; said R@@ od Cha@@ pel , President of the NA@@ P , R@@ od Cha@@ pel , The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints before . &quot;
this is the first such warning that the organisation has issued on the state of the US .
the group referred to events such as racist insul@@ ts against black students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of 28 @-@ year @-@ old mus@@ ici@@ ans from T@@ en@@ nes@@ ta .
the S@@ and@@ ers died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , after he had run out of petrol in the state and the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police took him in custody without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the comment refers to the recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which shows that in the state , the cars of black car drivers are hal@@ ted by 75 % more likely than those of white drivers .
&apos;@@ The comment is intended for people to be aware and to warn their families , friends and collabor@@ ators for what might happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is , &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it is to be involved in the bail @-@ out or to inform relatives that they are going through the state . &quot;
on the basis of the latest data from the F@@ B@@ I hate crime programme , 100 hate crime crimes were documented in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is in 2015 , which places the state in the state of similar violations in the country &apos;s cross @-@ section 16 .
the travel warning is also a response to the new law of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which makes it difficult for a company to be brought to court for reasons of discrimination in search of housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had previously issued travel barriers to T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona , following the adoption by these states of immigration laws , which obliged local authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration , because , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , it increases racial profiling .
usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain US laws and trends .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what could everyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or inc@@ in@@ eration , may be caused by five different - A , B , C , D and E he@@ pati@@ tis .
all these vir@@ uses are provo@@ king a fier@@ ce bur@@ n .
however , the worst cost is chronic B and C he@@ pati@@ tis , which can develop into a cir@@ cus , or a li@@ p , to pay for cancer .
the epidemi@@ ology Ad@@ vis@@ er of the Health Agency , Mr Ku@@ rel , is saying that acute he@@ pati@@ tis disease is the same for all types of li@@ ver inc@@ in@@ eration - a f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ gue , s@@ tun@@ ning , birth , o@@ liberalisation , cru@@ el@@ ty , grey emissions , horse mackerel , meat and excess pain , and s@@ wine and li@@ mas@@ ters .
the last hour of disease also comes from the popular name of the li@@ ver bur@@ n .
children can undergo he@@ pati@@ tis without disease .
the various species of combustion can only be identified on the basis of a laboratory study .
extreme he@@ pati@@ tis can go to chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and go for decades without disease , which means that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous disease .
Mr Ku@@ tsa@@ r highlights different forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their cul@@ mination more closely .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading from a disease to humans and infec@@ tious us in eating contaminated food or drinking water , on the road to se@@ als , on the hands of infected people and on food , soil , objects , sugar , and drug consumption .
a he@@ pati@@ tis was infected by family members and carers , people suffering from chronic pay , sex people , sex men with men , drug users , the high spread of he@@ pati@@ tis A .
vaccination can be prevented by vacc@@ inations , in particular by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot of travel and he@@ pati@@ tis A .
in addition , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands , before the consumption of all fruit and vegetables is was@@ hed .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading in the face of the blood of a sick person , in the face of drugs , in the inc@@ in@@ eration of drugs , in au@@ g@@ mentation , in the use of blood @-@ contaminated sites ( too@@ th@@ me@@ ters , pregnant women ) , in the use of donor blood , he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , in the sex of he@@ pati@@ tis , and in he@@ pati@@ tis hospital .
the he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis group includes drugs , the sex partners of the infected person , sex men , men who are infected with the mother &apos;s new@@ born , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , health , rescue workers and police officers , and passengers who visit the countries with he@@ pati@@ tis B .
in order to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis , it is possible to vacc@@ in@@ ate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vacc@@ in@@ ate people who are at risk and , in addition to chronic pay @-@ related diseases , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
he@@ pati@@ tis other preventive measures are : refrain from the hygiene and man@@ ure of stran@@ gers , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ de @-@ coun@@ ters , other sharp resources , and the use of need@@ le @-@ advice , and the use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection , or the prevention of sexual risk .
vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis is part of the national immun@@ isation scheme in Estonia and free of charge for children .
He@@ pati@@ tis C virus is spreading in the face of the blood of a sick person , drug injec@@ tion , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic , au@@ g@@ mentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated fo@@ d@@ der , donor blood , he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , sex and he@@ pati@@ tis hospital for animals / new@@ born babies .
C @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis infections include drug users , sex partners of infected people , sex men , inf@@ ant inf@@ ant mothers , sick family members and carers , blood and other body flu@@ ids , health , rescue workers and police officers , HIV @-@ infected persons and C he@@ pati@@ tis high @-@ disease travellers .
C he@@ pati@@ tis preventive action is : refrain from the hygiene and man@@ ure of stran@@ gers , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ de @-@ coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ot@@ teries , other cereals and au@@ g@@ mentation , and use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
A@@ he@@ pati@@ tis is caused by he@@ pati@@ tis D virus , which is multi@@ plying in the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
as a result , he@@ pati@@ tis D infections , together with he@@ pati@@ tis B or super@@ information , occur in chronic B he@@ pati@@ tis .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading exposure to blood and other body liquids , contaminated with need@@ les , sexu@@ ally and sel@@ dom infected animals .
d &apos;@@ he@@ pati@@ tis &apos;s risk group &apos; is chronic B @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ ers and people who do not have immunity from he@@ pati@@ tis B .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis B , which also protects people from he@@ pati@@ tis virus infection .
he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses of drinking water and food , including low heat @-@ treated beef , fish and marine car@@ b@@ ons , donor blood , joint sy@@ stal@@ ls and infected animals .
passengers can be infected with the high incidence of he@@ pati@@ tis E in countries .
the prevention of he@@ pati@@ tis preventive measures is compliance with hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands after the fire , before food production and feed , after hospital care .
fruit and vegetables are was@@ hing before consumption , to avoid eating little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , only safe drinking water and to avoid drug consumption .
although the last round of competitors tried to get rid of the four @-@ fold Olympic winners , 34 @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ara@@ h final s@@ gel found strength and won 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
the F@@ ara@@ h did not think long enough , after the fin@@ alists , with the hus@@ band T@@ ania and children .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much regret my family .
it was wonderful to be with them , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h is targeted in London at the fifth edition of 5 000 and 10 000 metres of the gol@@ den heading .
everything is possible if there are religions .
despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ norm , &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti , A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , has an extraordinary story of &apos; one of the art works &apos; , much deeper than the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna .
but even more in the history .
the inf@@ lam@@ matory information on the basis of the prize , which is to say , a s@@ nap@@ shot , a narro@@ wer topic would have been allowed to have more influence on the extraordinary nature of the title of the title .
at the moment , it would be like two books : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti and his pain@@ ting &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , the story of A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , and a much more extensive and comprehensive time @-@ to @-@ day history and the German occupation , along with its subsequent effects in Austria .
the first third of the book will lead in the middle of the w@@ ed@@ ding Vienna cultural life and who , in the Austrian capital itself , can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago , life in R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ s , or how the Cen@@ tr@@ ali coff@@ ee , when the climate was introduced .
the concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the rich@@ est cities in Europe , and when we saw the name in the book , some of them are known as a gram of culture .
at the same time , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a city where un@@ treated ar@@ son and was the highest level of suicide in Europe , the development of a story as if nothing is done .
or perhaps , however , every couple of couples , too , will add colour to the cultural life of the 20th century in Vienna .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
the S@@ aj@@ an@@ di@@ cal exchange was almost one in ten people in Vienna .
parents were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time when the aid for A@@ dele was two times opened up to the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ te Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch@@ every and the Kli@@ m@@ tile , his father had already become the seventh largest bank in the H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg E@@ mp@@ ire E@@ mp@@ ire .
however , A@@ de@@ let &apos;s entire life , which he belon@@ ged to , did not draw up .
if you look at the &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end of life was infected by this kind of soci@@ alism and dre@@ ams of a trip to the Soviet Union .
in 19@@ 0@@ 3 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s luggage from the Kli@@ m@@ ti@@ g , the last moment was the pain@@ ting mak@@ er in Vienna .
the cli@@ m@@ t ordered 4 000 kro@@ ons at the time , a quarter of the price of a good location for the rural house .
the fact that there was a suspicion of the mo@@ del@@ li of the mas@@ ters of a few sports mar@@ ty@@ rs , the sugar mag@@ na@@ ti , was not discoura@@ ged .
as far as the dele@@ tion is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between the mo@@ del@@ li and the ar@@ tist created during the work continued to the end of life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; .
the G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti C@@ up , A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri &apos;s extraordinary story , &quot; Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , Al@@ do R@@ and@@ land .
just before the start of the work with the A@@ dele@@ ga , Mr Ra@@ ven@@ nas San V@@ ita@@ le had visited the climate , and the investi@@ g@@ ators think that it was precisely there that the wonderful mo@@ sa@@ ic countries of The@@ o@@ dor@@ a , which were seen as a &apos; gol@@ den &apos; ban@@ ner , gave an artificial idea to make a gol@@ den t@@ ree .
the cli@@ m@@ t presented his &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; in Vienna in 19@@ 08 and at the same time ( 19@@ 07 @-@ 19@@ 08 ) , one of the gol@@ den land &apos; S@@ novel &apos; was born .
artistic his@@ tori@@ ans did not notice the simil@@ arity of two women .
how does Hitler relate to nature ?
&quot; I think that my friend , Mr Kli@@ m@@ ti , will be indeb@@ ted to him to make his work available to the public , &quot; wrote to A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer a few years after the departure of the ar@@ tist ( Kli@@ m@@ t died in February 19@@ 18 ) to the Director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere muse@@ um , and wanted their family to go to the muse@@ um .
six years prior to death , the Kli@@ m@@ l had been killed by the A@@ dele@@ e .
he also asked for the hus@@ band to leave her two sports courses and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti landsca@@ pes to the Austrian Gal@@ eri in February 19@@ 25 .
in his tru@@ ths , he has written to Mrs Mari@@ ana and Mr Lu@@ i .
one year after the Kli@@ m@@ t had finished the &apos; Austrian Mon@@ a lisa &apos; , it had attempted to access the A@@ ca@@ de@@ issu@@ er A@@ ca@@ de@@ mine of Vi@@ ini , 17 years of Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , but failed in the drawing up of the German .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is considered to be the reason for the Jewish profes@@ sors not to be admitted to the anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism , none of his ex@@ hor@@ tations were actually Jewish .
in any case , the Austrian Gal@@ special task was referred to in 19@@ 39 , which has changed considerably in 19@@ 39 , and it was important to find the work of the Vienna rich Jewish art colle@@ ctions .
Hitler &apos;s personal art mus@@ ici@@ ans also had some work at home , but not those of the climate .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the Nazi arts , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute between the Austrian Government and B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ cher was launched .
at this point , it should be noted that , if &apos; S@@ novel &apos; is seen in Vienna in Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle , A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ er &apos;s &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; must be seen to travel to New York Ne@@ ue Gal@@ special .
and before Vienna , the aforementioned book will also be read .
even if you do not intend to look at the work of the climate , because at least my emo@@ tion , after the closure of the book , was more laugh@@ ing and the Jewish issue than the ma@@ gic and mode@@ ll A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer re@@ sold for USD 135 million .
so it is not so much of a t@@ ree , rather than a marriage - and a very moving story .
it has significantly facilitated the orientation of the events at the beginning of the book on the sex of Bauer .
17 @-@ year @-@ old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonia
in the event of life , gold was very close to the personal record of its own 200 m of se@@ li@@ cking in 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 .
the Ti@@ pp@@ mark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ old pirates every week since the Canadian cheese Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships were awarded 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 , the Pri@@ it A@@ av@@ ik U@@ ju@@ gation blo@@ g .
gold is the last one , or the tenth A @-@ fin@@ alist .
in Fin@@ ally , he went through a distance of 2.@@ 15.@@ 76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful top @-@ level .
A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or@@ n , Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) remained a little over half a second .
Estonia &apos;s all @-@ time ranking rose by the third , and its fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of all the times in Estonia .
the young hope for the future is Canada &apos;s adult Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships of 100 m@@ m , 200 m and 400 m in bal@@ bal@@ ls and 200 m@@ m and 400 m@@ m .
last week in Tor@@ onto , Canada took place in the Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship of Canada , and gold has done a successful start there .
he won 200 m in a sil@@ ver bul@@ let with 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
so quickly , this distance was sw@@ am@@ ped by the last year in 2008 .
the Gol@@ f faster than ever , Estonia has only distan@@ ced itself from the record of Estonia &apos;s record , E@@ lina Par@@ evi@@ ka .
as a guardian of Canada , there has been an excellent personal record of 100 m v@@ ouch@@ ers in Canada , and 5@@ 6.@@ 66 of the new Estonian season .
for example , the old Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k of his year has distan@@ ced it from one century more quickly .
in his personal excellence , he reached a further 100 m in the opening of a letter of 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 in the opening of a brief@@ ing .
for half a longer distance , he has only reached the seventh place when the fin@@ alist was 17.@@ 31 .
gold is currently leading to four different distances from the Estonian season .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics insu@@ red teet@@ h
the holiday time is in the hands of the US President , Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ le , too .
however , as the T@@ ru@@ mp has been one of the most most of the holiday days , the critics have already been too@@ th@@ p@@ aste .
according to the US Guard and CN@@ N , the President intends to have 17 @-@ day leave in the B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , which is located in New Jer@@ se@@ ys .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , the anti @-@ T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i leave has already been spoken for weeks .
they are asking the Olympic Games for too frequent treatment .
it is the President &apos;s practice to spend a week in his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey &apos;s cotton .
by the way , T@@ ru@@ mp is not the most pu@@ zz@@ led President in his 19@@ 6 term .
for example , George W@@ . Bush has already reached 67 days on holiday , Barack Obama , but 21 days less than T@@ ru@@ mp , but 21 days .
however , things tend to be forgotten quickly by the Olympic Games .
the days after becoming President , Mr T@@ ru@@ mp said , &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , that there will be no time for long holidays , because there is a great deal to be done .
he also expressed three years ago his outra@@ ge at Barack Obama &apos;s leave .
the current President wrote on Twitter : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , plays a gol@@ f , it is on the brak@@ es and the j@@ ung@@ le concer@@ ts , journalists in the face of the sun &apos; .
according to the white house officials , 17 @-@ day gol@@ f club visits to pol@@ len have no place .
it is officially called &apos; working holiday &apos; , during which there is no time for the T@@ ru@@ l to read or for other forms of action .
in addition , there was also a second reason for working holiday .
in particular , the White House will be replaced by a Western @-@ style pension system , and therefore all staff had to leave it .
the West is also located in O@@ val@@ ka@@ c@@ abinet and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West in August if there is 38 degrees and there is no con@@ tention , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , who stressed that the President will continue to work during the holiday period .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp will follow 17 days , you will get an idea of video .
blocking of critics from Facebook to do not stand for the state of office if you do not tolerate the criticism of the voters .
the father of our country knew a great deal about the unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to get him to gri@@ ps with everything from internal politics to his political principles .
of course , it was anno@@ yed by the criticism .
but he did not forced his critics to remain silent .
because , in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and , in dar@@ k@@ ness and silence , we could be chaired by sheep . &apos;
this brings me to Mr Ho@@ gan , Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has worked hard to be more in Washington .
it has been blocked and deleted by at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the Union for Freedom of American Civil Liberties ( AC@@ L@@ U ) has therefore been brought to court .
the Governor of the Governor of the Governor of the Civil Guard was a trivi@@ al action and web commen@@ taries s@@ lide away from reactions in a style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos; .
&quot; this is just Facebook , &quot; said many .
but that is what counts .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
this is an ama@@ zing popular re@@ public@@ ist in the democratic state .
his approval rate is the second highest in the country &apos;s 50 @-@ month Governor .
Ho@@ gan is not an un@@ thin@@ kable response .
he has led the state firmly and has remained strictly firm in its principles .
in addition , it has used the main tool in communicating with its voters on Facebook , for example , after the first time after the chemical waste , for the first time in a stu@@ b@@ born presentation .
it is therefore a public forum with a formal label , which is managed by the staff of taxpayers &apos; dollars to block the people who are visiting the country of taxpayers &apos; money , which is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with Mr Ch@@ astel , the representative of the Ho@@ gan press , defended the behaviour of the Governor of the Governor , claiming that the blocking of comments was nothing other than a mo@@ del@@ ling .
however , it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet checks on the web , spa@@ w@@ ers or people full of hatred .
the post spoke to a number of people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and that is precisely what they are people who are in contact with their elected leaders , the owner of the company and the passport , not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were dis@@ respectful , thought @-@ out and not the ro@@ gue .
Mr Pas@@ tor quoted the Bi@@ ble in his post , by emphasising the Ho@@ gan Catholic traffic .
a lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan@@ t Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ m Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not insti@@ gate hatred , but rather hate crime .
&quot; I said poli@@ tely that I am disappointed , because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news , &apos; he wrote The mail news story in the country .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , when many people comment on the same subject , some of them immediately call a collective effort , instead of recognising that this is a great deal of concern with citizens . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s officials called &apos; targeted spa@@ m attack &apos; would probably invite others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era allows messages to be easily mat@@ ching , simply blocking criticism or dele@@ ting a negative comment .
it is a lot of cleaner than the old , when the workers had to be sent out to do the same , so that they gather newspapers with critical edit@@ orial letters and bur@@ n them or arrest protest@@ ors and forced them to remain silent .
but that is exactly what is happening now , just digita@@ lly .
the Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to be criticised on Facebook and other social media .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has compla@@ ined to court Twitter users who have been blocked by Twitter .
one of the first signs of court rulings on this subject was made last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
Mr James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is decided in Alexand@@ ria that Mr Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i Coun@@ ty of the Board of supervisors of the Coun@@ ty Council breached the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the election on his Facebook page .
Mr Ken@@ tu@@ ck@@ ys visited the AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter for the use of him by Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in@@ it ( R ) .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar impact on the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters da@@ red his way of leadership .
and even then Washington had to deal with anon@@ ymous controls .
people wrote letters from the newspapers such as Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , making Washington &apos;s decisions .
according to the historical documents collected by George Washington , the web @-@ based George Washington project , he sw@@ am@@ ped the c@@ abinet of petitions which criticised his views on the Great Britain &apos;s friendship , trade and shipping agreements .
but he did not have forced them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , special opinions and debates are the foundations of our country .
and the right leadership means accepting this .

the De@@ ge@@ i is sitting on the other floor of the fur@@ ni@@ ture of fur@@ ni@@ ture , and yet it is also doing its daily ho@@ mework , for example , was@@ hing the b@@ ath water from a ne@@ ar@@ by sex .
the role of the baby is being played by un@@ scrupulous support .
since he is the four women of his hus@@ band , he has not been appointed to take care of any contempt .
Pol@@ y@@ ga@@ a@@ mia is common here on May .
late work may be dangerous , however , for the majority of men in the village , and many of them drink hard , plus soldiers here .
&quot; no one dare to go around after five o &apos;@@ clock in the village , &apos; he says .
this is a rare pilot in Papua mä@@ ki , which is a former Dutch col@@ ony , which was brought under the auspices of Indonesia in 19@@ 69 after a referendum , which was forced to vote in front of the forces .
the movement of the Netherlands , which has freed up the power of the people of the Netherlands , has quickly fuelled its ra@@ ils against the government of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , which is still keeping the region under its strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially split into the P@@ ope and the West P@@ ope , so that the independent Papua New Guinea was left in the east .
the majority of the whe@@ el is both remote and abandoned , and in order to arrive here , 90 minutes from the capital of the province , Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ i , and then go through a five @-@ hour journey with a ren@@ tal car .
there is no public transport .
the city of around 19 000 inhabitants is made up of t@@ ree houses surrounded by ba@@ mb@@ s and covers la@@ in@@ ous iron ro@@ of@@ s , which have been transformed into a different tone for the tri@@ ump@@ h of the bar@@ rel .
very few indicators have taken place here , not to mention journalists , and there have been almost no foreigners here .
prior to the arrival of Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago pa@@ ints a God called T@@ ame@@ e .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear such ideas , &apos; says De@@ ge@@ i , referring to our col@@ our@@ ful approach to the market , to the plu@@ g and to the private sector .
&quot; prior to this , we have only had a plant cow . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
however , it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
just 100 km away from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , which is a mountainous province with 153 000 inhabitants of New Jer@@ sey , is the world &apos;s largest and most profitable gold mine , G@@ ras@@ berg , which belongs to the P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x@@ is company F@@ bet@@ g Mc@@ Mor@@ an .
in 2015 alone , the F@@ bet@@ e report extra@@ cted approximately USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ per .
in addition , it will be possible to con@@ tend with the supply of timber , which is estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are a source of suffering for boats , as they result in the presence of a powerful Indon@@ esi@@ an army .
the New York Times 2005 study showed that the F@@ re@@ port report paid around USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including USD 150 000 to one of the victims .
P@@ ope &apos;s efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den and they are rou@@ tin@@ ely bet@@ ra@@ yed .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 69 and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esi@@ an army .
according to the Committee on Human Rights in Asia , the mass killing of the genocide in Papua tri@@ bal moun@@ tains in the 1970s was a measure of genocide .
last year alone , over 3@@ 900 peaceful protests were arrested by the police in Indonesia .
the 2016 report of the Bir@@ s@@ b@@ ane Ar@@ ch@@ bis@@ ho@@ p &apos; We lose all &apos; contains testi@@ mony to the atrocities committed in the previous year , such as non @-@ judicial executions , torture ( one second report , in particular , rape and electric shock ) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; the number of victims is difficult to read , because such incidents will take place every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , a research@@ er of Human Rights Watch .
K@@ ru@@ ms are still more strongly closed because Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new settlements from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing , because the Muslim economic migrants are coming from the inhabitants of Indonesia , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ es islands .
C@@ V@@ s are sold in the gallery and mixed vegetables to ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do , which will be st@@ olen together with the ground level .

&quot; migrants started to sell chic@@ ken and vegetables from local boats on the traditional market , &quot; explains the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ita@@ lians born in P@@ ani@@ a@@ is , who worked on behalf of the province of Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ i .
&quot; Sy@@ ma@@ ma @-@ Ma@@ ma &#91; women &#93; in Papua ma@@ ma &#91; women &#93; lose their market share . &quot;
the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , who is known as Jo@@ ko@@ w , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to address these inequalities and human rights violations in P@@ ope .
the former pu@@ mp won the presidential Pal@@ ace in Papua 29 constitu@@ encies 27 , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
however , the P@@ ope has changed very little , and the local feel chea@@ ted .
&quot; our hearts have been broken , because in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes in terms of restoring justice , &quot; says you .
in fact , only two months after Jo@@ ko@@ w took office in October , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i was in a low position .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the Roma were s@@ inging to Christmas , when two Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers were blin@@ ded by the dar@@ k@@ ness of motor@@ cycles .
children have told them that they should be included in the front lights .
according to the words of the local passport , Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ eba@@ i , one of the soldiers insul@@ ted their voting tone and later returned to four soldiers .
according to the victims and specta@@ tors , in drink @-@ driving soldiers , children were driven by children and beaten them with their gun@@ s .
one of the soldiers then shot among children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , was so cruel that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , the building of the close electoral Commission was bur@@ nt down , and the next day , things were even further .
around 1 000 young men , women and children gathered in a football pit@@ ch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they were carrying out direct repair , and they presented Papua me@@ e pa@@ go to wa@@ ita @-@ tan@@ ts@@ u , during which drinking around and bu@@ ried poultry s@@ ongs .
some prote@@ sters started to le@@ cture the police and the military .
&apos;@@ I@@ f the crow@@ ds show more than three times resistance , let them go down , &apos; the official document , which has seen a magaz@@ ine , but which has not been issued to local media publications , was sent to the soldiers .
Ke@@ y Ko@@ to , the city of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , the oldest city of Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ me ( 56 ) felt threatened and called for peace to be maintained , asking for a crow@@ d to go home .
no one was willing to listen .
&quot; turning me back to the left , I was suddenly shot in the left , &apos; he said to the magaz@@ ine at the time of his German col@@ ours on the blood of the t@@ ree .
we still do not know who was shot , but says that the soldiers of the soldiers gathered in the month came from .
&quot; there was a lot of people , a lot of children in the House , adding it .
the local man , Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , has been shot three times , according to his shooting .
&quot; I would like to go to him and in his body to make sure that it is with him , &apos; said the magaz@@ ine at the time in Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who uses only one name in many indicators .
&quot; I saw that he has died ... S@@ novel le@@ ta . &quot;
the chief inspe@@ ctor of Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said to repor@@ ters that he was only subject to the security of his department , as it was attacked .
&quot; we need to protect ourselves if we are threatened to kill , &quot; said Vice @-@ President P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , the spokes@@ man of Papua police in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ors were killed and many injured .
the news about the killings reached J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta@@ il only next day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ras made a passion@@ ate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the mis@@ treatment of the P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
the Security Minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that he would introduce an ADR mechanism to address human rights crimes .
but almost immediately , the ex@@ cus@@ es were also followed .
&quot; most crimes happened long ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and the early 1990s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we must follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
on 5 June in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas , on 5 June , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to with@@ drew his words , saying that he has no intention of creating a P@@ ope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything will be resolved according to the law &apos; .
the W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in relation to the death of more than 1 000 people in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 human rights crimes have already been resolved , including what happened in P@@ ani@@ a@@ is .
the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i have adopted such claims with a g@@ loom@@ y mistrust .
&quot; I have been heard four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that there is still a fear for years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I fear that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I am shot . &quot;
he bro@@ ther Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed the opinion that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are afraid of this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bur@@ y four victims .
&quot; after the bur@@ ying of the bodies , the army had to look at me , &apos; he says .
the celeb@@ rations have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the inhabitants of the village of Indonesia were shot in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ is in the village of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
one person was killed and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , when it went to war between the inhabitants of the village and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an un@@ conscious man to hospital .
this male people , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ w@@ ning fish in a ne@@ ar@@ by river , died on the road to hospital .
the recent village inhabitants prote@@ sted at the construction site before the company &apos;s office .
according to the police , the people of the villages were st@@ oring the police , which was followed by the latest warning visits .
however , according to local authorities , mobile British people ( Indonesia &apos;s military police ) started to shoo@@ t at the people , killing one person .
&quot; we were in great panic , we are afraid of reven@@ ge , &quot; said 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who live near the hospital and saw the in@@ se@@ ct of those injured .
&quot; I have beaten myself two days in my own house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i Parliament has called for the prosecution of police officers involved and the withdrawal of the police in the area of mobile Bri@@ gade .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ i has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development will feed into the dis@@ satisfaction of the honey , m@@ oni , dan@@ n and da@@ m@@ mal tri@@ bes living in Papua bad .
many of them have joined the army of Liber@@ ation ( V@@ PL ) insur@@ gen@@ ts , which , according to their own , protects the rights of boats , by organising attacks and abduc@@ tions among the Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers .
some V@@ PL leaders come from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , the army , under the pretext of protecting the sovereignty of the country , has been arrested in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i over the last few years and has arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them never appear again .
among the people of Papua people , P@@ ani@@ ans are known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty fe@@ eds dis@@ satisfaction .
the low ri@@ ce that is sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
the Lei@@ b is the same un@@ available .
people are growing all their food themselves , mainly in the ba@@ ta , in addition to a little fruit and vegetables .
farming is the work of women , each of whom can care for four or five ba@@ il@@ ines .
they usually keep most of the harvest to the family , the rest is sold on the local market .
ten ba@@ ta@@ tes cost only 10 000 Indon@@ esi@@ an sites ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have deepen@@ ed between in@@ shore boats and new migrants , who have arrived at the N@@ ab@@ ire airport from the opening of new air routes .
these few jobs , which exist , are going to be better educated and more prosperous migrants .
the P@@ ope himself often lacks capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the village because there are no jobs and no money , &quot; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , Chairman of the Council of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
segregation keeps the eyes of the world away from the P@@ ope .
in addition , strict restrictions on foreign media remain .
at the beginning of this year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ bridge L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were sent out , because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they were given a rare film authorisation .
according to the Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch , P@@ com@@ m K@@ ine , the Vice @-@ President of the Asian department of Human Rights Watch , has failed to implement the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development in Jo@@ ko@@ w .
&quot; in Indonesia , journalists from the most eastern provinces and the West P@@ ope reports are threatening to face new threats to the rejection of a visa and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
the absence of the press means that international pressure on the government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua near neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries were encouraged by T@@ on@@ ga , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ pain , Mar@@ shall Islands and Sol@@ om@@ on Islands to examine the &apos; various wide @-@ ranging crimes &apos; in the UN Human Rights Council , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the same countries have historically supported V@@ PL .
Mr Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed the accusations of a group , saying J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas journalists : &apos; Indonesia still applies democratic order and freedom of the press , so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bur@@ y &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to notice .
when the Dutch official delegation visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra on 4 May Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra , the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , was interrupted by local people at the meeting , but the source of anon@@ ymous desire to remain silent , urging : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , the new presidential elections will take place in 2019 , but the boats do not believe that they will vote in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w again .
&apos;@@ Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man with good intentions , but the people around him who are involved in the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i &apos; say Ho@@ ba@@ i , President of the Council .
he wants to give Jo@@ ko@@ w to understand that , in addition to the fact that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are constantly living under the threat of a pre@@ da@@ tory army , they are suffering from poor education and health services .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , as well as other boats , regard their voice to Jo@@ ko@@ w as a debt that has to be paid .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite the mis@@ fortune and intimidation , the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i fire were still coping with the last symbolic reception of one victim to the police station and the army in the country in response to the death of one victim .
knowing that justice may never be put on its feet , they will not at least allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
ne@@ eding Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch &apos;s pil@@ gri@@ m and already in the second time .
on Friday , there was one of the world &apos;s highest housing stor@@ ms in Du@@ ba@@ i , forcing hundreds of people to escape from this 3@@ 37 me@@ tre and 79 regular buildings .
this is the second fire that has been ra@@ va@@ ged in just two years , which is called on to happen in Tu@@ rin , or T@@ us@@ vi@@ ku@@ p .
the building was evacu@@ ated , none of the injuries were reported and there were no direct fire @-@ related causes .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and wake up to the fires and people &apos;s fears .
we would be waiting for a t@@ ree and we took around 10 minutes to get down the 50@@ th order , &apos; said to the Re@@ u@@ ter@@ ans one of the people who called himself George .
according to Du@@ ba@@ i civil protection officers , fire fighters were also deleted at around 4 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning at local level ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and ja@@ iled building .
the government said that they are working to shelter the victims .
this incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on high @-@ level external soil in the world .
during the investigation carried out by the steering Board in Tor@@ ch after the 2015 fire , it was found that the most damage was suffered by a fa@@ ç@@ ade - the de@@ cor@@ al panels and isolation of the external surface .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London G@@ ren@@ portfolio T@@ ow@@ er T@@ ow@@ er and Ambassador panels could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June , which killed around 80 people .
see : these phones are likely to be sold in the autumn
language and coal are the time for technological games , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um came to sale , as well as in the autumn , new h@@ it@@ t telep@@ hon@@ es are expected .
according to the Tele@@ 2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Se@@ mother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by an innovative design , an eye @-@ fast s@@ ner , a ser@@ ser @-@ servan@@ i 4@@ K resolution on the screen and the ultra @-@ fast process .
Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , which has also reached the front line of the Estonian smar@@ t@@ phone , is a major e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant in the world of technology .
in the autumn , it will allow for a more ti@@ dal high @-@ speed char@@ ger , a more resilient , high @-@ quality camer@@ as and greater water and customs security .
he added that , on the basis of rum@@ ours , you can already specu@@ late and predict the four top models that are likely to be con@@ qu@@ ered by street sales .
these four smar@@ t@@ phone excellence models will reach po@@ e@@ lep@@ han@@ ts in the autumn of this year .
the long @-@ awaited i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach po@@ lep@@ han@@ ts in mid @-@ September .
however , what the new Apple model looks like , and what it can do , is spreading a lot .
if the i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not lead to significant differences between i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , Apple &apos;s tenth birth@@ day is expected to see the new model completely separate from previous ones .
there has been talk of four col@@ ours : black , white , ro@@ ck and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the entire telephone front , has lost their homes and fingerprints have been built on the scre@@ ens .
Apple &apos;s design director J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve demands that the new i@@ P@@ hone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk of the i@@ P@@ hone version .
in addition to the horizon , the un@@ man@@ age@@ able charging and even higher quality camer@@ as can be expected to accelerate the A@@ 11 process .
it is certainly one of the expected smart phones for one year .
a new model of G@@ ala@@ x@@ y is beginning on 23 August .
there has been a lot of rum@@ ours about what new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y is going to see .
Ad@@ mittedly , even more business users , and the S pen will allow even greater fun@@ ction@@ alities .
the Tele@@ fon@@ t should have two camer@@ as , one of which is a la@@ in@@ ur@@ k and the other with the same narrow view of television content .
at the moment , no one knows what two of the camer@@ as are capable of , but in any case , it is the first test of Sam@@ sun@@ g , which is certainly comparable to i@@ P@@ hone 8 in terms of quality .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August .
although Nokia has sold three smar@@ t@@ phones in this year with Nokia 6 , there is still a lack of their flag - Nokia 8 , which is already being presented on 16 August .
we are looking forward to 5.@@ 3 @-@ dust scre@@ ens and ultra @-@ fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ nap@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and a more resilient a@@ partment .
in the case of Nokia , there is also talk of alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and significant levels of water and customs security IP@@ 68 .
like Sam@@ su@@ ng@@ every , Nokia in the new model has two camer@@ a , which is produced by an opti@@ mist company Z@@ e@@ iss .
if S@@ ony &apos;s firm flag has been X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smar@@ t@@ phones will be added in the near future , with even more innovative functions .
we expect a smart phone that is slightly more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least the same good or better camer@@ as .
the new model of S@@ ony has been specu@@ lated that its screen is at least hot .
what is the reality is that we can already see the right thing , because traditionally S@@ ony has unve@@ iled its autumn flag vessel , at the international level of IFRS , which will take place on 1 @-@ 6 September this year .
according to the trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts le@@ ak@@ ed by telephone calls , T@@ ru@@ mp Mexico was forced to pay for the border wall .
the Washington post unve@@ iled the telephone calls between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i and Mexic@@ an and Austr@@ alian state leaders .
on 27 January , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ o , the President of Mexico , went to the President of Mexico , to put an end to public pro@@ claiming that he does not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President , with him , with his public condemnation of the wall , said : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ mp set out his presidential campaign to build a long selle@@ r and the age of the southern border of the United States , so that Mexico is paying for this project .
the trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts were also published in his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l , which reveals a ten@@ se debate .
the T@@ ru@@ mp said to Mr Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l that the agreement that the United States would take on refugees from Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; stu@@ pid &apos; , and he said that the agreement that was made during the Obama Government would give him the impression of a &apos; guide &apos; , because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the T@@ ru@@ mp ended the speech by telling the Tur@@ ks that &apos; this was the most un@@ pleasant speech of the day &apos; .
the Court of Justice did not take a complaint on the matter of the city of O@@ C MR@@ P in which the city of Tar@@ tu rejected their offer for bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 20@@ 29 .
this is a letter which was rejected by the O@@ C MR@@ P city of Tar@@ tu buses , as the offer did not meet the requirements , explained by An@@ neli A@@ pu@@ tin , the President of the Tar@@ tu City Service .
this is the procurement of intra @-@ Tar@@ tu cities for the period 0@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 @-@ 3@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
the city of MR@@ P Li@@ delegations referred to the Court of Justice for the decision of the Tar@@ tu Dis@@ tri@@ ct Court .
the national court did not take this process .
although many people in the social media complain that the We@@ ek@@ t F@@ esti@@ val is disrup@@ ting their night and the whole city is full of driving brak@@ es , there are also many who have no bad words about a lasting festi@@ val .
I am even positively surprised that the super@@ market was so poli@@ te !
I did not see any confusion or cour@@ tes@@ y .
even though I saw the word &apos; , a wonderful wave .
&quot; it is good that it is coming , there is , and it is known to be , the joy of the Per@@ sian , which has remained in winter , &quot; he will gla@@ dly add .
a wave of ty@@ rann@@ y is not destroyed .
if , in the middle of the city , he is still listening to mus@@ ici@@ ans being played in the ran@@ k , then the music has not yet arrived at his home .
&quot; but I hope that I hear , &apos; he will happily say &apos; .
Mrs Ag@@ nes , too , talks that the Grand festi@@ val is a good thing for the ski@@ es , which will make a good contribution to the turnover of local merchan@@ ts .
in addition , it welcomes the fact that the summer capital has come up with such a great deal .
the woman of Pe@@ ds is not a woman .
although I am no longer in the ran@@ k , but it is nice that rand has revi@@ ved .
and it is good that the people are moving and that has been the case three times , &apos; says a woman .
in the first case , I think it was a little worse .
&apos;@@ then perhaps there were complaints &apos; , he is wondering .
however , what is happening in the be@@ aches is normal for the summer capital cities .
&quot; this We@@ ek@@ ise is a very good pro@@ ph@@ mo for our small city , &quot; says Har@@ ri , who is hiding in the park .
life and m@@ ö@@ ll have also not been s@@ ounding his life .
but for that ?
we should all pull together .
think about how it would be better to communicate between nations .
after all , the music man is not black .
that is not the case , although I live near there .

Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts 3 000 jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revita@@ lise business
the British education company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that more than 3 000 jobs are being cut and reduces its interim dividen@@ ds by 72 % , by launching another restructuring programme to tackle the threat of business .
the jobs that are being created , according to John F@@ all@@ on , are likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , will be accompanied by 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring process .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced in May a plan to cut costs by another GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) under the third cost reduction programme ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) in order to try to revive business , which has been hit by the transition to digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell last month &apos;s participation in the Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House to its partner companies Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , said that their expectation in relation to the year has not changed since the 1 % increase in sales revenue was announced in the first half of the year to 2.@@ 05 billion .

terrorist attack in K@@ abu@@ l : suicide attack killed by NATO soldiers
the suicide bom@@ ber , according to officials , attacked military con@@ vo@@ ys in the capital of Afghanistan in K@@ abu@@ l , killing one NATO soldi@@ er and w@@ ounded several of you .
the NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to local reports , the city of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi has also been killed by three civilians .
this bom@@ bing is the last acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in the Her@@ ati mos@@ que attack .
on Monday , two people were killed in K@@ abu@@ l near the Iraqi emb@@ assy .
the NATO statement said that an explosion took place on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ ro@@ l with the Afghan army was attacked by &apos; man @-@ made explo@@ sive body &apos; .
according to the statement , everything has been injured in a stable state and is treated in the US military hospital in Bag@@ ra@@ m .
according to the Cor@@ respondents , the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( in Vietnam ) , are a serious source of concern for the forces in Bag@@ h@@ dad in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi .
according to the UN , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l mainly killed at least 30 people in K@@ abu@@ l .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed in the middle of a major bomb attack , which is the most deadly military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the President of the United States , Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , is considering whether to increase the number of US military and police forces .
according to the correspon@@ dent , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
the EPA repealed the decision to postpone the regulation after the shar@@ ks .
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA ) annul@@ led the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama Regulation , which obliges states to limit emissions from the summer , one day after the 15 states compla@@ ined to the Court of Justice .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday 2015 , saying that it shows the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our national partners and listen to them , &quot; said Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t in a statement by the head of the EPA .
the P@@ ru@@ it@@ t had announced the intention of the EPA in June to postpone the rates of share@@ holder content to be measured in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to meet the highest standard of air quality in 2018 .
the 15 mainly democratic states , together with C@@ olum@@ bia , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
the government of President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations imposed by the former President Barack Obama , which , according to T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , is part of a broader plan for growth .
however , these efforts have led to the reactions of the democrats and nature conservation groups , who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that the brea@@ thing of air containing ozone can reduce the ability of lun@@ g to work and increase the risk of res@@ pira@@ tory diseases , such as as@@ th@@ ma .

&quot; the quality of the content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said A@@ gra@@ vis R@@ ai@@ ff@@ e@@ en &apos;s analysis of Mr Bern@@ hard Chil@@ la .

the German farmers , like their European colleagues , have been exposed to any weather this year .

it has to be pointed out that the black , white and grey links , if they are supplemented by the wood ton@@ es and to@@ wer plants , can be very desperate .

M@@ sole y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ lon@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should be on a col@@ lisi@@ on course in order to face up to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg in the most attractive po@@ ker in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in the ES@@ P@@ N office in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ le@@ in , until Gar@@ cia , the winner of the World Bo@@ un@@ ch Coun@@ c@@ il , at the other end of the corridor , to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , World Bo@@ un@@ ch sul@@ g@@ weigh@@ ch .
following the unanimous decision of the Gar@@ cia , the victory of the former four @-@ time world champion , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er , on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ time , both comb@@ at@@ ants belong to the top of the table .
Mr Gar@@ cia extended his better hand and said : &apos; how does the summer go , the champion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko will protect his bel@@ ts against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 ES@@ P@@ N .
when a couple of photo@@ graph@@ s were present , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko &apos;s memory , E@@ g Kli@@ mas , said that a possible confrontation between the mili@@ tants would be &apos; perfect &apos; .
&quot; I am a former consul@@ tant , &quot; recalled Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I called for B@@ ron@@ er &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small about 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move down@@ wards .
and he must move towards a ligh@@ ter weight &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the F@@ ans have requested this .
let us give them this . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
in the climate , the question raised was whether it should be worthwhile to look at it , and it is part of its strategy that he wants to allow the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to debate the end of this year with 6@@ 1.2 kg in the class to make it possible for the next summer to meet with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ vans ) , who also have an interest in combating Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ li &apos;s match with the winner of the For@@ u@@ um of 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as the f@@ ans have called for this confrontation , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , saying later that he is open to fighting any channel that offers the best financial package .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name is able to attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Mr Gar@@ cia said that he must see L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t as &apos; troops &apos; and can go to his des@@ k on Saturday .
however , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was modest in pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia , saying that he felt that the three di@@ vis@@ s from the Ri@@ ver@@ pool were &apos; very slow &apos; ; I apologise , M@@ lon@@ y ... you wanted it to be no@@ distant .
according to Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show strength and then to bo@@ y .
both confirmed that they feel that the tension between them is increasing .
&quot; this is the fight that awa@@ its the realisation .
no other confrontation does not bring so much attention and s@@ lan@@ der .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters and M@@ lon@@ y is just that .
this is a good fight . &quot;
what are the world &apos;s events going to Estonia ?
it extended and issued a record of more than 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work , study or family .
if , for example , the soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit for 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , the figure was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the agencies cannot say how many immigrants will finally remain in Estonia , but this analysis will be drawn up in the Ministry of the Interior .
when nearly 500 Ukrainians per year ago in Estonia a year ago , this figure will close to 2 000 in recent years .
the number of applicants for a residence permit increased expon@@ enti@@ ally during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014 , 10@@ 87 people were granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit , up to 6@@ 75 .
according to the statistical office , we have the highest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than left .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has had a great deal of time in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many of the family are already in front of the family , the spokes@@ person of the Ministry of the Interior , Kris@@ tin Ram@@ mus .
the number of Ukrainian citizens who have been granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens , even though in 10 years the most fixed @-@ term residence permits have been issued .
if the Ukrainians come to work here , Russia &apos;s citizens will be on family migration .
&quot; in view of this historic Russian community , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with the people living in Russia , &quot; said Hel@@ ina Me@@ use , the Internal Protection A@@ ca@@ de@@ my .
&quot; if you look at where the Russian citizens who have been able to live in the country of residence have moved to , then , after Har@@ ju@@ land , the East Vir@@ u@@ land is immediately , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them have been mar@@ ried with the citizens of the European Union .
the Mul@@ ti @-@ term residence permit received 16@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased .
&quot; compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested to be established permanently in Estonia , &quot; explained by the press representative of the Ministry of the Interior , Ram@@ on , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years .
a new residence permit for Estonia will be able to apply for at least three years for foreigners who have been living here since last year .
its aim is to encourage the eman@@ cip@@ ation of people who have been adapted .
however , a long @-@ term residence permit requires five years , for example .
for the new residence permit , the extension of the old residence permit has obviously been reduced .
for example , the soil was granted a residence permit for 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to change their work and the Estonian state will no longer be pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit became popular - applicants are still holders of a grey passport ( 10@@ 29 ) , Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , individuals ( 54 ) and n@@ ig@@ er@@ ans ( 36 ) .
a total of 19@@ 68 people , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and the same number of Chinese , were able to live in Estonia for the purpose of residence .
the first half of this year has already been set at 12@@ 69 .
in 10 years , surpris@@ ingly , Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for the Estonian residence permit .
when three residence permits were issued in 2007 , the soil was 200 .
there are lessons to be learned from Nigeria in this university .
Estonia &apos;s higher education institutions are also popular , for example , among Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely thanks to learning games .
for them , too , the rule is that where the community has arisen , there will be more easily others &apos; , in addition to Ram@@ alla@@ h .
in ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , it is about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if the citizens of the European Union are concerned , migration will remain around a percentage , &quot; commented on the fact that the figures are in fact small .
in total , 14 8@@ 22 people died in Estonia , according to the statistical office , 13 7@@ 92 .
this means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration .
most of them are the citizens of Estonia , but more of them are among those who leave them .
this is why Estonia &apos;s citizens &apos; migration secret with 2 000 people was in decline .
Est@@ oni@@ ans , in particular , mig@@ rate between Finland and Estonia .
M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture Pr@@ inc@@ ess of C@@ ou@@ ture tri@@ cks with sa@@ ts , chic@@ k@@ ens and t@@ we@@ ed
however , in the North West of ideas , Maria Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u , there is history - old pain@@ ting and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream of a few hours somewhere in the muse@@ um and ad@@ m@@ ire the old @-@ fashi@@ oned thi@@ ev@@ es .
if you are going to do something , you will study and learn about it every day .
this is a joy of disco@@ very !
the world of C@@ ou@@ ture , which is long ago , may seem to be alien to some , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourself decide how much you are in your life !
as a friend , I have a friend , who has a whole sa@@ il full of the cou@@ ture of the shar@@ ks that I have created .
because , and it is not his fault , he does not live in the Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ oo@@ d and does not go on a red bed every day , he wants to wear the most beautiful bro@@ kers , and he is suffering !
you can live a special life for their lives .
the ar@@ tist does not recognise the gap between the sh@@ ining events and the grey day .
it is this reasoning that put the rolling stock in Estonia into rural areas , between forests and fields , to people , who often do not reach the m@@ ood .
for example , the College was presented in comparison , for example , in J@@ air , and at the y@@ ard@@ stick , where 45 mo@@ del@@ l Ro@@ yal de@@ fi@@ le@@ e filled the whole street .
in Tallinn , there is often a shop in a shop , a young person , but there are more emo@@ tions elsewhere - s@@ log@@ vo , rising up , you want to thank you .
a large part of the audience was just as news , but now they are the f@@ ans of the M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture .
if you over@@ shoo@@ t people &apos;s expectations , they are spiri@@ ted !
and I like this feeling that I am in my mo@@ tive like the summer .
Per@@ nus was a 50 @-@ me@@ tre red car@@ pet , a whole street full of stic@@ kers , it seemed that they would not come to an end !
Mrs Maria also does not recognise the mo@@ tive that animal creation must be presented by a super@@ ficial super@@ ficial , she will be happy to bring ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always been happy .
that is , after all , the experience , the island of the ice cur@@ tain , which was wonderful .
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen my role , always behind the ground , to give things the last meat as a hope@@ less act .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow cal@@ mly to look at the Chamber .
Mrs Maria is this type of motto , who does not just want to play a representative role , but to be involved in everything .
I have my sis@@ ter machine , most of the colle@@ ctions myself .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to discover .
I am never far from my animal , and I am not afraid of work .
it is not limited to any matter , but also to the style , logistics , organisation , organisation - everyone has to ju@@ mp off the day of a woman &apos;s day .
for these hours of work , the fana@@ tics are still enormously .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a day full of joy !
I have been very lu@@ cky - it is like an un@@ stop@@ p@@ able jo@@ ke : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compli@@ ments .
it has been said many times that my bro@@ kers have a land - they make themselves feel like a printing .
the gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ ous lines that Maria talen@@ ts made overnight have long been a signal of C@@ ou@@ ture sign@@ alling to date .
Mr Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p U@@ 18 boys : the weapon of the Est@@ oni@@ ans was now turned against us .
the damage , the fair@@ y@@ tale , ran out .
the first thing was that we did not get our table .
and if there is such a big difference in the table , there is nothing to do with the Estonian U@@ 18 cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ po@@ ts 61 : 75 in Britain , our only N@@ B@@ RA has played a cor@@ v@@ ball , BC Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p .
opponents adopted 28 Pal@@ ace and received so much more attacks from the wave of attacks .
we were also not prepared for their aggressive defence or attack , it created .
many of the attacks on the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
however , in defence , they were able to keep their hands everywhere , we could not combine .
it created the team from its feet .
the anti @-@ domestic work was better done .
according to M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ pa , Estonia would have to make more tac@@ tical errors in order to take up the anti @-@ insur@@ gency .
the last quarter - we had a zero mistake , but the opponents have already received a number of quick harves@@ ts .
In@@ ad@@ missi@@ bility and a close offensive , which was our weapon in the al@@ ag@@ ro@@ pi@@ l , now all of us were opposed to .
today we did not have the strength of their aggressive behaviour .
the M@@ y@@ r@@ la@@ p remained satisfied with its neg@@ ligence in Kal@@ ev@@ is , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s .
security in general can say good words about the whole team , to date there was a single blow to the whole of the team .
it is a pity that such an aggressive response has not been met earlier .
T@@ as@@ s has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but it seemed that he was ti@@ red - he has borne quite a heavy burden .
however , he made a very fine move , which I have seen in the past in the past , &apos; , in addition to the lead .
the terrible figures : the E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ r concentration thre@@ w less than 10 points ...
the U@@ 18 age class does not only apply to the young men B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ tur@@ ni@@ ir in Tallinn , who started in Dublin yesterday .
and Estonia &apos;s game with Poland , unfortunately , is in the area of anti@@ qu@@ ity .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , there was 9 : 49 , or only in the last ten minutes , opponents of the gas family and 16 : 16 : 16 .
both in the first and second quarter , Estonia 4 , third point ...
at the same time , in the first two minutes , the Est@@ oni@@ ans hit two pieces of the first two pieces , but there are 25 pieces of the game , then one of the tri@@ alogues , and then 21 others ...
perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 fin@@ gers were tab@@ oo .
in addition , 2 points came from four non @-@ negoti@@ able .
there was a reasonable number of losses in this time , 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland was 33 and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , on the opening day , to recognise Portugal &apos;s 83 : 56 better .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement the stocks
today , the NATO @-@ 1 permanent group of mines arrived in Tallinn for a week &apos;s planned port visit to Tallinn , in order to supplement the stocks of ships and prepare for pre @-@ presu@@ med habits .
in the course of the visit , ships are preparing for the landing of the sea , giving cre@@ ws the opportunity for a pa@@ ari@@ table holiday .
after the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future historical explo@@ sive operations .
&quot; the participation of Est@@ oni@@ ans in NATO and their co @-@ operation in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the alli@@ ed forces , &quot; said Ar@@ to Rein@@ land , the chief of the operation and planning of the overseas fleet .
since 29 June , NATO will run a permanent mine group from the Latvian naval group , G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , who took over the tasks of a group of Estonian naval officers at a ceremony in Riga from the cap@@ ten@@ ant Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as Sel@@ ja@@ b .
the group &apos;s flag vessel is L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , a Latvian naval force , which also operates as a group leader .
this semester is also part of the Estonian naval mine me@@ al and anti @-@ Caspian region .
as one of the four groups of NATO naval forces under the auspices of NATO , NATO is a permanent mine group of primary rapid reaction teams , which can be sent to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - On 13 August , the P@@ iri@@ ta mon@@ as@@ tery &apos;s mu@@ tu@@ r &apos;s silence will once again become a place where Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has been carried out 13 years ago by Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ las@@ ta .
this year &apos;s Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val can be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented , according to the F@@ esti@@ val of the artistic leader of the city of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
the risk to J@@ oo@@ st : Cuba will reach the class of the &apos; Tra@@ vi@@ ata &apos; and &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; , &apos; bal@@ le@@ ti@@ la@@ e &apos; and &apos; Car@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ in &apos; , and there is also no shortage of its own production , which is , this time , Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ n &apos;s wonderful or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra &apos; A@@ asta@@ times &apos; , by the same international creative team , who brought the P@@ iri@@ ta to the Hague in 2015 . &quot;
Mrs F@@ esti@@ val has much more than just concer@@ ts and theat@@ re answers .
it is more than any music theat@@ re in its normal form .
it is a festi@@ val that takes power and never gets rid of it .
because experience , which can be heard in this sup@@ erior and sal@@ va@@ ble environment , puts human s@@ oul and concerns human beings in a way that cannot be described .
for the first year , you are the art leader of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
did the ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ las@@ kin@@ s not feel a little big ?
of course , as I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , there has been a lot of help .
he went through my entire student career and also supported a career in the beginning of the adjustment .
perhaps it is thanks to this that it is easier for me to continue his work .
in K@@ las , so much good and , of course , it will be passed on to Burma &apos;s F@@ esti@@ val team .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going .
it is precisely the great heart of E@@ ri K@@ ars , who also gave me the strength to go ahead with the F@@ esti@@ val of Tallinn in harmony with Burma .
and here I am now and I can do it !
what could the audience at the F@@ esti@@ val today , which you offer in particular ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , as a surprise , the first bal@@ le@@ tt , written by Mrs L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i , will come to the fore .
this is &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson l@@ ent &apos; .
and one of the no@@ torious nu@@ ances in this regard is that the author of this bal@@ le@@ l is the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser , J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ sons , who himself expressed a desire to write it .
apparently , he has already lived in the Car@@ l@@ sson of Kar@@ l@@ sson .
to the risk , how are you all the nu@@ ances ?
thanks to my support for life , I certainly do .
this work needs a system of support and a lot of love , and it is fortuna@@ te to me .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tions do not depend so much on the other people , as I do myself , in other words , how I am going against every new day .
and this awareness of the tone , the preservation of the positive nature and , in fact , the na@@ ming of ourselves in the mir@@ ror of the morning , has made a significant increase in my happy percentage .
in particular , this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen to practise it and it works .
the na@@ ming of one@@ self is an act of a@@ mus@@ ing and raising the tone .
that is not just a word .
I think that people are not yet aware of the body that the univer@@ se offers to them , but each of them will be able to discover it slowly .
right now , it is an important moment .
is there any ri@@ tual before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ d has been taken ?
there are still , clothing must be replaced against more convenient .
this is a small moment for ourselves .
however , in general , I do not have the opportunity to make a pu@@ mp or a small stra@@ w before .
in fact , I even like to engage actively with people , even before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di@@ um took place .
but come to the F@@ esti@@ val of Bir@@ git@@ ta , what is also to be discovered here is not particularly large @-@ scale and bal@@ le@@ ans .

in Sweden , among the asylum applicants , the most recent results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the constitution was assessed by the parents than 18 , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for medicine ( R@@ om@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started with tests at the beginning of this year .
the tests were set up in order to assess the age of age more accurately , after the Swedish Authority for Migration ( I@@ OM ) criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of many allegedly minors .
up to now , 68 cases have been sent to the tests by Mig@@ ran@@ s@@ ver , and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 24 81 tests between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed for 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older , and in 25 cases , the Institute of medicine assessed that the test &quot; may be 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older . &quot;
the 4@@ 32 cases concluded that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if the age of the person is questioned .
according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son , the Institute of Justice , the results are consistent with those of previous months .
&quot; we do not see a great difference compared with the statistics in previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &apos; he said to the newspaper The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as an older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been able to choose their age .
the Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that in 4@@ 42 cases &apos; there are references to the fact that a research@@ er is 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson ska Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the results of their 581 test , it became clear that in 2@@ 43 cases , a person had declared directly that this year would be 18 .
this medical age assessment method , which is carried out by r@@ ö@@ n@@ t@@ gen@@ i@@ ters of smart me@@ ters and fields of MR@@ T , and then they will be allowed to be analysed by dental doctors and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts , has been criticised in some circles .
one of the sceptics is the endo@@ k@@ rin@@ olo@@ gist of the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute , Claude Mar@@ cus , whose work includes an assessment of people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through the normal audience sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say firmly , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he said &apos; to the newspaper &apos; forestry .
but Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son , the Institute of medicine , defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that the risk of in@@ accurate adults is low .
most of all , perhaps around 10 % of the risk is if the person is a little under 18 . &quot;
9 signs that you could for@@ give you for more expensive talent .
you are more expensive on Friday and spent a night with someone else .
Su@@ l is wrong , because you have so many nice times and memor@@ ies together .
I would like to for@@ give him , but is it the right time ...
Y@@ our Tan@@ go lists nine signs that show that you are more expensive to regret and could for@@ give him .
it seems to be more expensive to understand the seriousness of the situation and to work hard to resolve it .
the more expensive thing is to deal with the problem that led him to the stream of another .
you are no longer in a defen@@ sive position .
he sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for his actions .
he is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
it agrees that it has made a serious mistake and genuinely tries to improve the situation .
he is attentive and is trying to communicate with you .
at the same time , he is pressing you to get over the matter .
they do not deny what has happened or try to make it un@@ noticed .
Su@@ l and you have a more expensive understanding of why your in@@ loy@@ alty to you was born .
you are talking about this and also about how to avoid it in the future .
you will better communicate and assess each other &apos;s needs .
your more expensive attitude and actions have helped to develop our condolences against his mis@@ carriage .

the 20 @-@ year @-@ old new@@ er , Anna Maria O@@ rel , made the London M@@ M@@ il beautiful debate , with 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 3@@ 7@@ with a good 18 seats .
Mr O@@ rel was M@@ M no@@ ori@@ m and a jo@@ y@@ ful woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for med@@ als in the future .
the contest went well and received good experience .
with the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , I immediately made my medium @-@ term result , the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) risk too much and the third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) I have been able to keep it very clear , &quot; said O@@ rel after the contest .
I had my own emissions and I am very pleased that I found it .
Anna Maria O@@ re@@ li M@@ M &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 seats .
the Vi@@ h@@ mas@@ ad@@ u O@@ reli@@ t did not mix , because he is training him through the TEC stage .
&apos;@@ I am afraid &apos; , he said a little bit .
the London Olympic Games had almost a full house of the people , did the O@@ rel rec@@ lai@@ m people or were able to turn themselves off ?
I was in a positive sense , but in a positive sense .
everyone says that it will add - that is the case !
if it is to compete , it can be experienced .
he then confirmed that he will be satisfied with the M@@ M debate and he is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 3@@ 2nd outcome of this year &apos;s season , the final outcome , I finished 18 .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and M@@ il - that is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of the med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina ku@@ ber@@ ner announced party exchanges
the Governor of the Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a Democrat , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ a , that he will change the parties .
&quot; this or not , but the democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today , I say to you , having veto@@ ed and thought ... today , I say to you , the West , that I cannot help you as a democratic Governor . &quot;
at the mer@@ cy of the sitting , the de@@ vil is happy .
&quot; so I will be a Re@@ publi@@ can tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a engine@@ er , I would say to you that it is time to play a second game . &quot;
the T@@ ru@@ mp had pledged a major announcement in the past at the meeting of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
T@@ ru@@ mp won 42 points in Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and Justice did not support the candidate for the democrats , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
Justice , which is the only billion sta@@ r in the state , according to the Ford , proved to be elected in 2016 .
in the wilderness , it notes that it is owned by coal mines in five states and that it is quite self @-@ employed by coal .
his value is approximately USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday evening , the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) published a statement that &apos; the party exchange of Governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic par@@ ade that would rather prevent the country from improving again than working on it &apos; .
&quot; just 15 months , and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent wake @-@ up to you , which is the way to the end of the day and cannot find a positive and united message , &quot; said R@@ N@@ C representation , R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ Daniel statement C@@ B@@ S New@@ si .
it is not surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
Ur@@ met , who is in office in the We@@ ek@@ ise medical axis yesterday , said that the pos@@ ters have had to be distributed quite a lot .
Vil@@ ls and mar@@ ches are fundamental , ex@@ cus@@ es and easy fall .
of course , it is also the case , in ab@@ sen@@ tia and sho@@ es .
according to Ur@@ me@@ ti , visitors will come to the festi@@ val with false foot@@ wear and so the problems will come .
the media have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic and also one of the foot@@ wear .
we have also made a ble@@ s@@ sing when someone has done a hand or a finger .
we are doing less here , we are going to send a hospital .

Co@@ e praised the honest apolo@@ gies of the Russians for the anti @-@ doping scandal .
the international r@@ ally of the Ker@@ ge@@ an , S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , praised , according to his words , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apolo@@ gy &apos; for the &apos; doping &apos; scandal , but reiterated that it is not time to allow sport to be returned to the country .
at the eve of the World C@@ up on D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin , the Russian fri@@ vol@@ ta@@ tor , the IA@@ AF Congress , said that the ban on the competition imposed on his country is right and has a firm aim to combat doping .
he has apolog@@ ised for &apos; all the ligh@@ ters of gold and sil@@ ver med@@ als &apos; in competitions . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of leaving the ban on the entry into force of the competition which was introduced in November 2015 after the report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think it was a very honest answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to journalists .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were satisfied that the Russian Federation also recognised that they have had quite difficult times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Union . &quot;
according to Co@@ e , he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for self @-@ determination .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place , but Congress supports the proposal for a working group that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything possible in the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want clean ath@@ le@@ tes to be separated from the system , &apos; he added .
Eigh@@ teen Russian ligh@@ ters who meet the strict criteria of the IA@@ AF are competing with neutral ath@@ le@@ tes in London on Friday .
the head of the IA@@ AF Group , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of criteria for forecas@@ ting .
following a presentation by the IA@@ AF to the Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that trained engineers are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution makes a significant difference to the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
little because the revolution in electric cars makes a significant difference to the fuel market up to infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although mining gi@@ ants like G@@ len@@ core can say that they will win from one place and lose another , smaller mining companies will not help .
at the moment , G@@ len@@ core coal and oil , but in the era of electric cars , there will be a growing demand for co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ kel .
this year , the decisions of the UK , France and Norway , which allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades , have contributed to the spread of electric cars .
therefore , Vol@@ vo has already been aware that they are planning to abandon the combustion engine , and T@@ es@@ la will bring a cheaper country 3 electric car to the market .
B@@ animal berg , according to the New Energy Finance forecasts , electric cars are already sold over two decades more than cars using oil @-@ produced fuels .
&quot; for some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ ini B@@ animal berg .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as co@@ balt and li@@ thi@@ um , which have increased demand for years .
in electric cars , there are approximately three times more cop@@ per than in the ordinary car , the G@@ len@@ core .
even more answers are needed at charging stations , which is why the Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that it will increase the demand for around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ gan@@ ese demand .
the G@@ len@@ core can increase the profits of electric cars from cop@@ per prices and the fact that there is the world &apos;s largest producer of co@@ balt , forecast J@@ eff@@ itative Group .
according to this bro@@ ker company , the winners of the second wave of electric cars will be winners of F@@ bet@@ e @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ mas Min@@ er@@ als .
the market is already reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of the London me@@ tal stock exchange rate has been mixed .
the price of soil was 37 % .
the answer has also been 14 % this year , mainly due to economic growth .
the G@@ len@@ core excise duty rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price rise to the ri@@ val Rio T@@ into Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ oni and Ang@@ lo .
on the side of the losers , lead companies such as Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine , who have to adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ use of the P@@ li@@ i is the bat@@ teries of petrol and diesel cars with the influx of cars .
electric cars are used by gla@@ ci@@ ers .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes , which could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael W@@ id@@ mer , the Bank of America Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ ch , the head of analysis of the metal@@ lic market .
the impact of the P@@ li@@ i price movement has not yet been noticed in the form of a se@@ am@@ less trend .
the P@@ li@@ i is 17 % this year , with the best methane me@@ tal in London among the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems for me@@ tal in the future .
&quot; I am not sure that it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition , &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the head of the me@@ tal company Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ si .
if the lead demand falls , it will be slow .
this may be the case in about ten years &apos; time .
in the meantime , stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which is more frequent dependent on advanced lead @-@ based bat@@ teries , will be assessed by international lead and by the investigative organisation .
Ker@@ g@@ metal@@ lic , like alu@@ mini@@ um , is replaced by steel , as a ligh@@ ter car can go beyond electricity .
this explains the additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes from 2013 to 2016 .
this represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s output of alu@@ mini@@ um .
this trend is likely to grow , says W@@ id@@ mer .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um is responsible for 13 % this year , as the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
steel producers do not .
the blockade is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful cars .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and S@@ hal@@ Europe are also trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down in order to oppose the minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris , Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to a pla@@ te .
it took around half of this precious me@@ tal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , announced by the me@@ tal re@@ fin@@ er Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ ta .
&quot; many of the high @-@ demand raw materials such as oil and pla@@ te may not have a great deal of demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
the Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ makers believe continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Mr Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , leader of the Un@@ core , said that in 20@@ 25 , more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from cars .
the great hope of the Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ at@@ makers in the 10 @-@ year perspective is To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ mun@@ i Mo@@ to@@ si , based on hydrogen @-@ based cars , which depend on a pos@@ ter to produce electricity from hydrogen .
so far , however , this technology has not yet been commercially justified .
&quot; it seems to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris from Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers received a major set@@ back in July , as S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art &apos;s court banned the use of diesel in the city of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how football &apos;s financial rules affect the transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the ram@@ pan@@ t spending of European football clubs do not prevent the world &apos;s record transition from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona club Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences for UEFA , the governing body , which domin@@ ates the European game and in its power to ban teams from the pres@@ ti@@ gious League of Me@@ is@@ ters , are still waiting for the Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ May .
the financial rules for the fair play of UEFA in 2011 ( F@@ F@@ P ) mean that the PS@@ G will have to prove at some point that the transition to Ney@@ ra was funded without a huge loss .
EUR 2@@ 22 million were paid to Barcelona ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) alone for buying the Brazili@@ ans out of his contract , and the salary of Ney@@ ra will reach tens of millions of dollars per year .
here are some of the financial aspects of moving to the French club .
the PS@@ G is undoubtedly possible for the recruitment of Mrs Ney@@ ra and for adding such money to the clo@@ ak of its sta@@ rs , given that the team is funded by the family governing the Ka@@ tar of Energy .
clubs have been allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players , but they have to balance this with legal sources of income that allow them to come out of a football business .
F@@ F@@ F@@ P was set up by Michel Pla@@ tini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs , who are in the search for success in large debt , are actually dealing with fraud and risk buying when banks or owners should give up their support .
since 2011 , the F@@ F@@ P club will focus on monitoring their losses instead of their debts .
this change means that the business model that Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch used first in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ sea - to buy a club with the potential and then to make huge costs to make the team better and to create a global brand - is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of the F@@ F@@ P , which runs until 2018 , the clubs will be able to bear the losses of up to EUR 30 million .
and despite the fact that Pla@@ tini was dis@@ credi@@ ted by the presidential office in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , is still committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; F@@ F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said the previous week , Mr Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is the guardian of UEFA &apos;s F@@ F@@ P .
although the PS@@ G for the purchase clause of Ney@@ mar@@ i as one of the full payments , they will be able to distribute this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the agreement .
Mr Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it is possible to show a transitional fee of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
for the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G , together with Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , received the most severe penalties on Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga .
the PS@@ G was fined EUR 60 million ( currently 82 million dollar ) , which was reduced later to EUR 20 million , and the club was required to limit the team of the League of Me@@ is@@ ters for the 2014 @-@ 2015 season to 21 players instead of 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs who can try to regulate the financial institutions , blow@@ ing their income through companies connected with the owners of the club .
the company of Q@@ a@@ tar may spon@@ sor the PS@@ G , but if the value of spon@@ sorship is considered to be standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
this was the case in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar tourism Authority had the value of the PS@@ G support .
it has been said that a certain part of the PS@@ G services can come from Q@@ a@@ tar through contributions from the World C@@ up Board of 20@@ 22 .
however , the PS@@ G and Q@@ a@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ ra could become a world champi@@ on@@ ship and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities are able to easily expose such manoeuv@@ res .
the penalties previously imposed on the PS@@ G mean that UEFA is even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
the people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not been proactive in discussing the transition with the PS@@ G .
they talked about the associated forum , provided that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , because they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PS@@ G .
the latest reports show that the PS@@ G 2015 @-@ 2016 season will generate more than € 10 million in profits of around € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the figures for the last financial year have not yet been published .
the PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ ra will have a good impact on spon@@ sorship transactions , trade and s@@ nus .
the club looks forward to an increase of at least 30 per cent of the turnover of the agreement .
Spain too , having clearly irri@@ tated the departure of one of the largest football sta@@ rs , tried to prevent the transition by claiming that the PS@@ G is in breach of F@@ F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with a club and a country , &quot; said La li President Javier T@@ eb@@ as AS , referring to the fact that the PS@@ G belongs mainly to Q@@ a@@ tar .
the Ar@@ sen@@ al mountain , Ar@@ ch@@ ger W@@ en@@ ger , whose club belongs to the American sports mag@@ na@@ te , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights and it has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; if a club belongs to a country , everything can be done .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a major player . &quot;

today , 50 years ago , the or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra@@ ted storm in Estonia , which fo@@ iled houses and win@@ dows .
the or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra of the century , which , on 6 and 7 August , caused major damage in particular to the West , Har@@ ju@@ land and Rap@@ la@@ land .
in the course of these days in Estonia , the wind was over 30 m / s .
in my old drink in Ba@@ vari@@ a , a hand@@ ful of bot@@ tles from one card to another , and over@@ laps with them to support them .
everything was blind and ra@@ g@@ ne , like the world stage .
T@@ aa@@ mal has already been kno@@ cking on houses , in 2002 , the old Mrs L@@ inda K@@ uro@@ va , recalled the magaz@@ ine of Estonian nature in an interview with Estonia .
the L@@ inda spo@@ use saw how the plan@@ ted a@@ xes collapsed .
but what are you going to do with your hands , where are you going against such a storm ?
the sea came under the window , from the win@@ dows in the water , &apos; Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us Kal@@ da , who has lived on the streets , spoke of Mrs L@@ inda at the time .
the fact that the roads were full and the ro@@ ck of the railway station had been flying to 20 @-@ 30 metres , L@@ inda most of the Haiti@@ ans , just like the next morning .
according to the local authorities , the cages behind the Par@@ ale@@ pa were lagging behind , some of the very long @-@ term , some boys .
everyone saw very de@@ pressing , the storm went through the beautiful old trees as a ra@@ da@@ r and pragmatism , like war .
Western Vir@@ u@@ land was not particularly badly affected by August 1967 , compared with the West Estonia , but the losses were large there , the Vir@@ u@@ land Official Journal wrote in 2007 .
Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ u L@@ fossil Par@@ k and P@@ ad@@ ise Par@@ k were swe@@ pt away from the ground , but also our own par@@ ks were severely affected .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured by up to 35 metres per second , or around 130 kilometres per hour .
in Tallinn M@@ eri@@ expression was one of the te@@ ars of lead in the evening of 6.@@ August : &apos; mother , mother !
the channel is in the air and no longer , &quot; wrote Vir@@ u@@ maa Official Journal .
at the time of the storm in Vil@@ j@@ an@@ di@@ land , the concept of the generational building was so that it was decided to be disman@@ tled later .
the August pipeline did not have to be opposed to the design of the T@@ ü@@ ri ski moun@@ tains , which were later not restored .
the newspaper Red T@@ bl@@ t wrote on 12 August 19@@ 7 that the restoration of towns and settlements from the trees and their vehicles is progressing slowly , and the people could be involved in the cor@@ ro@@ gation .
in Tu@@ rin , fer@@ tility crops were also severely affected , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party @-@ based organisations must be both an incentive and a gu@@ ide@@ line for cor@@ ps and fer@@ tility &apos; .
Or@@ ka@@ an@@ ides can be said if the average wind speed exceeds 3@@ 2.7 m / s .

on the island of V@@ ain@@ d@@ story , a me@@ tre of measu@@ re@@ ments , so it was not possible to register the speed of a strong wind .
secret bathing areas : night cleaning and poor coast@@ line
the more expensive summer weather also means less cor@@ ro@@ tation in the be@@ aches of Tallinn .
&quot; if there is no , people are in the ran@@ k , and if there is no , there are no people , then the be@@ er is saying .
in the S@@ tro@@ om of Northern Tallinn S@@ tro@@ om .
they are offered by a me@@ chan@@ ical competition in the low @-@ turn tra@@ ctor , which is a threshold for a pla@@ card to the tri@@ ck .
in fact , the last seven cent goes through the dep@@ ths of the sand , pic@@ king it out of sea lit@@ ter and people left behind : pu@@ mps , cigarettes and others .
people are still coming to ran@@ k , regardless of whether water is so@@ rely or not .
if there is a beau@@ ty , then people are in the ran@@ k , and if there is no , there are no people , &apos; says Alexander U@@ so@@ v , the head of the private company &apos; , the management of the Ha@@ ab@@ er@@ sti .
at 6.@@ 30 p.m. and ran@@ k , there is a bitter repetition of the work , because at 8 o &apos;@@ clock , the pos@@ ter must be in order for the people .
the U@@ so@@ v is already at four o &apos;@@ clock .
apart from S@@ tro@@ om , he is still keeping an eye on the P@@ iri@@ ta , Har@@ ku La@@ ke , Ka@@ ku@@ mä@@ e and Pal@@ ar@@ a@@ are P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ari .
the amounts of Prüm have fallen .
years ago , it was much more .
people will now be able to assess what is being done for them , &quot; says U@@ so@@ v , who has harves@@ ted 15 years .
before it was the case that , when something new had been put up , it was already the next day .
now , what is already being kept in the ran@@ k .
price of clean be@@ ach
one of the biggest jobs in Estonia &apos;s be@@ aches is the b@@ reat@@ h of rub@@ b@@ ish , or ad@@ ru harves@@ ting .
for example , there must be 400 000 tonnes of coast@@ line in the P@@ iri@@ ta coast .
&quot; this is un@@ beli@@ evable , &quot; notes the U@@ so@@ v .
the second major category is municipal waste , all of which people leave behind .
there are eight major rub@@ b@@ ish sein@@ ers in S@@ tro@@ om &apos;s coast , which need to be watered down three times a week .
so much is the waste .
however , cold summer weather has meant that rub@@ b@@ ish is a fifth less than otherwise .
the third species are abandoned .
in most cases , these are children &apos;s TV .
as a result , the U@@ so@@ v sand has pul@@ led out ten metres of slu@@ dge .
they will remain waiting for the owners of timber to be lan@@ ded .
&quot; they usually come out more , but it is a normal harvest . &quot; U@@ so@@ v is already aware that it will soon find them back in the sand .
children come to ran@@ k and take toys to re@@ in@@ sta@@ ll them .
the landfill is broken down .
Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler , the representative of the administrative services , admitted that the work of the tra@@ ctor is disrup@@ ting local communities .
noise , which runs from night to night hours , is confusing the people living in the neighbourhood .
on the day , however , this work is impossible .
in one month , we have two times to go through the war .
&quot; if we do not do this , the city will be fined , &quot; notes Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
however , the aim is , like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ak@@ r and Per@@ sian , to get S@@ tro@@ om rand under the quality of the international flag .
&quot; compared with Europe , there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that be@@ aches are maintained , &quot; says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more ad@@ ru and more stone , and it is more difficult for us to live in the sand .
however , we have less rub@@ b@@ ish than elsewhere in Europe .
when I hear that there is talk of rub@@ b@@ ish in the ran@@ k , the conver@@ sa@@ tions between the journalist and the cor@@ ro@@ gation staff living near S@@ tro@@ om are un@@ wit@@ ting@@ ly , highlighting the current bottlenecks .
there is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is with birds and wood sla@@ ves who have pul@@ led the rub@@ b@@ ish bags &apos; , Martin .
although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the rub@@ b@@ ish and , for example , put them on the ro@@ of@@ s to prevent at least birds there from the news .
in general , however , Martin is satisfied with the development of S@@ tro@@ om .
it can be seen that the city is taking care of this .
it has become more pleasant with children &apos;s fields , enligh@@ tened and fresh as@@ ph@@ alt .
it was never the case that there was only one way to travel on the ground , &quot; notes Mr Martin .
findings of the village in S@@ tro@@ om@@ is : coins , only coins
a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Dimit@@ r , who , as a ar@@ bi@@ ter , is sa@@ iling the coast@@ line with a me@@ chan@@ ical me@@ tal , has had to be exploited .
he does not believe that , today and in the future , nothing will be found in the price .

&quot; I have been dealing with this year and I have not found anything worthwhile so far , &quot; says D@@ mit@@ ry .
as a ref@@ rig@@ eration , there are some euro coins in D@@ mit@@ ry , bot@@ tles and also dangerous p@@ ounds which later throw the rub@@ b@@ ish .

Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level , as weak economic growth and inflation alle@@ viation have sof@@ tened speculation on the rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth remains a lo@@ opho@@ le , as household incomes have put interest rates on expectations .
policy makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MP@@ C ) voted 6 : 2 to 0.@@ 25 % , and fewer members require an increase this month , as slow economic growth has weakened the support for growth .
in its quar@@ terly report on inflation , the Bank will cut the forecast of 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households &apos; incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in rates of inflation in the next few years is necessary to curb inflation from Bre@@ x@@ on and the financial markets may be necessary for the expected increase in the cost of borrowing .
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package , which was launched a year ago as a result of Bre@@ x@@ ti .
in February , the Bank will put an end to the fixed @-@ term finance scheme , which will provide the banks with cheap funding , although it said that it is now up to GBP 15 billion under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; the central forecast of the MP@@ C will remain gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the near future , as the difficult situation of real income for households will continue to have an impact on consumption . &quot;
on the rates , it was repeated that there is a need for a &apos; fiscal policy &apos; to alleviate inflation , and this &apos; somewhat more &apos; , if the markets are expected .
Mr Böge is now predi@@ cting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any kind of leap is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
the forecast of 1.8 % growth in 2018 was maintained .
after this news , the p@@ ound fell against the dollar and the euro .
women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.@@ 31 and 0.@@ 4 % to EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to growing hopes of an increase in GDP in the second quarter of the previous three months , from 0.2 % to 0.@@ 3 % .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will be able to collect a little momentum .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave rise to little reason to re@@ jo@@ ice for households suffering from rising inflation and ab@@ ject wage increases , saying that the situation is going to get a little worse before an improvement .
it was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent income from the next few years , but the end of the three @-@ year forecast is expected to see a significant return to wages .
as a result , the economy will also be stimu@@ lated by increasing demand for British production , which will partly compensate for lower costs for consumers .
the decision comes one year after the rates were taken in August last year by 0.@@ 25 % after the shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the p@@ ound .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to completely brea@@ the life into prices and the economy .
before the last decision of the Bank , there was a growing demand for raising the rate , as inflation has increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak p@@ ound .
Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , leader of Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ ga@@ ges , said : &apos; in view of the recent fall in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market will once again become more competitive , as borro@@ w@@ ers are losing their jobs and hoping for a positive end to the year .
Mr Bö@@ rs seems to be particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as re@@ financing , often without service and low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS is writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV medicine
patients will have access to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; HIV @-@ friendly treatment since September , following the battle against whether the N@@ HS should finance the medicine .
the N@@ HS England announced that public health is now estimated to make 10 000 people available for an initial three @-@ year clinical trial - pre @-@ pre @-@ professional sy@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t that is man@@ ned before the interim procedure and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people by around 86 % .
the N@@ HS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS is able to pay for the Pr@@ EP , despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Ste@@ vens , the Executive Director of the N@@ HS Eng@@ land , welcomed this Thursday as a &apos; new large @-@ scale intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &apos; pivotal moment &apos; .
sexual health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ oli@@ s and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to register people , and in October , further clin@@ ics , before the programme is introduced in England by April 2018 .
exposure to pre @-@ emp@@ tive pro@@ phy@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) is a hot@@ line for HIV drugs , which will be taken before the interim arrangement to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that the Pr@@ EP will significantly reduce HIV transmission among people with the risk of infection .
the Pr@@ EP &apos;s adoption before the mid @-@ term review means that there is a sufficient number of medicines that prevent HIV infections .
such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure .
the appropriate candidates include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment .
respondents identify suitable people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their participation in the local sex health clin@@ ics in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and N@@ HS England signed an agreement to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the clinical test aims to assess the actual potential of the Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who is intended for treatment and how it is consumed and implemented .
Ste@@ vens said : &apos; this new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and leverage a wide @-@ ranging and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
this is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of the greatest health problems of humanity . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , the Man@@ aging Director of NA@@ T , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
the Pr@@ EP , if it is properly targeted at those who need it and belong to the risk chain , offers an opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic .
since September , people with a high risk of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on the negotiations with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
the Man@@ aging Director of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Foundation , ian Green , said : &apos; now it is a priority to ensure that a clinical trial is put in place quickly and that none of the members of the HIV risk group should be excluded .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical test has been obtained , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
the Minister for Public Health , Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , said : &apos; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the cen@@ sus of the government &apos;s sho@@ es .
evidence shows how much changes can be brought to an end to HIV prevention and the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will lead us a step closer to the full understanding of the advantages of the Pr@@ EP .
it is now important that a clinical trial be introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV , and to bring us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the price of electricity rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.@@ 94 , compared to € 7.@@ 71 in June this year , announced by Ele@@ ring .
the main cause of the price difference is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ tt @-@ hour and the price increased by 12 % compared to June last month .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five per cent to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per hour .
in Finland , the price of EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 17 was EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 17 , and the electricity exchanges in Nord half of the systemic price was EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t @-@ hour .
prices rose according to 12 and seven per cent .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity reached 75 % of last month &apos;s hours in Estonia and 16 % of the hours from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine % of the hours between two countries did not take place in the next day .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity reached 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the hours were used by the entire transmission capacity .
according to the last trading day of July , Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X on the market , in August , the price of electricity exchanges could be around 34 and € 37 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ tt @-@ hour .
the price of carbon dioxide , which is affecting the price of electricity , came up last month , and transactions took place at 5.@@ 04 @-@ 5.@@ 47 per tonne .
life of higher education - half @-@ order and smart de@@ sig@@ ners have made it a small Ear@@ ls of the Court of Lor@@ ds home
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker who is a passion@@ ate property innova@@ tor , swit@@ ched his home to the Grand K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in 2014 against the Ear@@ ls Court .
it is in Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ ţ@@ i &apos;s first order , and the fact that Jo@@ anne has not pac@@ ked his bags and sold the fla@@ ts , is a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived together with a former fellow Member of life in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tanta@@ mount to the price of my offer .
it was shown to me by the Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high waves .
I have a doctor in this and I did the same day . &quot;
since the first visit , this 93 @-@ square me@@ tre has gone through full innovation .
at the beginning , it was one of the s@@ lee@@ ping rooms and a complex sta@@ r - to reach a s@@ lee@@ ping in the kit@@ chen , and Jo@@ anne wanted to add a storage space and a half order to take advantage of high rates .
&quot; I wanted high , big win@@ dows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he is asking Er@@ fan Az@@ adi N@@ ot@@ ting Hil@@ lis for archite@@ ctural and de@@ sig@@ ner Du@@ ck &amp; D , to take advantage of 3.@@ 8 m e@@ ars and to create a home that is not just a development site , but a place where Jo@@ anne could live .
it was not high enough to add two space to each other , so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create a qu@@ asi @-@ order in which to stand up .
the Er@@ fan was supposed to be a creative approach .
&quot; Me@@ tal@@ l@@ design is quite complex , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise the premises so that they are located on each other , without having to be bo@@ gged down .
it was not just about building a platform , but we used the construction of steel , so that both the upper and lower space is right . &quot;
this place allowed the Er@@ fan@@ il to create two full @-@ blo@@ wn elements in the room , with a great deal of dramatic elements .
a half @-@ way street will be opened up from the old @-@ old light of the R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us window to the gla@@ ci@@ er of R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us .
the Gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ spe@@ ctive Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille , under@@ sco@@ res space style .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in the inclusion of theat@@ re , space and lighting .
in the short corridor , mir@@ rors have been added to both sides , so that it would seem longer .
in K@@ night , the mir@@ ror is giving the impression of a second @-@ tu@@ p window .
in the course of a return , the main savings for all Jo@@ anne &apos;s feed ri@@ ches and glass requirements will be reflected .
housing is accompanied by a false opportunity to close the vegetables , if it is not used , creating a more den@@ se space .
the cu@@ mber@@ some kit@@ chen is nothing new .
however , with this kit@@ chen , it is a unique fact that this is a type of u@@ prising in the gar@@ age .
&quot; this went a little bit of design , &quot; explains the Er@@ fan ter@@ as@@ strengthened M@@ D@@ F from the M@@ D@@ F .
&quot; this has a counter@@ weight , which is why it is very simple to reject it . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne now has 16 additional metres , an additional s@@ lee@@ ping permit and a better cor@@ ter plan .
&quot; after all , there is what you sell - or what gives real estate value , &apos; say Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ Kin@@ nis@@ var@@ er takes an outdated form and makes calculations on the basis of the surface area &apos; .
here , they have been able to increase hos@@ pita@@ lity by using high @-@ quality materials , which add a luxury to the space .
&quot; materials are those that you are missing and thus help to create an emotional link with the home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not love the electricity cable .
it is important , but it does not give heart to languages . &quot;
this shows that a good design and an increase in the area will help to make something ama@@ zing about the rather normal cor@@ ps .
in fact , they may even create a desire not to leave , as was the case with Jo@@ anne .
the main figure , Jen@@ sen Ch@@ ic@@ ago , is a pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um in Ch@@ ic@@ ago , who is competing with a colleague for his profession@@ alism .
no other than the amount of money that has been earned , apart from which any ethics is forgotten .
his wife and three children see a man only in the early evening and late .
in the first half of the film , I think that it is a version of the business world - even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s speech is similar .
what the film is going on , however , in order to reduce the s@@ care@@ mon@@ gering element , and the mor@@ alising intention of film @-@ makers is becoming increasingly apparent .
life @-@ changing experience will be the main player in cancer .
there is now a choice between working and family life .
the po@@ g of the Ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ Office makes a father think of the big buildings in Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s foot@@ steps , about matters of real importance , such as religion , welfare , love ... , without even the disaster of the twin tow@@ ers .
after the third , where the son &apos;s father opens the eyes , there is a feeling that the film @-@ makers will certainly be able to meet the objective of the audience , because even the most stu@@ b@@ born heart of the view is unable to keep the suffering of a doctor in the face of cancer .
if the son falls and his situation seems to be hope@@ less , the father will finally understand the mor@@ ality of his work and will do a good job for the elderly .
now , in a sense , I am lu@@ cky with myself - if the film has been in possession of it , then I will reward my own sense after the film coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , then at least one sur@@ prises may be rewarded .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ice coff@@ ee will be lost - if the hus@@ band calls a sick and a man of a hospital in the middle of a corridor .
however , the Po@@ e@@ g has been ama@@ zing , and although his father has just lost his job , it will prove positive , because it is now time to deal with the family .
I can also feel well - I can predict the end of the American dra@@ ma quite well !
in fact , the film is well constructed , all the elements that are necessary for this are there .
there can be a but@@ ton , you can lau@@ gh , actor is good and moral beau@@ ty : money is not the most important thing in life .
this film is well @-@ established .
the new staff of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i will limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F@@ . Kelly will be able to do so .
it would then be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff@@ ing of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope that it will keep the upper hand in the water .
here , the repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ lt :
&quot; when the new staff of the White House , John F@@ . Kelly , met with high officials on his first day of work , he pointed out a key problem with President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ ges , which he intends to resolve in the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly said to the officials that the information must go through him , either on paper or at meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems completely logical , but others have tried to do so and have failed to monitor his media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television goes for decades , and now that he is in Val@@ dis Ma@@ in , his tele@@ visions have not gone anywhere .
&quot; when the candidate T@@ ru@@ mp was dis@@ honest about the dis@@ honest media coverage , he had to show him that he was also reflected fairly , &quot; said S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , a former campaign advis@@ er S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , in February .
Poli@@ tic@@ o tara Pal@@ mer wrote at the time that &apos; six former campaig@@ ners &apos; , according to T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter , the key to managing the habits of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter is to ensure that it has a personal media consumption in a stable way . &quot;
well .
however , the idea that the habits used by T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaig@@ ners know something that the rest of us do not know about the fact that the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i bonuses would have been even more hear@@ tening without their intervention .
we will probably never be able to know about the sh@@ ut@@ down that the T@@ ru@@ mp did not postal .
if he was able to save him or a couple of times , his efforts were worth doing so .
however , no one has been able to prevent T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i consistently from creating controversy .
part of the problem is that , in the White House , which consists of competing against each other , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception , by transferring material to the Olympic Games , which supports their views on the world , but may not always be credible .
Poli@@ tic@@ o , which reflects the whole story , wrote in May the advis@@ er &apos;s tendency to feed the President with a strategic question of information .
one of the examples described by the repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is as follows :
&quot; the current and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i will say that T@@ ru@@ mp can respond to the negative press , particularly the harmful effects of information , explo@@ sive , taking an ob@@ session with the identification of their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone gave a che@@ er@@ ful copy to the President of the Internet provocation to Charles C. Joh@@ n@@ son &apos;s website , G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com , which accused the staff de@@ pu@@ ties , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , that he was a white house for a number of le@@ af@@ lets .
there is no difference that Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked by Twitter , or that he did not provide any specific evidence or that he has also made and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
T@@ ru@@ mp read the article and started to ask Wal@@ sh@@ i . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that Ro@@ b Por@@ ter Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us and Head of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , have tried to establish a system for managing and docu@@ menting the documents reaching T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but the T@@ ru@@ mp is still an impul@@ se and his hel@@ ple@@ ss will continue to compete on the basis of influence .
these un@@ changing factors make the mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans who have come from abroad to the capital of the capital will not be allowed to speak .
there is a lot of foreigners in the city centre of Tallinn .
those with whom the le@@ af@@ let came out , acknowledged that they were playing in the old town without the permission of the urban government .
the first was the three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who have taken the same co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il with the gates of Vir@@ u .
it was clear to see that the mus@@ ici@@ ans of the rub@@ ber and sha@@ ck@@ les were in ab@@ sen@@ tia , who would have to spend one of the du@@ ch mar@@ ches .
despite the fact , the only woman in the company played a par@@ ia@@ h story , while one man , alongside him , was calling for a gesture of three faces and fur@@ ni@@ ture closer to him .
the third man had sat alongside them on one hand and smo@@ ked a warm @-@ hear@@ ted far@@ ce .
their three cha@@ mbers did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the people of the past .
Mr Bo@@ b , who has played the A@@ cor@@ di@@ on , has been saying that he has spoken in the streets , for the sake of both fu@@ n and money .
the aim of this group was to collect ticket money on the same day as a vessel travelling to Finland .
apart from the question of whether they asked for permission from the town of the age of the exhibition , No@@ emi and Bo@@ b were sha@@ king their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stay in one city more than a day or a few and , in most cases , permits for a month or something like this .
it makes no sense to pay for this , &quot; explained by Bo@@ b .
when we returned to the gates of Vir@@ u about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in mus@@ ici@@ ans and are going to go .
it is a task of luck to the Vir@@ u Centre in ab@@ sen@@ tia and co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils .
three Polish young men , one of whom played a fifth , are also present on the streets of Vir@@ u Vir@@ u , and the third was even in the form of electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people enter@@ tainment in order to spread music and joy , and to earn money for fuel and living , &quot; explained the tri@@ o from M@@ iv@@ os@@ h .
according to M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there must be permission from the city government to take place .
&quot; of course we do not have it , &quot; he said it jo@@ ke .
but we hope that if people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
of course , if the police comes , we will go elsewhere , but we must try , he added .
in July , the Estonian bank purchased bonds worth € 149 million in the public sector of central banks in the euro area , a bank bond portfolio increased to € 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , has explained in the past that the assets of the central banks of the euro system are covered by three different purchasing programmes : the bonds of the financial sector covered by the financial sector ( VIS ) , property guaranteed bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public bonds ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage investors to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases will fall in the production of lower @-@ risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks .
in general , in the framework of the public bond programme , each central bank will buy its government bonds , with other countries &apos; bonds not being purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank will make so @-@ called &apos; replacement shopping &apos; within the limits of the amount allocated to them .
the central banks also shop in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian bank is generally buying bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian bank is buying bonds under the asset programme from March 2015 .
in the meantime , Ele@@ ction bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian Bank of June 2016 will no longer buy bonds from June 2016 .
on behalf of the central banks of the euro area , since June , both the Central Bank and Estonia are buying energy bonds from Finland .
migrants ignore degrees and return to &apos; millions of business &apos; .
some of the rich@@ est owners of the West Mid@@ lands have once again found themselves in a fier@@ ce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the cra@@ dle of the Council to win back their cotton .
migrants have par@@ ked their 20 tra@@ ilers near the streets of So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l , who are ris@@ ked by a wealth of millions of business .
they have returned , together with the hor@@ ses , children and lorries , after they were thrown out of it only in May , without allowing themselves to be confused with the bureaucra@@ cies of the Council to prevent their invasion .
the group found a weak place in defence limits , turning its vehicles through un@@ blocked parts that were left to po@@ cket .
the people of M@@ aru@@ ang@@ ry have sur@@ rendered the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless &apos; in dealing with the problem .
one anon@@ ymous resident said : &apos; they are sitting there on Monday evening after their exclusion from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ from , where they were st@@ oned by stoning .
the Council must be ashamed that they are going to act , because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were going to go and now they are back again .
they came to the last night , probably more today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect their par@@ ks .
I live on the road to strike , and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay the power of a total tax if the Council is unable even to prevent such a thing . &quot;
one local resident , who also wanted to remain anon@@ ymous , said : &apos; it is ridiculous , and we saw the last of these migratory movements , and there is already a new offensive .
this time , there has been an increase in the number and even a horse has been seen in the grass@@ land . &quot;
the representative of the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Council said : &apos; we are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the land near the street pa@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k , and we are working with the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ li police , and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
the gathering of evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling the number 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ na festi@@ val will also visit the Minister for Culture , In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is pleased that Estonia has been able to bring real world top names .
on the question of why the We@@ ek@@ ise festi@@ val is so important for the Est@@ oni@@ ans , Sa@@ ar says that it should be asked from all those who enjoy the F@@ esti@@ val &apos;s three days in full .
however , he is saying that the real players have come to the ski@@ es .
&quot; looking at the level of artists that have been able to be brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this mus@@ ical gesture - often not in our hands - are spoken by the Minister for Culture .
however , what are the artists at the festi@@ val of Sa@@ art who are most telling themselves ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person , and I am sure one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ new@@ re@@ n , who stood up yesterday evening .
after all , it is all of us who , at some point , have complicated their own feet , &apos; he says &apos; .
however , it is still highlighting a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ thia , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ a .
of course , our own Estonian players : starting with NO@@ x P and they can be read a whole series .
in reality , this well @-@ known concentration of names is very high , he says .

according to the Chairman of B@@ M@@ W , the company believes that &apos; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including B@@ M@@ W , in Munich , which has considered a ban or restriction on diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be upgra@@ ded to reduce gas emissions from diesel engines .
no company has described these procedures as a re @-@ call .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and in the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and could cause as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , the cost of equipment to neutr@@ alise emissions from diesel vehicles is increasing for car industry , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of ring@@ ing the powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs referring to the problem .
companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , who are silent on the use of so @-@ called pe@@ tro@@ le@@ ry devices , which enabled the testing of gas to be adapted to the regulations in the time of testing a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
several Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former president of the Au@@ di engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
former President Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and can be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , the Au@@ di German Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen was drawn into criminal investigations when the authorities accused the installation of the audit system in order to evade the requirements of the European emissions of gas , thereby extending the investigation , which was previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Au@@ di in the investigation may be a major blow to the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , the manufacturer of luxury cars , which is a disproportionately large part of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen &apos;s profits .
Estonia &apos;s schools will have 20 000 euro of EU flags .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union to the Estonian schools by 1 September .
a total of 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 per cent of the European Union &apos;s flag will be 5@@ 70 educational institutions .
flags are intended to be made in in@@ door rooms , they have to be carried out in high @-@ quality printed techniques , with a view to a certificate of convenience , bro@@ k@@ ering the ER@@ R news portal .
there is a text on the label : &apos; Kin@@ gi@@ tus Estonia &apos;s schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education , or one flag costs EUR 35 .
murder of journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
the workers of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually gather on Wednesday , to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the State of Y@@ al@@ oa , which is so@@ wn by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ ased drug wars .
however , today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their rou@@ tine .
two parents will be discussing which seems safer : either to bring children into office , which was the target of a gran@@ dio@@ attack in 2009 , or to leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the leader of the room : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking repor@@ ters to be able to provide the names of a ve@@ il in every case , there is no need for impres@@ sions and internal emo@@ tions .
the presence of the government or car@@ tels is suspected of drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists , a whole list of couples who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
there is no b@@ reat@@ h of violence , and the more the bodies of the country accumu@@ late , the majority of them are journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists , from the appointment of President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Montre@@ to in December 2012 , at least 25 . 5@@ 89 journalists , following attacks and threats under national protection , have so far been killed at least seven journalists in the seven states .
the latest deaths include their edit@@ or and source of inspiration , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce co @-@ foun@@ der Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote in Val@@ dez one of his many books on drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though his presence can be felt everywhere on a fa@@ ç@@ ade of a secular Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building , a big picture of the average of Val@@ de@@ z@@ z , with a letter of &apos; Justice &apos; , and two of the 30 reports , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , is carrying T @-@ shir@@ ts , which have been portra@@ yed by his wife , or the ama@@ te@@ ur face of glas@@ ses .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death ; Re@@ por@@ ters will be discussing a common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , dre@@ ams , paran@@ o@@ ia .
although in 2010 , a separate public Prosecutor &apos;s office was set up to address cases of journalists , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee on the Protection of journalists .
as in the case of the most annual drug trafficking and organised crime , the number of murders of thousands , the kil@@ lers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
the edit@@ orial of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce will continue to reflect the violence in the Sin@@ al@@ as , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and justice of murde@@ rers , there is no great benefit from the meeting on security , according to I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very nice to waste your time here at the meeting , &apos; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , you will have no confidence in all . &quot;
Val@@ dez left in the capital of the State , Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office , on 15 May morning .
he managed to travel only a few quarters before the two men stopped the red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ roles , and he was forced to go out of the car and shot at 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which means the &apos; twel@@ f@@ th river &apos; .
the armed man travelled to Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s car and made an accident in the vic@@ inity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adults .
the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an is spreading freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
however , there is basically only silence on the subject of Val@@ dez .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition of the United States in January , you have been one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country , because ri@@ val@@ ries are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
there is no difference that a person or even a number of people are being shot on the streets of oa every day , or that the dead are s@@ tun@@ ned by the double @-@ fashi@@ oned swe@@ ets of drugs , which are greater than many homes .
let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one car@@ tel is headed by the state of the sea with valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce co @-@ foun@@ der and the President , Is@@ May Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , feels that he was unable to defend his friend .
he believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
the first of these was the publication of an interview with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons with a competing and military car@@ tel , D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z@@ every , in February .
this piece of correspon@@ dence could have been allu@@ ded to by the suspect gan@@ gs who bought all the cop@@ ies of the publication as soon as they were reached in the newspapers .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country for his own security , after there was a ra@@ mp in one of the newspapers that have been reflected in the same story .
Val@@ dez was leg@@ alised both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had remained alive for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to be permanently present .
he worked in 2003 as a ve@@ ter@@ an@@ repor@@ ter in No@@ ro@@ este , when he joined the five colleagues in order to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said that &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without tou@@ ching the drug problem &apos; .
the amount of time has been felt by its courageous and honest perfor@@ man@@ ces and sales and advertising increased .
Re@@ por@@ ters were keen to express vigorous studies without fear of censorship and read@@ ers , which they were able to read stories that no one else da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspaper won the pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot Award for his Latin American reports .
in the same year , the Committee on the Protection of journalists in Val@@ dez ( AK@@ K ) won the International Press Freedom Prize for his courage to follow the Mexic@@ an drug story wherever it leads .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said the AK@@ K award .
last October , in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV , he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in the Y@@ al@@ o@@ as .
&quot; your head is to embrace the task that the journalists &apos; office will have a second chance to play .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths , or why I did not say what is happening . &quot;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ ctives will miss Val@@ de@@ z , a jo@@ ke , a ro@@ b like low , a friend who divided embry@@ os and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their support to his rou@@ tine .
he always gave his village a bar@@ rel .
he went from the office of El nan to the bar of El Salvador , and was always sitting on the same table .
now they are asking whether his stu@@ pid love was fatal to him .
his death has also put them into question how best to do their work and stay in life .
&quot; they do not like their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ censorship .
trust in your in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
if it is a matter of dubious fra@@ gran@@ ces , it is a matter of keeping away .
according to the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ ali , the problem is that &apos; fra@@ gran@@ ce can be dece@@ ived ... and so this is the case with J@@ ternity &apos; .
he and others say that you no longer have the old rules , just as they do not apply in Thailand , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ ros or other states which are home to the toxic combination of lu@@ cra@@ tive smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in a space where the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted ; some days before that , it was revealed that only the nu@@ mber@@ ing assets sold to governments had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists .
in front of the House , two police officers sought to alleviate the 40 @-@ degree heat of the pu@@ zz@@ le .
the government appointed them to a more elected Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office in the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an Centre in the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an Centre .
some repor@@ ters won@@ dered whether these police officers are among their 50 % of police officers , whose Governor himself has been un@@ reliable .
several months have passed since the repor@@ ters have travelled to mountain areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gan@@ gs .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edition of this week addressed three main features .
one of them was the murder of the former po@@ et Ju@@ li@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez ven@@ na in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ as .
in addition , they had a reve@@ aling story of the spending of government funds on the home town of the Governor .
a group of people was kidna@@ pped by Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants , from the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an c@@ abinet to the quarter .
there was no official announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how it happened , so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of the restaur@@ ant , both the drug traffickers and the authorities of the authorities .
the Re@@ por@@ ter became aware of the public documents that the restaur@@ ant is registered as a politician who belongs to the institution in power , the Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
in recent times , several IR@@ P Governor has been accused of corruption in the framework of cases of corruption .
in Vil@@ lar@@ line asked the repor@@ ter to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Gu@@ z@@ man , El Chap@@ o , who was we@@ aring the name of &apos; El Chap@@ o &apos; .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have been looking for a Val@@ dez co@@ ck@@ ta@@ g to obtain information on the kid@@ napp@@ ings from the best sources .
&apos;@@ In the past we would have known what happened , &apos; said 46 @-@ year @-@ old Vil@@ lar@@ k , whose body construction has earned him a slogan El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all channels of communication have broken down with our sources . &quot;
the Val@@ de@@ z office has become a reser@@ vo@@ ir to bridges and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and edit@@ orial workers have become something that they never expected to wait for activists on behalf of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez seized a few eyes and direction next morning to the local Prosecutor &apos;s office for another journalist .
Mr Salvador , in the West of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an State , three days after the murder of Val@@ de@@ z .
it has been found to be a dead body and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists have become more popular across the country , and are cri@@ pp@@ ling organised protests on the roads and buildings with the phrase &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; .
on this day , President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington trying to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
a day after the death of Val@@ de@@ z , the Ra@@ mi@@ rez authorities accused the authorities of the journalists , in a nu@@ mber@@ ing and killing them , of telling the truth .
after that , he asked him to be diver@@ ted from the government &apos;s activities elsewhere , concerned that hatred has been affected by objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists have been &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ cul@@ pri@@ ts and indifferent society . &quot;
in his last book , &apos; drug media &apos; , he wrote that the repor@@ ters are not only killing drug gan@@ gs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who are at the mer@@ cy of organised crime .
Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , ap@@ pealed to more than half of the attacks on journalists on the police and civil servants last year .
&apos;@@ In Mexico &apos; , because you want to be silent , &apos; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
there is obviously a ver@@ bal impact .
no one will forget the death of blo@@ gg@@ ers and Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state in Thailand six years ago .
he was found to be dead with a letter , which was probably signed by a car@@ tel in L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
in addition to his pain@@ ted head , computer glass and e@@ ars were found .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state , Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , following the killing of their correspon@@ dent in March of the Mon@@ sla@@ va B@@ lus@@ h .
others will pass on as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do after the murder of their President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z has publicly spoken to the drug car@@ tel with the slogan &apos; What do you want of us ? &apos; .
some journalists have fled from national states or even from the country .
this is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
it is difficult to find a job in exile and they still have to look at the streets in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes they are behind them , as was probably the case with the photo@@ graph Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered together with four women &apos;s people in 2015 , three months after the Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z@@ ist break .
those who remain in place and continue to work will have to refu@@ te risky decisions every day .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to become a po@@ et , recognises that the reporting of drug trafficking is frigh@@ tening him .
&quot; Mexico is on the road to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
one of the recent mid@@ night of Friday , when the latest number had already been s@@ tun@@ ned , the edit@@ ors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat in front of the office and pl@@ undering the be@@ er when suddenly all the phones began to be cal@@ ib@@ rated .
there were 19 people who died in the fire exchanges between ri@@ val gan@@ gs and the security forces in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ is , a sta@@ ggering 19 people .
the war continues to continue , as has been promised by several of the messages of car@@ tels that have been found in the region .
on the basis of the same pa@@ vements , repor@@ ters made news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website using a mobile phone .
in the front of next day , we needed to change .
the S@@ ire@@ en@@ s were seized by another arms exchange in the region .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pi@@ il@@ us on white police officers to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not at least show that .
the foun@@ der of the newspaper has fallen under the mass t@@ ree , which his average fin@@ gers are to see the whole of the blue , edit@@ orial by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers in his foot@@ steps .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w can you think about closing , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; whereas on the same day when Javier was killed , a trainees@@ hip asked me to make a report on the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur@@ us used protective col@@ ours to prevent enemies
at first sight , it seems like a form , although rather frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now unve@@ iled the first findings in relation to the un@@ beli@@ evable presence of the Canadian mine , which is so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; din@@ osa@@ urs Mon@@ a &apos; .
it has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the lea@@ k covered by his soya was the colour of red bo@@ gus and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the report published in the Bi@@ ology published in the press described the assumption as &apos; the best preserved so@@ di@@ um &apos; , which has ever been found &apos; and &apos; one of the best parts of the world &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new type of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us that lived in the middle of the age of 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
it is incredibly good to maintain it in Rab@@ at , who describe it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
according to the National Ge@@ o@@ Guard , this type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus , which has ever been found , has been best covered by this type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus .
it was found on 21 March 2011 by Sha@@ wn functional , when he extra@@ cted Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um in the For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
he has struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone , and decided to examine more closely .
the ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus identified was sent to Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um .
for the next six years , it was designed to refer the animal to 2 500 p@@ ounds ( 1@@ 100 @-@ kilometres ) .
after all this hard work , the final result is now finally ready to bring the public to the public .
&quot; if a little bit of eyes , it can almost be believed that he s@@ le@@ ep , &apos; said Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , the leading author , Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell , in the muse@@ um of the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell .
&quot; this will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most preserved din@@ osa@@ urs - Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &quot;
when he looked at the lea@@ ther , he found that this vege@@ tation , which is covered by so@@ ws and rese@@ mb@@ les a wal@@ king tan@@ k , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food din@@ osa@@ urs .
this high @-@ level din@@ osa@@ ur used the red and white defence col@@ ours in order to hide from pre@@ da@@ tors , and applied shel@@ tering techniques which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
this enabled experts to be better integrated into the din@@ osa@@ ur and to avoid enemies , as the major din@@ osa@@ urs were likely to be hun@@ ted to him .
this was the first time in the news in May and is now visited by Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell in the pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um of the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell .
researchers have now investigated and given it the name of the Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta Mar@@ mit@@ chel@@ l muse@@ um , mark Mitchell , who was a famous team that spent more than 7 000 hours of demand to reveal more than 7@@ 000 hours .
thanks to the ama@@ zing good preservation of the father , Dr Mitchell and the team of international scientists were able to document the shape and size of the so@@ ws .
they discovered a contradiction - a common method of protection in the country of animal origin , which means that the intr@@ usion of the present was a dark than the alu@@ mini@@ um .
although there is a common sense of responsibility , the findings come as a surprise , as Boeing is much greater than those who are living in the face of the sha@@ dows today .
this suggests that the din@@ osa@@ ur is being actively hun@@ ted out by other mus@@ ici@@ ans , so that the evolution preferred to be over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed instead of the confrontation of the survi@@ v@@ ors .
however , most of the animals used today , such as fear , b@@ ars or archa@@ e@@ cles , are much smaller and more vulnerable , indicating that no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us had to really work to survive .
&quot; the strong hun@@ t of the din@@ osa@@ ur , which is covered by a huge and abundan@@ t amount of soya , shows how dangerous it could be to be the animals who were kidna@@ pped in the age of cri@@ pp@@ ers , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds of organic comp@@ ounds also revealed that the lea@@ ther of the din@@ osa@@ ur was a red ba@@ g .
scientists will continue to set up an investigation in order to get ang@@ les about this life , including the retained content of this gender @-@ style , in order to find out what the animal is the last word .
they believe that the din@@ osa@@ ur collapsed in the dead rivers , thereby entering into the sea , where he was sun@@ k in the ocean .
at that time , Alber@@ tas was just as warm as it is currently in South Flor@@ ence , and rivers and oceans are likely to go far beyond the internal land .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us is truly remarkable , as it is fully covered by a so@@ ber lea@@ f , while it has also remained three @-@ dimensional , maintaining the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal today sees almost the same as in the age of cri@@ cket .
in order to recon@@ stru@@ ct it , there is not a great deal of imagination to use - it is enough simply to pre@@ ach bridges and it seems that he would be s@@ lee@@ ping . &quot;
the time of the crisis was the time when there were huge two leg@@ s on the ground , the din@@ osa@@ urs - he@@ tero@@ han@@ ts .
although the Qu@@ e@@ en Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x lived millions of years later than Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , it could have been s@@ tun@@ ned by some of his hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous predecess@@ ors .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ sa@@ ur@@ us , 38 leg@@ s ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) , a long and six @-@ tonne mon@@ ster .
scientists , whose recent findings are published in the magaz@@ ine Bi@@ ology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta was killed after death in the sea and this mu@@ z@@ ambi@@ que slu@@ dge .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn functional was discovered when he extra@@ cted For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near the mining of Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um in Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
according to the Mu@@ use@@ um , it is best preserved in the world , including lea@@ ther and soya , and it is a comprehensive concentration up to timber .
these assumptions were on average 18 leg@@ s ( five metres ) long and the shel@@ ves up to GBP 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .
two 20 customs @-@ long ora emerged from its shoulders .
scientists believe that it was covered by the current Western Canada , until the river floo@@ ded into the open sea .
however , the place in which the din@@ osa@@ ur was bur@@ nt helped to maintain its excellent speci@@ ality in detail .
the ice caps of this particular father are so well preserved that the head@@ lines of the my@@ ste@@ rious so@@ om@@ ers are still covered by the head@@ lines of the din@@ osa@@ ur .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote in the magaz@@ ine National Ge@@ o@@ dic : &apos; such storage is just as rare as a lo@@ opho@@ le .
the more I look at it , the more incredible it seems .
De@@ lea@@ ded sk@@ in ice is still covered by the creation of my@@ ste@@ rious soya be@@ ans on the ground .
a better front is lying alongside him , and five of the assets have been rus@@ hed up@@ wards .
I will be able to count on the so@@ ws in his winter . &quot;
how did one activist find a response to the question of &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll received a full shock .
just a day after the trip to New York , it was the case of St@@ . Lou@@ ise Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , who had been ren@@ ted in New York , on a phone on Facebook .
he came to the post of his former school com@@ mu@@ te .
there was a letter : &apos; the police killed just 18 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ents and he is still on the streets &apos; .
he was confused why no one else had posted this information on his stream , which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
P@@ ide@@ ga @ The@@ e@@ P@@ suc@@ ah &apos;s user was repeatedly divided on his time@@ line .
Mr St@@ . , from the Lou@@ ise region , Michael Bro@@ w@@ ni , the death of an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man , who was killed by a white police officer in Fer@@ gus@@ on Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is , was communicated in real time .
he gave a picture of the life of Bro@@ w@@ n , which was in the street , for four hours .
&quot; it is cra@@ zy , &quot; said Ferreira .
however , death was nothing new for him or for the community .
he has put his phone off , but later this evening , he saw a re@@ fin@@ ement , which said this time about the people of Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve D@@ ri@@ ve .
J@@ ag@@ ati photo@@ graph@@ s of the police and the harsh people , and a man who claimed himself to be the father of Bro@@ w@@ ni and kept the label &apos; Fer@@ gus@@ oni police killed just my un@@ armed son &apos; .
he watched in real time a stream in which the police officer stood before a group of prote@@ sters with the gra@@ ves .
in the second video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Mr Fer@@ rell is reminded of how he struck himself : &apos; it is unusual . &apos;
&quot; this is not a murder of this kind , which we are ac@@ custo@@ med to and what we could describe as typical . &quot;
I felt frigh@@ tened at this moment .
I was ang@@ ry and I met . &quot;
he boo@@ ked a return flight and travelled home on the next day .
at 23 o &apos;@@ clock , he went to his father for his six @-@ year da@@ u@@ ghter and decided that they would travel to a two @-@ year @-@ old Fer@@ gus@@ on next morning .
what the Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ ga took place in the next three years is a central issue in the new docu@@ mentary &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; , &apos; whose streets ? &apos; , which will be presented in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who have than@@ ked the answers .
when Mrs Ferreira , together with her da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a li@@ ps@@ y stic@@ ker and a pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ch@@ at with it - Fer@@ gus@@ on , they spoke again on a subject that they had repeatedly spoken before this morning - about the experience and living conditions of the mus@@ ici@@ ans .
&quot; remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; recalls itself in question .
&quot; we are now travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ oni , because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on board , &quot; said Ferreira later .
&quot; what is happening now is the cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it must be aware of this and see it growing in the middle .
he must learn about the activist and organisation of the activist and , at the same time , feel the different la@@ yers of experience and living conditions , and what we need to do in order to be free and free .
even if I succeed in bringing him up so that he does not personally copy brutal racism , he does not differ from some other black girls .
I feel that I would do him a dis@@ service if I would defend him for this world . &quot;
the first stop that they did in the vic@@ inity of the Fer@@ gus@@ oni was through South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ ti - the police station in the middle of the road , which had become a certain kind of camp , where activists were waiting for news about the police officer , Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not ultimately charged .
there , Mrs Ferreira , and his da@@ u@@ ghter , joined forces with local business owners who prepared lunch .
they put together food bags and helped to distribute them to the prote@@ sters .
for the Fer@@ rell , a new type of activist has slowly started to take shape .
&quot; my activist change completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ ise University , he was the President of the Union for Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I did not have any experience of organisation .
this is all simply a pi@@ pe . &quot;
weeks later , Ferreira met a film co @-@ director Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ every .
the Fo@@ lay@@ an said that he and the film operator , Mr Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , simply wanted to document what is happening .
the question of the Fer@@ rell came to light : &apos; are you trying to document what is happening or to find a story that can be used ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often painful - come to the community and try to benefit from its legitimacy and resilience .
the Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of the people born in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard and we wanted to do so differently . &apos;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ ati , the co @-@ director of the region , who was well known for prisoners sentenced to death , had already been hit by the Fo@@ lay@@ an .
his involvement made the project attractive to the Fer@@ rell and the six other local ones who were watched by the film &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; for years after the shooting of Bro@@ w@@ ni .
&quot; in this docu@@ mentary , nobody is talking about us or with us , but we are talking about ourselves , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; for me , it was important how these people are portra@@ yed , because I am also portra@@ yed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rell - it was intended to show that the movement is not a &apos; donor leader &apos; , but a community of community &apos; , as the Fo@@ lay@@ an said , it was the most open party to the film .
as a result , the &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; is documented by the surprising personal aspects of the life of Fer@@ rell , such as ru@@ th@@ less and mar@@ ried with his wife .
&quot; I felt , as I would be earlier , &apos; said Ferreira , laugh@@ ing at the first time when he was prepared to see the city .
&quot; however , I realised that this work and the humanity of the black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the Fer@@ rel@@ li story emphasises and re@@ places the role of black L@@ GB@@ T women in the wider Black Sea Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three initi@@ ators of the movement , who thought in the social media in 2012 after the killing of the black teen@@ ag@@ er Tra@@ y@@ von Mar@@ tini , the h@@ ash@@ ta@@ g # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter , is homo@@ sexual .
&quot; the leading role of homo@@ sexual women has kept the movement in general , &quot; said Ferreira , &quot; and this is precisely because we have to fight continually on several fronts .
Roma women have to bear all the burden . &quot;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed , pointing out that &apos; movement is indeed alive by black women , and many of them are black homosexu@@ als &apos; .
at the same time , he says that &apos; this is not a kind of kind of equal opportunities &apos; - Fer@@ rel@@ li was not chosen as a central point for his identity .
&quot; he was someone who was the right energy , &quot; he said .
&quot; however , it is not a coincidence that he was directly located on the front line , because the black L@@ GB@@ T woman is at stake when living in such hu@@ bs .
his energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news camer@@ as Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ ist has long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
at the time of the demonstrations in the Fer@@ rell , the conditional sentence for blocking the road las@@ ts for another 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region , which he calls on home , simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
nevertheless , it still attaches importance to the man@@ tra that has been fed by the memory of the memory since it was on the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ on a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we do not have to lose anything apart from our chains . &quot;
7 ni@@ ps , how to overcome the We@@ ek@@ ise du po@@ h@@ mel@@ le
some of the most stu@@ b@@ born me@@ ters will find that , after a scarce number of pi@@ pes , they will be able to help .
or in the light of the word &apos; Be@@ et po@@ t &apos; , the py@@ ra@@ mid of the stick &apos; .
however , this is only an inevitable postponement and a good ble@@ s@@ sing for health .
what can you do to make sure that , after today and tomorrow , the We@@ ek@@ ise trend - or other pi@@ pes - is better felt this morning and to overcome the po@@ pp@@ y as pain@@ fully as possible ?
Jo@@ o water .
it is down to alcohol and , after a great deal this morning ... or , if possible , even alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it must somehow be recovered .
together with water , mineral materials and se@@ sta@@ p are also a good ha@@ ir of mineral water .
as it is often irri@@ tated after a me@@ al , it is particularly good if it is a bub@@ ble @-@ free or easy ga@@ mble .
let us walk .
it would certainly not cost the grand@@ mother to bur@@ n the trees - it may prove fatal to be a false decision .
however , it is easy to remind the body once again what the feeling is in life .
T@@ el@@ gis and s@@ lee@@ ping boys are a more time @-@ consuming way of s@@ lee@@ ping .
give poor energy back slowly and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are already in the middle of yesterday &apos;s over@@ run , it will certainly not be worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
for example , a fresh volume of fruit in which the lion &apos;s body is slowly placed on the market .
if the health of the South is already suffering , it would be possible to try , for example , pow@@ dered .
and a little later .
a coff@@ ee was avoided .
this sof@@ ter will release your body from the last water .
as has already been said : water and volume are friends .
the contribution to anal@@ ge@@ si@@ cs .
if you were to be pain@@ kil@@ ler in order to prevent the po@@ t , then you have to deal with par@@ at@@ se@@ ta@@ mo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ ph@@ et , not only with alcohol , but also with the ability to do so .
so the ri@@ ches are even more expensive , and in the future , the po@@ pp@@ y is worse .
in addition , there will not be a long @-@ term silence in the past .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler this morning , you will do it with a blan@@ k che@@ que - it irri@@ ta@@ tes your already di@@ r@@ ty ma@@ ils .
or if a partner is not to be taken , it will be well with itself .
it is about the same thing as wal@@ king , but it does not become a org@@ as@@ m .
however , there should be too active a gear and an outrageous shop - a physical effort should be moder@@ ated during the po@@ t .
a jo@@ ke .
the words of the friends of the friends of the friends of the time , the easy to@@ pes and the na@@ era am@@ ic@@ ably , both for themselves and for others ( suffering ) .
N@@ ali and laugh@@ er may not be doing a po@@ t , but it is certainly easier for them to follow up .
once again , the po@@ h@@ me@@ ll goes on anyway !
Professor of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and Ox@@ ford University workers are being sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , the professor of the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and the University of Ox@@ ford , who have received suspects after death row , are being sought by the police , from a university in Ch@@ ic@@ ago to the death of male people .
according to the trial of the C@@ oo@@ k Coun@@ ty , on Monday , the arrest warrant was issued for 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i , accused of the death of T@@ ren@@ ton H. James Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u for their alleged association .
according to documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u died after repeated Naz@@ is .
according to a warning , the Ch@@ ic@@ ago police station issued to the community , the body of the 27 July was discovered .
police officers received a telephone call and found the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house for the victim , whose body had a number of stor@@ ms .
according to the officials , the Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ tag@@ u event was recognised as dead and investi@@ g@@ ators , while the police are actively looking for two suspects .
it has worked as co @-@ profes@@ sors of micro@@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at the University of North@@ w@@ ester since 2007 .
the Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations , Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , said in a statement sent as an e @-@ publishing , that La@@ ke has now been temporarily removed from work and has been banned from entering the cities of the University of North@@ w@@ ester .
&quot; this is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of North@@ w@@ ester will work with researchers , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
Mr W@@ arre@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant in the University of Ox@@ ford .
the representative of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to help US research authorities in every way possible &apos; .
in addition , the statement stated that War@@ ren@@ i &apos;s colleagues are shocked and willing to give themselves .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , President of the Ch@@ ic@@ ago police department , urges the authorities to give themselves to the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are , but we are dealing with an increasingly intensive definition of the exact location , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , suspects will help local , regional and national authorities .
the G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police had received a telephone call from the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house , who had just received a cry@@ p@@ tic rain that there has been something happening at Cor@@ ps .
according to the police description , it was a ma@@ gic specta@@ cle .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , it is not clear whether the event was also taking place on 27 July .
he said that the security camer@@ as confirm the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ mil and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the Grand Pla@@ za leadership sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police are currently working to identify the background of events and the background of the victim , and examines the various mo@@ tives , including the possibility of a family dispute . &quot;
companies that help your businesses to avoid receiving the next U@@ b@@ would
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were lu@@ cra@@ tive .
the answers were often vague , useless or , even worse , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is headed by Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , a company operating in San Franc@@ is@@ co@@ s , who sel@@ ls 75 workers .
it therefore called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups with new types of human resources , which will help businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software , which aims to measure the involvement of workers , they will allow companies to make a k@@ ni@@ fe , to target firm teams and demographic groups , to provide the anon@@ y@@ mity and complaints of the workers , and , in some cases , to allow manufacturers to by@@ pass C @-@ level leaders and to turn directly to the Bureau .
&quot; now there are tools such as Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ bi , which are designed to monitor health , but where is F@@ it@@ bi for your company ? &apos; asked Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O Reding wood City start @-@ ups G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ sts are used by companies to measure the involvement of workers .
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , he has received three years when he has used G@@ lin@@ ti , a much better overview of what he thinks and feel .
in addition to surveys and specific teams , it offers a company &apos;s heat card , which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , allowing it to identify the causes .
companies have started to understand that they have to stay in touch with their culture of work , so as not to become the next U@@ b , which has been insur@@ moun@@ ted in scandals since the former worker published a blo@@ g , which described the har@@ as@@ sing environment where those who da@@ red to speak were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , the desire to have an overview is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business option .
the global governance , regulation and conformity area can be worth more than USD 118@@ .@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the statistics on financial ethics .
Den@@ ver@@ is Col@@ or@@ ad@@ os , a start @-@ up company , which will help businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , noted in the light of the dubious reputation of U@@ b@@ ber this year an increase in interest and activity .
there are almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
the U@@ ber has recently registered himself as a customer .
as in G@@ lin@@ ter , the coalition companies will be able to send tailor @-@ made impul@@ ses , to collect real @-@ time confidential answers and to look at the problematic areas of heat cards .
it also offers anon@@ ymous messages to enable workers to report un@@ suitable behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has been an@@ cho@@ red by regulators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan and CE@@ O Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act im@@ mor@@ ally , the company may face serious consequences , such as consumer boycot@@ ts , leaving workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by , the restaur@@ ant , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of activity , has been used more than a year to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to intera@@ ct with the headquarters of the corpor@@ ation .
if a worker wanted to report the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address to the corpor@@ ation headquarters , and I hope that it will be taken seriously .
it was often a deterrent and in@@ convenient process , said Mr Vit@@ ran@@ o , General Ad@@ vis@@ er , who said that there was no good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , at a time when the company is using a cen@@ sus , it is possible to identify problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices , which did not previously lead to those operating in other cities or states , more quickly to identify and deal with them .
&quot; I will be able to get closer to the hol@@ ist 3@@ 60 @-@ degree experience of the workers , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who is headed by Mr Ru@@ by &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; and we defend our shareholders for liti@@ gation with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and the involvement of workers more seriously in 2002 , or after the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen collapsed due to ethical infringements in the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; , companies realised that they cannot prevent their black was@@ h from publicly hiding online .
&quot; before using the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Vienna offer their software as a service , taking advantage of companies &apos; perio@@ dic fees for using their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors who have been based on both start @-@ ups .
in February 10 million dollars were financed by companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by 47 million dollars .
the G@@ lin@@ ti invested USD 10 million in November in B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , increasing the total funding of the company to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise when taking into account the link between companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more research shows that modern workers are waiting for more than before .
in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are merely on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued , and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy in a company , they feel they are heard and that the work they do is satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of a company , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , who has a general benefit and the experience of the staff of the G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors earn revenue if companies belonging to their portfolio are doing well ; businesses are doing well when workers are committed and involved .
if the analytical tools of the third party allow us to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , we do not think that they will be supported .
the possession of data on the involvement of workers is important , according to experts in the culture of work .
however , these data are useless if the company &apos;s supervisory authorities do nothing to do with them .
in fact , if a company asks for feedback from its employees , it can create expectations that changes are ahead of us .
and if the changes do not take place quickly or not at all , it may cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; said K@@ ot@@ ter International President R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who has seen how companies are making a mistake by relying too much on the collection of data .
&quot; because if things do not go to the end , the workers think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Mad@@ ison Re@@ e@@ l , who is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via G@@ lin@@ ti .
and , after the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , it was possible to re@@ organise several teams in the company and to provide communication training to deal with the problems .
however , Mr Ru@@ by Kyprianou will be collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in the industry , known for its large labour flows .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose your customers .
and if you lose your customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
the euro area remains a sta@@ r in Bali : incomes are growing rapidly
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , B@@ SE , referring to the report by the European Central Bank .
according to the ECB , since 1999 , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
there is a low debt burden , fast @-@ improving institutions and business @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , in one of Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area , where the EU average has been substantially closer to the middle of the reactor , announced by the Central Bank .
while the aim is to ensure that the overall output of the economy per capita is equal to the Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2 / 3 of the average of 15 countries , which were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle .
low wages have led the bal@@ ls to seek a better wage abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light , and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are doing very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was slightly less than half of those questioned about their economies .
N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel two times a day &apos;s trend makes Bru@@ in@@ si days long
it is almost 23 o &apos;@@ clock when the fund U@@ C@@ L@@ A football clubs will be stopped at the edge of a new exercise in a team &apos;s university .
some of them have been burdened by a company , reve@@ aling the efforts of the first day of their training camp .
for a large part of the team , they are offering a mid@@ day break .
the players involved in the course of the cu@@ cu@@ mbers will go back after a three @-@ hour trend to learn from a joint life , before returning at 6.@@ 30 meetings next morning to the W@@ W@@ man football club .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Bru@@ in@@ si tre@@ ach , Jim Mor@@ a , shortly before the Monday became Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel the burden of players on a two @-@ day basis has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end of the end @-@ up to one side on Friday .
for this reason , the three first operations of the U@@ C@@ L@@ A were prompted to start at 19.@@ 15 , in order to fit players into the already tight time@@ line .
the transition from two to two strikes a day means more than one trend - the beginning of the Bru@@ in@@ si camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season , and for the first time in Mor@@ a &apos;s six W@@ es@@ tw@@ ard season , there will be workshops during summer courses .
they have until 20 August an agenda of 18 trends before the formal preparation of the opening game against T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M in September begins .
according to Mor@@ a , he is in favour of the change of the N@@ CA@@ A rules , although it adds another item to the close schedu@@ les of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they break themselves through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that if we arrive on Saturday and we have more time , it will be a truly good thing . &quot;
if the camp is closed , the U@@ C@@ L@@ A work@@ ings will be closed down , which is not an easy task , given the clear view of the par@@ king pla@@ te of their fields and by @-@ stand@@ by L@@ us@@ kin@@ i , a higher @-@ class hotel , which has already become a ga@@ te@@ way from the net of protection from the gates .
since this weekend , ho@@ tels are occupied by the Bru@@ in@@ si players , but Mor@@ a acknowledged that problems may arise during the season with free tobacco .
&quot; we are implementing security measures , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real concern , and it is not exagg@@ erated to think that people can fil@@ ter a do@@ zen and tre@@ asu@@ ries .
if there is a record of a train , it can do a good deal .
but we are using a security team there and 8 par@@ king stations .
we will do our best to use it .
I will try not to worry about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the cost of the election union of Sa@@ du@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , who was expelled from the Reform Party , Kris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ and and the ECB forced to leave the forces of Maria Kal@@ j@@ s in the hands of our Tallinn , and the parties to the ECB , will be able to show the establishment of a business union in Tallinn - it seems to be as much as political parties in party politics at least as much as political parties this year .
however , buses will be considered in the autumn , and the key issue will be whether there are enough disappointed voters to all of them .
who will remain with the Sahel ?
if a small reduction has been made in the support of Ed@@ gar Sa@@ du@@ are , the events of his electoral union can be predicted .
one of the members of the country , some former and current middle @-@ party groups and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and is there any reason why , in Tallinn , some of the fai@@ th@@ ful fai@@ ths and sis@@ ters of Sa@@ du@@ are , to evade the candida@@ cy of the &apos; Sa@@ du@@ are list &apos; , which is the subject of suspicion of corruption and corruption , is becoming a reality ?
on the Russian @-@ speaking po@@ em of a film @-@ driven music cal@@ de@@ o , which takes part in the city of Las@@ na@@ mä@@ e ; and in any sense , the original computer game in which Prime Minister J@@ ü@@ ri Ra@@ tas , the Prime Minister J@@ ü@@ ri Ra@@ tas , has to avoid l@@ om@@ ni@@ pe and hur@@ ric@@ ane - is it the first time that the central party is trying to avoid the votes of the 16@@ th and 17@@ th year @-@ old voters who are allowed to take part in the ballot box ?
we look forward to the perception of the other political parties of the youth campaign .
if the Kan@@ al 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 view@@ ers , instead of the beginning of August , there will be two options : to accept that , in the future , only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn TV and English Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels or surrender each month to a few TV operators .
there are probably also those who openly welcome the free television experience at the beginning , but at the end of the day - albeit reluc@@ tantly - pay for television and advertise@@ ments .
the de@@ af@@ ening music , the people and the rub@@ b@@ ish left on the streets are the un@@ pleasant side of almost every major mus@@ ical festi@@ val .
however , if you do not want to be part of the ocean , it is worth going to the home country , rather than being pain@@ ted at home , to be able to go - and to s@@ le@@ ep for the Cop@@ tic sum of the F@@ esti@@ val .
Washington changes the rules of the Green Card
media publications are quoted by President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who says that a new US immigration plan , which makes the green card rules .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Re@@ publi@@ can and the President supports them .
the draft legislation will be discussed in the two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , as it will change the way in which green maps are issued to citizens of other countries in the US .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process gives an advantage to the candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economies , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp American media publications .
Si@@ b@@ erian young people are moving to the city , pensioners back to the land .
J@@ ev@@ se@@ ye@@ v A@@ na@@ tol@@ oli continues the tradition of the famous se@@ to gold min@@ ers of the River Ma@@ ana .
he is working 140 kilometres away from home to Ma@@ ana Ku@@ vai as a motor driver .
this is a tough job : two months of work without rest days , and then only 10 days at home and again .
during the three years of the Ar@@ tel , A@@ na@@ tol@@ l has seen only one time .
&quot; there is a res@@ ounding procedure : in passing , there will be a thorough check that the reference does not lead to it , and when it comes to doing so , it is A@@ na@@ tol@@ y .
M@@ are Pi@@ ho &apos;s conver@@ sation in the village of H@@ ai@@ da with the local se@@ to Ja@@ ga , who has spoken a lot about the memory of his family in Si@@ beria .
the archa@@ ic culture of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ pes is also beginning to affect the homes , because it is simply so shocking , thinks the most far @-@ sighted mix@@ tures have been investigated by Pi@@ ho M@@ are .
his first investigation trip to Si@@ beria will be 30 years later this year .
during this period , he has been there 14 times and has lived there for one year .
how much was the case in Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century in order to get land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I have taken note of this in the words of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to men , who have also thought about it .
it is very difficult to say , because at the time , up to 30 people could come up in one group , but the passport was only given to a man .
the passport was only given to one , but it was children , sis@@ ters and women .
look at how much this territory was here .
this was a number of times greater historical S@@ et@@ oma@@ y .
after all , it was necessary to educate , in some way .
S@@ et@@ os came here as farmers , but their lives changed , because here they came to regions that were not only involved in agriculture but also in the river ( pal@@ gi@@ par@@ ation ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New Pet@@ ser@@ t , many pigs went to work later in K@@ ras@@ no@@ jar@@ sk @-@ 45 ( where the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P@@ . ) , when it was formed .
was it the majority of the population in the region at the time ?
yes , they lived in a Compact .
in addition , a long tradition of marriage is maintained , and a lot of children .
seven @-@ eight children were common@@ place .
how much is the culture of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ pes different and different from that of the mother country ?
they are different , although what was said here was never the same .
they brought a great deal of money .
they then also made themselves ( the shadow ideas ) , but they always made a distinction between what was included and what was done here .
climate change has been severely affected by the traditional ri@@ val@@ ry , because there is , after all , cold .
the changes have been made .
for example , S@@ et@@ oma@@ al meat was salt , but here it was simply frozen .
where are the villages of Si@@ beria and what life is living there ? / graph@@ ics : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ends
the link with the mother country was spiri@@ tually strong , it was considered very important .
it seems to me that it is now starting to give back to the Se@@ tu@@ ony , to influence them .
those girls who have lived here in families have listened to ama@@ zing stories .
Pi@@ ho must bear in mind the people of the Estonian delegation , who came to H@@ ai@@ da at the beginning of July to the Kingdom of H@@ ai@@ da , and lived four days in homes - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is very easy to come and also to go , because the city has a wonderful location : the railway link and the roads at the crossroads of the road , says Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m , Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a great deal of hope , sport and culture , and the car@@ rot will be in every corner .
T@@ ap@@ a is a ti@@ p @-@ up city !
there is a small island in the L@@ in@@ era through the current White river , where the Ta@@ mil@@ s tend to be hi@@ jac@@ ked .
&quot; this beautiful train window does not appear to be &apos; , ha@@ gg@@ les Re@@ ig@@ o .
those who are not afraid of cold water can be floo@@ ded in the river , because the river is full of resources .
I have been flooding there , you can do it !
the water of the river can be considered long and simply to do the ro@@ man@@ tics - it can look at the flow of the river and think about life and want .
I have also been there with my own names .
O@@ oper@@ is@@ ol@@ ist Tam@@ m has , apart from anything else , been getting used to the three bridges between the river basin : &apos; that it is a place at the city , no one may come to answer if their stories &apos; .
&quot; there is a wonderful view of the T@@ ap@@ y mountain , but there are also health professionals where you can drink , winter ski@@ es and now , for example , to play a gol@@ f game - the gol@@ f path has been made , the chains can be borro@@ wed from sports centres , the Re@@ ig@@ o .
the old professional bodies , of course , go there , but I have not yet got to play there .
obviously , my colleague , Mrs Ras@@ mus , must be invited to visit T@@ ap@@ ale , because she has experienced c@@ gol@@ f@@ im@@ ans and she has a chain .
perhaps he will lend me !
Re@@ ig@@ o and M@@ än@@ nia were in@@ separ@@ able from the current period of childhood .
at least during the hours .
there is a lot of te@@ ars , frustration and rest in my sporting life .
not to mention the collapse of bel@@ ls and su@@ ici@@ des .
&quot; the entire city is now full of construction works , all of this will become unknown , &quot; endorses Re@@ ig@@ o .
however , the old and ti@@ red building is a very attractive place in which oral disco@@ veries are being played .
I am pleased that in 2012 , the head of R@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ M , welcomed my idea , and the summer theat@@ re of his theat@@ re had to be done .
although this year &apos;s theat@@ re season &apos; Ale@@ kse@@ i K@@ aren@@ in &apos; has just been carried out , on 11 August , the railway station is &apos; El@@ lu@@ wake &apos; , when the old building is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; from 11 to 13 August , T@@ ap@@ a City Days , which has been replaced by an open house site , and will take place in a series of cultural events , among other things , the Re@@ ig@@ o , who is proposing to visit the city of 9@@ 1@@ years in just a few days .
the muse@@ um has already been in 1994 since 1 May of the P@@ personal y@@ el@@ low house .
&quot; the house is small , but there is a great deal of publicity and information enormously , &quot; endorses the Re@@ ig@@ o site , which is full of the history of T@@ ap@@ a town , most of which focuses on the railways and sis@@ ter .
Re@@ ig@@ o mu@@ ds that , if you go through all the proposed sites , you will go on a long distance , but fortunately the small town is full of coff@@ ee .
&quot; we have such good eating places and when we sit in coff@@ ee , sometimes you have the feeling that you are abroad , he describes .
educated and young T@@ ap@@ y soldiers spend a lot of time in pub@@ s , se@@ sta@@ p there is a mixed feeling that you are in Estonia and your home town , but there is such an international company together .
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to the stories of the French or the Americans .
the wars , yes , we are going to have a lot !
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal ten@@ dering in Greece
Tele@@ kan@@ al b@@ TV quoted a Ministry of Foreign Affairs who announced that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ dering .
in the morning of 1 August , the police arrested people who illegally ordered a group of people on the island of Si@@ th@@ onia , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free ten@@ dering and are already imposing severe fines on all those who are caught in a place of cle@@ ans@@ ing , which is not intended for this .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
the w@@ ol@@ ves that teach the junta are going to break the sheep .
the farmers on the shel@@ ves must once again give the w@@ ol@@ ves of their car@@ pet &apos; educational material &apos; - probably the w@@ ol@@ ves that taught the junta have already broken down a number of sheep .
this year , the w@@ ol@@ ves in the Hi@@ i@@ u Coun@@ ty have broken sheep three times , with 23 sheep and injured eight , wri@@ tes the Hi@@ i@@ u page .
the soil was only three years before 124 .
there are also data from the Environment Agency in the Mur@@ d@@ les that the soil was not born on the shel@@ ves of the soil , and Hi@@ iu@@ land hunting Council information that this year has been fixed on the island of two w@@ ol@@ ves .
on Monday night , the w@@ ol@@ ves unle@@ as@@ hed 15 sheep in the village of K@@ abu@@ l , and injured in 18 survi@@ v@@ ors .
in the morning of the morning , the w@@ ol@@ ves in the village of Re@@ he@@ mas have broken down one of the sheep and w@@ ounded by one of you who had to make an emergency kil@@ ler .
rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and the draft law on the amendment of plant protection products .
the amendment to the law remo@@ ves the creation of a separate collection of data for both genetically modified ( GM ) crops and operators , which will continue to be used for plant health registers .
in addition , the GM crop management and the obligation to have prior agreement with the designated radio ap@@ ic@@ ulture person will be amended .
although there is currently no cultivation of GM crops in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as there is no decision to declare Estonia GMO @-@ free , &quot; said S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , the President of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both private and public sectors , in the Annex .
the draft law repe@@ als the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of GM crops in GM crops and operators , lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and the requirements for starting economic activities .
specifically , in relation to the beekeeping sector , the obligation to inform bee@@ keepers of the cultivation of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with bee@@ keepers before bringing up cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to the minis@@ tries for coordination .
all interested parties have the opportunity to examine the draft information system and , if they so wish , to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , those operating in the area of plant farming , bee@@ keepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10 .
so far , however , no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops .
the reason is that in Estonia there is no ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h , the European media , which is resistant to the ma@@ gic line mon 8@@ 10 .
it has also been extended to the southern regions , and it is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
in order to obtain certainty , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect the seeds of a possible GM contamination in Estonia , maize and soya vari@@ eties .
the results of the sam@@ ples carried out showed that seeds were not included in the seeds , and the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soya vari@@ eties in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms .
in turn , it can be concluded that in Estonia , GM crops are not deliberately culti@@ vated , and it was also confirmed that there has been no random contamination .

J@@ ose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manch@@ ester United States has recru@@ ited N@@ eman@@ ja Ma@@ tic@@ u in the form of &apos; genetic gen@@ i@@ us &apos; , after a central player against Sam@@ lov on Wednesday evening .
GBP 40 million of the game bought from C@@ hel@@ sea started in Dublin , in the last seasonal game of the Uni@@ te@@ di , before the UEFA Su@@ per C@@ up@@ i line against Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 , impressed by the role of defence , while Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Pe@@ re@@ ira were free to go on attacks .
however , having left aside from the Blu@@ eprint for seasonal Asia , Ma@@ tic@@ l was badly needed to bur@@ y and he had only received 45 minutes , which , according to M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , must be corrected before the start of the Pre@@ mi@@ er League season .
&quot; he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , gen@@ i@@ ous thinking - he has a football mind@@ set , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to achieve a form as soon as possible . &quot;
as in the past , the A@@ vi@@ va sta@@ di@@ um also started with other new recru@@ ited Vic@@ tor L@@ inde@@ l@@ of and Rom@@ lu Mubarak , and M@@ our@@ in@@ ho began to put in place a man who started in the beginning of the season .
the In@@ dependent public week revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wants to recruit three football clubs , but he confirmed that the club has already done a &apos; excellent job &apos; by concluding agreements with three of its four priority options .
&quot; I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three four , &quot; he added .
&quot; I am even more happy if they are able to make four four , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
another warm son was on the ver@@ ge of the GSM E@@ mb@@ assy on 1 August and this time in M@@ uh@@ us .
according to M@@ ati Mar@@ tin@@ son , an observer living in S@@ fragile Mar@@ tin@@ son , we received the first cu@@ mber to be equipped with the emb@@ assy in S@@ fragile , and this was@@ hing cell is already flying around , leaving the was@@ hing ground and joining the Mul@@ ti @-@ Grand Gulf of Mul@@ lu@@ tu .
this is because , after all , there are no fer@@ tility fields , the voice of the islands is written .
this Tuesday , in a relatively late way , it has become yet another son , and it was on the island of M@@ uh@@ u .
according to Mar@@ tin@@ son , the installation of emb@@ assies is actually an international project that is being carried out by A@@ iva@@ r Lei@@ to and I@@ va@@ r O@@ j@@ ka .
the soil was supplied by a son called M@@ ati GSM , S@@ fragile ves Turkey .
&quot; his actions are all on the internet : how he went to Spain in winter , back a long time in the German and Polish border , and then Sa@@ are@@ land came , Mar@@ tin@@ son spoke .
British inven@@ tors to in@@ sta@@ ll a micro@@ chi@@ p in their own body in order to access their homes and cars .
the British inven@@ tor became the first person in a country to have a micro@@ chi@@ p installed in order to be able to open up a mere hand@@ ful of its own privileges , to access the office and even to launch a car .
33 @-@ year @-@ old Ste@@ ven North@@ am children to in@@ sta@@ ll a small chi@@ p between their fin@@ gers and the finger of names , and now provides this service to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier through technology .
he has joined forces with Dr Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consul@@ tant @-@ an@@ es@@ te@@ si@@ olo@@ gist of the Ro@@ yal hospital in Win@@ ch@@ ester in Han@@ ts , in order to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards .
the technology is similar to the micro@@ chi@@ p that is installed on ca@@ ts and co@@ aches , and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure .
the North@@ am company will also replace the houses of houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chi@@ p , asking for GBP 300 per cent .
this is a child &apos;s father of a child who has now installed the technology both at home and in his car , B@@ M@@ W Z@@ 4 , which is going to start when he has his hand in the whe@@ el .
the White House has cost taxpayers thousands of
according to the military documents announced in the magaz@@ ine , the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicop@@ ter last month for an event involving American production in the south of the hor@@ ror of the taxpayer was to pay even USD 24 000 .
the green and white colour S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , which is called Marine One during the President of the President of the Council , was a central feature of the event that took place on 17 July in Val@@ ges Ma@@ in .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence and the White House senior officials reported on industrial products from all 50 states .
the helicop@@ ter built in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ tis was built together with the image of the hun@@ t , W@@ is@@ con@@ ten from the fire @-@ fighting car and the Mis@@ sis@@ si@@ um .
according to the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) documents , the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on , the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ is , called for the presence of a white house in a military c@@ abinet helicop@@ ter , or F@@ AR@@ G@@ O , to 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter for the &apos; extraordinary &apos; event in the south of the hor@@ ror .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 kom@@ and@@ ö@@ r a day before the event , in the e @-@ mail , the Deputy officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
the message stated that helicop@@ ter arri@@ ves in the south of 17 July this morning at 7 : 00 at 15 : 00 , and remains there until the same evening between 18 and 21 .
it was added that , if the departure of the White House were to be present , a second e@@ pa@@ thy is needed because of the restrictions on working time .
the original air crew was at the helicop@@ ter during the event , and the security team of the es@@ tu@@ r was close to the aircraft near the ground throughout the period .
it was not possible to read out from the documents given to the magaz@@ ine whether or not the second e@@ tho@@ s were eventually needed .
the H@@ at@@ ch law prohibits federal workers to use the government &apos;s assets for political purposes .
the documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 examined whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked whether this is a violation of H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law , and we were told that it was not , &apos; he wrote a com@@ man@@ der &apos; .
&apos;@@ It seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to the leading officer &apos;s Deputy .
the White House announced the event as a formal event in America and the H@@ at@@ ch law would not have covered it .
however , even official events have political under@@ ton@@ es .
the President supported the efforts of health reform in the Senate at the time in the Senate and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in jeopar@@ dy .
the use of the aircraft known as &apos; Marine One or Air Force &apos; for a politically profitable purpose is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use these purely photo@@ graph@@ s is unusual .
in February , the T@@ ru@@ mp came to the attention of his first campaign event in Flor@@ idas Mel@@ bour@@ ne , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the President , and Twitter &apos;s account of the messages that complain about how his predecessor , the President of his predecessor , used the aircraft .
&quot; the White Ma@@ l is very pleased to see the &apos; made in America &apos; in America , where products were represented in all 50 states made by American workers , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the spokes@@ man of the White House .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams are often carrying out tests around Washington and the southern hor@@ ror in order to get the US President &apos;s white house down with a c@@ enti@@ metres .
when the T@@ ru@@ mp was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House was organised by 58 sam@@ ples .
according to the official , the flight was considered to be the norm for the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; flight crew at the time of a month .
the Es@@ ka@@ r helicop@@ ter was flying at the time 11 hours for &apos; non @-@ subsidy missions &apos; .
according to the White House , none of the other forms of this event did not burden the taxpayers &apos; pur@@ ses .
according to S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky &apos;s representative , the company was not involved in carrying out helicop@@ ters in the southern hor@@ ror .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 does not maintain the budgetary documents and the precise costs of the President &apos;s flights are difficult to find out .
however , at the time of the defence Ministry for the financial year 2017 , V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D will be reimbursed at USD 24 380 per hour .
in Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r &apos;s documents , the main base of the flight was 30 minutes from the Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o airport to Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a in both directions .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using helicop@@ ter is well below the amount .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimated compensation rates include staff , care and many other irreversible costs , which will be taken into account in the annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 rand study , the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation rates for personnel costs , but they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former press representative of the White House Se@@ an S@@ pic@@ er defended the use of helicop@@ ter at the time .
&quot; the point is to show the things that have been made in America this week , &quot; said S@@ pic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that the State of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ ti is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds , if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the T@@ ru@@ mp was a helicop@@ ter in the south of the hor@@ ror of the event , or not , but he was hiding behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
in the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky addressed representatives of the T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , giving a jo@@ ke to media publications on company products in his personal aircraft .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ ská very well , &quot; said President , &quot; I have three products . &quot;
G@@ ari Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o - T@@ as@@ te@@ ars arrived in peace and joy
the 2011 M@@ M@@ il D@@ ae@@ tis hit Š@@ ade@@ i@@ ko@@ t in the last area , 800 m be@@ ver@@ ages and a sta@@ di@@ um was taken away from the sta@@ di@@ um .
shortly before that , he had received a zero @-@ sum leap in China .
the Helsinki formula for 2012 was an asset for the loss of cheap injuries , but in London , it received 60 13 points 23 .
however , I have continued .
after 2013 , Moscow M@@ M@@ il received a day @-@ to @-@ day parental injury on Estonia &apos;s record .
two years later , he became the 15@@ th seat of Beijing and met the Olympic Games , but this was more than a disappointment to the ath@@ le@@ tes .
the Ras@@ ke@@ d@@ ali@@ p@@ u was only passed through the soil of Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o , when the outcome of the Amsterdam E@@ mb@@ assy was not received at the beginning .
I would just like to put together a proper multi @-@ contest once or one time .
once again , you spra@@ yed Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
worse still , a month later , his Olympic contest in Ri@@ os re@@ i@@ ev@@ ig@@ as@@ tery was already in the first hur@@ dle .
the time had to be taken down - is there to continue with the seven competition at all ?
is the two @-@ day effort worth all of this ?
N@@ ei@@ u thought a long time , but found peace .
I have been able to think about it .
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time for us to treat ourselves and to think about it .
&quot; I knew that I am not going to put a c@@ ool on the picture , &quot; speaks of his self @-@ cle@@ ans@@ ing .
I was able to turn a clean page and go ahead with the new momentum .
T@@ re@@ en@@ er Anne hill has said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of neg@@ ligence , but he understood that , above all , the spor@@ ts@@ man himself has to come up with clarity .
after all , he was so repres@@ sed by all .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; however , he said that he does not give up and he wants to prove what he is worth , says remember .
now there is some kind of peace .
he is doing so to joy .
the contest came back in May , when the Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o set a new Estonian record of 6@@ 280 points at the G@@ öt@@ z@@ ise multi @-@ contest .
in a high @-@ level competition , he improved his personal excellence in the heat of nearly a me@@ tre ( 13.@@ 89 ) and drink a record of a record @-@ close @-@ time barrier .
then there was a feeling of multiple competition , that it is not at all a ceiling , but it was only the first hunger to be defe@@ ated .
for years , he has been guided by a word of memory that Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o is a black student .
he is ready to be spor@@ ts@@ man , he is a good training .
if something is wrong or wrong , he says it immediately .
he feels his own body and trus@@ ts his sense .
that is what we must do .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we follow it .
the new approach has also been found in Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
&quot; I am not the one who is going to make the most of the trend , he will speak and say that the most important thing is to get the right sense , because it will also ensure a good result .
baby wal@@ ks will be happy to do so .
the good emo@@ tion has also been offered to the S@@ ade@@ i@@ ko@@ u .
both his former friend , Mar@@ is hill and Gre@@ te , recently became grand@@ parents and has received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;@@ It has been quite interesting &apos; , says Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
one alcohol whose drinking is tanta@@ mount to &apos; training &apos; .
Li@@ ves@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is a father of such a great wine game that he believes - wine can be trained better than any other thing in the world .
She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist University of Y@@ ale .
his message is not about alcohol or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but instead about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
when it comes to the Council , the wine was complicated by enjoying it , and when we perce@@ ive it , we are putting our brain to work in order to create a taste for wine .
according to the She@@ per@@ di , there is not actually a taste of cattle , but a taste in the way in which wine is stimu@@ lated .
he will bring a comparison to how the brain &apos; sees &apos; colour &apos; .
&quot; taste is not in wine , taste creates wine and &apos; says She@@ per@@ d .
the things that are still affecting the taste of wine are , for example , our van@@ ity , gender and even the amount of coal that man produces .
She@@ per@@ d , of course , is that wine is not in order to be full of July .
&quot; there must be more &apos; , he says .
if you have too much lon@@ gest , the system is over@@ crow@@ ded .
over @-@ wine drinking can harm the brain instead of profit - according to the 2004 survey , people who drink more than three glass wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity .
10 % of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay for colleagues
the figures reveal that 10 % of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia are paid less than their colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , the portal Ge@@ eni@@ us wri@@ tes .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay study .
a total of 8 5@@ 77 posts were examined .
63 % of posts were employed by men .
&quot; although only 3 companies said that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies , the reality is that there is no pay gap , compared to the average salary of men per month is 10 % higher than that of women and men per year on average 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said Fon@@ crates analy@@ sts Il@@ mar North .

according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
the head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
the leader of the United Nations Assistance Mission , Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , said that hundreds of women are standing in local Soviet elections , three women are standing as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the importance of women &apos;s role cannot be exagg@@ erated , &quot; said in the statement on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections will mark the first time that power is given cal@@ mly from one democratically elected government to the next .
according to Hamas , women &apos;s strong role will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the Afghan independent electoral Commission , 1.2 million women have registered 3.@@ 6 million registered voters .
the joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both in large and small .
there is always too little common time , but the trend is a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
and what a convenient solution - wherever you were in the summer , live living in the summer , is always accompanied by the summer , and you will be im@@ pati@@ ently reminded of your fine voice : &apos; we are now making a trend ! &apos;
it is a very good game of gold , and it is a very good thing to by@@ pass the flag of the coast@@ line .
one is the foundation of permanent foot@@ wear and tuna - who would then like to take the form of sand co@@ ded in the summer over the summer ?
it is nice to use children instead of chic@@ ken .
firstly , it is secure and convenient , and the race is gradually growing at the same pace as training and force .
it is also possible to make villages with quite large children .
the child is training a balance , counts the cor@@ ps and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
bigger children can do their own villages at the same time .
the scale of the movement is in place and you are going to have a grip on the ground .
the fin@@ gers directly , the pal@@ try mini@@ mised properly .
the child can read the fla@@ ts and feel as a job .
the planet is an extremely high , but hope@@ less exercise for the child .
however , it is easy to make things easier .
in the game @-@ plan@@ k : take a long plan@@ k to a long plan@@ k , which is repeated .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much easier to do if , in the meantime , a friend can give hands .
to add the burden , we can keep the plants , the small market , and we can also walk around .
in addition , the pu@@ zz@@ le of a child can be plan@@ ted , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
at the same time , while the cra@@ bs are joining the sand , the tri@@ ump@@ h , ash and air meat burden , such as the infection .
a child wal@@ ks on their feet so that his body is distributed equally in advance and behind .
security can be kept in the hands .
all wal@@ king and wal@@ king up directly .
I will be able to fly , to fly , to strike a balance and to be difficult .
the life of a small engine@@ er is an ex@@ hor@@ tation if he gets a small number of things in every fire .
the extra burden will be made by sho@@ es in advance .
check that it would remain in a neutral position .
children themselves have a lot to do with c@@ oo@@ king meat in a couple and a pla@@ te .
the work and the w@@ ed@@ ding fuel .
follow the safety of the child , the place of contempt , and the hotel in a neutral position .

from the Philippines to a wide range of the world , a trip to the heart of the mo@@ pe@@ ds
the workshops have been bun@@ dled with the summer class , which has become a product in itself in recent years , which , in one of the right lines , has to be han@@ ged at the top of the hand , and which has been able to be used by traders , despite its modest origin , to display a price label .
it is probably one of the things that has been present in red tape , which is one of the things that has existed in the life of one order , and which has not been aro@@ used by a particular emo@@ tion .
it is simply there , and if there is no , there is no overla@@ p .
however , there is now a real victory for be@@ er bags , and mo@@ ef@@ ers have been exchanging their mus@@ h@@ rooms for the summer months against simple be@@ er bags .
it is not only a coast@@ line , but today it is just as popular as a street , and more courageous women even walk into office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear whether this summer &apos;s summer is still sitting or whether it is worth postponing and s@@ lap@@ sing a little more official .
however , the wealth of tolerance has made a real summer love for women .
for example , when we read foreign mo@@ eb@@ logis@@ ts , the first thing is that the mo@@ y@@ o@@ gh@@ ur@@ ts will be tru@@ th@@ ful to the local market as a first thing , and they will acquire some be@@ er bags , which will then be accompanied by a be@@ ac@@ on , a market and also as a friend in the city .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are even so generous that they are buying from the market a bigger w@@ ol@@ f and selling them to their loyal read@@ ers .
it is worth noting , however , that there is a demand for read@@ ers in the world , so that women in the real world ( and men ! ) are likely to be involved in each other &apos;s fishing zone in order to become a happy owner .
in some ways , this mad@@ ness is also understandable , because it is rare for them to be repeated when , in the fashion yesterday , it is possible to buy some of the things that have risen to a few EUR 10 .
it is true that white traders have also discovered a simple way of ear@@ ning money here , and so it is cheaper to sell luxury br@@ ands for a few hundred and a thousand euros .
obviously , in order to ensure that the richer customers do not have to feel easy to die , who are pro@@ pel@@ ling around with some cheap bags .
for example , it is possible to buy D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a over EUR 1 000 in hand .
however , the interpretation of Chan@@ el &apos;s interpretation can be found in the circulation of EUR 6 000 .
in contrast to most of the mo@@ tives , however , the be@@ er bags do not come from some of the big mos@@ ques , but their story began in a far more distant way .
Ad@@ mittedly , it is far from the Philippines , where they have been subjected to a wide range of them .
there is a lot of red tape , particularly in the case of export business , and there is very often no way in which there is a local export business .
Ad@@ mittedly , the 14@@ th century of the a@@ mus@@ ement technique comes from and is quite a series of normal cor@@ ps .
however , as the be@@ er does not have to be as strongly red as cor@@ ps , they will be able to have mus@@ ici@@ ans and other materials that are more person@@ alised and , by extension , more active .
in recent times , for example , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y bags where the colour of red col@@ ours or sk@@ in .
however , the full letter can be sent to the ac@@ tress J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , who was the largest bun@@ ch of be@@ er bags before they had been seen .
it was precisely that he su@@ ed the be@@ er of all kinds of clothing complex and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
however , the popul@@ arity of the Cop@@ ts today does not play a smaller role , but also that caring for them is a hot head and , unlike all the other things , they do not have to care for them with special means , but also the water and the w@@ et .
as in the case of the trend rob@@ ber@@ y , the br@@ ands have come out of all kinds of interpretations , apart from the classi@@ cal appearance .
for example , if you want to have a red ri@@ ce , you may have a red @-@ shir@@ t , or a little bit of a boo@@ m .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classi@@ cal be@@ er is never going to be a mo@@ b , but a be@@ er .
but what is the classi@@ cal be@@ er ?
for centuries , there has been a classic copy of the be@@ er , which rese@@ mb@@ les its style of cor@@ ps , is open , and it is short , as well as be@@ er , cri@@ pp@@ ers .

G@@ M@@ B concerns about investment in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant
the trade union is expected to be confirmed by the leaders of the long @-@ term production plans at the G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant in the company G@@ las@@ go@@ w .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment .
more than 500 people are employed in H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich know @-@ how and other products .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s owner , Pla@@ dis , said that they have invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years .
the workers and trade union chair@@ men have been the first to hear &apos; if something changes in the operation of the plant .
in a letter sent to the company &apos;s objects , G@@ M@@ B Scotland , Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e , called for &apos; Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s concerns about the lack of funding to modernise production lines &apos; .
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the site on the business needs and the future investment plan for the future , makes our members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and the people around G@@ las@@ go@@ w , as an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region where there is high unemployment and social housing .
therefore , in the context of jobs , wages and welfare in the east of G@@ las@@ go@@ w , and in the context of Bre@@ x@@ ti , the rise in living costs and the chronic damage in production , the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e company is badly needed . &quot;
the Pla@@ dis@@ e representative said : &apos; the leader of the Customs Council received a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ ch only yesterday , and the company complies directly with him , because we value an active relationship with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers and the representatives of the G@@ M@@ B , which discussed a number of issues openly .
we then discussed with workers that , like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we look at our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years we have invested more than GBP 5 million in the Customs site , most of it has gone into production routes and improvements .
we fully understand the heritage of customs as a source of production , and if there should be any changes in the activities of the object , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach ?
the la can regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main does not give up in the attempt to attract Mr Ney@@ mar to his ranks by making an offer of GBP 18@@ 9 million , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record con@@ quest ?
this bold approach has opened the summer as a transitional window , and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world record of buying , which was set at the last season by Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returning to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ ba for GBP 89 million .
once the transition has been completed , Ney@@ ra will become the most expensive player in the world and , at the same time , the highest paid professional ath@@ le@@ tes in the world , who will be able to pay over GBP 500 000 a week after the payment from the PS@@ G .
Barcelona is also an indication of the way in which the approach has been made , as well as of the liber@@ ation of Ney@@ ra , although the source of the Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ i Board confirms that the club has always taken the best care for football since its arrival in San@@ to@@ z in 2013 .
but did the PS@@ G President warned the football world for such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blair Agreement in 2014 , the N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all clubs who think about the best players in the PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that if they concern some of our players , we will be against them and we will contact their players , &apos; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
the Barcelona seems to have taken over this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the PS@@ G central player , Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow them to leave and that the Barcelona can become a set@@ back as a result of this interest , by abolishing one of their precious assets in the form of Ney@@ ra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t .
&quot; Bre@@ x@@ it is seriously threatened between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&apos;@@ I cannot imagine who would benefit from this &apos; , he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the free movement of people and goods , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , he emphasised .
he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union , and because it is not possible , he would be part of the European single market .
this would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
the second option to make Britain &apos;s departure smoo@@ ther would be the creation of the European Union and the United Kingdom Customs Union , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , the Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said : &apos; surely we could have such a British &apos; .
the alternative to this would be to return to customs points , which would be a historic division and a political failure .
&quot; bring about trade , prosperity and peace , &quot; said Irish Prime Minister .
he called Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that the result could affect every aspect of the daily lives of Northern Ireland .

7@@ 0.@@ 3 miles of mine consis@@ ted of 1.9 km of flooding , 90 km of cy@@ cling and 2@@ 1.1 km of cy@@ cling .
among others , the first tri@@ ath@@ on of her life has also ended up with a note of Av@@ ja .
&quot; I thought it would be difficult and , in the end , it was difficult to do so , &quot; said Av@@ ja fin@@ i@@ ch .
despite the complexity of Av@@ ja , in fact , the tri@@ ath@@ on is a force for all .
&quot; not dance kills , but the pace kills &apos; , he said , suggesting that , at a comfortable pace , everyone will be able to reach the fin@@ alists .
with the exception of O@@ tt Se@@ pp : &apos; everything is fine , but , unfortunately , he cannot swi@@ m &apos; .
Av@@ ja was very keen to have done a trend since February .
at the beginning of 4 @-@ 5 hours a week , but 10 hours a week later .
time 05 : 34 : 12 achieved 27@@ 60 seats in general terms .
although Av@@ ja lost both R@@ ai@@ o Pi@@ ir@@ ony ( time 04 : 59 : 53 ) and J@@ ür@@ gen L@@ ig@@ i ( time 05 : 06 : 37 ) , he won other so @-@ called &apos; prominent classes &apos; .
