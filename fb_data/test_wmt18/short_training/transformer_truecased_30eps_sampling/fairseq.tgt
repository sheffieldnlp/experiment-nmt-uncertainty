four members of the C@@ ro@@ Cape Verde group were detained in Estonia and Spain ;
on the recording , in Spain , the so @-@ called K@@ rem@@ ro group leader , S@@ val Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch , known as S@@ talo@@ gue K@@ Cape ro , was arrested by the police as criminal community leader of Estonia .
y@@ o@@ gh@@ to@@ ch , cap@@ tured in Spain , was arrested on trial .
yesterday , the Court also arrested three suspects in Estonia .
there is doubt that today it is members of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde crime &apos; association who , in the midst of 27 to 57 , have primarily committed crimes against drugs .
in M@@ dimensional province , Spain , the alleged leader of the no@@ torious association was detained .
three hundred men were arrested in Estonia and one of them reported as perpetra@@ tor number of a criminal organisation and two members of the criminal organisation .
the data collected indicate that the criminal community clearly separated the roles and roles .
the aim of the engaged criminal alliance was to commit drug crimes and therefore earn money from crime . &quot; stated Madam Va@@ NAFO Ver@@ te as unit of a pre @-@ trial trial Prosecutor of criminal proceedings .
&apos;@@ We do not rule out an increase in the circle of suspects of this criminal offence &apos; .
it is people who have previously taken an interest in law enforcement , some of whom have been sentenced for drugs crimes .
the Ver@@ te emphasised that cooperation with Spanish counterparts has always been crucial throughout the investigation .
&quot; international Cooperation has become common@@ place for us and this week &apos;s operation demonstrates progress in the work together , &quot; commented Ver@@ te .
core police services in Le@@ is said that the de@@ ten@@ ts preceded now almost one and a half years of pre @-@ screening .
&quot; we took L@@ ung work back in the first half of the week whilst having not only been arrested in Estonia and Spain for criminal offences , &quot; said .
it says that the chief criminal police officials helped arrest in Spain .
for years now we have good contacts and understanding with the Spanish police and civil Guard .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are another message to criminals that we will also have them from the other phase of Europe , &quot; says Le@@ i .
all the information gathered so far clearly indicates that when arrested , suspected men may continue with the criminal acts which provided for , and approved the arrest , requesting and agreed by the public Prosecutor &apos;s office .
in Spain , a man arrested is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
under this criminal case property , vehicles and cash have been seized for authorised confiscation .
a criminal case before judicial proceedings is operated by the organised crime officer of the central police , and by its public prosecution service .
in 2005 , the city in Tallinn &apos;s city court sentenced S@@ Interior Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch to blackmail and punished him with a five @-@ year prison sentence .
in the middle of the last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch was clas@@ sed as the second most prominent inter @-@ man in the world , headed by the then alliance @-@ ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m , Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch from Cape Verde came to the fore in the sources of Estonia in the early 1990s when he began examining the cases of blackmail in Tallinn .
apparently he has been taxed by tax@@ i @-@ drivers and female servi@@ ce@@ men on various hotel shel@@ tels and has ordered a monthly ro@@ of tax on commercial cre@@ ws .
international joint operations , seiz@@ ures of proceeds of crime and judgments in force ines effective combating against organised crime .
for example , the latest sentences , eight of the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ hs criminal offence , from whom proceeds of criminal activities were confis@@ cated , were seized € 80 000 , or from nine individuals by third , establishing a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade in illegal cigarettes and the crimes against people @-@ related trafficking in Muslim countries and in southern Estonia .
the proceeds of criminal works confis@@ cated there range from nearly EUR 71 500 .
progress has been made on these criminal matters by police officers sharing information and prosecutors &apos; evidence every day and operations are prosecuted in any EU country if needed .
citizens &apos; rights group war@@ ns against Mis@@ sou@@ sou@@ sou@@ des travel
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ 143 of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ AC ) has warned local S@@ ton@@ gues travelling to Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ res about its discriminatory policies and racist attacks .
the group statement says : &apos; why the NA@@ TO@@ EPA journey barrier issued for a state applicable until 28 August 2017 calls on all African travellers , Pro@@ bail and J@@ ans to be especially attentive and extremely careful as they move around your country , given the whole series of events , which have recently taken place and which have been pointed out , that the whole Roma have been exposed . &apos;
according to NA@@ reunification , the group was urged both by its recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i Law , which makes it more difficult to win proceedings involving discrimination and its assumption that , in many cases , minorities are unequal to those of regional law enforcement .
&quot; people &apos;s rights are being violated .
they seem to be taken because of their sk@@ in col@@ ours : they are beaten or killed , their President R@@ os Cha@@ pel borne in the NA@@ AC Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ industry , The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&apos;@@ We have never received so intense appeals &apos; before .
this is the first act of warning issued by an organisation between a US state State .
the group referred to events where racist insul@@ ts took place with extremist students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University , or S@@ and@@ er@@ les , of 28 years old fashi@@ oned &apos; experience in T@@ en@@ nes@@ this year .
S@@ and@@ ers died this year under any circumstances when they ran off the State o@@ ke and without charge of the crime , when they had their names arrested police , S@@ and@@ ers died earlier .
in addition , note draws attention to a recent report drafted by Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i Prosecutor General , which reveals that the cars of black drivers are 75 % more likely to be damaged by black car drivers than by white b@@ os@@ ses .
&apos;@@ The remark is for people to be aware of and to remain vigilant in warning European families , friends and contractors that might happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people must be ready , be it such as taking in fast @-@ track money or inform relatives that they are going through a state . &quot;
regarding the F@@ B@@ I hate crime awareness programme , record 100 hate crimes at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is in 2015 , which will place the state in a country on the 26@@ th seat of cross @-@ nationals for similar offences .
the travel warning is also a response to the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it harder to su@@ e a company for a search for housing or work .
the American Civil Aviation Community ( U@@ P@@ IC ) had previously issued travel preferences for T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona following the adoption of immigration laws which required local authorities to arrest people for face objections regarding immigration , because ACTA L@@ U told us that it would capita@@ lise on racial profiling .
usually the Ministry of Foreign Affairs amending travel warnings is issuing tourists to other countries but , recently , interest groups have started to resort to this measure as a counter @-@ reaction to certain US @-@ level laws and trends .
he@@ pati@@ tis : what is everyone listening to in different forms of this serious disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis - operating ch@@ ro@@ four , that is , scrap animals - can be caused by five he@@ pati@@ tis drug , A , B , C , D and E .
all those vir@@ uses highlight the acute combustion of li@@ ver .
however , the cost of life is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B and C that can develop into li@@ ver cir@@ rests , such as rem@@ ket@@ us and stressed cancer .
Ku@@ ul@@ o Ku@@ TI@@ r , a Health Agency &apos;s epidemi@@ ological advis@@ er , said that he@@ pati@@ tis disease is the same in all categories of li@@ ver inc@@ in@@ eration : f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ tude , la@@ v@@ ness , be@@ ating , smoke , f@@ ist pain , black dig@@ es@@ tion , dark weather , meat and excessive house pain and w@@ ound and packaging col@@ lisi@@ ons .
the final disease also results from the People &apos;s population revival of li@@ ver inc@@ iner@@ ator gen@@ ous condition three diseases .
proach children reach sadly un@@ disease .
it is possible to determine the different types of land bur@@ ning only based on laboratory science .
pe he@@ pati@@ tis can go on with chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and commit decades without disease , meaning that people do not perhaps know anything about an intrinsi@@ c disease that damages their with@@ holding earnings .
he present he@@ pati@@ tis various forms and describes the progress there@@ of in a closer respect .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses are spread from the illness in@@ discrimin@@ ating from a person to cattle , and are infected when they eat contaminated foods or drinking water , inside , substances that are infected by man &apos;s emissions , food , maize and objects , in@@ take , and drugs consumption .
Al@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , in other words , family members of the health group at risk - that is , rec@@ id@@ negotiated caring people , people with chronic pay @-@ awarded diseases , sex people with infected persons , male sex men , drug addi@@ cts , passengers visiting countries with disabilities .
S@@ activation can be prevented after vaccination , notably by claiming vaccination for people , and to someone at risk of he@@ pati@@ tis A .
furthermore , it is important that daily hygiene requirements are complied with : res@@ che@@ du@@ ling or dis@@ infec@@ ting hand before taking care of food , all fruit and vegetables are was@@ hed .
the he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread once a person &apos;s blood , from drugs injec@@ tion , pregnancy and ex@@ termination , on blood @-@ contaminated s@@ abduc@@ tion , injuries to ther@@ ap@@ y , cord blood @-@ blood Earth , from wh@@ eel@@ chairs to sex and he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ Health from diseases to fo@@ e@@ tal / inf@@ ants .
the health , rescue workers and police officers who visit countries involved in the high @-@ level incidence of he@@ pati@@ tis drug infection will be en@@ x@@ oned by drug addi@@ tions , sex partners , men , survi@@ v@@ ors and carers of infected mother , survi@@ v@@ ors , blood and other body flu@@ ids , and travellers with he@@ pati@@ tis B .
to counter he@@ pati@@ tis tis , it is possible to vacc@@ in@@ ate people ; crucially , to vacc@@ in@@ ate people at risk of suffering from chronic li@@ ver , HIV infection , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
the he@@ pati@@ tis is other preventative measures : prevention of the use , promotion and dis@@ honesty of alien hygiene and man@@ ure ware , other sharp tools and sy@@ tar@@ d@@ inal a@@ decisions and types of cancer , humili@@ ation and use of c@@ in@@ weaknesses in the event of any danger of contamination known to humans or prevention of sin@@ king activities .
the racism against he@@ pati@@ tis B is part of the Estonian national immun@@ isation scheme and is free for the children .
he@@ pati@@ tis C virus sur@@ faces human blood , drug injec@@ tion , bin@@ ge , honour , use of contaminated objects , non @-@ blood , sex with a he@@ pati@@ tis drug disease and harm transmitted from tail@@ ors to animal D@@ os@@ si@@ gh@@ ty .
He@@ pati@@ tis C healthcare , rescue workers and police officers are included in the person infected . sex partners , men with their infected mother ; women with pre@@ born babies , sick family and carers , and passengers under painful conce@@ als of blood , physi@@ cs ; common dangers of health care , rescue personnel and direct , persons with HIV infection and C he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ ill @-@ treated countries .
the He@@ pati@@ tis C is a prevention measure : avoiding the use , pregnancy and peer rec@@ u@@ mation , of household hygiene or man@@ na , other th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic clean@@ ers , other shows and sy@@ stal@@ si / ta@@ ment , and con@@ az@@ ox@@ id@@ isation in the event of a risk addi@@ tive .
He@@ pati@@ tis C &apos;s vaccine has not occurred .
He@@ pati@@ tis H@@ pati@@ tis causes the he@@ pati@@ tis D virus which occurs la@@ tely with the presence of the he@@ pati@@ tis B virus .
consequently , we have a D he@@ pati@@ tis disease , with the He@@ pati@@ tis B or the Cen@@ tr@@ update for chronic B he@@ pati@@ tis disease .
He@@ pati@@ tis virus vir@@ uses spread during exposure to blood and other body flu@@ ids , contaminated sy@@ tri@@ wood need@@ les , sexu@@ ally transmitted and rarely associated animals .
the he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis R@@ oun@@ d@@ der is chronic B he@@ pati@@ tis vi@@ ral dis@@ course and people not with a he@@ pati@@ tis B immunity .
an effective prevention measure is the vaccination of he@@ pati@@ tis B vaccine , which will protect people from the infection of the He@@ pati@@ tis D virus .
he@@ pati@@ tis virus disease is spreading fe@@ ....@@ men@@ tension along the or@@ ch@@ es@@ ome route to drinking water and food , including very few hot beef , fish and marine sh@@ ell@@ fish , li@@ prime blood , headline gun@@ s and mother @-@ infected animals .
citizens may be affected by he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis in the country .
stro@@ ke prevention measures are the basic hygiene requirements which are being set in motion : was@@ hing or dis@@ infec@@ ting hands once the disease hit , before carrying out or eating food after being treated .
F@@ ru@@ its vegetables can was@@ h before consuming , prevent the nutrition of less treated beef , fish and se@@ vessels , contamin@@ ate only safe drinking water and refrain from restricting consumption of drugs .

but more deeply later passed on in history .
a b@@ rick ba@@ g would have de@@ oli@@ ged an excuse to learn about the pu@@ zz@@ le , the more narro@@ wer concern would have been to economies greater impact on the exceptional story of a licences ree .
there are now re @-@ packa@@ ged two books like Ne@@ m@@ t on the one hand , G@@ ood Kli@@ m@@ ti and his me@@ dal , with the story A@@ tus B@@ lo@@ ch Co @-@ Bau@@ eri de@@ pic@@ ting his or her prosperity , and a much more conc@@ ise and comprehensive book book from respected Jewish families and the German occupation , with its subsequent affects in Austria .
the first third reformist in the middle of Vienna cultural life of which they now have hold in alternative private capital can makes the slightest effort to imagine how more than a hundred years ago she s@@ ounded her lives around R@@ ing@@ st@@ race or how the Cen@@ tr@@ al coff@@ ee turned all his heads in when she came before her wal@@ king .
these offices were concentrated in one of Europe &apos;s rich@@ est cities , and Britain &apos;s bit is like a program@@ med in the book , seeing the name which is familiar with it .
however , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud operated in a town where the greatest levels of suicide in Europe were ram@@ pan@@ t and did not deliver anything more , as though nothing else .
or perhaps yet , in fact , every an@@ ima@@ ted dra@@ wer will add colour to the cultural life in Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
Si@@ x@@ teen hundred years ago , the quantity of Jews in Vienna was explo@@ sive , developing into the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
nearly one in ten respondents of Vienna were Jewish .
the A@@ ite parents were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but when the help campaign for the A@@ aks was tough on each other , it had become the seventh largest bank in the H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg imperi@@ um , with the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ di Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch and a Climate Maj@@ ese .
but A@@ de@@ h H@@ un@@ t did not draw up 100 % of the gla@@ b@@ ene to which he belon@@ ged .
looking at the lesson of Da@@ am gold , it is hard to believe that , towards the end of life , it conta@@ cted that larger 160@@ alism and left of themselves with sa@@ i@@ our from the trip to Soviet Union .
in 19@@ 32 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s Por@@ t Col@@ ree from Climate , it was the last si@@ x@@ ty @-@ minute official in Vienna .
at the time , at the cli@@ mb order , you paid a sum of 4000 k@@ ron@@ es , a quarter of the price of a land @-@ based house .
nor , in the case of a few sports CP@@ R , it suspected having m@@ oul@@ ded Peter , a car@@ to@@ wer with a mo@@ di lin@@ er and at all that , with the oversee , a sugar mag@@ na@@ r .
as far as the A@@ dele@@ gation is concerned , the only certain fact is that any com@@ ical or artistic relationship that arose during the course of the work continued to enjoy life .

artists did not notice the simil@@ arity of two women .
how is Hitler linked to the creation ?
&quot; I feel I owe her happ@@ iness to make her work accessible to the general public , &quot; publicly speaking to A@@ ud B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer a few years after leaving an ar@@ tist ( Climate killed in February 19@@ 18 ) was in February 19@@ 18 for meeting DG Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere M@@ use@@ um and asked their families to travel a muse@@ um .
six years before death , one of the three hea@@ ths was the cli@@ m@@ ka Ministerial Do@@ ree .
she also invited her hus@@ band to leave her two emb@@ assies in her testa@@ ment ( February 19@@ 25 ) and four G@@ raham Kli@@ m@@ t Coun@@ ty to Austria Gal@@ infring@@ er .
she je@@ al@@ ously told her messages to Mari@@ ana and Lucas .
a year after Climate cli@@ ten had finished &quot; Austrian Appendix Mon@@ a , &quot; attempts to get Northern Trans@@ statistical Credit M@@ ist Da@@ ol@@ f Hitler 17 , a men @-@ mor@@ alising doctor , had been making ends in Vienna but he failed to draw the line .
although sometimes a mistake was made on account of Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism that Jewish profes@@ sors did not adopt it into the A@@ ca@@ de@@ an , none of his ex@@ ca@@ gen@@ ous colleagues was really Jewish .
in any case , Mrs G@@ uli had grown considerably with the function of Tra@@ ci@@ er in Austria since 19@@ 39 , ren@@ dering it essential that the rich Jewish arts in Vienna found toward g@@ ard@@ ening sho@@ es for the Naz@@ is community .
Hitler &apos;s personal arts wealth also caught some expert work in A@@ le at home , but not those of Climate .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the Nazi artistic slavery , the 10 @-@ year impasse began between native government representatives of the Federation Federation and the he@@ irs of B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ hir@@ ra@@ ys .
let me just state that if &apos; Se@@ el@@ ance &apos; sees in Vienna the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle , A@@ VIT@@ B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri &apos; in Da@@ ami gold &apos; should be treated in New York to Ne@@ ue Gal@@ lity .
and - before Vienna - read through this book .

so it is not so much a boo@@ m - and a very moving story - rather than a relatives &apos; le@@ g .
the events facilitated a significant portfolio of content in the list of Bau@@ integra@@ ans that were produced at the beginning of the book .
17 @-@ year @-@ old sw@@ im@@ ming in Canada has very close to an Estonian la@@ den !
in his life , the gold was Y@@ el@@ low 200 m to a personal existence , just as she sw@@ allowed into 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 .
the Ti@@ pp@@ mark starts off from 17 years ago , working first in K@@ h@@ all Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships in Canada at 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 , on the foundation of the Pri@@ it A@@ av@@ lic U@@ pea@@ king bloc .
finally , unfortunately , ten A to It came to a promise .
he completed his Máire G@@ ren@@ tal distance with 2.@@ 15.@@ 76 , and gained a good seventh seat with a powerful new top level .
out of the Estonian record , Estonia ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) , Article K@@ end@@ zi@@ or , inflexi@@ ce D@@ R has nearly half a second to repair it .
the Scoreboard brought about most ult @-@ up@@ bringing from Estonia at all times reached levels , and 15 % of Estonia &apos;s most recent individual top @-@ rate ceremony is the equivalent in Estonia .
the young hope for the future lies in the Canadian Millennium C@@ up and the Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship of Cancún at 100 minimising , 200 m and 400 metres lacking and 200 m@@ m and 400 million complex@@ ities .
last week in Tor@@ onto , Canadian domain champi@@ ons took place in Tu@@ onto , and gold also made successful head@@ lines there .
he won over 200 m in bal@@ ra@@ cing on sil@@ ver me@@ dal during 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
this is the very day since the latter last year , that withdrawal was taking place as a gu@@ ise of distance .
at least greater speed than Gol@@ den , the Belgian record , E@@ lina Par@@ tias , distance it in Estonia .
a Canadian revol@@ t has won a fine country@@ man of 100 p@@ m in hell with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season country with 5@@ 6.@@ 66 .
for example , top of his year , Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k , for example , has attracted it only a century faster .
she got a personal top level , saving us a further 100 m cu@@ bic as she sw@@ im@@ med , in the opening up of the letter 1.@@ 0@@ 3,@@ 69 .
at a half distance , she only got seven seats when she was s@@ u@@ hed in the final as far as I would .
gold is currently leading four separate phases of Estonian season ranking .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics tri@@ m nic@@ ely na@@ ils
in time , we have a ch@@ ord - this includes a salary deplore also for the US President , Donald T@@ ru@@ dal .
now , since T@@ ru@@ mp has been one of the most ban@@ ner @-@ aged presidencies , critics are already b@@ lending teet@@ h .
according to SADC , 17 days &apos; leave is planned by the President at B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster of ara , the B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster student club of New Jer@@ ina .
although presidential leave began yesterday , it has been a week now that speakers on leave against Thailand have started .
they repeated the fes@@ tive ex@@ ca@@ vation funds .
basically the President fears for a typical weekend of her exchange in cotton , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey .
incidentally , in 19@@ 6 , the T@@ ru@@ mp is in no position to de@@ tain it one more .
for example , George W@@ . Bush made it 67 days in these hours &apos; leave - Barack Obama stands at half the target of T@@ ru@@ mp , but 21 days .
however , the Olympic Games tend to rapidly forget all the things .
yet a few days after becoming President , T@@ ru@@ mp was saying in his sending &apos; 60 minutes &apos; that there will be no time any longer for long rest in his national band because a great deal needs to be done .
three years ago he also voiced his outra@@ ge at Barack Obama &apos;s holiday .
on Twitter , today President wrote , &apos; whereas Obama is on holiday , gol@@ f plays , brak@@ es and j@@ uni@@ ary concer@@ ts , journalists in flight go to their head . &apos;
in the arts , people reported to officials that a 17 @-@ day gol@@ f club visit went on to some kind of re@@ bel@@ lion .
this is what is officially ter@@ med &apos; work holiday &apos; during which the light light Olympic engine has no time for reading or other pro @-@ active purposes .
furthermore , Sun@@ days had to have a second reason .
the separate system relating to the Western tunnel will be replaced , which is due to have left office after the full staff in question .
the West will also contain the O@@ val Office and other President &apos;s office .
&apos;@@ I believe no one of you would be on the west in August if there is 38 degrees there and there is no col@@ post pension &apos; , said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , speaking for the White House who stressed that he would continue working during rest .
if President T@@ ru@@ mp includes another 17 days , you will get an idea of a video .
facing up to critics via Facebook without standing for government unless a result of the criticism of voters
the father of our country was aware of negative media coverage in many ways .
the Americans love George Washington but it was not long in newspapers to start mu@@ d@@ dling him on for everything from internal politics to political principles .
naturally , the criticism was irri@@ tated by him .
but he did not sh@@ y away his critics .
because , in 17@@ 83 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression could be taken away from us and ban@@ died of and remained silent , trag@@ ically , could lead us to the massacre &apos; .
that brings me to Kinga K@@ gan , the head of Mar@@ y@@ land , who must push hard for being more like Washington .
the Ho@@ gan &apos;s entries have blocked and cancelled at least 450 people pol@@ ling , who expressed their views on his official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the American Civil Liberties Union meaningful ( cit ) was thus taken to the Court .
the Ku@@ ber@@ ner leadership te@@ mb@@ ol@@ oured the act empty and the office of Internet comment mo@@ cked out of con@@ tras@@ ting show &apos; who ca@@ res ? &apos;
&quot; that is Facebook , &quot; many told us .
but it does matter .
and this is particularly significant if it is a man like Ho@@ gan .
it is striking according to the popular standing Re@@ publi@@ can Council as it is an openly democratic state .
his approval rate comes second with the 50 @-@ run@@ ners of the country .
Ho@@ gan is not an un@@ wise reaction head .
it has determined the State firmly and has strictly maintained its principles to which it is a state .
furthermore , in dealing rather skil@@ fully with your voters , he has used Facebook rather frequently as a means of informing him about this content , for example , after the chemical season for the first time in its rush her head .
therefore , the Governor &apos;s website in FT@@ S is a publicly labelled public forum managed by workers from the taxpayers &apos; dollars &apos; pay @-@ bound arrangements for veri@@ fying people who find themselves travelling to commodities unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
O@@ CH@@ R &apos;s spokes@@ man , Ame@@ lia Ch@@ asse K@@ ingle , defended the conduct of H@@ end neighbour with the interview given to Mr. Dur@@ ing The Washington Secretary , claiming that blocking these comments was nothing more than a programme re@@ pos@@ turing .
however , it is all too easy to take a g@@ host image of online elec@@ trol@@ els , spa@@ m busines@@ spe@@ ople or people with anger .
the post has spoken to several people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and that is exactly what they are about everywhere else : they are about communications with their chosen leaders - a teacher , the owner of a firm and pas@@ tor - not Internet checks .
they all said that their comments were respectful , pru@@ dently thought @-@ out and not at all ro@@ ws .
the Pas@@ tor quoted the Bi@@ ble in his post , underlining the K@@ consistency Catholic movement .
a lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan@@ tis Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not give anger , but rather hate crimes .
&apos;@@ I dec@@ ently tima@@ ted that I am disappointed as he has not responded to hate crimes and other recent news stories to hear &apos; he wrote The good news story in the fallen @-@ room of Cyprus .
&quot; nor do I like the idea that while many people give their comments on the same subject , some are immediately erian in terms of collective efforts instead of admit that they are a source of concern &apos; .
what Governor General officials call the leap &apos; targeted spa@@ m attack &apos; would probably be called &apos; public support &apos; by others .
the information in the Facebook era enables messages to be easily fitting , merely blocking criticism or dele@@ ting negative comments .
it is all about much cleaner than before , when there was a requirement to expe@@ l workers to do this so , so that they get down newspapers with critical leadership letters and bur@@ n them or arrest prote@@ sters and force them to remain silent .
but that is exactly what happens today , simply industri@@ ally .
the Ho@@ gan is not the first public official criticised for doing nothing about Facebook and other social media .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has taken users of Twitter who are blocked from Twitter .
one of the first mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous sentences in the subject took place in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a last week .
in Alexand@@ ria , Secretary General James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is , US Chancellor , decided that the board president of the Coun@@ ty Council of Lou@@ d@@ ou@@ au had breached the first or@@ deal of a constitutional improvement when he blocked a constitu@@ ent from his Facebook page .
dence , he also visited B@@ ev@@ in , for example , ACTA L@@ U Facebook and Twitter for its use .
this must not be so complicated .
during Washington , the cost of affordable postal expenses under dubious conditions had a similar impact on the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous translators has given rise to manipulation .
and even then Washington had to be@@ at face anon@@ ymous window controls .
people wrote letters about newspapers from pseu@@ do @-@ na@@ methods such as Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , making also bro@@ k@@ ering in Washington &apos; decisions &apos; .
according to historically harves@@ ted documents from the Online George Washington collection project , she locked into a c@@ abinet of petitions criticising her position on the purposes of UK @-@ America treaties of friendship , trade and shipping .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , opinions , discussions are the fundamental principles of our country .
and leadership proper management means accepting that .

a Northern I@@ ris@@ ter with his musi held routes near Ar@@ cher@@ field L@@ int last year leading from Paul E@@ al@@ ala@@ ia to brink of degradation has embarked upon a new site , filling turnover of tur@@ ni@@ mir si@@ r and chief execu@@ tor of clubs , rather than John S@@ anu .
I saw that R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ance C@@ lu@@ b was built and now we are seeing a club br@@ us@@ h in the back@@ room for this event , said R@@ aff@@ er@@ ty .
right now the players see the band in their best form ; this is with tremendous status .
Jer@@ ry has done an excellent job of constructing this ground .
he is a keen supporter of this gol@@ f f@@ ever game and proud of what is being achieved here .
it makes it possible to present this path exc@@ el@@ len@@ tly . &quot;
an Eng@@ lis@@ h@@ man is ever looking forward to being able first to defend the charter even though the man has won the European Toubon as well as European challenge during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this is given a very special feeling , &quot; said a agents in Sou@@ th@@ por@@ tis .
&quot; I could not defend my Ex@@ t@@ rema@@ du@@ ra O@@ Antwerp title because it was taken from my playing field in a year &apos;s time .
it is ag@@ ony to come back to that channel .
it is a mag@@ nific@@ ent place to play gol@@ f be@@ dro@@ om .
I remember last year &apos;s memor@@ ies , and for myself and my wife Shar@@ on , last year &apos;s victory was a special one .
this was a very special period , and we will always be stuck to our hearts . &quot;
finally , on the soil of a nation the competition will once again be returned to G@@ ary Or@@ r , who joined the European architecture for gene@@ tics earlier this year , when he got 50 .
this is her first event in Scotland since the participation of A@@ ber@@ de@@ en asset Management Secretary O@@ pen@@ il in 2013 .
&apos;@@ Bres@@ tically significant of life always comes worth playing at home , &apos; stated Hel@@ en@@ s@@ bur@@ gh man Or@@ r .
&apos;@@ The ro@@ d was good at the time , but there were also feelings of more damage .
I have experienced playing at sphere once again somewhat and I have shown quite respec@@ table gol@@ f f@@ an distributed .
I am happy that we have made things so far . &quot;

it is a rare cloud in Papua mä@@ ian ; it is a former col@@ ony , a Dutch unitary To@@ mas , involved in 19@@ 69 following a referendum that sti@@ r@@ red up a controversy that forced just 1 0@@ 26 old students to vote to paper their hands before their heart .
through the Dutch sup@@ rema@@ cy of release , the movement has urgently pushed its tor@@ ships against the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta Government - a government that is maintaining the region under its tight control - by keeping out foreign journalists and human rights defenders .
in 2003 , the province was officially po@@ c@@ oo@@ ked back to P@@ ope or West Pa@@ pu@@ practically , so that there was an eastern island left independent Papua New Guinea .
the majority is a remote and remote site - a journey from Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ s to 90 minutes from the capital of the province , and therefore we have a five hour journey to rent with the birth vehicle over@@ flight .
there is no public transport .

Papua Japan is the poorest province in which 28 % of people live below the poverty line and the statistics on inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy are some of the worst in Asia .
it is actually a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia as well .
a mountainous province with an estimated complexity of 153 000 inhabitants is the largest and most cost @-@ effective gold mine of G@@ ras@@ berg , which is a firm based in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x , F@@ bet@@ ten Mc@@ Mor@@ an , which has undertaken up to one hundred metres away from Peru .
in 2015 alone , F@@ re@@ exports from there are approximately USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and bun@@ dles .
furthermore , Hong K@@ ide can be bound up an estimated USD 78 billion worth of raw wood .
but these ri@@ ches are a source of suffering for boats as a result of the stif@@ ling presence of a powerful Slova@@ ki@@ an army .
the 2005 study by The New York Times showed that F@@ ree@@ exports paid around USD 20 million for local military and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to USD 150 000 for a single officer .
P@@ ope efforts to secure more autonomy threaten this gol@@ den match and controls it ru@@ th@@ lessly .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1967 , while thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the flo@@ til@@ la of Indonesia .
according to the Asian Committee on Human Rights , there was a massive : mass killings on the Cel@@ si@@ ties of Papua mercury in the 1970s by genocide , a s@@ word .
last year alone more than 3 900 peaceful protest@@ ors were arrested by the police in the region of Indonesia .
the bri@@ gade report 2016 &quot; We lose all , &quot; committed complete testi@@ monies of atrocities , such as extra@@ judicial killings , torture ( rape and power struggle ) and brutal crus@@ hing of peaceful demonstrations , to which the second report states that rape and electric shocks are particularly widespread .
&apos;@@ It will be hard to read the figure of victims because of the incidents this Republic takes place every few weeks , &apos; says the physi@@ cian , Lu@@ adequately executed by Human Rights Watch , Mr Andreas Har@@ son .
Jews have been turned off all the more strongly because Papua Coun@@ ties have caused new entrants to go up across Indonesia .
Eigh@@ ty @-@ five per cent of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graphy is changing , as Czech @-@ populated sane W@@ ou@@ tw@@ ard , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ li competitors come from Muslim economic migrants .

the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , known as Jo@@ ko@@ w amongst the population , pledged to address these inequalities and human rights violations in P@@ ope in his 2014 election campaign .
the former bot@@ tle won on its way to the presidential task of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta in Papua 29 local constitu@@ encies , including the P@@ ania .
yet very little has changed in the P@@ ope and local people feel chea@@ ted .
&apos;@@ O@@ ur hearts have been broken down because , in 2014 , Jo@@ ko@@ w was able to vote at the stand@@ still hope that it will live up to our hopes of restoring fairness &apos; says li .
well , in fact , just two months after Jo@@ ko@@ w took office , the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i faced a low performance in October .
on 7 December 2014 , at most 11 children spread on b@@ reat@@ h because of the White Paper &apos;s terrible story of 2 44 soldiers .
the children ab@@ ited told them they should integrate the front @-@ up .
according to what the local passport , Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ min@@ i , insul@@ ted one of the soldiers of their tone of voting and subsequently lea@@ sed with four soldiers .
according to the victims and specta@@ tors , in the b@@ during the concentration , the mili@@ tia could drive children forward and deprive them with their gun@@ s .
in addition , one of the soldiers shot at the children .
one child , 16 years old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , was tas@@ ked so cru@@ el@@ ly that he fell into the house .
a few hours later , the ne@@ ar@@ by electoral Commission was set to bur@@ n the building and the next day things es@@ tu@@ alised apart still further .
around 1 000 young fishermen , women and children gathered in the downward fields facing a local police force and military command centre to enforce justice .
V@@ eri@@ al hunting boats carried live rub@@ ber @-@ co@@ ses and submitted a tri@@ ck tox@@ ic@@ o @-@ tan@@ k introducing a 30 @-@ mile hal@@ k c@@ rying and resulted in poultry bo@@ ilers .
some protest@@ ors started falling on the police and the military .
on arrival in the field of love , last week &apos;s soldiers were sent a response via gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ la . &apos; if the mass of the public means more than once resistance ; let them down ; &apos; said official Journal which you have seen in time but has not been handed down to the local media .
gal@@ dan@@ to Ko@@ to , the oldest Mayor of Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ me , has felt the danger and called for peace to be preserved and asked to go back to a popular !
there was no will to hear either .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen I was suddenly dead to left , &apos; he said time at a time in his private col@@ ours on the be@@ dro@@ ck of a school .
we still do not know who the shoo@@ t was , but they say that the first been on the troops &apos;s lines this month .
&apos;@@ The people were very different ; the House s@@ ounding up and adds . &apos;

&apos;@@ I would like to come to him and have looked on him by body to make sure you are facing him &apos; said that the magaz@@ ine was treated with real taste at the time in Y@@ oh@@ ano , who is using only one name ump@@ teen , many Lebanese .
&quot; I saw that she is dead ... Val@@ ley . &quot;
in Papua poli@@ tan , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , the chief police inspe@@ ctor enqu@@ iry into repor@@ ters , stated that he considers that he would only be subject to a security of his department because he was under attack .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at les us with threats to death undermined , we must defend ourselves , &apos; committed the Commissioner for the Press officer in Papua police , Mr P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , in 2015 .
it is a matter of life or death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ors were murdered and there were many injured .
news of the killings reached J@@ ak@@ ar@@ di only next day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ras gave an im@@ passion@@ ed speech with her expressing condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses in P@@ ope .
&apos;@@ I want to immediately make sure that this never happens again in the future &apos; .
those Minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that he would introduce an ADR mechanism to tackle human rights crimes .
but there were ex@@ cus@@ es coming almost immediately .
&quot; most crimes happened a long time ago .
some of these occurred in the 1990s and the early 200@@ 0s .
the end is that we are committed to this , but we should follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
however speaking time at J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas on 5 June , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to re@@ signed his words saying that he had no intention of creating a P@@ ope mechanism for dealing with complaints .
instead , he said &apos; everything will be solved according to law &apos; .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , accused of crimes against human rights by the UN of more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor in the bloody independence referendum back 1999 , said that 11 illegal crimes against human rights were resolved in P@@ stan@@ a , including the incidents in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the families of the PSE victims made such statements with a dis@@ da@@ the doubt about them .
&apos;@@ There has been four hearings in the last three years - but no progress has taken place , &apos; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&apos;@@ I &apos;m ti@@ red of this . &apos;
he says that , years on , &apos; there is still a fear &apos; .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; she says .
&apos;@@ I am afraid the army arrests me , I am afraid I am shot &apos; .
he co @-@ emp@@ t Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed the view that , with the media , people are afraid of wrec@@ king this incident .
he stated his defeat for that military be@@ having after helping to bur@@ y four victims .
&apos;@@ E@@ ven after the bu@@ o@@ asis had been bur@@ nt , I was found by the military units , &apos; she will say &apos; .
the efforts have not stopped .
on Tuesday , citizens in neighbouring stein , D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i , are shot in by the authorities in Indonesia .
one person &apos;s death and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , when communications were w@@ ounded by accidents involving village residents and the Chair of a construction company who refused to travel for an un@@ informed man in hospital .

recent village inhabitants prote@@ sted on building sites against their office .
according to the police , the village residents st@@ oned police officers , and they responded by warning shot .
it is noted by local stations , however , that they started to shoo@@ t up their people ( for the police transported by the army ) whilst killing one person .
&quot; we were much alar@@ med , fe@@ aring re@@ tali@@ ation , &quot; three out of the order of 29 years of Dom@@ ing@@ Tad@@ Ba@@ dia i , who lives near the hospital and saw injured in@@ hes .
&quot; I have disappeared at my building for two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i Parliament has been calling for the prosecu@@ tions of the police officers involved and the return of the mobile Bri@@ gade of the police to the region .
as far as the Government of Indonesia is concerned , evidence has always been a problem .
the lack of meaningful development fe@@ eds the dis@@ satisfaction between the minds of the seas , the m@@ our , the Azores and the G@@ ood@@ land on the gal@@ ambi@@ ent middle hil@@ ly floor in Papua hal@@ j@@ gen .
many of them have joined the Free Trade Organisation ( V@@ PL ) Soli@@ dar@@ meri@@ ted ar@@ mi@@ es army , which it claims will protect the rights of pa@@ pel@@ lets by ar@@ son , ra@@ tionally ar@@ resting attacks and kid@@ napp@@ ings amongst the army of Indonesia soldiers .
some of the leaders of V@@ PL will come from P@@ ani@@ a@@ c , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , on the pretext of the protection of the state &apos;s sovereignty , the military have in recent years arrested in P@@ ania and held thousands of people arbitrarily detained .
some of them will never come out again .
in the meantime , P@@ ani@@ a@@ ths , known as &apos; tragic forgotten seats &apos; , are known as P@@ ani@@ a@@ ths .
poverty fe@@ eds dis@@ content .
the small ri@@ ce sold in most regional bal@@ ls is too expensive for local buying .
it has the same im@@ possibility of seeing that it will .
people are growing all food product shortages at net@@ worked levels , plus some fruit and vegetables .
caring is a female labour , each of whom can care for four or five sources of nur@@ ser@@ y .
they typically keep most of their catches with their families , while the rest are sold on the local market .
10 trillion Austrian spaces ( 75 cents ) are eligible to pay .
over time there has been ac@@ centu@@ ation in economic disparities between indigenous boats and the new migrants who have come full from opening new airlines at N@@ ab@@ ire Air@@ port since .
the few jobs that exist will go go stronger to well @-@ educated and richer migrants .
P@@ ope alone often has no capital or necessary skills to compete .
&apos;@@ Young people are not interested in staying in the cold since there is neither jobs nor money here &apos; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , Chairman of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ bal Council .
separation still touches the world beyond P@@ ope .
moreover , restrictions remain on foreign media .
earlier this year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ flag L@@ ong@@ cha@@ tory were expelled from the Netherlands due to a rare film authorisation &apos; who had not monitored the relevant practice &apos; .
the Vice @-@ President of the Asian department of Human Rights Watch , Pa@@ convincing K@@ ine , stated that the election promises issued in Jo@@ ko@@ w to get rid of constraints on the reports , to promote transparency and development , have not come about .
&quot; in Papua ki@@ an , through its assistance reports from the most trou@@ bled provinces from the East and from Western P@@ ope journalists , al @-@ grip on new threats of denial of entry visas and black@@ listing have been incomplete , &quot; he said in his statement .
the absence of a press @-@ based outlook means that the international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is far limited to Papua closest neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries were driven by the mediation , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ ty , Mar@@ shall Islands and Sol@@ om@@ on Islands to examine the &quot; various types of wide @-@ ranging crimes &quot; in P@@ ope , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
these same countries have also historically supported V@@ PL .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , spokes@@ person for the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Indonesia , wri@@ g the allegations of compli@@ city by J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta for journalists : &apos; in Indonesia democracy and freedom of the press still applies , so that evidence of cases against human rights is impossible to bur@@ y &apos; .
the local people want to see more foreign governments taken note of .
when the Dutch official delegation , chaired by the human rights defen@@ der of the country , Mrs Van B@@ ari , visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ v on 4 May , the local people inter@@ cep@@ ted the meeting but , according to what the source of what wanted to remain anon@@ ymous , leaving us open by na@@ ci@@ fication , deeply appealing to it : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
Indonesia is holding a new presidential election in 2019 , but pa@@ tri@@ cks do not believe that they will vote for Jo@@ ko@@ w again .
Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man of good intentions , but the surrounding people with the bul@@ lying of the P@@ ak@@ at say says Ho@@ ba@@ i , President of the sil@@ ver Council .
he wants to give Jo@@ ko@@ w a taste that , in addition to the constant dangers from the P@@ ani@@ a@@ e people , they are struggling with this misery with mis@@ er@@ able education and health services .
according to Ms Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , like other boats , regard their votes on Jo@@ ko@@ w as their debt to be paid .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want justice , &quot; he says .
despite these o@@ hin@@ ts and intimidation , the families of the Ib@@ erian victims of the shoo@@ t also bought up the last symbolic resistance in machines sc@@ ent up one victim &apos;s body of legitimacy in the police station and ar@@ mi@@ es in the country eligible for the army .
knowing that justice might never be rewarded , I think not least that the responsible do not allow the accused to forget their crimes .

the summer also saw one of the highest homes un@@ fol@@ ded in Du@@ ba@@ i in the world , forcing hundreds of residents to fle@@ e at this 3@@ 37 me@@ tre he@@ ight and 79 ju@@ mp through .
it was the second fire which has been ra@@ va@@ ging high standards over just two years - the case of Peru , T@@ fragile mo@@ ck - that is called Helsinki .
there were no cancel@@ lations , no damage did be notified at all , and no direct causes caused by fire occurred .
we s@@ le@@ ep and la@@ cked about fire and much fear .
here we cras@@ hed down of the train and it took us about 10 minutes to get down the 50@@ th rule saying , &apos; You are a resident who belon@@ ged to George himself .
according to Du@@ ba@@ i &apos;s civil protection officers , other fire fighters deleted even around 4 a.m. locally based on 00@@ .00 G@@ MT and denied civil buildings .
the Government denoun@@ ced that it was working to ensure shelter for the victims .
this incident could once again raise issues of the safety of high @-@ quality , foreign @-@ condi@@ tioned materials throughout the world .
a competition monitoring carried out following the Christmas 2015 fire near Operation church delivered most harm to fast @-@ track panels and isolation outside surface .
these efforts are being made by the British police for believing that the isolation of the London G@@ ren@@ portfolio T@@ ow@@ er and by certain di@@ ac@@ at@@ ty panels could contribute to the proliferation in June of the fire fire we were getting there .
see : these phones will probably receive sales meetings in the autumn .
the range and autumn remains a big business @-@ old period for technological investors because European telep@@ hon@@ es will then be made public in their new models of excellence .
in the spring Sa@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peri@@ a X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um arrived on sale , new h@@ it@@ t phones are expected for the boys not long ago .
today &apos;s flagship yards are characterised by innovative design , game fast action , ser@@ ver @-@ servan@@ i 4@@ K resolution and the ultra fast process method , according to the Director of Tele@@ 22 marketing and sale ( Christian L@@ im@@ my Se@@ ema ) .
Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 comes in the world of technology from which high visibility has also increased over the ita@@ bly pla@@ ted edition of Estonia &apos;s smar@@ t@@ phones k@@ direct .
autumn further allows smart hu@@ bs to go over fast , a resilient accommodation , a better quality camer@@ a and higher water , and dust resistance .
he added that rum@@ ours can already be interpreted and forecasts four model excellence that probably dis@@ continue streets .
these four &quot; top @-@ performing &quot; networks will reach the shop websites this autumn .
the expected i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach the bo@@ y shops by mid @-@ September .
there are many rum@@ ours that we hear about , and there are positive steps in the new Apple model .
in the case of EM@@ P@@ hone 7 , unless significant differences were created with respect to the i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , Apple &apos;s 10th birth@@ day is expected to pay li@@ p service to the previous model .
four pa@@ ints are spoken of : black , white , pin@@ k and cro@@ wn .
a mo@@ ck@@ list covering the full list of telephone places is apparently avoidable , bu@@ tch@@ ers and fingerprints are blo@@ wn in the screen .
the director of Apple design , J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve , is calling for the new model of the i@@ P@@ hone to look like the glass .
there has been talk here of the en@@ chan@@ ical i@@ P@@ hone version .
an accelerated camer@@ a could be expected in addition to an eye @-@ hungry so@@ ber , wireless charging and a higher @-@ quality camer@@ a .
clearly , this has going to be one of the cheap@@ est intelligent phones ever involved .
the use of the U@@ ru@@ t model G@@ ala@@ x@@ y Mid@@ 8 session begins on 23 August .
indeed , there are lots of rum@@ ours on which the new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y start to look like .
jo con@@ no@@ med for an even greater amount of business usage , and S pen allows yet more fun@@ ction@@ alities .
the Social Fund should have two camer@@ a camer@@ as , of which one is s@@ le@@ ep and another was TV @-@ related content with suddenly more striking point .
now nobody knows what two Bud@@ d@@ hist packages are capable of but in any case the Z@@ sun@@ g test is firstly one that , as far as quality is concerned , is definitely comparable to that relating to the i@@ P@@ hone 8 .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August with great tension .
while Nokia has selling three smart phones led by Nokia 6 this year , a sh@@ ut@@ tle is still missing : Nokia 8 , which is already being presented on 16 August .
from the f@@ law side to the screen far from 5.@@ 3 and at mid @-@ fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ nap@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and more endu@@ ring bat@@ teries , we are waiting for an exceptional period from now on .
Nokia is the subject of the alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ pus and the significant levels of water and customs resistance IP@@ 68 .
like the Sam@@ su@@ ng@@ ga Chinese new model Nokia has twice dis@@ continued camer@@ a which is produced by an opti@@ mist company Z@@ van@@ y .
if S@@ ony solid flagship has previously been O@@ ver X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , the manufacturer has assured that in the near future at least two smart phones with even more innovative functions will follow .
we now await a smart phone , albeit a little more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but of what is more or better camer@@ a .
on the model from S@@ ony , speculation has been level@@ led that the screen is on the screen at least now .
what real progress we are getting here is right very soon , because traditionally S@@ ony has unve@@ iled its autumn flag ship at the International Technology F@@ oo@@ ver IF@@ A , which will be known tomorrow 1 to 6 September .
T@@ ru@@ mp Mexico killed in payment of spiri@@ ts for a border wall , according to the trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts le@@ ak@@ ed to television calls
the Washington post revealed telephone calls by US President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i as well as between Mexic@@ an and Australia administrations .
on 27 January , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ o , speaking to the Mexic@@ an President , asked the President to stop pro@@ claiming that he did not intend to pay for the proposed bor@@ der@@ wall .
he was fed in the USA on public condemnation of that wall who was saying , &apos; You don &apos;t have to say so to the press &apos; .
the speaker placed his rolling campaign on the promise of building a long deal with the Southern United States border walls and van@@ ity that makes Mexico pay for that project .
trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts were also published from his first speech with the Prime Minister of Australia , Malcolm Turmes , which reveal an intensive collaboration .
the wind of huge speeches to Mo@@ summer said that a deal whereby United States bing on its way into Australia would give a &apos; lu@@ dic@@ rous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ ve &apos; and &apos; stu@@ pid &apos; attitude : it claimed that an agreement made under the Obama Government would give us the impression of &apos; guiding &apos; after it has proposed a ban on depor@@ ting refugees to the US .
the SME has closed his speech saying to Mr Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l that &apos; this was one of the most un@@ pleasant speeches of the day &apos; .
the city of Li@@ uni@@ references cou@@ ps ( city of O@@ unions MR@@ P ) did not talk about the matter where the town of Tar@@ tu rejected its offer of bus services from July 2019 to 20@@ 29 .
this is a ten@@ et rejecting the Li@@ consumed town manufacture given that supply was not up against the profession of the Tar@@ tu town Law Service , An@@ four A@@ pu@@ tin , Chairman of Tar@@ tu municipal Law Service .
this was a public service contribution for distance within Tar@@ tu , for a period of 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 - 3@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
the city of B@@ ini compla@@ ined to the Civil Court about the judgment of the province of Tar@@ tu .
the national authorities did not follow that .
although many will complain in social media that a l@@ ot@@ tery clo@@ ses off the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val is disturbing their night and that the entire city is tic@@ king off , there are many others who do not have a fair word of saying on a ri@@ val running .
I am even positively surprised that , on the shop , the logging enjoyed this poli@@ te !
I witnessed no dis@@ trust or non @-@ poli@@ teness .
even 1st out I saw , &apos; it has a pretty bad wave .
&quot; what is good is that to come up , stay happy to sw@@ allow in a country like winter being delayed &apos; , he will che@@ at a jo@@ ke .
there is no bl@@ ur@@ red wave flooding in the no@@ se .

K@@ abu@@ l bomb attack : a NATO soldi@@ er w@@ ound killed in suicide bom@@ bing
the suicide bom@@ ber mentioned , according to officials , military vo@@ ounds in K@@ abu@@ l , the capital of Afghanistan , killing several NATO soldiers and injured others .
in the NATO statement , five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
three civilians also died in the distur@@ ban@@ ces in the town Guard despite local reports .
this bom@@ bing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month , with more than 30 deaths due to the hunger mos@@ que attack on Tuesday .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ b@@ ers killed two people near the Iraqi E@@ mb@@ assy in K@@ abu@@ l .
NATO also said that yesterday evening there was explosion involved when the cooperative pat@@ rolling mon@@ gering with the Afghan army was attacked by &apos; man @-@ made explo@@ sive continue &apos; .
the statement stated that everything is being w@@ ounded in a stable state and will be treated in the US military hospital in Bag@@ ra@@ m Air@@ port .
according to our correspon@@ dent speakers , the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic Country ( in Asia ) are a sting in the worrying face of NATO forces in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ y in Bag@@ ra@@ y .
according to UN data , in the first half of 2017 , most 16@@ 62 civilians have died , of which around 20 % amount in the capital .
at the end of July , at K@@ abu@@ l , at least 30 people were killed by a car bomb mainly down the lines of Shi@@ ite March .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attacks .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed in a major bomb attack in the centre of the town , which is the most deadly result of the military attack in a country since the US @-@ led forces ran sta@@ ged the Taliban &apos;s co@@ ven@@ suit in 2001 .
this violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan while US President Donald T@@ ru@@ unit is considering improving the number of US troops in favour of the country .
according to reports from the floor of the experts , in recent weeks in K@@ abu@@ l , the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings have also caused a crisis of public confidence against the government , its policies and in particular directed against President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
the EPA lifted the decision to postpone the repeal of the summer regulation
the US Environmental Protection Protection Agency ( UK Environment Protection Protection Agency ) repealed the decision to delay the establishment of a Obama @-@ day regulation that obliges states to reduce their emissions of fuel , one day after 15 countries called the Agency to court because of its March .
in the EPA , announced its decision to move on to &apos; nomination proceedings for biodiversity content 2015 &apos; late on Wednesday , saying that it reflects the Agency &apos;s commitment to collabor@@ ating with the State @-@ owned countries .
&quot; we believe that we must have dialogue and listen to our partners in states , &quot; said Hel@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t servants in the statement on the partnership law .
a cautious note to be made in June by the EPA was right to announce that pre @-@ emission levels for ozone content be def@@ er@@ red across the country , which measured emissions but then highlights where their level to meet the highest air quality standard should be reduced by one year to the 163 stocks in 2018 .
shoulder to K@@ olum@@ bia , a German predominantly democratic state , addressed an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision was unlawful .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has tried to pull back several of the environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama that are in line with his stated role in a broader plan for enhancing economic growth .
but these efforts have provoked reactions among the democrats and other conservation groups , who are concerned about the influence of the increased polluting content on human health .

Ver@@ y Gar@@ cia Is@@ su@@ es L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meets for the first time and considers possible opposition
V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ ain@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should serve on a clas@@ h course in order to face in the most attractive bo@@ xing boys until 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg of the short future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in Budapest in L@@ reamed Chinese separate rooms , until Gar@@ cia , the va@@ g@@ men@@ em@@ t unrestricted World Bo@@ pers , watching the corridor &apos;s second in order to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , the World Boeing Dimension S@@ ili@@ z@@ anne@@ i consulting the Middle ages .
after the unanimous decision of Gar@@ cia , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ eri , a former four @-@ day world leader , has succeeded on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ Lefrançois , both comb@@ at@@ ants are on the front days of the ranking .
she stret@@ ches her hand to her improving role , and said , &quot; Ho@@ w does the summer go , why does she ?
I wish you well . &apos;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko protects her bel@@ l Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ ja from 19 ES@@ P@@ N on Saturday evening .
while a couple of pho@@ tos appeared , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko &apos;s memory Deputy EMU , E@@ autumn Climate , indicated that a possible confrontation between comb@@ at@@ ants would be &apos; perfect measurement &apos; .
&apos;@@ I am a former sul@@ ecu@@ men@@ ical &apos; , since my memor@@ ies were S@@ chil@@ ler General .
&apos;@@ I have up@@ front in favour of B@@ ron@@ ger &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so large .
I am aston@@ ished at 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move below ligh@@ tability .
and it has to move for half the light . &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and we can then fight .
sin@@ ks have indeed right to do this .
let us invite them to do so . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&apos;@@ The world of things needs that fight &apos; .
the question that I asked was whether this review should be worthwhile , a part of his strategy that he wanted to let L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l see a 6@@ 1.2 kg class out of the debate later this year possible next summer , when he was going to meet with the Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ remo@@ ts ) , who also had an interest in combating Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ l &apos;s match after their light @-@ winning in For@@ u@@ r on 23 September .
&apos;@@ Sup@@ jud@@ ging this battle can be paid because f@@ ans are calling for this objec@@ tivity , &quot; stated Gar@@ cia , eventually , that he is open to fighting in any of his channels offering the best financial package .
&quot; we are the major actors .
none other name can receive so much attention .
whenever they stand ... &apos;
Gar@@ cia says that she considered L@@ om@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t to be a &apos; willing figh@@ ter &apos; and can go from des@@ k to lunch .
but L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko sh@@ ine at praise the Gar@@ cia , saying that he saw the champion of the three di@@ vis@@ u@@ us ong from Ri@@ ver@@ pool looks &apos; very slow ; sorry , Mr Me@@ qu@@ e@@ ue ... you want it no@@ ft &apos; .
according to Gar@@ cia , this is it aimed to show strength of disease and then to wrong about it .
both confirmed that they felt the tension increasing in order to meet them .
&quot; that is a battle that remains to be realised .
no other confrontation would lead to such an am@@ ple attention and ran@@ go@@ ism .
I am more than prepared to work on this &apos; in quote Gar@@ cia &apos; .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best aggressive and M@@ ain@@ y has precisely that .
it &apos;s going to be a good fight . &quot;
which world players will continue to move to Estonia ?
from last year , the police and border services ( PP@@ A ) gave a record worldwide succession of 13 000 residence permits to third @-@ country nationals who are mostly travelling to Estonia for ( work , study or family ) .
when , for example , soil authorisation was given up to 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreign languages for an indefin@@ ite period , that figure was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the authorities cannot say how many migrants ultimately remain in Estonia for the time being , but this analysis is being drawn up in the Ministry of Internal Affairs .
when in Estonia almost 500 Ukrainians a year ten years ago , this figure is running close to 2000 in recent years .
the number of applicants for housing permit increased a so@@ aring role during the Ukrainian crisis : 1 0@@ 87 people had access to temporary leave permits in 2014 , compared to 6@@ 75 / year previously .
according to the statistical office , the electricity growth rate is -@@ a surge in Ukrainian citizens was spread amongst the largest population in Estonia , with communism arriving in Estonia last night .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been pivotal in Estonia all the time and , due to the difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that the possibility of seeking work and learning is sought from the country in which the public , and many others before the family now &apos; , had declared the spokes@@ person of the Ministry of the Interior , Mrs Ram@@ mus K@@ olu@@ tionary .
given the highest number of Ukrainians that benefited from terms of time , soil and tourism had even been authorised , even though 10 years ago the total number of permanent residence permits had been given .
aged over there in posts here because of Russian migration , the Ukrainians end up over .
&apos;@@ The@@ ath its historical Russian community , to which extent they are also most likely to have family ties with Russian people &apos; , the migrant theat@@ re of the Internal guardian army , Hel@@ ina Me@@ use , said .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you look at what Russian citizens entitled to residence , you &apos;@@ re immediately in the country of O@@ ri@@ par@@ a @-@ Vir@@ u@@ restri@@ e and you have already written in and made it clear that about 40 % of them were hel@@ ple@@ ss with citizens of the European Union .
soil had a life permit of 1 6@@ 96 Russian nationals in time , which is also a record number .
yet we may pursue a reduction in the number of Russians wishing to extend their residence permits .
&quot; benefits are due to the fact that instead of the extension of residence permits requests have been consistently located in Estonia , &quot; commented on the position of the Ministry of the Interior press , Ram@@ mus shoulders , who said that months of interest towards a residence permit for Russian citizens has remained rather stable .
the new residence permit for Estonia will be able to apply for a foreign stay of at least three years now .
it is intended to promote more rec@@ eding of the displaced .
long @-@ term resident residence permits , for example , require five years .
this new residence permit obviously has resulted in an extension of the old residence permit .
for example , last spring , in this way , the financial product enabled 146 Ukrainians to reside here , who have been working here for at least three years .
now the Ukrainians can change their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer take the lead in achieving the fulfilment of the pay criterion .
this residence permit became popular : ine@@ ligible passport holders of the last mad cow &apos;s pass ( 10@@ 29 ) , Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , individuals ( 54 ) , and de @-@ South people ( 36 ) .
in total , 19@@ 68 people were authorised to reside for origin in Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and equally many Chinese .
the first half of this year has already reached 12@@ 69 total numbers of new applicants .
in ten years a country with one of the most active applicants for residence in Estonia has become a stran@@ gely Nigeria .
after three housing permits were issued in 2007 for sch@@ ol@@ ars , 200 goods came into being .
it is Nigeria who is coming out into universities .
in addition , the Estonian higher education institutions are popular with the Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks for example .
the number of people living in India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has mainly increased thanks to student migration .
in this case too , the rule is that where the community is there there , there is more simply a second ; it also levies on others . &apos;
during 10 years , two people immigration into Estonia , for example , North Korea and as much from La@@ os and Madagascar , to name a few .
ten people come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 from South Korea , 40 from Indonesia and four from U@@ ru@@ guay .
while there are net EU @-@ wide citizens to travel home about 6,@@ 000 year to death , this amounts to about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if more European Union citizens think , migration is around 1 % &apos; , the Me@@ use was comments that the figures actually are small .
altogether , according to the statistics office , Greece transported 14 8@@ 22 people in depth , with 13 7@@ 92 gu@@ est est here .
this means that immigration has increased emigration for another year .
most relocation and in@@ duc@@ tion are Estonian citizens but more are leaving .
that is why Estonia &apos;s citizens were in res@@ ti@@ lian evolution of mine , with someone who had lost a population of 2 000 .
Est@@ oni@@ ans , in particular , are travelling between Finland and Estonia .
Ru@@ ture denoun@@ cements of illegally C@@ ou@@ ture went on aw@@ k@@ ic@@ k@@ ward with hundreds , can@@ tons and sc@@ ool .
in the northern gu@@ ise , however , Maria Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u has an historic history - old feet and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream of anywhere in mus@@ h@@ rooms and ad@@ m@@ ire old tre@@ asures and cra@@ cks .
if you take the lead with a stone , you will investigate and learn about it on a daily basis .
this is a pleasure .
worldwide of C@@ ou@@ ture gla@@ regener@@ ate might seem to be some living ali@@ en@@ ated , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much you feel is .
as a friend , I have got a whole se@@ ct full of these stic@@ ks designed by myself .

a mobile ar@@ tist does not acknowledge the gap between sh@@ ining events and a grey Christmas Day .
it is precisely that reasoning which determined the plan to move the higher level in Estonia away into the countryside and between forests and generations , to people that often cannot achieve .
our colle@@ ctions were presented nearly in comparison , J@@ evening and Ol@@ vers in the j@@ arg@@ on , where apparently 45 mo@@ del@@ les the Ro@@ yal de@@ fi@@ les were driven down a full street .
in Tallinn , they often shop away bo@@ w with dignity , but there are more emo@@ tions ; cri@@ es b@@ ra@@ vo rise up , they want to thank you .
a large proportion of the public had to be given the news , and now they were D@@ ou@@ ture f@@ ans .
if you go beyond people &apos;s expectations , they are warm !
and I like the feeling that I am a mo@@ ped by my own mo@@ tive like the summer .

this is that la@@ x experience ; you are certainly locked in an app .
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen my own production , always behind the scene in order to signal things as a hope@@ less ha@@ m .
my ner@@ vo@@ us@@ ness would not allow calm to be shown on the floor .
she is this kind of mo@@ dus oper@@ andi that fit not only to perform its representative role but to be involved in everything .
I have got my blood machine in conscience , and most college is carrying out this myself .

the subject matter is not limited , nor is it vol@@ ta@@ cra@@ t , logistics , organisation , organisation ... - they must all come to the day of one of the sta@@ gi@@ gical women .
finally , the fana@@ tics still come enormously out of this work .
I cannot say when my day arri@@ ves ; for me , this is simply full of joy .
I have been very fortuna@@ te ; it is like an never @-@ ending trau@@ ma : for me , someone gets something beautiful , and you get all my compli@@ ments .
on several occasions , a bro@@ ker like me has been told that it is a pas@@ si@@ person - they make you feel infected by printing .
the wonderful high standards of this diligence his capacity made available overnight are so far fa@@ you can see the entrusted gi@@ urgently by Mrs C@@ ou@@ ture .
Mr M@@ y@@ r@@ lin@@ er among U@@ 18 boys : the evol@@ ent ar@@ mi@@ es in the al@@ organisation of the wards missile S@@ ili@@ um were now turned against us
the ra@@ inf@@ all lost its , the w@@ ings .
as the first thing seen , we did not get our feet .
added to the table : with so much effort a gap on the table , Estonia commented , &apos; while it commented on 6@@ 61 in U@@ 18 Kor@@ talks : 75 abstained in Britain from our only Cor@@ v@@ pal@@ le@@ r , BC Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ r@@ h@@ p .
from tide to wave , opponents were attacking 28 k@@ cars and consequently more attacks .
we were also unable to defend them on an aggressive basis or attack ; it created it .
in three to five seconds , many of the English attacks resulted , we were unable to build up protection .
however , in defence they managed to hold their hands on in different parts , we could not combine them .
that task laid the ground for this team .
the internal work of the opponents is better done .
Mr M@@ yl@@ r@@ se@@ pa estimates that more tac@@ tical mistakes could have been made by Estonia to slow down the momentum of opponents in the b@@ ud .
furthermore , in most only one quarter : we had a plu@@ ral error , but the opponents had already received several quick instances .
Con@@ cer@@ na@@ iv@@ ety and the intense offensive which was our weapon at h@@ aste have now turned all on against us .
today we did not have the strength against their bru@@ tality .
Me@@ ro@@ focusing remained calm in fishing , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s .
overall , tourism generally gives a good word of good name to the whole team , and to date it has been a united blow in the cold which we are experiencing .
it is a pity that this aggressive response was not met in the past .
ice has always been self @-@ confident and played out to date , but it seemed them ti@@ red of having put down quite a burden .
but he moved a couple of wonderful things , which I had seen in them in other tr@@ en@@ ches &apos;
appalling numbers : ne@@ days de cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ sely s@@ nu@@ t@@ tened E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ l , in 3 waves with fewer than 10 paragraphs ...
the U@@ 18 age classes are not just a tu@@ ary H@@ .@@ B , di@@ vis@@ j@@ on Kor@@ sel@@ li@@ tur@@ ni@@ ir in Tallinn ; she started last yesterday in Dublin .
and the Polish lea@@ k in Estonia did not go far enough of a record @-@ box .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after 10 out of the third quarter , it was 9 : 49 or only at the last 10 minutes that it has taken the o@@ il@@ bro@@ r off the accele@@ ra@@ tor , and a single period was maintained after 16 : 16 .
both on first and second , and on an overall quarter Estonia thre@@ 1 , third .
in so doing , they took two pieces , just in two minutes , from the first four Fundamental cra@@ ts , but 25 pieces a match , then one in three , and then another 21 te@@ ars over ...
perhaps over half an hour there was a list of seven fine gu@@ ides .
moreover , 2 points have come from four la@@ yers of fre@@ es .
a reasonable number of losses at that time , 12 others .
at the end of the game , the compliance rate with Poland was 33 % and Estonia 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started two damages , turning to 83 cases on the day of the founding esti@@ mation of Portugal : 56 of its good .
NATO vessels have ready for priorities in Tallinn .
today , the first permanent &apos; wave group &apos; that arrived in T@@ ric@@ i , NATO , was reached on a scheduled port visit to Tallinn for week @-@ long exchange to complement vessel stocks and prepare for pre@@ judicial practices .
during the visit ships will prepare for entering the sea and with this the opportunity for crew members to leave break .
pursuant to the visit , NATO boats remain in Estonia &apos;s waters to have a variety of exercises and ready for future historical bom@@ b@@ ings .
&apos;@@ In@@ ner participation in the NATO entity and the operational study being carried out by them in local waters res@@ on@@ ate well with our integration with alli@@ ed forces &apos; , the com@@ man@@ der of the Operation and Planning unit , in the tasks of the naval flo@@ til@@ la offset , was said by Ar@@ ten@@ arti@@ to Rein@@ land .
from 29 June , NATO will launch its group as its 6@@ 1st permanent anti @-@ party , cap@@ tr@@ end@@ ant G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , Latvia &apos;s Na@@ vy partner , who took over from Estonia &apos;s naval officers from the gan@@ arch@@ che@@ que , Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia .

what could a public ou@@ tle@@ t be present at this right up for the festi@@ val , what is it that you are proposing of particular kind ?
we have had the artists in England , Latvia , Lithuania and , by the way , the first bal@@ le@@ tt written to the Me@@ ath of L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i .
that includes Car@@ l@@ sson l@@ .@@ b .

very carefully , how are you going to nur@@ se all this ?

such work requirements a foundation system and a great deal of love , and that is fortunately with trouble .

this high level of awareness in tone , keeping on positive and , indeed , s@@ mile ourselves in the mir@@ ror of this morning , has significantly increased my hus@@ band of happ@@ iness .

it is still , broken down in the face of more comfort .
this is a small moment for ourselves .

new analysis testing results of age tests for asylum applicants in Sweden have been published
Sweden introduced a cross @-@ border test because of their novel approach , which revealed that more than 80 % of the voters were assessed as old as 18 , but not all believes in the details .
the Swedish national judicial health service ( rolling accident ) started the tests at the beginning of the year .
the tests were set up for more accurate age @-@ testing during asylum claims following criticism against the Swedish migrant reception Agency ( Mig@@ weap@@ s@@ ver@@ provo@@ ke ) for failing to correctly determine the age of the alleged many under@@ age refugees .
for the period from mid to 31 July 2017 , immigration manages to dis@@ pat@@ ch 68@@ 80 cases , and the Institute of Justice presents 24 4@@ 81 tests that were presented .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) was evaluated as 18 @-@ year old or older , and 25 more cases were reported by the Institute of medical Training that the testing &apos; might be eigh@@ teen @-@ year @-@ olds or older &apos; .
in 4@@ 32 cases , they also concluded that the person is &quot; probably younger than 18 . &quot;
tests exist only when age affects a person .
Ar@@ ch@@ ives , working for access to justice , said Joh@@ an Gö@@ integ@@ son who works for the institutions , had the result been consistent on previous months .
&quot; we are not seeing very much difference between the statistics of the last months , numbers are quite consistent , &quot; said The Local newspaper .
ensuring a good part of cases were estimated as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum applicants have ea@@ ten their age .
the Institute issued the results of its 581 test in May and said that , in 4@@ 42 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person studied is 18 year old or older &apos; .
however , after the newspaper bis@@ expect Dag@@ bla@@ testi@@ mony investigated the results of their 581 test , it turned out that in 2@@ 43 cases , nearly 18 of them were voting directly on 18 cases .
this medical age assessment method which deals with di@@ ri@@ el@@ ty co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il X @-@ gen@@ i@@ les from fields MR@@ I and leaves them to be subject to research in den@@ tists and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts has been criticised in some quarters .
one of the sceptics is po@@ inter@@ s web economics of the Cor@@ k@@ rin@@ tic Institute for K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska , ran@@ k@@ rin@@ tic Product Safety , whose function includes the assessing of humans &apos;s biological maturity in order to establish whether they went through their public va@@ cation until or later than usual .
I have had reason to think about that and do not feel that the measurement we have used today should be used .
the importance of determining biological age in this way is extremely precarious .
if we cannot say for sure , we should not pretend that we will receive a &apos; he said to his history , Met@@ ro .
however , the Institute of Cas@@ tle John Gö@@ avier adequ@@ son ensured the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general terms , it is low to state that his child is exposed to wan@@ t@@ fully vac@@ ant separation .
perhaps the biggest figure of 10 % is now perhaps just under 18 . &quot;

Western Vir@@ g@@ ina govern@@ ber@@ ner expressed Political exchange

&apos;@@ W@@ h@@ y it or not , the democrats bo@@ wed away from me , &apos; said the Governor &apos;s Justice .
&apos;@@ Today I tell you , having prof@@ ite@@ rated a great deal and have d@@ le@@ an@@ ed ... today I will tell you , the Hungarian Lady , that I can no longer help you as a democratic Governor &apos; .
Community @-@ min@@ ding tri@@ bes which were being rig@@ ged were to joy .
&apos;@@ It will therefore be a Re@@ publi@@ can tomorrow , &apos; Justice added .
&apos;@@ As a engine@@ er , I would say to you that it is time to play a different game &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ mp had never allowed a large theat@@ re of joy at the gathering of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
the team won in Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a with 42 explanations , and Justice did not support Mr Clin@@ ton , who has been candidate by democrats .
the courts , who , according to For@@ tte@@ red ideas , are the only gan billion spot in the state , were elected in 2016 .
For@@ da@@ b@@ intense notes that it has coal mines in five states and has a coal business quite self @-@ imposed .

at the same time , the Heads of National Council ( R@@ N@@ C ) of Re@@ publi@@ can countries published on a Thursday evening notice that when Governor Justice &apos;s party change is another blow to a democratic party which will prevent the State from improving , rather than working for , back on its development .
&apos;@@ Sky 15 spa@@ Europe@@ s and checks on the least rule in history , &apos; The announcement by Governor Justice is simply the most recent expression loud and artis@@ an , as a party that is from the very end out power@@ less and it failed to obtain a positive and inclusive message saying one &apos; said R@@ N@@ C Cha@@ ir@@ woman R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ Jobs in the C@@ B@@ S New@@ si Statement .

Co@@ e gave honest apolo@@ gy to the Russians about this D@@ oping H@@ all .
he said that , &apos; Russia four days of F@@ air Free ex@@ i@@ ah@@ ry &apos; , the L@@ and@@ y alists &apos; , praised D@@ oping and reiterated that now is not the time to allow sports to return .
the taxpayers &apos; side ch@@ rene@@ l D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ Intergovernmental h@@ tin ( Soviet experts ) reminded us in front of the World C@@ up , during the IA@@ AF Congress , that the ban on competition against his country was right and that it had a firm aim to combat doping .
she par@@ did apologise to &apos; all the 30 lifted inhabitants of the gold and sil@@ ver med@@ als &apos; below during the competitions .
despite his remarks , it has voted to retain the Turkish Congress &apos;s ban in June 2015 , which was initiated under the W@@ AD@@ A report , covering Italy &apos;s supported D@@ oping Strategy .
I believe this to be a very honest answer today , very honest presentation ; &quot; said the President of the IAEA for journalists .
&quot; the Council and the whole Congress were pleased that Russia &apos;s al@@ tar &quot; recognised they had some rather complex times and considered them as doing their utmost to transform the treaty . &quot;
furthermore , the Co@@ e told us that Russia accepted the criteria for rein@@ recovery .
&quot; I think that today was a very constructive day and some progress is being made , but Congress supports the proposal of the working group that this is not the time to take Russia back , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we need to move to a normal norm@@ alisation of the situation in the next few months .
we are always guided by the principle that we want to separate free spor@@ ts@@ people from a dis@@ connected system , &quot; he added .
N@@ in@@ th Russian fri@@ vol@@ Conciliation Agency - who meet strict criteria for IA@@ AF - is competing as neutral spor@@ ts@@ people on Friday in the light of the World B@@ ren@@ ac@@ pool competition in London .
he , the head of the IA@@ AF Working Group , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of criteria to pre @-@ emp@@ t .
in London , following a report to the IAEA board , he told journalists that doping control is still insufficient and that iner@@ ators who have been protected still act freely .
the electricity Revolution would substantially change the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
not only is the revolution in electric cars making a significant difference from the E @-@ fuel market to infrastructure , also creating new winners and losers in the metal@@ lic market .
while mining gi@@ ants such as G@@ len@@ core can say that they are winning one place and losing out on the other , smaller extraction companies do not benefit from this .
today G@@ len@@ Sky coal and oil earn , but it will lead to new demand for co@@ balt , Board , cop@@ per and alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ ot@@ ine ones in the age of power vehicles .
this year , the contributions on the spread of electric cars have been increased by the decisions of UK , France and Norway governments , which will allow for the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades .
therefore , Vol@@ vo has already known that he plans to abandon his combustion engine and T@@ es@@ la will place at a price of 3 electric cars .
according to Mr New Energy Finance forecasts , over two decades more power cars will be sold than cars using oil @-@ made fuels .
&apos;@@ For some metals all that al@@ ters &apos; , the Capital sensitivity economics raw materials analy@@ sts Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ in B@@ oli@@ ber@@ j said .
we have already seen large impacts on metals such as co@@ balt or li@@ thi@@ um , whose demand has been increasing over the years .
electric cars are about three times as many as a simple car and have stated G@@ len@@ core .
a further answer is needed through re@@ charging stations , which means that Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris is estimated to increase its cop@@ per demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
increased demand for electric aircraft means further demand for li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and tun@@ an .
G@@ len@@ core will benefit from increasing trends in electricity cars from an increase in cop@@ per prices and from the fact that there is the largest co @-@ bal@@ lers in the world , the assumed J@@ eff@@ inning Group .
this bro@@ ker company estimates that the other winning electric car course would be won by F@@ res@@ tally @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ Hamas Con@@ sor@@ tium .
the market is responding to a trend change already .
this year , 70 percent of installed me@@ tal on the London stock exchange base .
rising soil prices represented 37 % .
it has also grown to 14 % this year , particularly as a result of economic growth .
G@@ len@@ core Air@@ port was based in London at about 20 % , after exceeding the price increases on the ri@@ val Rio T@@ in Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ on and Ang@@ lo DA .
on the side , producers show lead companies like Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine who need to adjust to the new era .
the main end @-@ U@@ V of the sun is equipped with bat@@ teries with petrol and diesel diesel hea@@ ters .
electric cars use flow@@ ering blocks .
&apos;@@ This is a serious risk excluding the lead demand &quot; if other purpose ends are found to go beyond the decline in demand , &quot; the Netherlands said Michael W@@ id@@ mer , the chairman of Mr Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ ch &apos;s me@@ tal market in America .
there is still an absence of any significant development when housing prices are spread .
the p@@ ound has been load 17 % this year , with the highest amount of methane seen in London among the major industrial metals .
investors will see problems on metals far from the foreseeable future .
&quot; I am not sure that leads will be so bad because cheap oil will hold ordinary cars in competition , &quot; at the time Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the Ro@@ yal E@@ cho@@ ker of Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ s , said .
when leading demand is falling , this takes place slowly .
perhaps that will be the case in around 10 years &apos; time .
to date , however , stricter emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars , most based on advanced lead @-@ based bat@@ teries from driver @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ator manufacturing , meets with an international cul@@ mination and placement office .
L@@ urgency metals like alu@@ mini@@ um replacement steel , as a light @-@ duty car can operate further down a distance with less electricity .
it explains the already @-@ 2013 @-@ 2016 unlimited minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes .
it accounts for 2.7 % of the world &apos;s GDP for alu@@ mini@@ um .
that trend is likely to remain stronger ; according to W@@ id@@ mer .
the A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um caps have been fishing for 13 percent this year , due to the growing demand from cars having led to a short market deficit .
steel producers are not up .
ak S@@ rada holding is working together with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce wonderful par@@ cel@@ s of vehicles .
the Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and V@@ ega Europe will also try to develop an easier mel@@ ting th@@ read to withstand the very minimum .
&apos; merit and strength should be the answer to this development &apos; , says the Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris analytical activity Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
we in Europe can see some progress .
the end of the oil era can also result in star@@ vation being swe@@ pt on eyes .
soil is so much as likely to act as catalyst on about half of that precious diesel engine for cars , with Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ already announced to us as me@@ tal re@@ fin@@ er .
&quot; many raw materials now high @-@ demand , such as oil and pos@@ ter , will perhaps not be exposed to severe demand in the future &quot; said Mrs Na@@ ti@@ x@@ is raw material analy@@ sts Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , whereas their importance becomes of such importance within 15 years .
Pla@@ to @-@ sized producers believe in the continuous demand for diesel @-@ free di growers .
Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , the leader of Un@@ core , said that more hybrid cars are being sold 100 % more in 2025 .
the great hope of planned producers in 10 years is done on new vehicles based on hydrogen @-@ based cars developed by To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ reaffir@@ i Mo@@ socio onwards that are dependent on pla@@ tin@@ um , to produce the electricity produced from hydrogen .
so far , however , this technology has not been commercially justified .
&quot; Di@@ ult seems to have a clear free cut along the way to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P from Paris to Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers suffered severe repercussions in July , as the Tribunal for S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art bans diesel in the town of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how the financial rules on football affect the switch to Paris
the rules which are designed to prevent any un@@ bri@@ dled expenditure by European football clubs do not constitute an obstacle to the global migration of Ney@@ ra from the 2@@ accepted Spanish football club , Barcelona , Inves@@ ti@@ ms Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences from UEFA , from the steering Board , which holds the ultimate pre@@ tence in Europe and which will enable teams to ban the prestige that policing League of Me@@ oni@@ ans de@@ part in they will travel , will wait until Rio for Saint @-@ Ger@@ all .
the Financial Rules for fair play ( F@@ F@@ P ) , introduced by UEFA in 2011 , mean that the PS@@ G is indeed obliged to demonstrate any evidence at all that the tak@@ e@@ over of Ney@@ ra was financed without any enormous damage .
Barcelona received € 2@@ 22 million ( $ 2@@ 62 million ) alone to buy a Taiwan@@ ese from his contract and promo@@ ter pays it to tens of millions of dollars a year .
there are some aspects of the glob@@ ali@@ zation of Ney@@ ra &apos;s discussion into the French club .
PS@@ G is without doubt in a position to ar@@ range im@@ ne@@ ys for hi@@ jac@@ king Ney@@ ra and invites its sta@@ rs to put such money forward , with the staff being funded by the governing family in the yards of Opel .
clubs have been allowed to spend heavily on recru@@ iting players , but they have to balance this with legal sources of income that allow them come up with in players &apos; clubs .
F@@ F@@ F@@ P was initiated by Michel Pla@@ tini after following his appointment as President of the UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs which are succe@@ eding in trying to have a massive debt are in fact lobbying and ris@@ king de@@ purchase where the banks or owners are obliged to give up subsidy .
from 2011 , F@@ P sincerely centres up the way to monitoring losses off club debt .
this amendment means that the business model John Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch employed first in 2003 at C@@ hel@@ sea - buying a community with potential , but then having to spend huge expenditure in order to improve the team , to get the &apos; global mark &apos; set - is difficult to introduce .
over the current three @-@ year evaluation period that ran until 2018 , F@@ F@@ F@@ P clubs may suffer damage of up to € 30@@ m .
and although Pla@@ tini was being shame@@ fully anxious pool of presidential office in 2015 , his successor was still committed to preventing over @-@ spending .
&quot; F@@ F@@ P is certainly not in death and we will continue to reinforce these rules beyond any doubt , &quot; said last week Information note to The vian paper , Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who hold the head of UEFA @-@ F@@ P .
although it was had contra@@ cted within Saint Ney@@ mar as a single integrated payment , they would have the chance to distribute this amount for the accounts for the whole duration of the agreement .
decade has signed a five @-@ year agreement , which gives reciprocal fees available under the timeframe of : € 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
in 2014 , key bank group infrastructures including 93@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga , the lly sophisticated competitors of Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , received the highest penalties for the first wave of F@@ F@@ F@@ P sanctions .
the PS@@ G was sentenced to a fine of EUR 60 billion , a fine of USD 82 million at the same time , which was then reduced to EUR 20 million , and it was ordered that the deployment of the League of Me@@ simplify Ministers team be restricted for the period 2014 @-@ 2015 by 21 players instead of regular 25 .
UEFA is seeking clubs that can force regulatory regulators over by pic@@ king up their income through businesses linked with their owners
the K@@ ey@@ holding company may spon@@ sor the PS@@ G but , if the value of spon@@ sorship is deemed to be above standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be considered officially income .
in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar tourism Authority was ler to EEA , S@@ wine support was of the value of the PS@@ G .
it has been said that parts of the Label &apos;s global multi @-@ agency management team , in 20@@ 22 , could come from Ca@@ infrastructure via payments from contributions made by the sustain@@ G .
however , their absolute Amendments N@@ os 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ mark could become a world cor@@ ps Ambassador , claiming that UEFA &apos;s regulators could easily reveal such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on the PS@@ G mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in any bid to enforce non @-@ rule rules .
the people who know the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not regarded the switch to PS@@ G Ney@@ mar@@ i before all .
they spoke to The Helsinki Congress , provided that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PS@@ G .
most recent reports show that in in the PS@@ G period 2015 @-@ 2016 , more than 10 million euros in profits are in excess of a turnover of around EUR 54@@ 2.4 million .
the data for the last financial year have not yet been published .
the PS@@ G expects that the arrival of Ney@@ ra will have a positive impact on spon@@ sorship transactions , trade and distribution .
the club is waiting to increase at least 30 per cent in turnover for the conclusion of the agreement .
Spain too , who is clearly upset at leaving one of the major football sta@@ rs , tried to prevent Tripoli from migration , claiming that PS@@ G is in breach of F@@ P .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with the club and country , &apos; La li President Javier T@@ eb@@ as said to Spanish time 0.7 , out of point to gaining access to a PS@@ G belonging primarily to Ka@@ tar .
Ar@@ thro@@ al mä@@ archa@@ te Ar@@ eti@@ W@@ en@@ ger , who is an American sporting r@@ ally , shares the view that the state financing is a club .
this is the result of ownership rights and it has changed entirely the whole football landscape in the last 15 years , saying W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to the state , we can every possible entry .
it is fundamentally difficult to respect financial rules of fair play because it can have other ways or other interests for this large player to represent the country . &quot;

Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to notify that interest rates remain at these levels , since weak economic growth and easing inflation have cus@@ hi@@ oned speculation about this up@@ ward spiral .
the Bank of England has warned that growth is still a sound thing because the weak incomes of households have put interest rates on its kne@@ es .
meant that the report votes by the Policy makers on the Bank &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee ( MP@@ C ) : &apos; sustaining the 2 rate , but fewer members expect an increase this month due to a weakening of support &apos; slow economic growth &apos; .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank ba@@ iled out a growth forecast for 2017 from 1.7 % and 2018 at 1.6 % , with a warning that the pressure on households &apos; incomes would remain as inflation is expected to qu@@ el@@ l 3 % in the autumn .
however , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in tariffs in the next few years is necessary to limit inflation due to Bre@@ x@@ us , and could prove necessary on the financial markets to perform the expected higher credit market activity .
Members also voted a year ago for the partial withdrawal of the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package , which has been introduced as a result of Bri@@ x@@ t .
it clo@@ ses a roadmap in February to providing low @-@ cost banks with in@@ expensive finance , although it says that it can now expect a pig offer in the scheme of GBP 15 billion higher - the GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision establishing the rate , the Bank says , &apos; gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains power@@ less in the near future , with the difficult emissions of real households continuing to affect consumption &apos; .
as regards the tariffs , it has been repeated that in order to allow inflation to be reduced the need for &apos; trying some kind of fiscal policy &apos; and to what extent &apos; somewhat greater than has been expected in the markets .
Mr deposi@@ rs is currently forecas@@ ting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and other increase in 2020 .
but the bank stressed that any ju@@ mp is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this , and by next year the Bank &apos;s forecasts for May will be 1.9 % and 1.7 % .
the annual growth forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 remained constant .
after this news , the p@@ ound fell in its exchange towards the dollar and against the euro .
in the same time , it fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 dollars and 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to abstain is due to recent disappointment caused by weak growth rates which have raised raise expectations of the move to TO@@ GDP grew in the second quarter from 0.2 % the previous three months to 0.@@ 3 % .
the bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will generate some momentum .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report provided little margin for re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing rising inflation and w@@ ret@@ ched households all in half when they say that the situation is particularly worse prior to recovery .
it was included that monetary policy could not avoid any expenditure last few years , but there is also a expected return of considerably stal@@ l in the light of the three @-@ year forecast .
this p@@ ound also results in an boo@@ m in demand for British produce , applau@@ ding part of consumers &apos; bill .
the decision comes one year after the return of 0.@@ 25 % last August to a shocking poll for the EU leading to a sudden weakening of the p@@ ound .
the bank forecasts estimate that it is likely to take four years to completely fuel prices and the economy life .
before the last decision by the Bank , an emerging demand over the rise in inflation had put the pressure on tight households on the table ; in July three latter politicians called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell last month from 2.6 % compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank eventually said it was expected to get closer in the coming months .
the bank stated that an excess increase of 2 % was due to the completely weak p@@ ound .
Alain Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , the head of the H@@ on@@ ourable cu@@ ri@@ o@@ ar boat in Co@@ rec@@ o , said : &quot; as the recent decline in bargaining rates has been seen , the mortgage market seems to be becoming more competitive again , with creditors sh@@ ying down to work and hoping to break off a year positively .
this B@@ TS@@ G is looking particularly favourable to those whose existing transactions are coming to an end , as re@@ financing , often without service , but at low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
national authorities prescribed 10 000 HIV drugs that have run counter @-@ electrical divergence
patients will have access to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; HIV treatment since September , after the battle left behind in the Supreme Court over whether a medicine should be funded by one of the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England reported that public healthcare has now made an estimated 10 000 voted in the original clinical trial , at most cases of a maximum of 86 % exposure to pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ x@@ y@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) .
the national HS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the appeal court backed a ruling from the Supreme Court last year affir@@ ming that the N@@ HS should pay , even if it claims , disbur@@ ses that the medicinal product should be funded entirely by local authorities .
Simon Ste@@ 167@@ Oomen ha@@ iled , Executive Director of N@@ HS Eng@@ land , welcomed the way in which the communication was published on Thursday as &apos; new serious interference &apos; , whereas the National Law and NA@@ T described it as &apos; a pivotal moment &apos; .
Can@@ al health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ bo@@ l and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ is are among the first to register the population ; in October , further clin@@ ics will follow before the programme is launched in London by April 2018 .
Ar@@ ch@@ bis@@ ho@@ p the pre@@ ac@@ e@@ rec@@ ting py@@ ro@@ x@@ sky ( Pr@@ EP ) is an inc@@ ur of HIV drugs , which has been repeated before the rec@@ ess in order to reduce the very serious threat of HIV infection .
clinical trials show that Pr@@ EP will significantly reduce HIV transmission by humans at risk of infection .
Pr@@ EP rec@@ aran@@ ces suggest that the body of people is able to enjoy sufficient amounts of medicines which can prevent HIV from being infected .
these medicines may be introduced daily , or at the latest two hours , before the rec@@ ess .
the low @-@ level , bis@@ ex@@ ual and homo@@ gen@@ ous candidates include those who are clas@@ sed as HIV and those who are trans@@ gender and people who are treated above all .
teaching staff are identified as &quot; fit gu@@ est casu@@ al &quot; people willing to participate - including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV @-@ based partner cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and who chose a family lawyer there receive effective training of their claim for sex health in the local police process involved in the programme .
the programme cost GBP 10 million , and N@@ HS England signed a deal to get medicines to the hands of international tender this week .
this clinical test aims to evaluate the true potential of the Pr@@ EP , by gathering clinical evidence of who was intended for and how the medicine is consumed and adopted in large sa@@ ges .
Ste@@ ami said , &apos; This new massive intervention should complement , and mobilise , the wide scale of fighting the spread of HIV .
this is another milestone in more than three decades of action before reaching one of humanity &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot;
Da@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , Deputy Chief Executive officer of NA@@ T , said , &apos; This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , when properly targeted in this regard with regard to those who require and are in danger , provides an opportunity to transform Britain into a HIV epidemic .
since September , people with high HIV risks in England have access to a powerful new tool , financed by the State HS clinical trial not only individually managed but reli@@ ably dependent on negotiations with partners , thereby improving a lot of lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian Green - CE@@ O of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Fund - said , &apos; now the priority is to ensure that the clinical trial on the whole of the country is fast launched and does not leave any sections of the HIV at risk in isolation .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been obtained the treatment we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people that run the risk of infection with HIV .
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , the shadow Minister for Public Health , said , &apos; the start of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is very welcome and is long overdue following the delay in the month or repeated delay and read government feet .
evidence shows how dramatic changes this becoming can bring to HIV prevention work and eliminate the spread of infection to the interests of those who make it life .
this clinical attempt will take us one step further towards full understanding of the advantages of P@@ RC .
it is now essential that the clinical test should be deployed as soon as possible to protect citizens with exposure to HIV and to move us a step closer to halting HIV use in society . &quot;
electricity prices rose 12 % in Estonia , however , Latvia and Lithuania fell .
in the case of electricity next day , the differences between regions in the stock exchange between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to 1.@@ 94 euros compared to EUR 7.@@ 71 in June this year , announced the move to Ele@@ ring .
the main reason for the price disparity is the rich links Lithuania @-@ Sweden .
last month in Estonia , the average private equity price of electricity reached EUR 34.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t and prices rose by 12 per cent compared with June .
the price fell by five percent in Latvia and Lithuania to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 from me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts .
in Finland , the cost was EUR 34.@@ 17 , and the systemic price of the electricity exchange Nord half was EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t @-@ hour .
prices rose by 12 @-@ 7 percent as a result .
between Estonia and Finland electricity drew up 75 % of the roadmap for Estonia in the past month and 16 % for those hours from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not follow the next day .
electricity was spent 99 % , between Estonia and Latvia , with Estonia Latvia running with 73 % of the remainder of the hour in the tunnel using the whole transmission capacity .
in the spot spot in Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X in the last trading day in July risks to electricity stock exchange per unit of € 34 and € 37 per Me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t in September .
the CO2 price affecting electricity production started last month , with transaction prices amounting to a price of € 5.@@ 04 to € 5.@@ 47 per tonne .

it was not high enough to put in two spaces above each other , so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create a qu@@ asi @-@ order that it could stand up .
Mr Füle had to approach it in a creative way .
&apos;@@ Me@@ tal@@ gal building is quite complicated , &apos; he will explain .
&apos;@@ We had to re@@ organise premises , so that they were installed on each other , no matter how they should b@@ other .
it was not just building a platform ; rather we used the steel system to ensure that it is a suspended fibre level . &quot;

&apos;@@ We have come a little bit of &apos; programming &apos; into this : &apos; explanations from Er@@ fan ter@@ as@@ can@@ ist , a spo@@ use down@@ stream boo@@ ked by radio@@ s ship .

in fact , they also want not to leave , as happened with Jo@@ anne .

on the first half of the film itself I feel like a spe@@ lling of Latin house business : even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ingi and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ ry have similar language .

after the third residents where the po@@ et can open a window of her eyes , one is inclined to feel that film makers are certainly driven by a aim of households because even the most vile vie@@ wer can &apos;t keep te@@ ars back seeing centuries of suffering from a tiny cancer bo@@ y .
if a shop@@ per ce@@ ases to be turned into a house and his situation looks almost hope@@ less , the father will ultimately see the mor@@ ality of his work and for a good man seeking work .

after all , the least has been caused to be completely healthy , and although his father has just lost his work , that proves positive , because now there is definitely time to deal with the family .
I can also feel good - I can foresee the end of the American dra@@ ma quite well !
in truth , this film has been approved well , with all its elements in place .

the new staff transfer plans to limit the use of the media by the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps Mr Füle will be able to cope with this .
he would then be established as the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff surplus in the White House plans to limit to President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in &apos;s flow of information , including news , in the hope that this will balance the water .
here is a broken article from Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ incredibly :
&quot; when Mr Kelly received a new staff upper house in White with high officials during his first job , he highlighted a key problem in President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s Val@@ ges in Da@@ mas which he planning to solve to reach the IPCC bad information in the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly told officials that information has to go through him , whether on paper or in meetings , as the President would make better decisions if he could be given good information &apos; .
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems to be totally logical , but others have also made attempt to do this and they have failed to g@@ rin@@ d down T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i by keeping its media consumption monitored .
President T@@ ru@@ m &apos;s relationship with television extends decades and , even now that he is in White Ma@@ s , his television observation habits have ce@@ ased .
&quot; while candidate T@@ ru@@ mp was a lost line , he was told that the statements having consequences were also fair : &quot; said S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , a former campaig@@ ner for the violence in February to Poli@@ ti@@ co .
Poli@@ tic@@ o critic@@ Pal@@ mer wrote at the time that Pe@@ tals T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter , a former six campaign develop@@ ers , said that it was key to manage behavi@@ ou@@ ral behaviour , to ensure that their physical consumption of the media included a similarly high level of praise . &apos;
on good note .
the idea that T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter &apos;s exercises used ; at one time allegedly , it has been under &apos; control &apos; , however , is ridiculous .
perhaps they know something else that the rest of us too do not know that the mortgage caps would have cro@@ wn even deeper without these operations .
we are probably never getting any news of the waste that a T@@ ru@@ ker has dis@@ pat@@ ched .
if it managed to save it twice as easily by putting them off , their efforts were worth doing it .
but nobody has succeeded in preventing T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i from systematically creating controversy .
part of the problem is that in the White House , which has competing c@@ olum@@ ns together , people are seeking the promotion of their own interests without exception , making it possible to convey a material that supports their views in the world but does not always have faith .
Poli@@ tic@@ o , which reflects the evolution of this whole story , wrote strategically questionable information on the medi@@ eval tox@@ ic@@ ity of coun@@ sell@@ ors in May to the President .
one example report describing by Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is as follows :
&apos;@@ This and the former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i claims that T@@ ru@@ mp could respond to a negative press , particularly particularly damaging ones , by a speeding @-@ up approach and seiz@@ ing the source of those that they were in .
this same approach occurred at the end of February when someone happily made a copy to the President @-@ elect of the Internet provo@@ cative EPP @-@ based website , Charles C. G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com , annexed to John , which accused the de@@ pu@@ mber of staff , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , of being the white house &apos;s &apos; source for several inf@@ eri@@ fe &apos; .
it does not matter that Joh@@ n@@ son , by mo@@ cking , has been permanently blocked from Twitter , or that he has provided no specific certification or provided mis@@ calculations in the past and recalled them in particular .
a sample approved the article and inh@@ eri@@ ted revol@@ t over Wales from the eligible logo . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that the staff top at that time , through 0s Re@@ Pri@@ eb@@ us and Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , Director of the White house &apos;s Office , &apos; has tried to establish a system for managing and docu@@ menting documents reaching T@@ ru@@ mp@@ ini &apos; .
how did it manage ?
three months later Mr Kelly is attempting to do just the same .
it may prove that it is a good Mr Pri@@ eb@@ ist driver , but the T@@ ru@@ for@@ k@@ man is still &apos; impul@@ se &apos; and its hel@@ ple@@ ss &apos; competition in order to remain at large .
these unchanged factors make the arrival of Mr Kelly &apos;s mission extremely difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans coming from abroad are not necessarily getting permission to speak .

the purpose of this event was to collect ticket costs for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day .
whether they did not want permission from towns for the disgu@@ isation in the old world is what the No@@ emi and Boeing had their heads shak@@ en .
first , we did not know .
secondly , we are never living for more than one town or another and exceptions are mostly granted month or such action .
it does not make sense to pay &apos; - explained by Bo@@ b .
at the gates to Vir@@ u some 20 minutes later , I saw that two ladies were sitting with them and pushing them to go .

the Bank of Estonia purchased EUR 149 million in a public assets programme from central banks in July , with the Central Bank bond portfolio increasing up to EUR 4.@@ 36 billion overall .
the Central Bank does not publish details of purchases in more detail .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , has explained in the past , in response to the issue of head of question from members of the Assembly , that the deposi@@ tory scheme of the Euro@@ system includes three different purchasing programmes : financial sector bonds ( TRIPS ) , property bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public debt ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank bu@@ ys down on the market to encourage the investors who sold bonds to invest money elsewhere .
it reduces the production of impaired assets whilst making purchases , and encourages investors to take up higher risks .
generally , within the framework of the public sector bond programme , each Central Bank buy its own national government bonds , and the bonds of other countries do not go un@@ convinced .
since the Estonian State has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is going to make a so @-@ called replacement purchases within its limited scope .
Central banks will also be able to shop in countries where they offer B@@ T@@ R bonds limited .
the Bank of Estonia , under assurances by H@@ ans@@ son , is generally purchase European institutional bonds , such as the European Financial Stability Facility and European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian bank will buy bonds through its investment programme as from March 2015 .
in the meantime , spot bonds were purchased and bonds no longer bought by the Estonian bank in June 2016 .
on behalf of the central banks in the euro area , both electricity and Estonian energy bonds are purchased by the Bank of Finland .

they have returned Mo@@ ses , Children and trucks after they were born out of it just in May , without being thrown out of the cracy emo@@ tion suffered by a ven@@ ue to prevent their invasion by a council .
an active group found itself weak in its bureaucratic limits rather than turning its vehicles out of the retention point that was left to bic@@ y@@ cles .
young people have moved to a Fin@@ no council , say that the council is &apos; no &apos; to tackling this problem .
a anon@@ ymous individual said : &apos; they went there Sunday evening after their evi@@ ction from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ on , where they were st@@ oned .
it is worth sha@@ ming governments to take action because they are useless to deal with the problem .
it was there in May , it was time to move and now they return .
they came in yesterday evening , probably more today . &quot;
she added : &quot; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m implementing council awareness as regards how to handle such matters by getting long limits to protect its par@@ ks .
I live on street et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k and I am not satisfied to press ahead with the provision of a total mandate when the local council cannot even do anything to prevent this . &quot;
a local person who likewise wished to remain anon@@ ymous said , &apos; that is ridiculous and we have just seen the latter rid of those migratory defec@@ ts and we are already seeing a new offensive taking place .
this time , the numbers are rising , and even a hor@@ ror has been seen on the ground . &quot;
the So@@ hat@@ ul@@ li Regional Representative said , &apos; We are well aware that in Val@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k land near the path , it is intolerable for a camp press to work together with the So@@ minis@@ ul@@ li police ; we are taking the necessary legal measures to get them through as soon as possible .
it will help enormously to gather evidence when as many local people as possible report all the antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour committed to the police , calling the number 101 .
this helps to find out where the case is in justice . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val will also visit the Minister for Culture , In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , among others , who is delighted that a real world of top names has managed to become I@@ wi@@ IP .
as for everybody who is actually coming across the ran@@ k of three days for the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val , the question as to why this is so important to the warning is also that you should be asked by all those who che@@ at to the full .
she points out , however , that there are real players present in the Bulgarian area .
&apos;@@ whereas looking at the level of artists that can be brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this mus@@ ici@@ dal j@@ arg@@ on are put home - we often do not have it in our court &apos; , the Minister for Culture talks .
which top performers on the F@@ esti@@ val , however , will Sa@@ art itself be most spoken about ?
I declare myself quite old and some of the old people represented by me certainly have one of the most experienced lawyers Ar@@ min van B@@ situ@@ rez , who stood up last night .
in his legacy , none of us has feel forced into our own hands at any point in time . &quot;
he is still highlighting a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ coordinators , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ um 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ registers .
our Estonian counterparts , of course , too : starting with NO@@ Hoo@@ P and they are beginning with a whole range .
in fact , in fact , it is of great ze@@ al to have names ; it says so . &apos;

J@@ ew , to 850 000 diesel vehicles renew their machines over middle of criticism faced by car manufacturers
the day before the award notice , B@@ M@@ W said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles .
&quot; there are smarter alternatives than travel restrictions , &quot; according to the chairman of the B@@ M@@ W , referring to European cities , including the B@@ M@@ W home city , Munich , which has fac@@ to@@ red about banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that three million eco @-@ vehicles in Europe will renew their sales of diesel engines in order to reduce emissions of exha@@ ust gases .
no business described these steps as being withdrawn .
European car makers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the US in order to help follow regulations on CO2 emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide em@@ itted from diesel engines is considered a carcino@@ gen that can cause as@@ th@@ ma .
furthermore , waste equipment intended to counteract emissions of diesel gases from cars is increasing , making it difficult for cars to stay competitive .
while the German car manufacturers are under thorough scrutiny , the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ring@@ ing the powerful car manufacturers of forcefully and ignoring the signs of the problem .
companies try to avoid repeating the mistakes of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , which has du@@ mped the use of so @-@ called &apos; hidden devices &apos; , which enabled their way of adjusting the face from a car to complying with the regulations at the time they tested , but which were actually brought back in the normal driving conditions .
several Presidents of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen have been charged in the US for the investigation of others in both sides of the Atlantic .
a former chairman of the solar dynamic part of the Au@@ di engine development department was arrested in Germany last month .
Mr Pa@@ mi@@ o , the former President , is an Italian , and so not protected from extradition and can go to trial in the United States of America .
earlier this year , during the criminal investigation on the Au@@ di textile Agricultural Court in Germany , the authorities accused the Eurostat system operators of instal@@ ling it , to avoid the demands of European gas , thereby increasing the investigation , which was previously focused on the United States .
the incorporation of the author in the investigation could be a huge blow to Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen &apos;s toy manufacturer of abolished character cars , generating a disproportionate share of Vol@@ ks@@ w@@ agen@@ i &apos;s profits .
to Estonian schools , their European flag will be bought EUR 20 000 .
the Estonian School will be bought by 1st September by the Ministry of Education by range of Education with Commission quality opinions .
collectively , the meter is given to 5@@ 70 educational institutions in the EU .
cros@@ ses are designed to be given priority on in@@ puts , to be carried out in good quality , print equipment , with internal en@@ closed doors and to be subject to expert information .
the flag label reads : &apos; a commitment of Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of Estonia .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags is EUR 20 000 at the expense of the Ministry of Education , or a flag that costs EUR 35 .
journalist murder highlighting the growing threat situation in Mexico
workers from N@@ chan@@ al@@ al@@ everyday Govern@@ e Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , normally r@@ ally , collected in Wednesday in order to review the plans to reflect the most recent chaos experienced by the State of Sin@@ ory , experienced by organised crime , corrupt officials and drug wars .
however , they have gathered today under the auspices of their personal tragedy to debate their own security .
they are told that it is important to change your rou@@ tine .
two main members of the House are discussing which seems safer : can they bring children with me to the office targets for the gran@@ dio@@ de attack in 2009 or leave them in the home .
security experts have written three words to the group taking the lead : &apos; enemies &apos; ; &apos; neutrality &apos; ; &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask repor@@ ters for crow@@ ds to offer no SWIFT evidence , to whom impres@@ sions and insi@@ ghts are required .
being employed by the government or car@@ tels in@@ discrimin@@ ates hap@@ pi@@ res the idea of drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists as their cur@@ as dangerous for reporting the chaos prevailing in Mexico .
according to the Committee for the Protection of Citizens , since the fa@@ however , of President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena boycot@@ to took office in December 2012 , the more death toll accompanied by public protection , the more journalists from the Aviation Fund were able to aid , with a delay and , within all numbers , to kill at least 25 , 5@@ 89 journalists due to attacks and threats , and then to death en masse in at least seven states .
among the latter are the edit@@ or and source of inspiration , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as , co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in line with some of its many books on drug @-@ violence .
his absence makes itself felt very felt when his presence could be perceived across the Caspian Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building field , as you know , described with the specta@@ cular eye of Val@@ dez , with the letter &apos; Justice &apos; , and the 30 reports , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , carrying T @-@ shir@@ ts em@@ itted by his attract some pe@@ pp@@ ling pri@@ l@@ ings of images or Britain @-@ s@@ kin@@ s .
less than two months after his death , rolling Portuguese are reflecting the trau@@ ma of shared trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , lack of vision , paran@@ o@@ ia .
although the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established to prosecute journalists in 2010 , only two cases have been prosecuted according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
like the majority of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime @-@ related killings reaching thousands , this percentage sel@@ dom ends up being prosecuted .
the presence of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce will continue to highlight the violence prevailing in Y@@ al@@ o , even though hearts have broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without this licence information and justice , I@@ bar@@ ra &apos;s meeting on security is unlikely to be well .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at requires your time at this summit his &apos; message is that he is considering that he is wasting .
&apos;@@ sures all so long as there is no reason for known claim . &apos;
this is 15 May morning of Val@@ dez up from the National Capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an port on the National and Monetary Affairs Authority .
she managed to travel just a few quarters before two men suspended her red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ roles , forcing her to go away from the vehicle 12 times - probably for &quot; the language of the newspaper , &quot; which is its li@@ ten@@ ary &quot; twelve rivers . &quot;
an armed person travelled to Val@@ dez in the car and was also striking in the vic@@ inity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she was behind her her female and two adults .
the rum@@ ours spread freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the issue of Val@@ dez , there is basically silence .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition of the United States in January , you will have been one of the bloo@@ di@@ est bat@@ tle@@ fields of that country because ri@@ val cli@@ cks will fight to fill listened to this power vacuum .
it is no different that on the streets of your own permit , a person , or indeed often several , is fel@@ led every day or that our homes bur@@ ned in an abundan@@ t dream of two drug slaugh@@ ters are disappe@@ aring and more than the homes of many .
let us remember for a second time that time the weather suggests the only maritime state governed by a car@@ tel by precious ports and good routes within the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of its work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s com@@ run@@ ner and president Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) feels very full of li@@ mb@@ o wasted ering in causing these conflicts .
he believes that two errors have been facilitated by killings .
the first was to publish an interview with the Latin man &apos;s sons in successful theat@@ re , which was in competition and fighting surroun@@ dings with the Mon@@ sig@@ o D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ za .
all fields were bought off by di@@ ves@@ ty members of diplomatic forces , even even though they were agreed into newspaper blocks , to continue to be em@@ itted by a piece of paper .
another mistake was that Val@@ dez should not leave the country for security itself after its crackdown was carried out in a piece of news report which mir@@ rors the same story .
the Val@@ dez was a leg@@ end both in Mexico and abroad and her killing is seen as a breaking point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had survi@@ ved for so much a period of time that his friends and colleagues expected him to be permanently present .
he served as a ve@@ ter@@ ant repor@@ ter at No@@ ro@@ childhood in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce over 50 @-@ dollar % .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said today that you &apos;@@ knew that it was impossible to deal with this problem without affecting the press . &apos;
history implies a considerable amount of time ago with its bold and honest publication and increased sales and advertising .
Ath@@ reg@@ ans liked to be well @-@ informed without co@@ g@@ ul@@ tation and s@@ no@@ w@@ dly printed to read texts , which no other manager da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was formed , the newspaper became honoured for her broadcas@@ ts in Latin America in the pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot Award .
similarly , Val@@ dez &apos;s international press freedom prize was won by the committee for the Protection of Public Health ( AK@@ K ) in the same year for its courage to follow up the Mexic@@ an drug bub@@ ble elsewhere that leads to .
he quite frankly admitted that he was afraid .
&apos;@@ I want to continue , &apos; he said whilst receiving the AK@@ K prize .
last October , in an interview with the television channel Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV , he said that trafficking in drugs is the way you live in .
&quot; we can take our heads at the challenge that life has to play with the media profession as a kind of opportunity for rela@@ ys can observe a second chance .
I do not want to see me asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not speak about what is happening . &apos;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce College is lon@@ ging for W@@ hil@@ y , a his@@ tori@@ an , who felt like a mad@@ ness , a friend , who gene@@ rously shared h@@ reflects and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they responded to his officials &apos; support .
it always 05 mon@@ k into its circle .
he took over from the office himself , during the same 1970s , from El eHealth y@@ ab@@ o to the bar and sat on it .
now they are asking : did his rou@@ tine love make her fa@@ me fatal to her ?
her death has also made them doubt that her job is best done and stays alive .
they have no like the blind pan @-@ ga@@ zing landing pla@@ tes used for the transport of drugs for their women , their children and their legitimate businesses . &quot;
&apos;@@ Nan@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez &apos; said &quot; This was not something I should worry about .
the result has very strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ estee@@ ming of the country , even in the best times .
my in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
suddenly , when it be@@ ds sme@@ ll out there is every bit of chaos .
according to Mr Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ ali , the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the problem is that &apos; the flav@@ our can be dece@@ ived ... and that is the case with J@@ Yugoslavia &apos; .
he and others say that you no longer have &apos; blue dis@@ e &apos; rules in force , just as they no longer are the case with the tox@@ ic@@ ity of the Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ page , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ iro or other states which are home to the misleading composition of the lu@@ cra@@ tive smuggling routes , fragile institutions and corrupt public servants .
diversity is changing all the time .
suddenly , within the community of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce r@@ ally employers came together for security training , mobile phones were no longer allowed , and a few days previously it was revealed that the r@@ charge bel@@ la sold to governments alone had been used to track journalists and activists in Mexico .
Co@@ me@@ a has been se@@ ar@@ ched by two police streams under the gu@@ ise of a pu@@ d@@ gel of 40 fran@@ proactive six .
the government appointed a more H@@ ot@@ ch office in its four @-@ order building in the NUTS basin of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
some repor@@ ters pon@@ dered half @-@ jo@@ king whether these police officers belong to those 50 % of the police officers which were himself not reliable by govern@@ or .
several months have passed since repor@@ ters have pushing down land in hil@@ ly areas where controls de facto do hold drug gan@@ gs .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edition this week covered three main beau@@ ties .
one of them was the assassination of testi@@ mony of the si@@ x@@ aval@@ ent of former son , Ju@@ li@@ o С@@ ar Cha@@ vez bro@@ ther , in Y@@ al@@ o .
moreover , they had an un@@ mis@@ tak@@ eable story about spending government finances on the town of dry .
and a group of people were kidna@@ pped from one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , which is gone from a c@@ abinet to a quarter .
there was no formal announcement as to who had been abduc@@ ted or how it happened , so it has to be cautious to write back in the city what everyone knows in alty to drug traffickers and the authorities .
the sport became aware from public documents that restaur@@ ant labels have been registered with the name of a politician belonging to a dominant Institu@@ tional Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) dominated by all levels of politics in almost the whole of the last century .
recently , several IR@@ P govern@@ ors have been charged with corruption within a context of widespread coverage of cases .
Vil@@ lar@@ line asked repor@@ ter to write these earlier incidents in the same place , including the way in which the son of Gu@@ z@@ mani g who speaks El Chap@@ o did not arrive at the military .
just a few months previously , read@@ ers should be looking to the C@@ ho@@ ff of Val@@ dez in order to be able to learn about the abduc@@ tion from the best sources .
&apos;@@ You know what happened earlier , we had already known &apos; tobacco farmers 46 year old in Vil@@ lar@@ line who had organise their bro@@ ker body earned him a sh@@ ell@@ name El Fla@@ co .
now all communication channels to our sources have broken down . &quot;
from the office in Val@@ dez , the homes of bridges and stic@@ kers who protest against the killing of journalists have been transformed into something that they could never expect from Catania activists on the media .
the Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez seized a few eyes and log@@ ged next morning to the offices of the local Prosecutor for another journalist .

on this day , President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington , trying to r@@ alli@@ ze international support for the bringing about justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
a day after the death in Val@@ dez with Y@@ al@@ oa &apos;s cell , Ra@@ mi@@ rez accused journalists of Working after papers of as@@ certain@@ ing the truth .
after that , he called for the leadership to be diver@@ ted from eliminating the government , in the concerned area of concern about its objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists were &apos; illegal &apos; for organised crime , for co @-@ accountable state officials and for an indifferent society .
in her recent book &apos; the drug press &apos; , he wrote that Tra@@ vel@@ urs kill not only the drug gan@@ gs but also operate under the command of politicians and security forces who are Chancellor of organised crime .
media Monitoring Group Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 gave more than half of the journalist &apos;s attacks on the police and those on state officials last year .
&quot; in Mexico global warming , you want to shut your h down , &quot; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
Wil@@ dless influence obviously works very bloody .
no one will forget the death of blo@@ gg@@ ers Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ s six years ago .
his body was found with a letter that perhaps had been signed in L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas Car@@ tel : &apos; I am here for my report &apos; .
he bu@@ ried in front of his bur@@ nt head in a computer glass medical room and high @-@ protein children .
some publications have decided to close their door , for example , the newspaper El Nor@@ te in Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , the North Fron@@ ti@@ er , after their correspon@@ dent IPR L@@ 2025 .
others will follow on , as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do did following the assassination of their president in 2004 .
in 2010 , Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly spoke to the drug bear with the motto &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home state or even their country .
we are facing a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
it is difficult to find an all @-@ out solution and they still have to fare down the f@@ ence in to avoid risks .
and sometimes this is doing it , as is perhaps happening with the Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in a matter of three months and after Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z was pain@@ ted in a Mexico where four women were murdered and murdered in 2015 .
those who remain at Bay and continue to work have to dance daily around risky decisions .

successive sections of the holder of cotton @ The@@ e@@ P@@ 45 were shared together on its ten@@ dri@@ ft .
Mr St@@ . Ho@@ mail G@@ rap@@ p@@ par passed on a real @-@ time st@@ in@@ y , Michael Brown , an un@@ armed Mayor of 18 : he had been killed by a white police officer in Nor@@ gus@@ oni Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is .
he gave a picture of the existence of Bro@@ w@@ n living which was born on the street , deeply old .
&apos;@@ S@@ cra@@ zy , &apos; thinking Ferreira 200 .
but the death toll was not new for him or for his community .
she rol@@ led out her phone but later saw the wa@@ y@@ fall later this evening , reporting people coming in in The Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
designed to photo@@ graph@@ ed the police and the urgent people , a man who claimed his father to be Bro@@ w and kept a label &apos; My un@@ armed son was killed by the Fer@@ gus@@ on police ! &apos;
she watched a foot in real time , with police officers standing before a group of prote@@ sters qu@@ el@@ ling a baby &apos;s bags .
in the second video , another poli@@ ce@@ man who said &apos; she w@@ ol@@ f and cra@@ cked the drain &apos; : I kill all ... animals . &apos;
the Fer@@ rell recalls how he was able to catch himself out of care : &apos; that is unusual &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is not the kind of murder we are used to and we might call typical &apos; .
I felt sc@@ at@@ tered at this point in time .
I was ang@@ ry and contained . &apos;
he boo@@ ked a return flight and he went home the following day .
having bu@@ ried at 23 o &apos;@@ clock , she went on to her six @-@ year @-@ old so@@ receive ; she decided to travel to the twin @-@ aged Fer@@ gus@@ on next morning .
what happened with Fer@@ rel@@ li and Fer@@ gus@@ oni in the next three years will be at the heart of the planning of the new &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; ( &apos; who streets ? &apos; ) , which will come forward on 11 August in cine@@ mas .
this is about survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and fir@@ m@@ ness for those people who live there and who then meet the streets in demand of responses .
when Ferre@@ ll , along with his da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a shu@@ tting sal@@ ge tied in it and had a fine at it - went through the Fer@@ gus@@ oni side , they once again debated the subject they had already raised before this morning with all too many hours - with black experience and living conditions .
&apos;@@ D@@ ho@@ you will recall , when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; he will remind us of his question .
&apos;@@ We are today travelling around Fer@@ gus@@ oni , as the police killed 18 @-@ year old boys and that was not right . &apos;
&apos;@@ I could not take him forward , &apos; says Ferre@@ ll afterwards .
&quot; what is happening now is ... the cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it has to know and see that happen and grow in the middle of it .
it has to learn about the organisations and organisation and , at the same time , also recognise the different la@@ yers of black experiences and living situations , and what we should do to get ourselves free and free .
even though I can grow her by not having to go on being subjected to - feel cru@@ el@@ ty racism in person - she is not exceptional for him from being a black girl .
I feel I would do her a dis@@ service if I supported her in this world . &quot;
the first stopped they gave when they arrived at Fer@@ gus@@ oni was in the South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ t - the be@@ ating place above the police station - which had become a sort of camp site in which activists were waiting for news to be on the poli@@ ce@@ man , Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , whom was ultimately not charged .
there , Mr Ferre@@ ll and his da@@ u@@ ghter combined forces with the local business owners who produced the southern aspect that took place there .
they brought together their workshops and helped to ap@@ portion food to those protesting .
a new type of activist has slowly started to rise to form for a Fer@@ neighbour .
&apos;@@ My activist changed profoundly after 9 August &apos; , he said , &apos; because he spoke out , while mentioning that when he was a student at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ tis University , he was President of the Association of teachers of the tiny L@@ ever@@ s and focused on food justice and health inequalities within black communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organising .
it is all there too little . &quot;
weeks later , at the moment of the Ferre@@ ll evening demonstration , a film co @-@ vi@@ tor like Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ ak@@ has sat for the signing .
Fo@@ lay@@ an has mentioned that his and my film operator , Mr Tra@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , just wanted to offer documents on what is going on .
according to the Fer@@ rel@@ li , the question raised was : &apos; do you try to put records or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless instances in which people - often white - come into a community and try to profit from its ir@@ responsibility and resilience .
Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview , &apos; we had heard that the voice of persons born and growing in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard and we had wished to do it differently &apos; .
Col@@ lay@@ an had already beaten her hand with the co @-@ n@@ om@@ ine@@ e D@@ am@@ on Da@@ vis , an ar@@ tist in the area known as a activist as detainees sentenced to death .
his involvement made the project attractive for ras and for the local community that was followed for years following the bom@@ bing of K@@ ho@@ se street .
&apos;@@ no one is talking for us or for us in this docu@@ mentary ; we are talking to us for the record , &apos; human being said .
&quot; I played an important role and saw these people portra@@ yed - that I would feel . &quot;
whereas it was not intended to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rel@@ li - it was to be shown that the movement was not about &apos; the bus and steel ass@@ or applies &apos; but about bringing the community together &apos; - as Mr Fo@@ lay@@ an said - he became the most open actor in the film he was born out of business .
as a result , &apos; W@@ ho@@ val street report ? &apos; ama@@ zing personal aspects of the life of Fer@@ rell such as be@@ ap@@ Bay and marriage with their wife are documented .
&apos;@@ I felt patients - and I used to say so definitely , &apos; Mer@@ ll said &apos; by laugh@@ ing over the first time that he has seen the contents of the paper .
&quot; but I made sense that we organise this work and human@@ ise the black . &quot;
furthermore , the Fer@@ rell story has emphasised and is re@@ si@@ ving the role played by a ruling homo@@ sexual woman for the wider Black B@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two movements from three first set out in the social media , after the out@@ door killing of Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , a black teen@@ ag@@ er of 2012 , will be homo@@ gen@@ ous .
&apos;@@ Con@@ tor@@ ne@@ y homo@@ sexual women of ten@@ se make a big majority of sense , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll , &apos; - and this is precisely because we have to fight repeatedly on several fronts .
Roma fundamenta@@ list women must carry all the burden of this . &quot;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed to pointing out that &quot; mobility really is stag@@ nation for black women , but many of them black girls are black female women &quot; .
he says , however , that &apos; This is not an act of equal opportunities &apos; - Fer@@ rel@@ li is not chosen as the centre for her family on the grounds of his identity .
&apos;@@ Britain was someone who had the right energy into her night &apos; the person he said .
but it is not a coincidence that he has only sta@@ tioned at his sharp front , for social @-@ level homo@@ sexual women living on such s@@ chil@@ ls are at a great deal .
her energy can be felt through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the sha@@ dows of news have long since disappeared from Fer@@ gus@@ ona , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the pa@@ thetic sentence imposed on a Fer@@ rel@@ li for blocking the road will last for another 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in what he calls home a simple &apos; huge freedom &apos; threat .
nevertheless , she still attaches importance to the man@@ tra it has hi@@ red since the time she went up on the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ on as a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our responsibility to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;

currency firms that help help your companies avoid next U@@ b@@ superfluous
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wished to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were hope@@ less .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , mis@@ guided .
and even if it promised anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust this process .
&apos;@@ The system simply was not consistent and objective , &apos; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is control of the black @-@ and @-@ white @-@ white @-@ commerce company , acting with 75 personnel on San Franc@@ is@@ co , &apos; .
she is therefore insti@@ gating aid from outside .
start @-@ ups addressing new forms of human resources are emerging to assist companies to identify what their workers feel .
in developing and licen@@ sing software which aims firmly to measure worker participation , they allow companies to carry out fe@@ e@@ ble surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , provide anon@@ y@@ mity , and offer a later line of complaints and , in some cases , allow internet au@@ operators to by@@ pass III @-@ level C management and address the directors directly .
&apos;@@ J@@ ust and F@@ it@@ bit tools have now set up to monitor health , but where is F@@ it@@ bit for your company ? &apos; : Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O Mrs music Ter@@ ring@@ es , Bri@@ t@@ we@@ t , that have software analytical tools used by businesses to measure employee inclusion .
according to Er@@ ret@@ t , he has been given a much better overview of what his staff think and feel about the three years he has used G@@ lin@@ ti .
besides messages to insolvency and teams targeted at sustained teams , it provides a business insu@@ lation map that outlines which departments manage to receive most complaints and which are performing the lowest support , allowing drivers to spot for their reasons they have the least support .
companies are starting to understand that they have to keep up with their work culture in order not to change to the next U@@ bi@@ g , which has been ri@@ d@@ dled with scandals since this former employee published a blo@@ gg@@ election describing the &apos; Sha@@ ming environment &apos; that pen@@ alised those who da@@ red speak .

and complaints go directly to the Bureau if it is concerned by the executive .
&quot; public opinion has had been Parliaments to receive , &quot; Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , foun@@ der and CE@@ O of Control cen@@ us said .
I have had to say that , if a company finds itself ill @-@ treated or une@@ th@@ ical , a company would face serious consequences like boycot@@ ts on consumers , a break @-@ down of workers and court cases even if regulators do not intervene .
Ru@@ by SS@@ GI , a restaur@@ ant that has more than 25 000 employees at 500 points of operation , has deployed a convergence cen@@ t for more than a year to ensure workers are aware of the rules and operations and to provide a fairly good way of intera@@ cting with the corpor@@ ation , the headquarters .
if an employee wanted to report the problem earlier , he had to find a company &apos;s head telephone number , or e @-@ mail address , and hope this is taken seriously .
it was often a da@@ m@@ ning and un@@ comfortable process , and Mr James Vit@@ ran@@ o , the stu@@ mbling rapporteur , said that there was no good way of monitoring the complaints of workers .
however , with the company &apos;s use of Def@@ en@@ sive cen@@ ts , problems are more promptly identified and dealt with , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices , which did not , in the past , reach leaders who acted in offices in other cities or states .
&quot; I am able to build a closer path to promoting a healthy 3@@ 60 degree experience for workers , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o who heads the Ru@@ by Judicial Risk Management team .
&quot; and we can protect our shareholders against judicial disputes with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that businesses got started taking ethical action , values and workers &apos; involvement much more seriously in 2002 , that is , after the auditors &apos; Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen failed in his case of ethical violations .
but only when &apos; social media were mature &apos; did companies realise that they could not stop their hul@@ l being swe@@ pt on the Internet in public .
&quot; before using technologies to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Control cent can offer their software services by having a financial charge for the use of their own products perio@@ dic@@ ally .
this is a business model and a way of having venture capital agreed for investors and supported by both start @-@ ups .
the convergence architecture provided EUR 10 million in February to firms such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and customs Capital , thus increasing the amount of capital generated to USD 47 million .
the G@@ lin@@ s invested USD 10 million in November in Sarkozy &apos;s pro @-@ Russian partners , increasing its capacity to provide top @-@ up funding to USD 60 million .
this investment will come as no surprise given the link between enterprises , culture and venture capital .
increased research shows that modern workers expect more than before .
on competition markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are just focus@@ sed on the table .
workers wish to feel they are accepted and valued and because they devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people would be happy in the company , feel they would be listened and the job they do is satis@@ fying , they are more committed to the success of the company , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President of the Global benefit and expert Department for Labour , L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ i , who will use both the 79@@ cen@@ t and the G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors make gains if their portfolio companies do well ; companies are doing well when workers are committed and involved .
if the verification tools of the third party allow increased commitment and participation on the part of the workers , we shall not be surprised that they are supported .
the existence of data on worker participation is important , according to the specialists of the working culture .
however , this data will be useless unless such a company &apos;s success@@ ors take stock of it .
actually , in case a firm is asking for feedback from its employees the prospect of change in front of us .
it can contribute to disappointment and reduce employees &apos; involvement if changes do not take place quickly enough or at all .
&quot; when you ask for EUR 4 000 , you must be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; said Mr K@@ ot@@ ter International , President R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who watched companies making a mistake by relying too badly on data collection .
&apos;@@ R@@ ue to say , if it is not , the workers are wondering : did you take I had a look ?
are you concerned ?
and surprised , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Er@@ ret@@ t , without tou@@ ching on the Netherlands , which now provides six studies among employees , it has been possible to deploy measures on the same day that the problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ ti .
and after the purely rapid decision making and engaged in regular communications from de@@ pressed workers , they could organise a number of company teams and offer communic@@ ators to address the problems .
however , this will collect new data on workers and in the long term it is expected that this generates a longer @-@ term commitment by the workforce in an industry known for its high turnover of employees .
&apos;@@ Un@@ so , without a commitment to transparency , you will destroy the people , &apos; commented Vit@@ ran@@ o o .
&apos;@@ You are losing customers as well if you lose these people .
finally , if you lose clients you will lose their business . &quot;
the pre@@ dominant sta@@ r of the euro area is Baltic : income escal@@ ates as a result .
although the crisis in 2008 and the problems regarding trade with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income trend of rich countries in Western Europe , B@@ iz@@ berg is writing the report by referred to the ECB .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 the economy output per capita has passed the hope in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the success stories followed by low debt , fast @-@ proving institutions and commercial and free @-@ market policies .
&apos;@@ The Baltic states , one with Slovakia , are among a few euro area countries where SA@@ A per head of purchase has substantially moved from EU average &apos; . the ECB acknowledged the fact that it had notified the Joint Summit ( AG@@ S ) .
whilst the objective is that for the economy per capita size of richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the aggre@@ gate output per capita of the Baltic economies made up the European Union only 2 / 3 of the average of the 15 countries that preceded the 2004 enlargement .
low wages have led the Bal@@ ans to seek better incomes abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and also that this year the economy is growing , there is not total enthusiasm for the population .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of residents of Latvia and Lithuania appreciate the fact that their economies are doing a very fine or rather good thing .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was estimated by some fewer than half of the respondents to the economies .
N@@ CA@@ A Decision : tw@@ o@@ fold G20 Re@@ quest long
it is almost 23 when leadership leaders from U@@ C@@ L@@ A upgrade , for discussions , at the edge of a new exercise at the university Chamber .
some of them have tightened their backs by reve@@ aling the aspirations of their training camp on a daily basis .
for a considerable proportion of the team , these Christmas minutes provide middle @-@ day pa@@ per@@ work .
after three hours of struggle , those who take part in the March are heading back for further termin@@ al learning before returning to W@@ NG@@ man for meetings next morning at 6.@@ 30 .
&apos;@@ The next three days will be a challenge for them , &apos; Jim Mor@@ a , an Bru@@ in@@ si train@@ er , said prior to Monday becoming Tuesday .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel outdated trends to reduce casu@@ alise the burden of players twice a day has in fact made their days long at least half @-@ yearly - at least with final extra@@ cts from Friday .
for that reason , the U@@ C@@ L@@ A &apos;s first three training sessions were ti@@ med to start at 19.@@ 15 with the need to adapt them to the already tight time@@ line of players .
the move from two people to three tre@@ draw@@ ings every day constitutes more of one election in a row : it has increased the start of the Bru@@ in@@ si train@@ er camp almost in the middle of the previous season , and for the first time in Mor@@ a &apos;s six W@@ es@@ tw@@ Medvedev po@@ t programmes during the WHO he@@ ad@@ prisoners .
they plan to reach 18 degrees until 20 August before the formal preparations for the opening play in T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M in September open .
Mor@@ a said that she was in favour of a change to the N@@ CA@@ A rules , even if this adds another item in close schedu@@ les of players .
they have a huge burden three hours or four days and this is one of a major challenges , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they are breaking through this challenge ; they are making efforts ; they are full of young people .
I believe that it is really good for us to come on Saturday and have more time . &quot;
if the camp has closed , the New C@@ L@@ A &apos;s training moves will in@@ tri@@ cate , which is no easy task at all given the clear view of their proximity from the wa@@ y@@ side station and from the outside Centre of L@@ us@@ kin@@ i , from the High classes ho@@ tels that are already at the bottom of their border loo@@ se .

it is , however , that we are using an adequate security team ; let us have that in paragraph 8 .
we shall do our utmost to use the existing ones .

Washington changes rules for a green card
media publications are cited by President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who says that a new US immigration plan is scheduled , which will change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants , for 50 000 people per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
these new rules are proposed by the Re@@ publi@@ can states , with the support of the President .
this draft law goes to discussion in two Congress cha@@ mbers .

his first trip to Si@@ beria to study lies 30 years earlier this year .
during this period , he has been there 14 times and he has lived there for a total of one year .
how much did Si@@ beria still emig@@ rated to have a living space in the late 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century ?
that is the un@@ solved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I have calculated that by the comment of Si@@ beria &apos;s men , who has come across this .
it is difficult to say what exactly is reasonably so , because up to 30 persons could then come to a Group , but a passport was granted only to a man .
only one passport was awarded but it was used by children , nur@@ ses and other pupils .
look , what a territory was with it !
it was many times greater than the historic S@@ et@@ oma@@ ka .
it was therefore necessary to educate , to manage it in some way .
the buildings came here as a farmer but changed their lives as well as being caught in territories that were not only related to agriculture , but also with the river ( problem ang@@ ling ) , with gold mines , with industry .

they are different , although what was taken here was there many times .
they brought back a great many percep@@ tions about the money .
they alone did . ( whether they were - laugh@@ ing minds ) , they always distinguish what had been mentioned here .
climate change was heavily affected by the traditional ri@@ ce of pigs , since it is sa@@ tu@@ rated here .

clear rules for handling genetically modified crops
the Ministry of Rural Affairs has sent a coordination package to the draft legislation on the release of GMOs into the environment ( GMOs ) and a draft legislation amending rules on soil protection .
the amendment to the law will lead to the abolition of the new collection of data - to be used for plant health purposes - for GM ( GM ) crops as well as for businesses .
in addition , the GM farming community manager will be subject to a prior authorisation of an active commissioner in down @-@ than @-@ fund mass beekeeping activities .
although , for the moment , no GM crops are culti@@ vated in Estonia , we consider clear rules for coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops necessary .
this is at least for as long as there are no decision to declare Estonian GMO @-@ free , &quot; S@@ ig@@ mar mouth , Head of the P@@ loom section of the Rural Ministry .
&quot; however , considering that the measures to be conceived need to be targeted and proportionate against the backdrop of both private and public sectors &quot; an excessive burden , &quot;
the draft law repe@@ als the provisions relating to the collection and processing of data from GM crop sites and street officers in the GMO &apos;s hydrogen meat area , introduces requirements regarding handling of GM crops and set up economic activities .
specifically in regard to slaughter , the current obligation for GM farmers to inform bee@@ keepers about school@@ women about the uptake of the GM crop from the start of cultivation with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the bee@@ keepers before cultivation begins .
the draft law has been sent for coordination to minis@@ tries .
all interested parties have a chance to access the content through the digital system , providing opinions to the departments of England could they wish to decide on it .
the proposed changes will impact on primarily those in the areas of plant production , bee@@ keepers and the farming sector .
in the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop , mon 8@@ 10 , is allowed to be grown .
however , so far , no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing a GM crops .
this is due to the fact that Estonia must not include a kid person , a European medium in the media and even subject to the opposite strength of mon 8@@ 10 .
then there will be this ma@@ gic line with southern regions , and it will not be appropriate for our climate conditions to do so in May .
in order to be secure , testing by the Department of Rural Affairs has been commissioned in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible harm from GM organisms in beneficiary seeds of various su@@ ch@@ ab@@ seed , maize and soya and so@@ types grown in Estonia .
the analysis of sam@@ ples taken concluded that seeds were not present among immigrants and research found that different seeds of rape , maize and soya sc@@ ales in Estonia would not contain GMOs .
such a consequence is that a cultivation of ir@@ responsibly GM crops is not raised in Estonia , or there has also been confirmation that there has been no shor@@ tening contamination .

Ro@@ yal House of White House cost taxpayers thousands !
according to the military documents that were published during the magaz@@ ines , the decision by the White House to fly an aircraft helicop@@ ter for a naval highlight of American manufacturing last month cost the south hor@@ ror taxpayers an extra EUR 24 000 mark .
the green and white colour S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , known as &apos; Sea One &apos; under President &apos;s permission of a green light , was the central gener@@ ator of the event on 17 July in White .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , senior officials of M@@ ike P@@ ence and White houses reported on the evolution of industrial products by all 50 states across the board .
the modu@@ le building by Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut was mo@@ cked with S@@ hi Loo@@ h , the fire cigarette from W@@ is@@ con@@ Cooperation and also two ble@@ ts made in Mis@@ posi@@ sia .
according to the documents of Mrs H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on one ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) , The White House &apos;s military c@@ abinet , that &apos;s to say , G@@ O , considered the presence of a helicop@@ ter to be responsible for operating a red hur@@ ry , scarcely moved by 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter bu@@ ried in the southern flo@@ til@@ la .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because this is an in@@ usually high event , in only one case where this street of H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 kom@@ and@@ ö@@ r said today , and before the event , &apos; H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 printed his fac@@ tion , the de@@ pu@@ ties of a sea@@ port &apos; , to their head of personnel in the aviation sector .
in the message , it was noted that the helicop@@ ter would arrive at 7 a.m. in the Southern ca@@ ror on 17 July morning for an event of independence ranging from 7 : 00 , then until the war broke down to 18 : 21 h@@ ent homes , which started .
an added factor was that for a fa@@ iry departure from Sweden , another thing is needed as a run@@ way thanks to restrictions on working time .
the initial flight crew was at the pressure of the solution and the security team deployed in the first run@@ way team near a plane over its entire ground .
it was not possible to read out in the documents we had during the press whether proposal two courses were necessary , must suffer after all ?
the H@@ at@@ chi Act bans federal staff from using government assets for political ends .

&apos;@@ It seems you do not have a choice , &apos; said a senior officer .
the White House declared the &apos; American &apos; officially made , and the hood law would not have covered it .

the use of a named &apos; Marine One or Air craft One &apos; for politically lu@@ cra@@ tive purposes is not a new phenomenon .

the teachers of the Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r l@@ ent an additional 11 hours &apos; time for &apos; non @-@ presidential support missions &apos; at that time .
none other than this exercise dis@@ plays taxpayers &apos; money according to the White House .
according to S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , the company was therefore not involved in public@@ ising it in the southern hor@@ ror .
the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 will not maintain the budgetary papers of President flights and the precise costs through the event will be difficult to discover .
however , according to the Ministry of Defence &apos; h@@ our@@ ly prices for the year 2017 , V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D provides for compensation of 24 $ 380 per airline .
during its initial dossier , a flight long beyond its base environment revealed 30 minutes from Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ on both sides .
the White House claims that the actual cost to use the helicop@@ ter is well below its sum .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; costs based on estimates of reimbursement is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
these estimates of reimbursement include many other irreversible costs taken into account in annual appropriations
the eGovernment survey 2015 shows that the Ministry of Defence &apos;s compensation rates do not impose human costs , but cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
shortly , Se@@ an S@@ conclusions er , former spokes@@ person for the White House , defended the use of an helicop@@ ter at the time in an event .
&quot; the point is to show things made in America this week , &quot; said S@@ pic@@ er .
and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut States are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are probably hundreds , if not even thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
and I think like most of the Americans I believe we are all proud of this helicop@@ ter and said military equipment , which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly with .
so it is certainly right to highlight this . &apos;

talk about Afghan democracy as a direct part of politics ,
an executive of the UN mission to Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections could represent the people unless all members of the population have a role to play in them , including women .
Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , leader of UN Assistance Mission , said that hundreds of women were standing for local advice elections , three women stand in candidate country elections , and more than 30 % of those who have recently been registered are women .
&quot; it is impossible to exagg@@ timate the importance of women &apos;s role by underlining it , &quot; he said in his statement on Wednesday .
the elections can only represent the people and be credible if they are fully involved and engage in all phases of the electoral process .
the outcome of local council council elections and presidential election in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban in turn have threatened the electoral process which coinci@@ des with the transitional period , in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
the election of this year is the first time that power is transferred peacefully to one of the democratically @-@ elected authorities in the next .
according to pre@@ Mavrom@@ mal , a presence of women strengthens the progress of democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the independent Afghan electoral Commission , 1.2 million registered voters of 3.@@ 6 million have been women .
the joy of distribution makes every effort made by large as well as small .
nothing less in common may be less , but with a lot of words the question of smooth interaction is a good opportunity of meeting , playing , clo@@ sen@@ ess and burden .
and what convenient solution - wherever you were in the summer , living homes are always with you and you want to remember your fine voice with keen blood .
without insu@@ lating , it makes perfect a frequent cul@@ mination game or a sli@@ pping down a country there .
all are fundamental to sta@@ ting feet and the dark , who will want to take the form of such co@@ ck@@ p@@ aste which has s@@ fu@@ n from past past days ?
it is wonderful that we take children instead of chic@@ ken !
firstly , it is secure and convenient , with a race where the speed of the rap@@ port gets slow .
while they have come home , they can also engage with quite great children .
a child rightly maintains the balance , reads the paragraphs and feels willing to have a big bet and say so .
higher children , meanwhile , may mili@@ tate .
the scale of the movement lies in place with touched land and trou@@ b@@ ling the hands .
I will keep the finger of Ho@@ ia straight , with its mini@@ mp@@ shore hard .

in addition , parents may be host to a small child and enjoy a ru@@ ler , but in fact that exercise contributes to the fu@@ n of school@@ children .

travel from the Philippines to the heart of mo@@ effici@@ ents
cl@@ ou@@ ds are the black household , which has become a distinct piece of &apos; je@@ al@@ ous@@ y &apos; in recent years , which even has to be le@@ ak@@ ed up on a hand@@ ful of smart bu@@ tch@@ ers to the back and who have been fed in extra price marks in de@@ fi@@ ance , whatever its moderate origin - every single peer has gone up to scra@@ tch .
a co@@ us@@ oph@@ ren@@ t stressed in all stories is probably one of the things that has historically existed in one &apos;s lives and terrible about having been left to lose of feeling .
it is quite simply there and , if not , then there is nothing wrong with that .
now , ceilings are off the ground , however , and mo@@ ef@@ ers have changed their mus@@ ical de@@ sig@@ ners to 000 cop@@ ies in summer instead of simple be@@ ver@@ ages .
it is not only a ghet@@ tor@@ house , however , but today it is just as popular as a street house , and we will have b@@ older women ever coming onto the office .
however , it is worth making clear at this point whether which is the case for such a summer time stipulated that the label and lap@@ top remains divided , or whether it is worth actually discrimin@@ ating slightly on some of the official domestic spring .
however , ar@@ bi@@ li@@ cal incentives in this regard have characterised the real summer love of women .
when we read home mo@@ non logistics , for example , the first thing that comes out is that mo@@ smar@@ t@@ ts@@ people will have started cooling off to their local market , acquiring a cli@@ ent that then has some backbone for a whole holiday period , and which will go hand in hand with tax@@ i , markets and also war@@ heads on the ground .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are essentially so ang@@ ry as to buy more eggs from the market selling their mus@@ cles and selling them off or hand@@ ing them away to their loyal read@@ ers .
it is worth noting that there are so many demands from the Chamber to see women , and men from sea@@ ted over the conventional world , possibly engaging everyone in a sea to have someone into fortuna@@ te ownership .
in some ways , this mad@@ ness is understandable as they are once in fashion , in which a few 10 euros in euro in li@@ mb@@ sion can be purchased on sale motion .
true , where the cle@@ ver traders have found a way of obtaining payments , they are doing this and with more hand@@ ful of luxury br@@ ands selling more nur@@ ses and months and up to EUR 1 000 .
obviously , in order for richer consumers to be unable to feel as low mor@@ bid@@ ity , who try out with some cheap do@@ gs .
for example , D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a can buy over EUR 1 000 from its shoulder .
however , between this text and the Chan@@ cel@@ len@@ ry interpretation is worth around € 6,@@ 000 .
unlike most of the mo@@ sa@@ ic buildings , though , the gar@@ ages do not inher@@ it at all from some large Bra@@ mo@@ ds while their story more distant .
it is his translation col@@ ours alleged that they come very far from the Philippines , where they were largely denial of them .
the red tape from the newspapers is there - and this has largely not been seen anywhere near the exporting business and there are more than ever seeing them .
Ad@@ mittedly , the digitisation technique dates back to the 14@@ th century and it is rather beautiful with the usual cor@@ pus .
however , as be@@ er bags are not as sets as be@@ am as chic@@ k@@ ens as fla@@ mes , they can have inc@@ iner@@ ators and other materials that make the home more person@@ alised and intelli@@ gently expensive as well .
for example , there are other particularly tr@@ end@@ matic cha@@ mbers as red thank you or mil@@ ls .
in particular , the text of the letter can be sent by actors , journalists , extensively speaking and obviously saying to the country , suddenly J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , which did not appear to be the first time since the red ru@@ g@@ ba@@ g sho@@ e was lodged .
she has offered an as@@ simil@@ ation on any kind of clothing set and she did not even consider it to do that to be a major success at the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
however , it is no smaller part first in popul@@ arity amongst journalists today that caring is dry and these unfortunately do not deserve to be ca@@ red for by special means , but it does not just do away with water and sta@@ fare a caught th@@ in .
as always with trends in the draw@@ str@@ ings , br@@ ands coming apart are with various interpretations specific to aspects .
for example , if you want , you can buy a bun@@ dled clothing reimbursement from your k@@ ings or , moreover , a tiny cur@@ se a simple nic@@ kel co@@ t .
meanwhile , it is worth remembering that the classic be@@ er region never moves from the description to the whe@@ el , it happens to see it .
but what happens to a classic bone of car@@ kage ?
for centuries , such be@@ ver@@ ages , like their wheeled ba@@ g , are frequently thrown up in public which rese@@ mble a flat from its style and is shor@@ tened , not least be@@ er .

G@@ M@@ B is worried about investments in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant
the company is awaiting a confirmation by the company company &apos;s chairman in the mature producer Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e , of long @-@ term plans which had been made at G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land says that company has kept silent on the future project project of investment at Customs fibre .
more than 500 people work in H@@ ob@@ no@@ boo@@ ts as well as in other products rich .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e holder Pla@@ dis said that they have invested more than GBP 5 million to the object over the last few years .
the staff and the trade union chairs got paid there : &apos; we are the first to hear &apos; when it changes in business .
in a letter sent to the NGO propri@@ et@@ ors , G@@ M@@ B Scotland for Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e asked for &apos; to keep a record of concerns that the financing does not serve to modernise this lin@@ d &apos; .
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said : &apos; the fact that we are unable to get clarity from the head of the object of the customs regime on the needs of business and future investment plan brings our Members to great concern .
a workforce has been made up of several generations of families here and the general community and the people around the G@@ las@@ go@@ w is very much made up of the people , as a crucial pillar for ensuring proper employment in an area with high unemployment and social exclusion .
so for jobs , wages and well @-@ being in Eastern G@@ las@@ go@@ w , and in the context of the Bre@@ x@@ t increase in living costs and the chronic decrease in production the company &quot; Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e , &quot; a thri@@ ving manufacturing business , require much more . &quot;
the Pla@@ in@@ e spokes@@ man said , &apos; The host of tariffs was written from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ mig@@ l only yesterday and the company replies directly to this case because we value active engagement with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , a regular meeting took place between workers in the Customs Partnership and representatives of the G@@ M@@ B , which discussed various problems openly .
we spoke with workers , then , that similar to all companies acting in a very competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are looking at what we do on the spot - and that very applies to all our enterprises and to all our sites - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; over GBP 5 million in recent years , we have invested over GBP 5 million in the Customs Caspian site , most frequently more in production routes and conditions in the making of operations .
we fully understand the legacy of Customs and if there is to be any change in the functioning of the object at which point we are managing , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear . &quot;
was the PS@@ G warning Barcelona three years ago for approaching Ney@@ PT ?
S@@ ga may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ core will fail in his efforts to attract Ney@@ mar to play her game by providing GBP 18@@ 9 million to enable her to be bought , but will they please warn Barcelona three years ago about this record sa@@ ga ?
this beautiful approach - which have opened the summer as a transitional window , and the L@@ ig@@ New club 1 club is eag@@ er to sha@@ ke its selling times more than doubled in the world that we have today set up last season with Paul Po@@ g@@ ba &apos;s return to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ mented GBP 89 million .
once the changeover has been completed , Ney@@ ra will also result in the most expensive global player having a professional career and wages in the world at the last paid research@@ er level , paid above GBP 500 000 per week , following taxes on the S@@ G .
Barcelona is known as &quot; hate &quot; and &quot; con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous &quot; breaking away ; although the source close to the Presidency of Ca@@ tal@@ ya shows that the club has always borne the best care since it entered San@@ to@@ te in 2013 .
however , was this an opportunity for the G@@ PS@@ G president warning the world three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City showed an interest in concluding the Bla@@ ise Agreement in 2014 , N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f severely warned all clubs that ref@@ ter for the best roles and entry into a PS@@ G .
&apos;@@ B@@ eli@@ ev@@ ed of having known that they are dealing with or dealing with our players , I stand by them and am in contact with their players at a moment that &apos; said Al @-@ Qaeda .
&quot; we will respect all clubs .
but trying to enter into an agreement with some of our players still has to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have gone over that border earlier this summer because it gave a strong impul@@ se for the PS@@ G Central channel Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
it made it clear that they will still not allow a future to leave the Italian context and that Barcelona may suffer a set@@ back as a result of this interest by eradicating one of their precious assets in the form of Ney@@ ra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t , not borders .
&quot; Bre@@ x@@ it risks really getting its w@@ edge on the ground between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Britain and Ireland &quot; said to the bar when it first visited Northern Ireland in June .
I cannot imagine who would benefit from this , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects were able to free circulation for current people and goods , saying Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders &apos; , the latter emphasised .
he allegedly said he would prefer Britain to stay part of the European Union , and they would - since they could not - be part of the Europe single market .
this would keep the current Free Trade Agreement between the Republic of Ireland and the UK .
another way which would make Britain &apos;s leaving smoo@@ ther would be by setting up a customs union between the EU and the United Kingdom clearly explained by the Ta@@ o@@ ise@@ ach .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said : &apos; I am sure we could have had this kind of agreement with Britain &apos; .
the alternative would be to return to tariff posts , declaring historical demar@@ cations and political failure .
&quot; make trade , prosperity and peace , &quot; said the Prime Minister of Ireland .
he mentioned Bre@@ x@@ ade@@ already the challenge to our generation and warned that its outcome could impact each aspect of daily life in Northern Ireland .
during his visit to Bel@@ fast , Irish Prime Minister met leaders of the main parties .
