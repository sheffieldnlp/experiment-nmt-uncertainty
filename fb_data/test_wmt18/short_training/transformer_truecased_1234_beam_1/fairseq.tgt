four members of the C@@ abinet Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to the Posselt , in Spain , the police detained the leader of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape K@@ alli@@ ro@@ vo Group &apos; in Estonia , S@@ pin@@ Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , who is known as S@@ pin@@ K@@ Cape ro@@ v@@ ski in the criminal world .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch arrested in Spain was arrested at the court &apos;s permission .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
it is suspected that the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde &apos; criminal community is members of the so @-@ called &apos; 27 @-@ 57 years &apos; , who commit mainly drug crimes .
in the province of M@@ ala Mi@@ ja@@ s in Spain , the alleged head of criminal community was detained .
three men were detained in Estonia as a suspect , one of them collected according to the figures , as a criminal community leader , and two are members of criminal community .
the data collected indicates that tasks and roles had been clearly divided in the criminal community .
the purpose of criminal activities was to commit drug crimes and thus to earn criminal proceeds , &quot; commented on the head of the criminal proceedings , Public Prosecutor Va@@ ila Ver@@ te .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; added the Prosecutor .
it is people who have previously been interested in law enforcement law enforcement , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Ver@@ te stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common@@ place for us , and the weekly operation shows that cooperation is successful , &quot; said Public Prosecutor Ver@@ te .
the head of the central police service , ago in Le@@ is , said that detention was preceded by a study lasting almost one and a half years .
&quot; in the first half of the week , we had a long history of work and were simultaneously suspected of committing crimes in Estonia and Spain , &quot; said : &quot;
in Le@@ is , the central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now we have a good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civil card .
these arrests are yet another message to criminals that we get them from another European end , &quot; said Le@@ is .
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that , when there is a doubt , the men who have been suspected of continuing to commit new crimes , which is why the prosecution service has requested their arrest and also approved by the court .
the man arrested in Spain expects him to be handed over to Estonia .
property , vehicles and cash are being seized to ensure confiscation in this criminal case .
the criminal prosecution procedure is carried out by the central criminal police organised crime office and is led by the prosecution service .
the city of Tallinn Tribunal in 2005 convicted S@@ pin@@ Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch of blackmail and punished him with five years imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ š@@ it was held second in Estonia &apos;s criminal world after the Mar@@ ty@@ r@@ ali@@ r of the time , Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , from Cape Verde , appeared in the Estonian alli@@ ge at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Ad@@ mittedly , he taxed tax@@ i and prostitution on various ho@@ tels and ordered a monthly ro@@ tation tax on business@@ men .
international joint operations , confiscation of proceeds of crime and the entry into force of court decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest judgments , the eight accused of a criminal offence in the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ y@@ ni@@ c Community , who seized EUR 80 000 in criminal proceeds , or the verdict against nine persons , in 2006 , Ig@@ or Alex@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v created a criminal association aimed at illegal trafficking of illegal cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in Eastern Vir@@ u@@ land and southern Estonia .
the confis@@ cated criminal profits are worth almost EUR 71 500 .
in these criminal cases , it has been successful that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and , if necessary , that they do business in any European Union country .
civil Liberties Group war@@ ns of Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ se travel
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ ancient People of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ Nicaragua ) has warned the people of the Muslim Muslim people travelling to the Mis@@ sou@@ la for discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the State .
the Group &apos;s statement states : &apos; The NA@@ SR issued for the State of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ a , which applies until 28 August 2017 , calls on all American passengers , visitors and sou@@ ls to be particularly attentive and very careful when moving around the country , given the suspi@@ cious racial events that have taken place recently and also been highlighted here &apos; .
according to NA@@ UT@@ S , the group urged both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that the country &apos;s regular police protection targets are , in large part , minorities .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are violated .
they are being dri@@ ed because of their sk@@ in colour , beaten or killed , &quot; said R@@ os Cha@@ pel , President of NA@@ SR .
&quot; we have never received such complaints so closely before . &quot;
this is the first warning issued by the organisation for the US state .
the group referred to events such as racist insul@@ ts against mus@@ ici@@ ans &apos; students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black S@@ and@@ er@@ si .
S@@ and@@ ers died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , after he was beaten by the state in the petrol sector and the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police arrested without being accused of a crime .
furthermore , the report recently compiled by the Chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i shows that the national flag state is likely to stop the cars of black drivers by 75 % more likely than white drivers .
&apos;@@ A comment is designed to make people aware and to warn their families , friends and collabor@@ ators about what might happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&apos;@@ People must be ready , whether it means taking fu@@ n money or informing relatives that they cross the state &apos; .
the latest figures from F@@ B@@ I &apos;s programme for information on hate crime were documented in 2015 in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is , which puts the state in the 16@@ th national position in the country in the number of similar offences .
the travel warning is also a response to the new Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it difficult for the company to refer to court for reasons of discrimination in search of housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( American Civil Guard Union ) had previously issued travel barriers for T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona following the adoption of immigration laws by those states , which obliged local authorities to arrest people for infringements in immigration , because according to AC@@ L@@ U , this increases racial profiling .
usually , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is issuing warnings on other countries , but recently , interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter@@ reaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or inc@@ iner@@ ator , may be caused by five different types of he@@ pati@@ tis A , B , C , D and E .
all these vir@@ uses highlight the acute bur@@ st of the li@@ ver &apos;s homes .
however , the average cost is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B and C , which can develop further into the li@@ ver &apos;s cir@@ cus , the tax@@ i@@ on@@ ist and the li@@ ver .
the epidemi@@ ology of the health profession , Ku@@ nil@@ ine@@ r , talks about the fact that acute he@@ pati@@ tis disease is the same in all types of sk@@ im@@ med infection - f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ gue , E@@ mb@@ rance , o@@ in@@ isation , s@@ pati@@ tis , air pain , grey emissions , horse mackerel , meat and asylum pain , and the collapse of s@@ wine and li@@ mas@@ ters .
the last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of the li@@ ver bur@@ nt @-@ up disease .
children can undergo he@@ pati@@ tis without disease .
the various types of heat can only be determined on the basis of laboratory research data .
Al@@ le@@ r@@ ally can be converted into chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and decades without disease phenomena , meaning that man may not know anything about his or her dangerous illness .
Mr Ku@@ nil@@ r highlights various forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their cul@@ mination more closely .
E@@ he@@ pati@@ tis virus infections are spread from a disease to human consumption and infec@@ t us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , via se@@ als , from infected person &apos;s emissions to hands and from hand foodstuffs , soils , objects , contact and consumption of drugs .
the risk of infection , or the risk of a disease , and the care of the risk of infection , chronic pay , sex people with infected infection , sex men , drug users , the high @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis A , people who visit the countries .
vaccination can be prevented , in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling a lot and at the risk group A he@@ pati@@ tis .
furthermore , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands , before eating food , to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
H@@ pati@@ tis virus infections spread to the circulation of human blood , drugs inc@@ in@@ eration , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tion , au@@ g@@ mentation , blood @-@ contaminated fo@@ d@@ der ( too@@ th@@ me@@ ters , pregnancy tools ) , don@@ ator blood , he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ bul@@ l@@ ors &apos; person sex and inf@@ pati@@ tis disease from inf@@ pati@@ tis to animal fo@@ e@@ tal disease .
the Group of the he@@ pati@@ tis infection includes drugs , sex partners of infected person , sex men , inf@@ ant inf@@ ant mother with a person infected , family members and carers , health care , rescue workers and police officers , and people visiting countries with high @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis B diseases .
in order to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis , people can be vacc@@ inated ; in particular , it recommends vaccination for people at risk , as well as chronic pay @-@ related , HIV @-@ infection , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
there is a he@@ pati@@ tis cure for other preventive measures : prevention of the use of hygiene and man@@ ure , other sharp tools and need@@ les , need@@ les , pro@@ phy@@ to@@ isation and honour rape , and use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection or prevention of sexual risk .
vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis V is part of the National Im@@ mun@@ isation Scheme and free of charge for children in Estonia .
He@@ pati@@ tis virus infections spread to the person involved in the circulation of blood , in the inc@@ in@@ eration of drugs , in in@@ eration , in au@@ g@@ mentation , in the use of blood contaminated fo@@ e@@ der , in the use of donor blood , in sex with he@@ pati@@ o @-@ sa@@ vi@@ c people and in the sick of he@@ pati@@ tis disease .
the risk group of he@@ pati@@ tis C infections includes drugs , sex partners of infected person , sex men , inf@@ ant inf@@ ant mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , people with HIV infections and people with high @-@ suff@@ e@@ rers , and passengers visiting the countries with he@@ pati@@ tis C .
the preventive measure of he@@ pati@@ tis C is : prevention of the use of xenophobia in the event of a dangerous comp@@ ound infection , other sharp and heart @-@ cell and need@@ les , need@@ iner@@ ator and honour and con@@ d@@ oms .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
the he@@ pati@@ tis tis D virus is caused by he@@ pati@@ tis B@@ ish@@ y virus , which is much more in the presence of the he@@ pati@@ tis B virus .
as a result , D@@ he@@ pati@@ tis B@@ he@@ pati@@ tis infections , together with he@@ pati@@ tis B or super@@ inf@@ ant , occur on chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B suff@@ e@@ rers .
H@@ pati@@ tis virus infections spread from exposure to blood and other body liquid , contaminated sy@@ stal@@ ls to need@@ les , relatives and rarely infected animals .
the he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ sur@@ ger@@ y is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B virus prote@@ ins and people who do not have immunity from he@@ pati@@ tis B .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination with he@@ pati@@ tis B vaccines , which also protects people from infection with the he@@ pati@@ tis D virus .
E@@ he@@ pati@@ tis virus infections spread by fe@@ u@@ dal means of drinking water and food , including low heat @-@ treated beef , fish and marine car@@ ro@@ ts , donor blood , psy@@ chi@@ ps and more infected animals .
passengers may be infected with high levels of E he@@ pati@@ tis disease in countries .
E@@ he@@ pati@@ tis preventive measures are compliance with hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands after the horse , before food production and eating , after care for the disease .
F@@ ru@@ its and vegetables are was@@ hing before consumption , avoiding eating little hot meat , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , as a result of which only safe drinking water and preventing drug consumption .
although the last round of competitors tried to printing four times the Olympic winner , 34 years of F@@ ara@@ h &apos;s final day saw the power of F@@ ara@@ h and won 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
F@@ ara@@ h did not think long , bringing the hus@@ band T@@ ania and children to their own path after the fin@@ alist fin@@ ch .
this was a special moment for me .
I am very much an advocate of my family .
being with them was wonderful , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h to journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h is focusing its fifth edition in London on the gol@@ den du@@ mp of 5,000 and 10 000 metres of the run@@ way .
everything is possible if it is believed .
despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ norm in Da@@ am gold , G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri &apos;s portfolio , has a special story of &apos; sy@@ non@@ ymous with one art works &apos; , much deeper than the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna .
but more deeply in history .
the anthem &apos;s inf@@ er@@ rant gold , the s@@ le@@ ep in the be@@ ach , the narro@@ w@@ ly subject being put on the top of the title , would have been to have more influence on the extraordinary portfolio .
at the moment , there would be a double book between some of the C@@ ub@@ ans : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti and his pain@@ ting , Da@@ am gold , the story of A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer , and a much more extensive and comprehensive history of H@@ on@@ ourable families and the German occupation , with its aftermath in Austria .
the first third of the book leads to the flou@@ ris@@ hing cultural life of Vienna , who himself entered the Austrian capital , could hardly imagine how life was going around R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ s more than a hundred years ago or how all its head was turned when the climate inva@@ ded .
the concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe &apos;s rich@@ est cities and the name familiar with the book , as if you see it , it was more cultural to quote a gram .
however , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a city where the vo@@ id ar@@ son and the highest level of suicide in Europe were not adding anything to development .
or perhaps , however , every couple of pa@@ tern@@ alistic pain@@ ting dri@@ ves adds a colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in the last decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had explo@@ ded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
the S@@ aj@@ an@@ di@@ tis was a person of nearly one in ten in Vienna .
parents were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time the A@@ rad relief was launched twice in the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ ad Fer@@ din@@ ja B@@ lo@@ ch and Climate for his famous pain@@ ting , his father had become the seventh largest bank in H@@ ab@@ s@@ bur@@ sts .
however , the whole life of the gla@@ ci@@ ers to which he belon@@ ged did not take the lead .
if you look at the &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end @-@ of @-@ life infection was more like a kind of c@@ ron@@ e of soci@@ alism and dre@@ am@@ t of travel to the Soviet Union .
for 19@@ 0@@ 3rd , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s luggage from Climate K@@ ong , the pain@@ ting mak@@ er in Vienna was the last moment .
the Climate K@@ IC paid 4 000 kro@@ ons at the time , a quarter of the price of a good @-@ place rural house .
the fact that some sports cre@@ ws were suspected of a mo@@ del@@ li of a mas@@ ter was not intimi@@ dated by sugar s@@ tun@@ na@@ tis .
as far as the dele@@ gate is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between mo@@ del@@ li and the ar@@ tist created during the work continued to reach life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; .

shortly before the start of the work with A@@ dele@@ ja , the climate had been visited Ra@@ ven@@ na San V@@ ita@@ le in basi@@ beria and the investi@@ g@@ ators think that it was precisely there that the g@@ ul@@ li@@ ous mo@@ sa@@ ic countries E@@ rin@@ na The@@ o@@ dor@@ t gave the ar@@ tist the idea of making a gol@@ den portfolio called A@@ dele@@ dele@@ dele@@ dele@@ r a a mo@@ sa@@ ic .
the climate presented in his Da@@ am gold , Vienna in 19@@ 08 , and around the same time ( 19@@ 07 @-@ 19@@ 08 ) , one of the gol@@ den ter@@ restri@@ al land was born .
art his@@ tori@@ ans were not left un@@ noticed by the simil@@ arities of two women .
how are Hitler connected with nature ?
&quot; I think I owe him to make his hand publicly available to the public , &quot; said A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer a few years after his departure ( Climate U died in February 19@@ 18 ) to the Director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere muse@@ um and wanted their family Climate K@@ af@@ m@@ ti to go to the mus@@ cle of the city of the city of Or@@ m@@ ti .
six years before the death , the customer had completed a succession of A@@ dele@@ st K@@ üh@@ ga .
in his wil@@ ls ( A@@ del fleeing in February 19@@ 25 ) , she also asked her hus@@ band to leave his two sports courses and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti landsca@@ pes to Gal@@ eri in Austria .
his founding fathers inh@@ eri@@ ted him to the sis@@ ter of Mari@@ ana and Lu@@ da .
one year after the Climate Minister had finished the &apos; Austrian Mon@@ a &apos; annex , Vi@@ in Ka@@ carri@@ art de A@@ ka@@ de@@ mine had attempted to get 17 @-@ year @-@ old Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , but failed in the drawing .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is considered to be the cause of the Jewish profes@@ sors not accepting him in the a@@ ca@@ de@@ my , none of his ex@@ ca@@ the@@ irs were actually Jewish .
in any case , the Austrian Gal@@ Special Undertaking &apos;s mission for 19@@ 39 had changed considerably , as referred to in Mrs Gal@@ eria , which had become important for finding decent works for the Ma@@ ci@@ ras of the rich Jewish Jewish arts in Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal artistic mus@@ cle was also home to some work for A@@ s , but not for the climate .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the night of the Nazi arts , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old trial dispute between the Austrian Government and the B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ kers was launched .
it should be noted here that if the &apos; novel &apos; is seen in Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle in Vienna , the Da@@ am gold , which is portra@@ yed by A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer , must be seen as &apos; trip to New York to the Ne@@ ue Gal@@ eri .
and before the Vienna Times , the aforementioned book will be read .
even if you do not plan to take the climate &apos;s work , because at least my emo@@ tions came across more laugh@@ ing and Jewish issues after the closure of the book than the Ma@@ in and mode@@ ll A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer , sold for USD 135 million .
so not so much a mar@@ ks@@ cre@@ w , rather a gay E@@ mb@@ assy - and a very moving story .
the gender pu@@ mps of the Bauer people who were brought to the beginning of the book were considerably facilitated by events .
17 @-@ year @-@ old sw@@ im@@ ming in Canada was very close to the Estonian Re@@ ba@@ te .
in E@@ el@@ el@@ les , gold was very close to the personal record of the pig meat sw@@ am@@ ping of its 200 m of meat .
the Ti@@ pp@@ mark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ old pi@@ pes since the Canadian Ju@@ tu@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ ship contest ran by 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 , the Pri@@ it A@@ av@@ nik U@@ ju@@ gation block .
gold last esca@@ ped , or perhaps ten years , A to finish .
in Fin@@ ally , he went through his distance to 2.@@ 15.@@ 76 and achieved a good 7th seat with a new powerful peak .
Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) , which is due to A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or@@ n , remained just over half a second .
the gold third edition of all the time saw the Estonian gold increase and its fresh top @-@ level mark is the fifth ever result of Estonia .
the young hope for the future is the launch of Canadian adult Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships of 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in bal@@ tu@@ tion and 200 m@@ m@@ m@@ m and 400 m@@ m in bun@@ dling .
last week , Canada &apos;s Ju@@ tu@@ als &apos; champi@@ on@@ ships took place in Tu@@ on@@ to , and gold also took successful start there .
he won 200 m in bal@@ fire with a sil@@ ver man &apos;s time of 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
this distance was so quickly sw@@ am@@ ped by a previous resort in 2008 .
Estonia has only distan@@ ced itself from the record Estonian B@@ SE faster than the Gol@@ den era .
a vibran@@ t Canadian champion won a further 100 m v@@ ou@@ cher in bal@@ tu@@ lation with an excellent personal record and 5@@ 6.@@ 66 in Estonia .
for example , her year &apos;s old mother , Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k , has distan@@ ced it by just one century .
he reached a further 100 m wall of university in the opening of the notification of the pu@@ b in the course of 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 .
for half a long distance , he won only the seventh seat when he s@@ le@@ ep in the final assembly of 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
gold is currently leading the Estonian fer@@ ry tables at four different distance .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics insu@@ red teet@@ h
the holiday season is in hand - that is , the break with the President of the United States Donald T@@ ru@@ l .
however , since the T@@ ru@@ mp has been one of the most holi@@ da@@ y@@ makers , critics are already we@@ aring teet@@ h .
according to US theory and the CN@@ N , the President intends to have 17 days &apos; leave in the can@@ na@@ bis in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster@@ is , which is located in New Jer@@ se@@ ys .
although President leave began yesterday , the anti @-@ T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has been speaking for weeks .
they are asking the P@@ ho@@ to@@ man to be too frequent to be clean@@ ed .
it is precisely that the President will have a week of time in his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey in the cotton .
incidentally , the T@@ ru@@ mp has not clean@@ ed the President for its 19@@ 6 working days .
for example , Mr Bush had already had 67 days on holiday for that period , with Barack Obama hal@@ ving the number of T@@ ru@@ mp , for just 21 days .
but the Olympic world tends to forget things quickly .
the days after becoming President , T@@ ru@@ mp in the T@@ ru@@ t gave the green light to say that there will be no time for a holiday for his ame@@ tri@@ ct , because a great deal needs to be done .
he also expressed his outra@@ ge about Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
the current President wrote on Twitter : &apos; while Obama has a holiday , plays gol@@ f , the brak@@ es and the j@@ ä@@ ss@@ ers are on the front , journalists in the country are pul@@ ling their heads off the fire &apos; .
according to the officials of the White House , 17 days of gol@@ f club visit to pol@@ len is not a bet@@ ra@@ p .
it is officially called &apos; working leave &apos; , during which the T@@ ru@@ l has no time to read or to take other pro @-@ sporting activities .
furthermore , there was also a second reason for working leave .
it is precisely that the western system of the White House &apos;s retirement is changed and that all staff had to leave it .
the West Bank is also located in O@@ val@@ ka@@ ts@@ t and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not think that anyone else would like to be in the West in August if there were 38 degrees and no con@@ glom@@ era@@ tes , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the white house spokes@@ man , who stressed that the President would continue to work during his leave .
if President T@@ ru@@ mp goes to 17 days , you will get an idea of video .
blocking critics from Facebook to 07 do not stand for national positions if you do not tolerate the voices of the voters .
the father of our country knew so much about the unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved Mr Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to get him to be bul@@ li@@ ed for everything from internal politics to his political principles .
of course , the criticism upset him .
but he did not make his critics quiet .
because , in 17@@ 83 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and , more quickly and in silence , we could be chaired by sheep on slaugh@@ ter@@ houses &apos; .
this brings me to Mrs Ho@@ gan , the Governor of Mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s ku@@ p , who has to be struggling to be more in Washington .
the organisers &apos; sub@@ missions have blocked and era@@ sed at least 450 people who expressed their views on their official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the American Civil Liberties Union ( American Civil Guard Union ) therefore brought the case to the courts .
the Ku@@ ber@@ ner official &apos;s office pa@@ ved the action empty and web commen@@ ta@@ tes s@@ lide from reactions in a style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos;
&apos;@@ This is just Facebook , &apos; many people said .
but that counts .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
it is an overwhelming democratic state of popular Re@@ publi@@ can .
his approval percentage is the second best place among the 50 Governor of the country .
Ho@@ gan is not a reac@@ tive sight .
he has led the state firmly and remains strictly firm in his principles .
furthermore , he has used her top tool to communicate with his constituents quite deliberately Facebook , presenting his own b@@ rick head , for the first time after the chemical waste .
therefore , the website of the Governor , appearing on the official marking , is a public forum managed by the staff who pay taxpayers &apos; dollars to the people who visit Kenya , and ultimately dangerous .
the K@@ end@@ ar@@ dent spokes@@ person , Ame@@ lia Ch@@ asse , defended the behaviour of the Governor in an interview given to Washington &apos;s Posselt , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than mode@@ recasting .
but it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet brow@@ sing online , cutting down internet brow@@ sers , or people full of hatred .
the post was inter@@ viewed with a number of people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
this is what they are , in fact , the people who are in possession of elected leaders . the teacher , the owner of the company and the passport , and not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thought @-@ out and not ro@@ p@@ aste .
Pas@@ tor quoted milk in his post , underlining the Catholic movement of Ho@@ gan .
the lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not inci@@ te hatred but rather hate crime .
&quot; I have poli@@ tely commented that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; he wrote the post news story in the Annex to the country .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , if many people comment on the same subject , some of them are now in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably calling it a collective effort rather than acknowledging that it is a great deal of concern for citizens . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s official called &apos; targeted jun@@ k attack &apos; would probably be invited by others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the age of Facebook allows messages to easily be mat@@ ised by simply blocking criticism or dele@@ ting negative comments .
it is much cleaner than the old one when it was necessary to send out workers to do the same , to gather and bur@@ y critical edit@@ orial newspapers and to hold them up or arrest the prote@@ sters and force them to remain silent .
but that is exactly what is happening now , just digital .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media too@@ th@@ less .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has brought Twitter users to court who have been blocked from Twitter &apos;s bed .
one of the first key judgments on this matter was made last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is , the US &apos;s Chief Executive Board , decided in Alexand@@ ria that the director of the Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i Coun@@ ty Board breached the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the vo@@ ter on Facebook page .
in K@@ tu@@ ck@@ y , the Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in@@ it ( R ) also visited AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter for use .
this should not be so difficult .
in Washington , affordable postal costs had similar effects to those on the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters were dis@@ pel@@ led by his way of leadership .
even then , Washington had to face anon@@ ymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers from pseu@@ do @-@ uni@@ on@@ ms like Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , making the decisions of Washington pain@@ fully rec@@ ou@@ ped .
according to historical documents compiled by the Water @-@ based George Washington magaz@@ ine , he bur@@ ned his c@@ abinet in petitions criticising his views on the British bro@@ therhood , Trade and shipping agreements .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , opinions and debates are fundamental pillars of our country .
and proper management means accepting it .

&quot; I saw R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ance C@@ lu@@ b built and now we see the club s@@ inging in full with this event , &quot; said R@@ aff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; players see the path in their best shape , it is in a perfect state .
Jer@@ ry has done an excellent job in setting up this place .
he is a keen supporter of gol@@ f games and proud of what has been achieved .
this will allow the best possible presentation of the path . &quot;
Ing@@ an ever looks forward to the first time that he can defend the title , even though the man has won both European Tou@@ der and the European challenge in his 32 @-@ year career .
&apos;@@ This is a very special feeling , &apos; said Se@@ th@@ por@@ tis &apos;s be@@ ating player .
&quot; I could not defend my Ex@@ t@@ rema@@ du@@ ra O@@ range , because it was taken away from my competition calendar one year after my victory .
it is a mathema@@ tical matter to come back to this chic@@ ken .
this is a great place for gol@@ f playing .
I remember the memor@@ ies of last year , for my wife and for my wife , Mrs Shar@@ on , the victory of last year was a special one .
it was a very special time that we will always be in the heart of our hearts . &quot;
G@@ ary Or@@ r , who joined the European Works Agency later this year when he received 50 , will return to the competition on the ground of his country .
it is his first event in Scotland since the participation of A@@ ber@@ de@@ en profitable Management Scottish O@@ pen@@ il in 2013 .
&quot; it is always a little more significant to play at home , &quot; said Hel@@ en@@ s@@ bur@@ gh , Or@@ r .
&quot; the Ta@@ ks well , but also the extra feeling .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and quite rightly demonstrated gol@@ f games .
I am pleased to see things moving so far . &quot;

&apos;@@ nobody da@@ res to go around after 5 o &apos;@@ clock in the village &apos; , &apos; he says .
it is a rare pil@@ o@@ k in Papua mä@@ ki , a former Dutch col@@ ony which was inter@@ cep@@ ted in Indonesia in 19@@ 69 following a referendum which only made 10 @-@ 26 older people vote in front of the forces .
the Dutch people &apos;s movement , released from the rule of the Netherlands , is encouraging their ra@@ ils to the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta Government , which is still holding the region under its strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors from being expelled .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into a P@@ ope and western P@@ ope , so independent Papua New Guinea remained eastern of the island .
the majority is both a remote and a backward seat , and a five @-@ hour journey from the province capital Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ u , which then makes it possible to fly to N@@ abi@@ mel , is the same as the one that is set up to commemorate the ren@@ tal car .
there is no public transport .
the city of approximately 19 000 inhabitants consists of ca@@ ts surrounded by car@@ mb@@ s and covers la@@ in@@ in@@ ous iron ro@@ ckets , which have been transformed into different ru@@ ins .
very few indicators have taken the road here , not to mention journalists , nor have there been almost any foreigners here .
before the Christian mission@@ aries came , Me@@ e P@@ ago pa@@ ints were mar@@ ched by the S@@ ik@@ hs with the name of T@@ ame@@ e .
there were other changes .
&apos;@@ We were not used to wear such clothing &apos; says De@@ ge@@ i , referring to the &apos; w@@ ire @-@ hun@@ ted &apos; of your colour @-@ ro@@ tation , the &apos; dark plu@@ g and the English &apos; .
&quot; before that , we only had a plant cow in the body . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the most poor province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
but it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
just 100 km away from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , a mountainous province of around 153 000 inhabitants of New Jer@@ sey , the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world is G@@ ras@@ berg , which belongs to the company F@@ bet@@ por@@ ana Mc@@ Mor@@ an , which operates in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x@@ is .
in 2015 alone , F@@ re@@ re@@ export from this place amounted to about USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ per .
furthermore , it is possible to con@@ serve imports of raw wood , worth which it is estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are the source of suffering for pa@@ ints , which are causing a stif@@ ling presence of a powerful Iranian army .
the 2005 study by the New York Times showed that F@@ re@@ re@@ export paid about USD 20 million to local troops and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including USD 150 000 to one of the victims .
the attempts of the P@@ ope to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den h@@ all and is se@@ am@@ lessly bet@@ ra@@ yed .
human rights activists say that more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 59 and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Iranian army .
according to the Asian Committee on Human Rights , the massacre in the moun@@ tains of the genocide in Papua tri@@ bal countries in the 1970s was a measure of genocide .
last year alone , over 3@@ 900 peaceful prote@@ sters were arrested by the Iranian police in the region .
the 2016 report of the Grand Pri@@ x of Bir@@ s@@ b@@ ane Dis@@ tri@@ ct , entitled &apos; We shall lose all &apos; , contains testi@@ mony to the atrocities committed last year , such as extra@@ judicial executions , torture ( one second report shows that rape and power shocks are particularly widespread ) and the brutal repression of peaceful protests .
&quot; it is difficult to read the number of victims , because such incidents occur every week , &apos; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , a research@@ er of Human Rights Watch , Indonesia .
the cor@@ ps have been tightened up even more strongly , as Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new set@@ tle@@ rs from other Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing , as the Indon@@ esi@@ an people , Mr Jaa@@ va , Mr Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Mrs Su@@ ma@@ tra and the S@@ ula@@ w@@ es Islands are arriving at black economic migrants .
P@@ rin@@ ce riding shops are selling a k@@ bal@@ be@@ y and mi@@ xing vegetables to ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do , which are st@@ olen along with ground level .
they cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started selling more cheap@@ ly than local boats in the traditional market , &quot; &quot; said Androulla Andersson born in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , who came to the capital of the province of Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ tis , who worked in the name of her work .
&apos;@@ The Latvian pa@@ int Mercedes Tech@@ ma@@ ma @-@ Ma@@ ma &#91; women &#93; is therefore losing its market share &apos; .
the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , who is known to the people as Jo@@ ko@@ w , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to address these inequalities and human rights violations in P@@ ope .
the former pu@@ b won 27 constitu@@ encies , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , on his way to the presidential Pal@@ ace of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta .
but the P@@ ope has changed very little and the local feel chea@@ ted .
&quot; our hearts have been broken , because in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes with regard to restoring justice , &quot; says apprenticeships .
in fact , only two months after the entry into office of Jo@@ ko@@ w in October , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i was barely affected .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children s@@ inging from the ro@@ ta@@ il to Christmas when two Indon@@ esi@@ ans were s@@ tun@@ ned by the dark motor@@ te@@ way .
children who came to justice told them they should include the front lights .
according to the local pas@@ tor Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ eba@@ i , one of the soldiers insul@@ ted their tone and returned later to four soldiers .
victims and specta@@ tors say that in the &apos; drink @-@ driving &apos; , soldiers were trying to take children away and hiding them with their gun@@ s .
then one of the soldiers shot among children .
one child , 16 years old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , was so bru@@ tally beaten that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , the building of the close electoral Commission was bur@@ nt and things were even more es@@ cor@@ ted next day .
some 1 000 young people gathered in the football pit@@ ch in front of the local police and military command centre to claim justice .
they carried out direct repair chi@@ ps and presented a ma@@ b pa@@ go tri@@ mming a wa@@ ita tan@@ ts@@ u in which poultry s@@ ongs were bu@@ ried and bu@@ ried .
some prote@@ sters started to le@@ cture the police and the military .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen the crow@@ d is more than three times resistance , let them down , &apos; the official document , which has seen the magaz@@ ine time but has not been issued to local media publications , &apos; .
the mother of the city of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ me ( 56 ) , felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking the public to go home .
nobody had the will to listen .
&quot; turning around me , I was shot in the left , saying &apos; he said time at night in his private col@@ ours at the blood of a t@@ ree .
Ka@@ y@@ are still not aware who was shot , but says that the troops &apos; troops &apos; troops &apos; sta@@ ged in the month came from .
&apos;@@ There was a lot of people , a lot of swe@@ et , &apos; adds it .
the local man , Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , was shot at his gun@@ s three times , according to a pu@@ p@@ pet .
&quot; I would expect him and I watched him through his body to make sure that he is a man , &quot; said the magaz@@ ine holiday syn@@ n@@ ically in Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who use only one name as many indicators .
&quot; I saw he dead ... S@@ novel le@@ w . &quot;
the Chief Police officer Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende said to the repor@@ ters that he was only putting his own department under the security of his or her services , because it was attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when we are threatened with killing , &quot; said Vice @-@ President P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , the spokes@@ man of the Police Service in Papua SI in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prote@@ sters were killed and injured .
the news of the killings arrived in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta@@ il only on the next day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ wi Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ras made a passion@@ ate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses to be dealt with in P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that he would establish an alternative mechanism for dealing with human rights crimes .
but almost immediately the ex@@ cus@@ es were also followed .
&quot; most crimes happened a long time ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and early 200@@ 0s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
however , when speaking at the moment at Christmas 5 June in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to with@@ drew his words by saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in P@@ ope .
instead , he said &apos; everything is resolved by law &apos; .
the W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been accused by the UN of committing crimes against human rights , with more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the bloody referendum on independence in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in P@@ ope , including what happened in P@@ ani@@ a@@ is .
the families of the victims of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i adopted such statements with a g@@ loom@@ y disregard .
&quot; I have been inter@@ ro@@ gated four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&apos;@@ I am ti@@ red &apos; .
he says that he is still living in fear for years later .
&apos;@@ I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&quot; I am afraid that the army is ar@@ resting me , I am afraid I am shot . &quot;
he confirmed his view that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i fear this incident .
he said that he had got the army out of the hand after helping to bur@@ y four victims .
&quot; after bur@@ ying the bodies , I was had to be looked by the army , &apos; he says .
the celeb@@ rations have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the people of the Egyptian police were shot in the neighbouring P@@ ani@@ a@@ i in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i .
one person was killed and 17 injured , including children , when he went to a war between the residents of the villages and the head of the construction company who refused to transport an un@@ conscious man to hospital .
this male people , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ w@@ ned in a ne@@ ar@@ by sea in the se@@ ar@@ by , died on the way to hospital .
the recent inhabitants of villages prote@@ sted on a construction site before the company office .
the police said that the village &apos;s inhabitants were le@@ c@@ turing police officers to be st@@ oned , which was last answered by warning children .
but local claims that mobile British people ( the Iranian military police ) started shooting at the people , killing one person .
&quot; we were very panic , we are afraid of reven@@ ge , &quot; said Assis@@ tant Dom@@ ing@@ les Ba@@ den , who lives near the hospital and saw injured in@@ sec@@ tici@@ des .
&quot; I have beaten myself in my house for two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the police mobile British hybrid from the area .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ i has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development is feeding the dis@@ satisfaction of the me@@ als , m@@ oni , dan@@ n and da@@ m@@ mal tri@@ bes living in the central mountainous land of Papua hal@@ j@@ enda@@ enda@@ eva .
many of them have joined the People &apos;s army of the Liber@@ ation of Papua gene@@ rously ( V@@ PL ) Per@@ bels , which , according to its own , protects the rights of pa@@ int tanks , by or@@ dering attacks and abduc@@ tion by Iranian soldiers .
some of the V@@ PL &apos;s leadership comes from P@@ ani@@ a@@ ia , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ g and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , over the last few years , the army has arrested in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , under the pretext of defending the sovereignty of the state , and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them will never again appear .
among the people of Papua gene@@ y , P@@ ani@@ ans are known as &apos; tragic forgotten place &apos; .
poverty is a source of dis@@ satisfaction .
the little ri@@ ce that is sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
the Lei@@ b is the same un@@ available .
people themselves grow all their food , mainly from Bahrain , with a little more fruit and vegetables .
farming is a job for women , each of whom can care for four or five of the Bah@@ a &apos;@@ clock .
they usually keep most of the recei@@ pt of the family , the rest is sold on the local market .
ten Bah@@ á &apos;@@ s pay only 10 000 Indon@@ esi@@ an premises ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities between the heavy pa@@ int trees and the new migrants who have arrived in a row since the opening of new routes at N@@ ab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
P@@ ope themselves often lacks capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the village because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , President of the Council of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ bal tri@@ bal Council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world out of the P@@ ope .
furthermore , there are tight restrictions on foreign media .
French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ bridge L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were expelled earlier this year because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they had been given a rare film permit .
the Vice @-@ President of the Human Rights Watch Asian department , P@@ ich@@ m K@@ ine , said that the election pledges made by Jo@@ ko@@ w have not been implemented to lift the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development .
&quot; journalists who are trying to report from the most peaceful provinces in the East of Papua Hel@@ esi@@ a and the Western P@@ ope are threatening new threats to the rejection and black@@ list of Yemen , &quot; said in his statement .
the lack of a satellite watch on the press means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esi@@ an Government is largely limited to Papua San Suu Kyi .
in March , six Pacific countries , Bahrain , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ pain , Mar@@ shall Islands and Sol@@ om@@ on Islands , urged the UN Human Rights Council to examine &apos; various large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in P@@ har@@ lia , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the same countries have also supported the V@@ PL historically .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r he@@ itis charges by the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , saying to the press : &apos; in Indonesia , democracy and freedom of the press still exist so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bur@@ y &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to be taken into account .
when the Dutch official delegation visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ rat , the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , K@@ ees , on 4 May , the local people inter@@ rupt the meeting but wanted to be anon@@ ymous with the source , saying they were anxious to remain silent , urging that &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , there will be new presidential elections in 2019 , but the pa@@ ints do not believe they will vote again in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w .
&quot; Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man with good intentions , but people around him who are involved in fir@@ ing P@@ ani@@ a@@ i say Ho@@ ba@@ i , President of the Council of the tri@@ bal tri@@ bal people .
he wants to give Jo@@ ko@@ w a sense that , apart from the fact that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i live under the threat posed by the army , they are suffering from poor education and health services .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , like other boats , regard their voice as debt to Jo@@ ko@@ w , which he has to pay .
&apos;@@ You do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite the theft and intimidation , families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i fire were coping with another symbolic objection , NEAF@@ id , which swe@@ pt one victim &apos;s dead police office and the military into the country .
knowing that justice can never be put on the ground , they at least do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&apos;@@ One of our family members was killed &apos; says a shot of Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us .
&apos;@@ What else can we do ? &apos;
ne@@ go@@ ver the T@@ ru@@ i Tu@@ ch pil@@ l had already come under his hand for the second time .
on Friday , hundreds of people died of this 3@@ 37 me@@ tre of age and of 79 @-@ order buildings in the world .
this is the second fire that has been ra@@ va@@ ged for just two years from the high level of radiation called the Tu@@ rin case , the T@@ him@@ vi@@ ku@@ r .
the building was evacu@@ ated , no direct fire @-@ related damage was reported and no direct fire was submitted .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and thre@@ w out the fire sub @-@ prime and people &apos;s fears .
we would wait for a t@@ our and we had about 10 minutes to fall to the 50 order , &apos; said to the Re@@ u@@ ter@@ ans one of the people who called themselves George .
according to Du@@ ba@@ i civil protection officials , fire fighters were also deleted at around 4 : 00 G@@ MT at local inter@@ vals and seized the building .
the government said that it was working to give the victims a shadow of shelter .
this incident may raise again questions about the safety of high @-@ level materials used on foreign soil worldwide .
following the fire of the Tor@@ ch Bureau in 2015 , the investigation found that the most damage was suffered by ste@@ ep f@@ ab@@ ric@@ s - de@@ cor@@ al panels and insu@@ lation of foreign space .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London G@@ ren@@ portfolio T@@ ow@@ er and the emb@@ an@@ ches could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that took place there in June , which killed almost 80 people .
see : these phones are likely to receive sales cards in the autumn
the time has come for the electronic fil@@ ters to recover , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peripheral a Pre@@ mi@@ um came to the sale , and new h@@ it@@ t telep@@ hon@@ es are expected for po@@ ele@@ rs in the autumn .
according to the Tele@@ 2 marketing and sales Director Christian Se@@ mother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by innovation , the eye @-@ wing s@@ hand@@ n@@ ner , the ser@@ ser @-@ servan@@ i 4@@ K resolution , and the ultra @-@ fast process .
Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , which has also reached the top of the Estonian smart phone sales table , gave great visibility in the world of technology .
in autumn , smart hu@@ bs are allowed to be even harder to h@@ ire , more resilient a@@ ven@@ ue , better camer@@ a and more water and more pollin@@ ation .
he added that rum@@ ours suggest that there are already four top @-@ level models that will probably con@@ qu@@ er street sales tables .
these four smart phones top @-@ level models will reach po@@ ta@@ les in the autumn of this year .
the lon@@ a@@ med i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach po@@ ele@@ rs by mid @-@ September .
however , the rum@@ ours that the new Apple model looks like and what can be done are spreading a lot .
if i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not bring significant differences between i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , Apple is expected to be completely different from previous ones on the occasion of the 10th birth@@ day of Apple .
four col@@ ours have been spoken : black , White , Swedish cu@@ p and cro@@ re@@ om .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen covering the entire telephone front , the loss of the dog &apos;s and the fingerprints of the pu@@ p@@ pet have been built in the back door .
the new i@@ P@@ hone model would look like a glass , the Apple design director J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve .
there has also been talk of i@@ P@@ hone &apos;s k@@ era@@ mic version .
in addition to the &apos; big deal &apos; , the un@@ run@@ ners and the even higher quality camer@@ a , the A@@ 11 process range is expected .
this is certainly one of the most expected smart phones for the year .
the ex @-@ post order of the new model G@@ ala@@ x@@ y Spring 8 will begin on 23 August .
although there have been many rum@@ ours of what new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y jet will look like .
Ad@@ mittedly , even more business users are meant , and S pen allows even greater fun@@ ction@@ alities .
the telephone fund should have two camer@@ as , one of which is a la@@ in@@ ur@@ t and another one with a narrow view to tele@@ objects .
nobody knows what two re@@ bel@@ ls are capable of , but in any case it is the first test of Sam@@ sun@@ g , which is certainly comparable to i@@ P@@ hone 8 for quality .
however , we are waiting hard for 23 August .
although Nokia has sold sales this year with three smart phones headed by Nokia 6 , their flagship vessel - Nokia 8 - is still missing , which is already presented on 16 August .
we expect a screen stret@@ ching from 5.@@ 3 to the bottom of the bar@@ gain and a fast @-@ cra@@ ck Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ scarce dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and more resilient a@@ gi@@ tation .
Nokia also talks about alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and about significant levels of water and security , IP@@ 68 .
like Sam@@ su@@ ng@@ one , Nokia has two s@@ tun@@ ning camer@@ a , an opti@@ mist produced by Z@@ e@@ iss .
once the S@@ ony firm flagship has been X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smart phones will be added , with even more innovative fun@@ ction@@ alities .
we are waiting for a smar@@ t@@ phone that is slightly more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least as good or better with a camer@@ a .
for the new S@@ ony model , it has been specu@@ lated that this screen is at least hot .
what the reality is , we can already see the very soon , because traditionally S@@ ony has unve@@ iled its autumn flag vessel at the International Technology Forum IF@@ A , which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year .
according to trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts le@@ ak@@ ed telephone calls , T@@ ru@@ mp sun@@ t Mexico on the payment of the border wall
the Washington post unve@@ iled the telephone calls between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i and Mexic@@ an and Austr@@ alian heads of state .
on 27 January , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ ole , the Mexic@@ an President , went to the T@@ ru@@ mp telephone call for the latter to stop public pro@@ claiming that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President stro@@ kes him for his public condemnation of the wall , saying : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ mp was setting out his presidential campaign &apos;s promise to build a wall and age on the southern border of the United States that Mexico would pay for this project .
trans@@ cri@@ p@@ tors were also published in his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turmes , which reveals a ten@@ se debate .
the T@@ ru@@ mp told Tur@@ une@@ le that the agreement whereby the United States takes on refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; ru@@ m &apos; , and he stated that the agreement that was made during the Obama Administration would give him the impression &apos; guide &apos; , because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the T@@ ru@@ mp ended the speech by telling the Tur@@ une@@ le that &apos; this was the day &apos;s most un@@ pleasant speech &apos; .
the national court did not take a complaint against the city of O@@ C MR@@ P Li@@ ine in the event that the city of Tar@@ tu rejected their offer for the transport of buses and coach transport between July 2019 and 20@@ 29 .
this is a letter rejecting the supply of O@@ C MR@@ P to Tar@@ tu buses and buses , as the offer did not meet the requirements , An@@ neli A@@ pu@@ tin , Head of the Tar@@ tu City Government , explained .
this is a procurement for public transport within the Tar@@ tu city for the period of 1 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 @-@ 3@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
MR@@ P city Li@@ ine referred to the national courts for the decision of the Tar@@ tu L@@ ca@@ de@@ my .
the national court did not act on this .
although many people complain in the social media that the cli@@ p from the We@@ ek@@ ise festi@@ val is disturbing their night and that the entire city is full of drink @-@ driving officers , there are also many who do not have any negative words to say about the ceremony that is going on in the coast .
I am even positively surprised that the brak@@ es were so poli@@ te in the shop .
I saw no dis@@ approval or cour@@ tes@@ y .
even if I saw the Gulf , a wonderful wave is a little bit like it .
&quot; it is nice that , as it comes , there is and joy of the Per@@ sian , which has been lost like winter , &apos; he will gla@@ dly add .
a wave of iron co@@ ws does not cru@@ mble .
if , when he was living in a city of centre , he was still listening to music being played on a be@@ ach , then now music is not yet up to his home e@@ tho@@ s .

the Ag@@ nes , who talked with a fire , also says that the Grand F@@ esti@@ val is rather good for the Per@@ ter - it is a great contribution to the turnover of local merchan@@ ts .
he also welcomes the fact that the Grand Capital of summer has come to such a large extent .
the woman of Pe@@ ol@@ lian me@@ lu does not .
although I am no longer going to be on the coast , it is nice that rand has revi@@ ved .
and it is good that the people are moving , and this has been the case three times , &apos; the woman says .
I think it was a little worse for the first time .
&apos;@@ The@@ y there were complaints &apos; , he will reflect .
but what he said is the case with the capital cities of summer .
&quot; this We@@ ek@@ ise is a very good pro@@ ph@@ mo for our small city , &quot; says Har@@ ri , who is on the park .
life and m@@ ö@@ ll have not put his life in the m@@ ö@@ ll .
but for it ?
we should all be united .
think about how this inter@@ ethnic communication is better .
after all , the music man does not lie .
it does not happen , although I live near it .
&apos;@@ G@@ ood people can and have no men@@ ace &apos; , he says .
visitors coming to the Per@@ sian Republic are , he said , cour@@ tes@@ y .
&apos;@@ With the bot@@ tles they have joined a little , of course , but young people are young people and mothers , but give them a hand , but be people and we can do ! &apos; says he .
the people who travel on the island have travelled to somewhere by then , whether to relatives or to acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces .
&quot; but overall , the festi@@ val has a positive impact on people - people like this me@@ dal , &quot; says Per@@ sian as a Ti@@ ina with children .
his family &apos;s F@@ esti@@ val is not a shame either , even though it was even further removed from today &apos;s work last year .
last summer , the ground was the second one , we heard more .
we live outside the city itself , that it actually goes a long way there from the River Per@@ sian , &apos; he talks .
Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revive business
on Friday , the British educational company Pe@@ ar@@ son said that he is cutting 3 000 more jobs and reducing his interim dividend by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with the risks of business pressures .
the jobs to be made redundant , according to John F@@ all@@ on , the CE@@ O , is likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , will be accompanied by the loss of 4 000 posts during the previous restructuring .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced in May his intention to cut costs by another GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) under the third @-@ cost reduction programme to try to revive business that has been hit by the transition to high @-@ speed digital learning .
a company that agreed to sell last month a company in the enterprise Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House to its partner Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann said that their expectation for a year had not changed since the sales income increase was announced to 2.@@ 05 billion p@@ ounds in the first half of the year .

the attack in K@@ abu@@ l : the suicide suicide attack killed a NATO soldi@@ er
according to the E@@ ne@@ se@@ ta@@ pu@@ ch bom@@ ber , military con@@ vo@@ ys were attacked by officials in the capital of Afghanistan in K@@ abu@@ l , killing one NATO soldi@@ er and w@@ ounding several other .
in NATO &apos;s statement , five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
in the case of the city of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi , three civilians were killed in a ra@@ da@@ r , despite the local reports .
this bom@@ bing is the last act of violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Her@@ ati mos@@ que attack on Tuesday .
on Monday , two people were killed by suicide bom@@ b@@ ers in K@@ abu@@ l near the Iraqi E@@ mb@@ assy .
NATO &apos;s statement said that an explosion took place on Thursday evening when the Afghan army , the collective pat@@ ro@@ l , attacked &apos; a man @-@ made explosives &apos; .
the statement states that everything is injured in a stable state and treated on the US military hospital Bag@@ ra@@ m flight .
according to the Cor@@ respondents , the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( in the country ) are a serious source of concern for the forces in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ h , NATO , Bag@@ ra@@ m .
according to UN data , in the first half of 2017 , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan , of which nearly 20 % have been killed in the capital city .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l was killed by at least 30 people in the mos@@ qui@@ ic of S@@ hi &apos;@@ ite .
the Taliban said they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the city , which has led most to death in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country &apos;s military forces and police forces .
according to the Cor@@ respondents , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf .
EPA annul@@ led the decision to postpone the regulation following the shar@@ ks
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United Nations Environmental Protection Agency ) annul@@ led the decision to delay the adoption of the Obama regulation , which obliges states to limit emissions from flying , one day after 15 states referred the Agency to the courts for its conduct .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday 2015 , saying that it demonstrates the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we must engage in dialogue with our partners in our countries and listen to them , &quot; said the President of the EPA in his statement , Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t .
the P@@ ru@@ it@@ t had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the level of os@@ tility content in Peru , which measured pollution in different parts of the country , in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year on to arrival in 2050 .
15 mainly democratic states , together with the Colom@@ bian community , submitted a complaint on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has tried to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , is part of a more comprehensive agenda for growth .
but these efforts have led to reactions among the groups of democrats and nature conservation who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that &apos; the brea@@ thing of po@@ pp@@ y air &apos; could reduce the ability of Cop@@ ts to work and increase the risk of dying in res@@ pira@@ tory diseases , for example at the as@@ th@@ ma .

&quot; the quality of content is far worse than the price of the soil and the worse than in 2015 , &quot; said Mr Rap@@ hard Nepal , the analysis of A@@ gra@@ vis R@@ ai@@ ff@@ e@@ en .

German farmers , like their European counterparts , have been exposed to any weather this year .
first of all , the winter was too dry .
then came the cold spring , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
in July , Germany was hit by the German dra@@ ma , which has continued in August .
many eyes are on northern Germany , where rain is an obstacle to harves@@ ting .
so far , only five per cent of nic@@ ot@@ ine has been repeated .
most of the regions have not yet started harves@@ ting , notified the local bu@@ yer of catches in C@@ era@@ vis .
&apos;@@ It is quite a difficult day , Mr Frank Dec@@ ker@@ t R@@ end@@ s@@ burg , senior traders in C@@ era@@ vis , said .
consistency in everything , i.e. the ro@@ tten ro@@ cks of the internal design of Fin@@ ns
nature plays a part in the inter@@ night of lo@@ c@@ als , because the mes@@ h views of the Sa@@ ima@@ a fish population are reached in many rooms through major win@@ dows .

it highlights that the theft of black , white and grey links , if supplemented by wood ra@@ pes and to@@ pi@@ pes , can be very disturbing .
good ideas can be given a week to go on the ground , as the air will run until 13 August .

M@@ ür@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
Mr V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and Mr Gar@@ cia , who should be on a col@@ lisi@@ on course to face up to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg of po@@ x@@ ic@@ y in the most attractive shop in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in the ES@@ P@@ N office in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ le@@ res , in the same rooms as Gar@@ cia , the un@@ winning World Bo@@ avian Coun@@ c@@ il ligh@@ t@@ weight champion , wal@@ ked the other side of the corridor to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , World Bo@@ assies assies Monitoring z@@ ation@@ i sul@@ g@@ weight che@@ que .
following a unanimous decision by Gar@@ cia , the victory achieved by the former four @-@ time world champion , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er , on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ erial , both comb@@ at@@ ants belong to the top of the ranking .
Gar@@ cia extended its hand better and said : &apos; how does the summer go , the che@@ em@@ pi@@ is ?
I wish you luck . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko will defend his bel@@ ts against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ ga on Saturday evening at 19 C@@ Z@@ N .
when a couple of pho@@ tos were available , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko &apos;s memory j@@ er E@@ gis Kli@@ mas stated that there would be a &apos; perfect y@@ ard@@ stick &apos; to possible confrontation between the fighters .
&quot; I am former sul@@ ta@@ gic , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I called on B@@ ron@@ ger &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move down@@ wards .
and he must move up to half the easy weight &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the F@@ än@@ ds have requested this .
let us then get them back on the ground . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
in the climate , the question raised was whether it should be paid for this , which is part of his strategy of allowing L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to debate the end of this year at 6@@ 1.2 kg in the class to make it possible for a meeting with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ vans ) , which also has an interest in fighting Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ li &apos;s match with the winner of the E@@ mb@@ assy after the easy title of the ceremony on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as f@@ ans have asked for this opposition , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , later , that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial packages .
&quot; we are the main players .
no other name can get so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that she considers L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t &apos; a force fight &apos; and could go to his Saturday &apos;s match .
however , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was modest in pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia , saying that he thought that the three di@@ vis@@ j@@ on champi@@ on@@ ist from Ri@@ ver@@ ge saw &apos; very slow ; apolo@@ gies , M@@ sele@@ y ... you wanted it no@@ distant &apos; .
according to Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show the strength of the blow@@ s and then to bo@@ w to the bo@@ y .
both confirmed that they felt the tension to be growing to challenge them .
&quot; this is a fight that is waiting for realisation .
no other confrontation causes so much attention and s@@ lan@@ der .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters , and M@@ ae@@ y is precisely that .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
what world @-@ based pressures are being moved from Estonia ?
the soil was extended and issued by the police and border control authority ( PP@@ A ) record more than 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to study , study or family .
when , for example , the soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , the Philippines was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the services cannot tell how many migrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia , but such an analysis will be prepared by the Ministry of the Interior .
while nearly 500 Ukrainians were kno@@ cked to Estonia 10 years ago , in recent years , this figure will reach around 2 000 close .
the number of applicants for a permit extension rose dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis , with 10@@ 87 people receiving fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , up from 6@@ 75 in the previous year .
in Estonia , the statistics office is the largest increase in the number of Ukrainian citizens , with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia in excess of their borders .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been a great one in Estonia all the time and , due to difficult circumstances , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already before the family , the spokes@@ person , Kris@@ tin Ram@@ alla@@ h , at the Ministry of the Interior , declared .
So@@ il and Kab@@ ila had the number of Ukrainians admitted to a fixed @-@ term residence permit even higher than that of Russian citizens , even though in 10 years the lon@@ gest @-@ term residence permits have been issued to the last ones .
if Ukrainians come to work mostly here , Russian citizens will be able to work for family migration .
&quot; given the historic Russian community here , they are more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said the Migration Con@@ sor@@ tium , Hel@@ ina Me@@ a .
&quot; looking at where Russian citizens who have been admitted to Estonian territory have moved to live , Har@@ ju@@ maa is now the Eastern Vir@@ g@@ land , &quot; he added and pointed out that about 40 % of them have been mar@@ ried by EU citizens .
soil was granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 16@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permits was reduced .
&quot; compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending residence permits , a new residence permit has been requested for Estonia to be established permanently , &quot; the journalist &apos;s spokes@@ person at the Ministry of the Interior explained that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonian residence permits has remained rather stable for years .
the new residence permit for Estonia to be permanently established will allow foreigners who have lived here to apply for at least three years from last year .
its aim is to encourage the Sil@@ k @-@ up of the people who have been adapted .
however , a long @-@ term resident &apos;s residence permit requires five years , for example .
the extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased since the new residence permit .
for example , soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years .
now the Ukrainians can exchange their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit was popular in the app - the holders of a bad passport in the soil ( 10@@ 29 ) , Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , Indi@@ ans ( 54 ) and Fin@@ ns ( 36 ) .
a total of 19@@ 68 people were able to live in Estonia for their part , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and just as many Chinese people .
with the first half of this year , the total number of such applications is already 12@@ 69 .
in 10 years , surpris@@ ingly Nigeria has become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residency .
when three residence permits were issued to n@@ ig@@ er@@ als in 2007 , soil was 200 .
Nigeria is coming to learn from this university .
the Estonian higher education institutions are also popular , for example , among Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased mostly thanks to learning games .
they also have the rule that where the community is in the pipeline , it is easier to come to others , &quot; added Ram@@ alla@@ h .
over ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , just as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , this is about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if you look at the citizens of the European Union , migration remains around a percentage , &quot; the Ma@@ in said that the figures are actually small .
a total of 14 8@@ 22 people died in Estonia , according to the statistical agency , 13 7@@ 92 .
this means that immigration exceeded the second anniversary of emigration .
most ex@@ traditions and movements are Estonian citizens , but more of them are among those who leave .
therefore , Estonian citizens had a loss of the soil with 2 000 people .
the Est@@ oni@@ ans are particularly travelling between Finland and Estonia .
M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture printing ta@@ ta@@ inc@@ s@@ sim@@ de lu@@ res with sa@@ ts , we@@ eds and t@@ arrogance
however , in the north @-@ west of the idea , there is a history for Mrs Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u - old pain@@ ts and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream for hours somewhere in the muse@@ um and ad@@ m@@ ire the early thi@@ ev@@ es and cra@@ ts of the old era .
if you go a bit on the f@@ li@@ p , you will study and learn to this every day .
this is a pleasure in finding out .
the world of M@@ M@@ M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture &apos;s gla@@ ci@@ er may seem like some alien , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much s@@ oul your life !
as a friend , I have a whole sa@@ il full of the w@@ ounds of mine , cou@@ ture .
because , and it is not his fault , he does not live in Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ oo@@ s and does not go on a red wh@@ im every day ; he wants to wear these most beautiful bro@@ kers , and he is suffering !
you can live your own life special !
the Mo@@ e@@ man does not recognise the gap between the sh@@ ining events and the grey day .
it was this reasoning that put the rolling stock in the land , forests and fields in Estonia , into the people that are often unable to reach .
for example , a joint colle@@ gi@@ ate was presented a long time ago , in comparison , in J@@ evening and in the Bay of Per@@ lo mo@@ e@@ fin@@ el , where 45 mos@@ ques were filled by Qu@@ e@@ en &apos;s Qu@@ e@@ fi@@ le@@ e .
in Tallinn , there is often a han@@ g , a dignified slogan , but there are more emo@@ tions elsewhere - s@@ log@@ ans , b@@ ba@@ vo , stand up , you want to thank you .
a large proportion of the audience had to be just news , but now they are the f@@ ans of M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture .
if you over@@ shoo@@ t people &apos;s expectations , they are spiri@@ ted !
and I like the feeling that I am with my mo@@ tive like the summer .
Per@@ nus had a 50 @-@ me@@ tre red car@@ pet , a whole @-@ day lorry full of stic@@ kers , seemed to be unable to come to an end .
Mrs Maria does not recognise that nature must be presented by a super@@ super@@ imperialist super@@ b , she will be happy to bring ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always come with pleasure .
that is how much experience is so la@@ x , the ice ice layer found a wonderful piece !
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own play , I am always behind the ground to give a final piece of things as a hope@@ less fe@@ is@@ ist .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow a calm watch on the floor .
Mrs Maria Maria is this kind of mo@@ el@@ o@@ gy who wants not only to play a representative role , but to be present in everything .
I have my sis@@ ter in the nuclear field , most of the colle@@ ctions I carry out myself .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to discover .
I am never far from my own creation and I am not afraid of work .
it is not limited to the subject , but also to the style , logistics , organisation , organisation - everything must fit the days of a woman of a tem@@ per@@ ment .
the fana@@ tics are still receiving huge amounts of work .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a happy day !
I am still very lu@@ cky - it is like an un@@ stop@@ p@@ able happy jo@@ ke : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compli@@ ments .
it has been said several times that my bro@@ kers have a land gra@@ ce - they make themselves feel like a printing ta@@ g .
the gu@@ est , ul@@ tr@@ ul@@ li@@ cal , car@@ cas@@ ses that made Mrs Eb@@ adi known overnight have long since remained the signal of M@@ M@@ bps to date .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p U@@ 18 boys : the weapon of the Est@@ oni@@ ans &apos; al@@ ag@@ ro@@ pi@@ pi@@ pe is now turned against us .
the damage , the fair@@ y@@ tale , ran out .
the first thing was to say that we could not get our own s@@ ongs .
and when so much difference comes in the table , there is nothing to do , &quot; Estonia said U@@ 18 cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ po@@ s 61 : 75 fall to Britain , our only bas@@ ket@@ ball , Mr Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p .
opponents took 28 Pal@@ ace from the south @-@ west and were so much more attacked as a result .
we were also not prepared to protect them agg@@ ressi@@ vely and not to attack them , it created .
many of the attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build up protection .
however , in defence , they have been able to keep their hands between them everywhere , we could not combine .
it created the team from the bottom .
the anti @-@ personnel ho@@ mework was better done .
M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ pa estimates that Estonia should have made more tac@@ tical mistakes to take the anti @-@ missile .
the last quarter had a mistake - we had zero , but opponents had already received a number of quick records .
A@@ tle@@ ss@@ ness and the intense offensive that was our weapon at al@@ ag@@ ro@@ pi@@ pi@@ pi@@ pi@@ pi@@ pi@@ pi@@ pi@@ pi@@ th@@ ic now all turned against us .
today we did not have the strength to resist their aggressive behaviour .
the M@@ y@@ r@@ r@@ hen@@ p remained satisfied with his neg@@ ligent Kal@@ ev@@ is , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ tery .
security in general can say good words about the whole team , so far there was a single shock in the game .
it is a pity that such aggressive reactions had not been met before .
it has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but it seemed that he had ti@@ red - he has borne a huge burden .
but he made some of the fine ges@@ tures I have seen in the past , &apos; added a guide .
appalling figures : E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ r , in the cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ li@@ p of ne@@ ps , thre@@ w three less than 10 points in the E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ r with three quarter exceptions ...
the U@@ 18 age class does not just work in the B@@ D@@ vis@@ j@@ on cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ tin@@ ir in Tallinn , her first to start in Dublin on the day after yesterday .
and , unfortunately , the game with Poland was pul@@ led in the area of anti @-@ missile systems .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but after the third quarter , 9 : 49 , or only in the last ten minutes , opponents took their feet from the gas beet and 16 were left in the same period : 16 .
Estonia , the third quarter , in the first and second quarter , thre@@ w Estonia 4 , the third point ...
in doing so , they initially caught two pieces of four minutes from four ben@@ ches , but they played 25 pieces , then one y@@ el@@ low in the back door and then another 21 ta@@ les .
perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 fin@@ gers were found to be caught one .
in addition , 2 points came from four free s@@ log@@ ans .
the loss of allowances was a reasonable figure of 12 .
Poland &apos;s surface hit by the game ultimately amounted to 33 % and 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , with 83 out of 56 of Portugal on the opening day .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement supplies
today , the NATO permanent &quot; no @-@ fly &quot; group arrived in Tallinn for a week to complement the vessels &apos; reserves and prepare for the pre @-@ existing exercise .
ships are preparing for landing on the sea during the course of the visit , thereby allowing cre@@ ws to be allowed to leave the boat for a pa@@ ternal holiday .
following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonia &apos;s waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations for the search of historic explo@@ sive rem@@ nan@@ ts .
&quot; the participation of indigenous people in and the combined activities carried out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the alli@@ ances , &quot; said the chief cap@@ tain Ar@@ to Rein@@ land , the overseas fleet &apos;s top office .
since 29 June , NATO will chair the Latvian Na@@ vy Cap@@ tain Cap@@ tain , G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , a permanent mine mine of mine , who took over the team &apos;s duties from the Estonian cap@@ ter Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as Sel@@ ja@@ b at the ceremony in Riga .
the group &apos;s flagship vessel is L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , a Latvian naval force which also has a group &apos;s leading office .
this semester , the Estonian Na@@ vy M@@ use@@ um M@@ use@@ um , is also part of the international unit .
as one of the four vessels under the NATO naval board , NATO is the first permanent mine group of primary respon@@ si@@ veness units , which the Alliance could send to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - N@@ ot 13 August , the P@@ iri@@ ta k@@ oo@@ ter &apos;s ref@@ res@@ h will once again become a place where Burma &apos;s Day of Bir@@ git@@ ta , called by Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ r K@@ ans 13 years ago , will be held down .
this year , Mrs F@@ esti@@ val , the city of Tallinn , the artistic leader of the philos@@ op@@ op@@ op@@ on@@ onia , said , &apos; The J@@ oo@@ tis ( 36 ) , will be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented &apos; .
the risk of hearing from J@@ oo@@ st : &apos; Tra@@ vi@@ ita &apos; and T@@ os@@ ca , bal@@ le@@ ti@@ la@@ la@@ answers from the B@@ ole@@ ro@@ st &apos; , the &apos; Kar@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ in &apos; camp , and nor is there a lack of production of the scheme , which is this time Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ni &apos;s wonderful or@@ a@@ en@@ do , by the same international team of creators who brought him to the P@@ iri@@ la@@ den Hague square in 2015 .
Mrs F@@ esti@@ val has much more than just concer@@ ts and theat@@ re replies .
this is higher than any music theat@@ re in its usual form .
it is a festi@@ val that takes power and never gets rid of .
because the experience that the lis@@ ten@@ er receives in this sup@@ erior and sal@@ va@@ ble environment puts human mind ring@@ ing and touches on human beings in a way that cannot be described .
risk to you , you are the first year leader of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
did the Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ las@@ kin@@ s not feel a little big ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been helpful .
I was pushed through a whole student career and also supported by the start of my di@@ os@@ ote career .
perhaps it is thanks to this that I will be easier to continue his work .
so much ch@@ arity has been s@@ tun@@ ned by the F@@ esti@@ val team of Burma in K@@ las , and of course it is also passed on to me .
it was excellent to join a team who knows how things are going to go .
it was Mr K@@ las@@ ka &apos;s great heart that gave me the power to move ahead very well with Mrs F@@ esti@@ val in Tallinn .
and here I am and can do it .
what could the public at this ceremony today , what special offer do you offer ?
we have the names of artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , surpris@@ ingly , the first bal@@ ler , written on the speech by Mrs L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i , is coming to presentation .
this is &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson l@@ b &apos; .
and one criminal nu@@ ance in this regard is that the author of this bal@@ le@@ l is the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser , J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ inning , who himself declared a wish to write it to the tune .
apparently she has already had a car@@ a@@ a@@ ture of Kar@@ l@@ sson , who has already lived in the b@@ reat@@ h of the child .
at the risk , how are you all the nu@@ ances ?
my life @-@ supporting fellow man is certainly thanks .
such work requires a system of support and much love , and I am lu@@ ck@@ ily cu@@ red of it .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tion does not depend so much on people as I myself , or how I will be against every new day .
and such awareness of the way we have been held , of being positive and , in fact , of laugh@@ ing ourselves into the mir@@ ror of the morning , was greatly increased by my happy percentage .
especially now this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen on this and it is working .
to lau@@ gh itself is an act of a@@ mus@@ h@@ all and it is raising the tone .
that is simply not a word .
I think that people do not know half the things of their own body that the univer@@ se offers them , but it is one that everybody himself is gradually ad@@ mitting .
now , it is an important moment .
is there also a ri@@ tual before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ d was taken ?
there are still clothing , and clothing must be changed against more convenient ones .
this is a small moment for ourselves .
but , generally speaking , I have no chance of pu@@ mping or making a little w@@ ool before I speak .
in fact , I even like to have active contact with people , even before they take di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di@@ um .
but come all to Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , what is also to be detected here , not least for the big manager and bal@@ le@@ ti war .

new results of tests on the age of Swedish asylum seekers were published
in Sweden , the latest results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the constitution was assessed as older than 18 , but not all believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for P@@ har@@ ma@@ co@@ vigilance ( R@@ asy@@ ts@@ preferably in@@ al@@ ver@@ t ) started tests earlier this year .
the tests were set up to assess the age more accurately during the application of the as@@ th@@ ma after Sweden &apos;s Office for Migration ( I@@ OM ) criticised for failing to correctly appoint several allegedly juven@@ ile refugees .
to date , Jordan has sent 6@@ 80 cases of testing and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 24 81 tests between March 2017 and 31 July 2017 .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) was assessed for 18 years or over and 25 more cases , the Institute for Legal medicine assessed that the &apos; testing may be 18 years old &apos; .
in 4@@ 32 cases , it came to the conclusion that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if the age of the person is questioned .
according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son , who works in the Institute of Justice , the results are consistent compared with those of previous months .
&quot; we do not see a big difference compared to the statistics of previous months , but rather consistent figures , &quot; he said to the newspaper The Local .
it is not necessarily the case that a large proportion of cases were assessed on average than 18 , which does not mean that asylum seekers have been making their age known .
in May , the EIT issued the results of the 581 test and said that in 4@@ 42 cases , there were indications that the person examining is 18 years old or older .
but when the newspaper Svensson ska Dag@@ bla@@ d investigated the results of their 581 test , it became clear that in 2@@ 43 cases , the person had stated directly that he would be 18 this year .
this medical age assessment method , whereby H@@ L @-@ too@@ th@@ me@@ ters and s@@ wine @-@ type MR@@ T are carried out , then they are being criticised by dental doctors and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts in some circles .
one of the sceptics is the endo@@ k@@ rin@@ ology of the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute , Mr Rad@@ Mar@@ cus , whose work includes assessing people &apos;s biological maturity to find out whether they were going through the audience sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the method of measuring what is currently being used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very precarious .
if we cannot say firmly , we should not pretend that we get , &apos; said to the newspaper , he said forestry .
but Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son &apos;s trial Institute for medicine was able to protect the accuracy of the tests : &apos; overall , it can be said that the risk of baby se@@ ating in@@ accurately is low .
perhaps the biggest risk , with about 10 % , is if you are in a little under 18 . &quot;
9 sign that you could for@@ give you for more expensive .
you were more expensive on Friday and spent a night with someone else .
it is painful because you have so many nice times and memor@@ ies together .
I would like to reassure him , but is it time ...
Y@@ our Tan@@ go lists nine signs which show that the cost of your action is tw@@ o@@ fold and could be for@@ given .
more expensive , it seems to me to understand the seriousness of the situation and to be working hard to resolve it .
your more expensive deal deals with the problem of bringing him into the bed with another com@@ pass .
pay is no longer a more expensive defen@@ sive .
he sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for his actions .
he is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
he agrees that he has made a serious mistake and that he sincerely seeks to improve the situation .
he is attentive and he is trying to communicate with you in a pleasant way .
however , without pressure , you will be able to get over the matter quickly .
they are not denying what has happened , nor are they trying to make it un@@ noticed .
it is more expensive for you and your de@@ ed to see why you were proved to be in@@ vio@@ lable .
you talk about this , and also about how to avoid it in the future .
you need to communicate better and assess each other &apos;s needs .
your more expensive attitude and action have helped you to develop our condolences against his mis@@ carriage .
your more expensive commitment and behaviour have created the basis for your proximity to return .
as a couple of you have made progress in believing once again in your unity and relationship .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old new@@ er , Anna Maria O@@ rel , made a nice debate in London , receiving 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7 places of good 18 .
after that , M@@ M no@@ ori@@ m was a female j@@ ung@@ le and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for med@@ als in the future .
the contest went well and has had a good experience .
with the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , I immediately took the risk of keeping my average result , the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) , and the third one ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) , very clearly said after the contest . &quot;
I was able to have my own emissions , and I am very pleased that I found it .
Ms Maria O@@ re@@ li M@@ M &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 @-@ time session .
Vi@@ h@@ mas@@ ad@@ u O@@ reli@@ t did not mix , as he is training him through the Quartet stage .
&apos;@@ I am afraid &apos; , he said a little bit of a mu@@ d@@ dle .
the London Olympic Assembly had almost a full house of people , did the people have their own house or were able to get rid of them ?
I have been to Tajani , but in a positive sense .
everyone says that this will add - that is the case .
if you compete on your own , you can experience it .
after that , he confirmed that he would be satisfied with the M@@ M debate and he is still waiting for a lot of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 3@@ 2nd outcome of the season of the street , the last one , I closed down to 18 .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and M@@ ore - that is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of the med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina ku@@ ber@@ ner announced party change
the Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a @-@ Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ a , that he would change political parties .
&apos;@@ W@@ hil@@ st it or not , the democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I say to you , having been a lot of che@@ er@@ ful and thought for ... today I say to you , the Western peac@@ hes , that I cannot help you any longer as a democratic Governor . &quot;
the rub@@ ber was applau@@ ded .
&apos;@@ The@@ reafter , I will be a Re@@ publi@@ can , &apos; added Justice .
&quot; as a engineers , I would say to you that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
the T@@ ru@@ mp had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
T@@ ru@@ ary won a quarter in Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a on 42 points and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
justice , which , according to For@@ tera@@ i , is the only billion state @-@ owned , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ tic@@ ent states that it has coal mines in five states and coal business quite from its own father .
it has a value of approximately USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday night , the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) published a declaration that &apos; the party exchange of Governor Justice is yet another blow to the democratic par@@ ade , which would rather prevent the country from being improved again rather than working for it &apos; .
&apos;@@ O@@ ver 15 months of govern@@ ors and controls over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent expression of par@@ king that is out of the beginning and cannot find a positive and united message , &apos; said R@@ N@@ C representation , in the Mc@@ Daniel C@@ S New@@ si statement .
it is hardly surprising that there are many people , there are many injured .
Ur@@ met , who is in the medical hotel on We@@ ek@@ ise , told the girl yesterday that pos@@ ters had had to be distributed quite a lot .
the moun@@ tains and br@@ ands are fundamental , ex@@ cus@@ es and easy failures .
of course , the main , left and foot @-@ and @-@ mouth .
according to Ur@@ me@@ ti , visitors to the festi@@ val come with false foot@@ wear , and so the problems come .
media have also had to help those who have suffered a few major injuries - there have been some panic and also one foot @-@ out .
we have also made ble@@ s@@ sing when a person has put his hand or the finger at the head .
we are doing less h@@ aste here , we are sending more to hospital .
see the vide@@ os as to whether the brak@@ es on the media would also be treated with pain@@ kil@@ lers .
Co@@ e praised the Russians for their fair apolo@@ gies for the D@@ ing@@ us@@ h@@ all .
the international r@@ alli@@ ed S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , who said &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apolo@@ gy from Thursday &apos; for the D@@ ing@@ us@@ h@@ all , has given a clear signal , but has reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country to return to sport .
the Russian k@@ ron@@ board r@@ hen@@ e D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ ce@@ h@@ tin said at the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World C@@ up that the competition ban imposed on his country is the right one and has a firm aim to fight doping .
he apolog@@ ised &apos; for all light @-@ entry groups who have been cut off in competitions by gol@@ den and sil@@ ver med@@ als &apos; .
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on competition in force , which was introduced in November 2015 , following the report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) , which found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think today it was a very honest presentation , a very honest presentation , saying to the press the President of IA@@ AF .
&quot; the Council and the Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognised that they had had had had quite difficult times and that they are doing their utmost to reform the al@@ union . &quot;
he also welcomed Russia &apos;s acceptance of its own recovery criteria , according to Co@@ e .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the proposal of the working group that this is not the time for withdrawal from Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything possible over the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we have always come to the principle that we want to separate clean spor@@ ts@@ people from the system that was broken , &apos; in his annex .
one hundred Russian b@@ len@@ der who meets the strict criteria of IA@@ AF is competing with the hybrid world champi@@ on@@ ship in London on Friday as neutral spor@@ ts@@ men .
on Monday , R@@ une Andersson , head of the IA@@ AF working group , said that Russia is still not meeting several criteria for rein@@ statement .
following a presentation to the IA@@ AF Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that le@@ c@@ ture@@ rs who have been banned are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution makes a significant difference in demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
little because the electric car revolution makes a significant difference to the fuel market until infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although mining gi@@ ants like G@@ len@@ core can say that they win from one place and lose another , smaller mining firms do not help .
G@@ len@@ core coal and oil currently serve , but in the era of electric cars , the demand for co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ kel will increase .
this year , the votes of the UK , France and Norway governments on the spread of electric cars have increased their contributions to allow the ban on the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades .
therefore , Vol@@ vo has already knew that he is planning to give up an internal combustion engine and T@@ es@@ la will bring a cheaper blue 3 electric car to the market .
B@@ animal berg &apos;s New Energy Finance Facility estimates that over two decades electric cars will be sold more than those using oil @-@ fired fuels .
&quot; for some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ in B@@ animal , the raw materials analy@@ st of Capital Economics .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as co@@ balt and li@@ thi@@ um , which have been growing demand for years .
electricity cars have approximately three times more cop@@ ies than the conventional car , publishing G@@ len@@ core .
an even bigger response is needed at the charging stations , which is why Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that it will increase demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and human@@ ans .
G@@ len@@ core will be the income of electric cars from the rising wholesale price rise and the fact that there is the biggest co@@ bal@@ ti@@ er producer in the world , predicted by J@@ eff@@ ila &apos;s group .
this bro@@ ker company estimates that the winners of the F@@ bet@@ report @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ ma Min@@ er@@ conventions are other winners .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of the London me@@ tal stock exchange line has been mixed .
the price of the soil was 37 % .
the answer has also been 14 % this year , mainly due to economic growth .
G@@ len@@ core shares rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price rise to ri@@ val Rio T@@ oni@@ pa Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ oni and Ang@@ lo Stream .
on the side of the losers , lead companies such as Rec@@ y@@ ht@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine are companies who have to adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ use of the P@@ li@@ c is the bat@@ teries supplying the start @-@ up of cars with a diesel engine .
electric cars use fil@@ ter @-@ based hy@@ ste@@ u@@ ms .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael W@@ id@@ mer , the Bank of America &apos;s Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ ch Me@@ tho@@ l , the analytical officer of the me@@ tal market .
the impact of the split in the form of price movements is still not visible .
the P@@ li@@ c has been fishing 17 % this year , with the best methane in London among the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems for metals in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure that leads to such bad behaviour , because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive , &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the chief company of the me@@ tal bro@@ ker Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ s .
if lead is to fall , it will be slow .
perhaps that will happen in about 10 years &apos; time .
meanwhile , stricter emission standards mean that hybrid subsidies are growing , which are more often dependent on advanced lead @-@ based bat@@ teries , valued by international lead and by the investigative body .
L@@ abor@@ tions like alu@@ mini@@ um replacement are a replacement of steel , as a ligh@@ ter car can drive less electricity .
this explains an additional 1.6 million tonnes of closed minimum demand between 2013 and 2016 .
it represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s output of alu@@ mini@@ um .
this trend is likely to grow , says W@@ id@@ mer .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um has been fishing 13 % this year , as the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market shortages .
steel manufacturers do not .
the holding of ak S@@ las@@ hing works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce wonderful car lights .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and S@@ lan@@ ta Europe are also trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down from steel to oppose the minimum .
&quot; the strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris , the analysis of the matter , Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
Europe is seeing some progress .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to the pla@@ te .
soil took about half of this precious me@@ tal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , and was announced by the me@@ tal fin@@ er Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ teries .
&quot; many of the raw materials currently facing high demand , such as oil and pla@@ te , may not have a high demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h , the Na@@ ti@@ x@@ id raw materials analy@@ st .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ at@@ at@@ ine producers believe in the continued demand for diesel hybrid subsidies .
Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , leader of Un@@ core , said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 .
the great hope of Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ at@@ at@@ at@@ in@@ ers in the 10 @-@ year perspective is for cars based on hydrogen cells developed by To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ mun@@ i Mo@@ tos , which depend on a pla@@ te to produce electricity from hydrogen .
however , until now , this technology has not yet commercially justified itself .
&quot; the Di@@ et appears to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris from Brussels .
German car manufacturers were severely affected in July , as the S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art court banned diesel in the cities of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how the monetary rules for football affect the shift of Ney@@ ra to Paris
rules aimed at preventing the uncontrolled spending of European football clubs will not prevent the world @-@ wide shift of Ney@@ ra from the Spanish football club to the Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences for UEFA , the governing body , which domin@@ ates the European game and which has the power to ban teams from participating in the security of the pres@@ ti@@ gious League of Ministers , are still waiting until Paris for Saint @-@ Ger@@ May .
the financial rules for fair play ( F@@ F@@ P ) , established by UEFA in 2011 , mean that the PS@@ G must prove at some point that the Ney@@ ra transition was financed without huge losses .
EUR 2@@ 22 million were paid to Barcelona ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) for the fact that the Brazili@@ ans were able to buy out of its contract , and the Ney@@ ra salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year .
here there are some aspects of the migration of Ney@@ ra to the French club .
PS@@ G will undoubtedly be able to go out such money for the recruitment of Ney@@ ra and for inclusion in its sta@@ tionary clo@@ thes , given that the team is funded by the family governing the Ka@@ tar energy pipeline .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recru@@ iting players , but they must balance it with legal sources of income that enable them to come out of football .
Mr F@@ F@@ F@@ P laid the foundations for Michel Pla@@ tini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs who are falling into debt in search of success would actually be engaged in fraud and risk buying out if the banks or owners were to give up support .
from 2011 , the F@@ F@@ P will focus on monitoring their losses instead of their debts .
this change means that the business model used by Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch first used in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ sea - buying a club with potential and then spending heavily to improve the team and to create a global brand - is more difficult to implement .
during this three @-@ year evaluation period , which runs until 2018 , the F@@ F@@ F@@ P can bear the cost of up to EUR 30 million .
and despite the fact that Pla@@ tini was dismissed in 2015 by the presidential Office , his successor , Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , remains committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; F@@ F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said last week The negotiator , Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is UEFA &apos;s F@@ P Supervisor .
although PS@@ G ta@@ cho@@ red for the &apos; buy @-@ in &apos; clause for Ney@@ ra as one full payment , they will be able to allocate this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the contract .
Mrs Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , so it is possible to indicate a transitional fee of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
in 2014 , the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions was the most severe penalties imposed on the PS@@ G , along with Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga , which is part of Abu D@@ ha@@ bi .
the PS@@ G was fined 60 million euros ( USD 82 million at this point ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million , and the club required to limit the team of the League of Me@@ is@@ ts to 21 players during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of the usual 25 .
UEFA seeks clubs which can try to over@@ ride regulatory authorities by ex@@ posing their revenues through companies linked to owners of clubs .
the Ka@@ tar company may spon@@ sor the PS@@ G , but if the value of spon@@ sorship is considered to be over @-@ standard market levels , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
this was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar &apos;s VAT Authority &apos;s PS@@ G support was in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably displayed .
it has been said that some of the GUE / G service could come from Q@@ a@@ tar through contributions from the World C@@ up Management Committee for 20@@ 22 .
however , the PS@@ G and Q@@ a@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ ra could become a world champi@@ on@@ ship and claim that UEFA regulators would easily be able to qu@@ ash such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on GPS mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition pro @-@ actively with PS@@ G .
they spoke to the press on the condition that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PS@@ G .
latest reports show that the PS@@ G made a profit of over € 10 million in the 2015 @-@ 2016 season at around € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the figures for the last financial year have not yet been published .
the PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ ra will have a positive impact on spon@@ sorship transactions , trade and s@@ nus .
the club expects a minimum of 30 % increase in turnover in relation to the conclusion of the contract .
Spain , too , having clearly upset one of the biggest football sta@@ rs , sought to block the move by saying that the PS@@ G is violating F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear case of &quot; financial doping &quot; with a club and a country , &quot; said President Javier T@@ eb@@ as , in La vie , AS , to the Spanish newspaper , indicating that the PS@@ G belongs mainly to the Ka@@ tari@@ as .
Ar@@ sen@@ al mä@@ ne@@ j@@ er Ar@@ ţ@@ W@@ en@@ ger , who belongs to the American sports mag@@ na@@ ge , shares with La Scotland the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights and has changed the whole football landscape completely over the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to the state , then it will be possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player . &quot;

today 50 years ago : the sun@@ test storm in Estonia , which was fo@@ d@@ der off houses and win@@ dows .
the or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra , which was designated as the stor@@ my of the century , ra@@ ging on 6 and 7 August caused major damage , particularly to the West , Har@@ ju@@ ria and the Black Sea .
in the north @-@ west of Estonia , during these days , the wind was over 30 m / s .
my old ame@@ tri@@ c was be@@ ating one of the maps trees from the other in Ba@@ vari@@ a and c@@ iting them with orders .
all was blind and ra@@ g@@ ne , like the world stage .

the wife of L@@ inda &apos;s wife saw his own plan@@ ted t@@ our collapsed .
but what support you are still going to put in the hands of you , where you are coming up against such a storm ?
the sea came under the window , the win@@ dows were s@@ lee@@ ping in the water , &quot; said Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us Kal@@ da , Mrs L@@ inda tone , who lived on the streets .
the fact that the roads were full and the office office &apos;s office had been flying 20 to 30 metres , L@@ inda most shar@@ k sto@@ res , just as it was next morning .
according to local authorities , the ca@@ ge behind Par@@ ale@@ pa was behind the sun , some were completely leng@@ ths , some boys .
everyone saw it very frustra@@ ting , the storm went through the beautiful old trees as ra@@ g@@ by and pragmatism like a war .
Western Vir@@ u@@ land was not particularly badly affected by August 1967 compared to Western Estonia , but the losses were also high there , Stalin &apos;s theat@@ re in 2007 .

in Tallinn , the wind was measured by up to 35 metres a second , or approximately 130 kilometres a hour .

the generation &apos;s natural building in Vil@@ j@@ an@@ di@@ land was so destroyed during the storm that it was decided to be disman@@ tled later .
the August stor@@ r was not opposed to the design of the T@@ ü@@ ri Dis@@ tri@@ ct mountain , which was later not restored .
the newspaper Red T@@ uro@@ t wrote on 12 August 19@@ 57 that the restoration of towns and cities and settlements from the trees that have been hit and their vehicles is progressing slowly , and the population could be involved in cor@@ ro@@ gation work .
Gra@@ ins also suffered greatly in Tu@@ rin , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party organisations must be both on cor@@ ps and on fer@@ tility cor@@ ps as an incentive and guidance &apos; .

people can now already assess what is being done for them , &quot; the U@@ so@@ v who has been ra@@ ging the migrants for 15 years .
it was the case that , when something new had been stood up , it was already a test next day .
now it is kept to what is on the ground .
clean coast price
one of the biggest jobs on the Estonian coast is the repetition of the rub@@ b@@ ish , the ad@@ ru , which has been ra@@ b@@ bed on the sea .
for example , in the Car@@ ta coast , it must be transported by 400 000 tonnes of coast@@ line .
&apos;@@ This is an incredible amount &apos; , marks U@@ so@@ v .
another large category is municipal waste , or all that people are leaving behind .
there are eight large rub@@ b@@ ish lines at a semi @-@ kilometre stret@@ ch in S@@ tro@@ om , which need to be emp@@ tied three times a week .
so much is done about rub@@ b@@ ish .
however , the cold summer days have meant that rub@@ b@@ ish is five per cent less than otherwise .
the third species is abandoned .
these are mostly children &apos;s TV spots .
the old so@@ v has broken ten towns and the slu@@ dge from the sand .
these owners will be waiting for a flo@@ ating wood route .
&quot; usually they will be more out of them , but it is normal harves@@ ts , &quot; and the sun knows that soon it will find them again from the sand .
children come to ran@@ k and take toys to bur@@ y them again .
landfill k@@ ni@@ fe
Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler , the administrative services representative , admitted to the hospital , is disturbing local careers in the tra@@ ctor .
noise , which las@@ ts from night to night , is mixed up by people living in the neighbourhood .
on the day , however , this work is impossible .
in one month , rand has to be inter@@ ro@@ gated twice .
&quot; if we do not do that , then we will be fined by the city , &quot; Sch@@ ol@@ ler will mark .
however , like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ka and Per@@ cau@@ ts , S@@ tro@@ om rand is also intended to get the international flag of the S@@ tro@@ om .
&quot; compared to Europe , Estonia has much more work to do to care for be@@ aches , &quot; says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more ad@@ minister and more stone and more difficult to join the sand .
but we have less rub@@ b@@ ish in our be@@ aches than elsewhere in Europe .
listening to the talk of rub@@ b@@ ish , a man living near S@@ tro@@ om &apos;s be@@ aches is moving around a conver@@ sation between a journalist and cor@@ ro@@ gation staff , highlighting current bottlenecks .
the picture of the morning is in the gallery everywhere .
the problem is birds and bot@@ tle sla@@ ves who have drawn the rub@@ b@@ ish bags into the ro@@ ck , &quot; Martin says .
although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the city Government will do something with the b@@ ars and , for example , put them on the ro@@ cks to prevent birds from being on the spot .
in general , however , Martin S@@ tro@@ om &apos;s be@@ aches is satisfied with developments .
we can see that the city is looking after this .
it has become more pleasant with children &apos;s fields , enligh@@ tened and newly as@@ ph@@ alt roads .
it was once that only one way could go on a single route , &quot; Martin notes .

he does not believe that , today , and in the future , something is found to be worth .
marine ang@@ les are not sufficiently generous to do so .
&quot; I have been dealing with this for one year and has not found any value so far , &quot; says D@@ mit@@ ry .
as a ref@@ rig@@ eration , there are some euro coins , bot@@ tles and also dangerous p@@ ounds that later throw in the rub@@ b@@ ish .
normally , coins are still .
&apos;@@ Wel@@ l , finger and whatever else usually does not exist &apos; , they are owned by the ar@@ mi@@ es .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level as un@@ profitable growth and the easing of inflation have cus@@ hi@@ oned speculation in relation to the increase .
Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain a lo@@ opho@@ le , as household incomes have put interest rates on stand@@ by .
the monetary policy decision @-@ makers of the Bank ( MP@@ C ) voted for 6 : 2 % in favour of keeping the ceiling 0.@@ 25 % and fewer members this month are calling for an increase , as slow growth has weakened support for the up@@ surge .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank cut its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
however , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in rates is necessary to contain inflation from Bre@@ x@@ on over the next few years and that a expected increase in lending costs could be necessary in financial markets .
Members also voted to partially withdraw the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package which was launched a year ago following Bre@@ x@@ ti &apos;s economic recovery .
the Bank will termin@@ ate its fixed @-@ term cash scheme in February , which offers banks cheap funding , although it said that it is now GBP 15 billion more than the scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; the average forecast of MP@@ C will remain gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the near future , as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
on the rates , it was reiterated that &apos; a slight effort to reduce inflation &apos; is needed , and this is to a somewhat greater extent than expected in the markets .
the Eurosta@@ rs is currently predi@@ cting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any ju@@ mp is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecasts in May .
the forecast for growth of 1.8 % in 2018 remained .
since that new , the p@@ ound fell into the dollar and the euro .
women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.@@ 31 and 0.@@ 4 % to EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to a rise in expectations for the second quarter of the year , from 0.2 % to 0.@@ 3 % .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it will be a little bit more encouraging at the end of the year .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave little reason to re@@ jo@@ ice households with rising inflation and pi@@ tiful wage increases , saying that the situation would go a little worse before the recovery was improved .
it was added that monetary policy cannot prevent a fall in income in the next few years , but a significant recovery is expected towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
the GBP 1 also encourages the economy to increase demand for British produce , which will partially compensate consumers for lower costs .
the decision comes one year after the rate was taken in August last year by 0.@@ 25 % following the shocking EU referendum , which caused a sudden fall in the p@@ ound .
the Bank is likely to take four years to blow up life entirely to prices and to the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last decision , it felt that there was a growing demand for higher inflation , because it had increased pressure on households in distress ; in July , three policy makers called for a 0.5 % increase .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month compared to 2.9 % in June , although it was expected to be expected and there will be a return in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak p@@ ound .
Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , head of Co@@ rec@@ o mortgage bro@@ kers , said : &apos; in the light of the recent downturn in exchange rates , the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again , as creditors are losing their jobs and hoping to finish the year in a positive way .
the Böge exchange looks particularly favourable to those who are going to complete the existing transactions , as re@@ financing , often without service and low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV
patients have since September had access to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; treatment for HIV prevention after the battle in the Supreme Court over whether the N@@ HS should finance the drug .
N@@ HS England announced that public health is now expected to make it available to 10 000 people during the initial three @-@ year clinical trial to pre @-@ ca@@ ta@@ cho@@ graph@@ s ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t that is man@@ ned before the interim procedure and has shown a reduction of approximately 86 % in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people .
the N@@ HS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal backed the judgment last year that the N@@ HS is able to pay for Pr@@ EP , despite the Agency &apos;s own claims that the drug should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Simon Ste@@ 186 , Executive Director of N@@ HS Eng@@ land , welcomed this on Thursday as a &apos; swee@@ ping new intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &apos; momen@@ t@@ ous moment &apos; .
sexual health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ l and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to register people , and in October , further clin@@ ics will be added before the programme is introduced in all parts of England by April 2018 .
the disability @-@ prec@@ urs@@ or ( Pr@@ EP ) is a hot@@ line for HIV drugs that is taken before the incident to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
clinical trials show that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people who are at risk of infection .
Pr@@ EP before taking the interim procedure means that there is sufficient amount of certain medicines in the human body that prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can take place on a daily basis or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure .
the right candidates include L@@ GB@@ T men , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are HIV @-@ infected and do not receive treatment .
the people who find themselves in appropriate contact with HIV are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen to have their family doctor in the family in their own country will also be able to register their desire to participate in the local sex health clin@@ ics .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and N@@ HS England signed the contract to get medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the clinical test aims to assess the true potential of Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who is treated and how it is consumed and implemented in a large cloud .
Ste@@ 186 said : &apos; this new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and enhance the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
this is another milestone in the fight for more than three decades against one of the greatest human health problems . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , the chief executive of NA@@ T , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if properly targeted at those who need it and belong to risk level , will be able to change the British HIV epidemic .
since September , people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool , individually managed and not dependent on the partner negotiations , thereby improving many lives , through this clinical trial funded by the N@@ HS .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian Green , Executive Director of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Foundation , said : &apos; now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is launched quickly across the country and that no person in the HIV risk group is excluded .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been received , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
the Minister for Public Health , Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , said : &apos; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is a very welcome and very late after months of delay and the cen@@ sus of government sho@@ es .
evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will lead us a step closer to a complete understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
it is now important that a clinical trial is introduced as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV and to move us a step closer to stopping HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
in July , the difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania in electricity prices fell to EUR 1.@@ 94 , compared with EUR 7.@@ 71 in June this year , Ele@@ ring .
the main reason for the price gap is the rich links between Lithuania and Sweden .
in Estonia , the average electricity exchange rate was set at EUR 34.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ ge hour last month and the price rose by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five percent to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ ge hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 34.@@ 17 and the electricity exchange rate on Nord Stream was EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ va@@ ge hour .
prices rose by 12 and 7 % respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity was mobile by 75 % last month in Estonia and 16 % in the hours of Estonia and Finland .
the other nine per cent of the two @-@ hour transactions between the two countries did not take place next day .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity was mobile from Estonia to Latvia at 99 % and 73 % of the hours was used by the full transmission capacity .
according to the July last trading day , Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X on the market , the electricity exchange price for August could reach approximately EUR 34 and € 37 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ ge hour .
the carbon price affecting electricity production prices came up last month and transactions were worth 5.@@ 04 @-@ 5.@@ 47 € / 5.@@ 47 per tonne .
living a higher life - half @-@ order and smart design schemes have made it a little bit of ca@@ mp@@ ine ca@@ mp@@ les of Court of Justice &apos;s home
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker who is a passion@@ ate building innova@@ tor , changed his home of K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in 2014 against the Ear@@ ls Court &apos;s kor@@ una .
it is in the first order of Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ ţ@@ i , and that Jo@@ anne has not brought his bags together and sold the fla@@ ts , has been a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived together with a former life @-@ rich com@@ pass in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge on much wider ground , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I wanted something that would be equivalent to the price I have offered .
I was shown by the Ear@@ ls Court of Justice &apos;s flat and had the same high waves .
I knew about this and made a offer on the same day . &quot;
since the first visit , this 93 @-@ me@@ tre cor@@ ps have passed a complete innovation gap .
it was a s@@ lee@@ ping paper and a complex fix - a paper had to be walk through kit@@ chen to reach a s@@ lee@@ ping wall - and a desire to add ca@@ tering and semi @-@ regulation to exploit high levels of talent .
&quot; I wanted high , big win@@ dows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he is asking Er@@ fan Az@@ ad N@@ ot@@ ting , a design and design nuclear site , Du@@ ck &amp; Order , to exploit 3.@@ 8 m e@@ ars and to create a home that is not just a development site but a place where Jo@@ anne can live .
it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create a qu@@ asi @-@ order where to stand .
the Er@@ fan had to approach the matter in a creative way .
&quot; aquaculture is rather complex , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise the premises so that they were located on one another without having to be bo@@ gged down .
it was not just about building a platform , but using steel design to ensure that the upper and lower space is the right one . &quot;
this emphasis allowed Er@@ fan@@ s to create two fla@@ mb@@ les with full e@@ tude alongside each other in the room , with a lot of dramatic elements .
one @-@ off is the old @-@ day light of the R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us window , which is looking at the gla@@ ci@@ ers under the car@@ pet .
the gold fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ pa@@ ci@@ g@@ ne Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille &apos;s lighting highlight the style of space .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theat@@ re , space and light courses .
both sides of the short corridor have been included to ensure that it appears longer .
in the night , the mir@@ ror is giving the impression of another window opening up with the can@@ na@@ bis .
in the course of the exercise , the cen@@ sus provides a reflection of the deposit for all the eating disorders and glass requirements of Jo@@ anne .
the debt to live is added to the possibility of closing the vegetables if they are not used , creating a more den@@ se space for the mo@@ tive .
the cu@@ mber@@ some kit@@ chen cu@@ cu@@ mbers are nothing new .
however , with this kit@@ chen , it is unique that this is a s@@ and@@ board of gar@@ age types of u@@ pris@@ ings .
&apos;@@ This went a little into design , &apos; explains the image of the M@@ D@@ F , which has been spo@@ iled with a multi@@ tude of Er@@ fan ter@@ as@@ as@@ as@@ tron@@ om@@ y .
&quot; this has a counter@@ weight , so it is very simply a mix@@ ture of a qu@@ an@@ tum leap to reject it . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and maintenance , Jo@@ anne now has 16 additional computers , additional s@@ lee@@ ping rooms and better harves@@ ting .
after all , the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to property - &apos; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ Kin@@ nis@@ mineral land k@@ ler takes an outdated form of tu@@ p and makes calculations based on the area of land &apos; .
here they have been able to increase the sur@@ faces , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to the space .
&quot; materials are what you have to do and thus help to create emotional links with your home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ You do not love the electricity c@@ ables in my se@@ in .
this is important , but it does not put heart languages ring@@ ing . &quot;
this shows that good design and an increased area of land help to do something aston@@ ishing from a rather normal cor@@ ps .
in fact , they can even cause a desire not to leave , as happened with Jo@@ anne .
the chief figure , Jen@@ sen , is Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s pil@@ o@@ qu@@ er@@ old pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um , who is competing with my colleague for his profession@@ alism .
you cannot count on anything but the amount of money you earn , which is not forgotten about any ethics .
his wife and three children only see his hus@@ band on his property and on the late hour .
in the first part of the film , I find myself in the idea that it is a &apos; home of the Ca@@ ar@@ di@@ um &apos; version of the business world - even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s speech is similar .
what film will continue to do , the less the c@@ abinet element remains , and the mor@@ alising intention of film makers is beginning to appear more and more .
a life @-@ changing experience is the main driver &apos;s disease of po@@ pp@@ y .
now there is a need to make a choice between work and family life .
the po@@ et d@@ ressing the doctor at the ru@@ ins of Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s great buildings is putting his father into thinking about matters of real importance such as religion , welfare , love ... without even affecting the twin @-@ scale disaster .
after the third as@@ tron@@ om@@ y , where the son &apos;s father opens the eyes , it is felt that film makers have certainly come to the target of getting the audience bu@@ ried , because even the most ne@@ edi@@ est heart @-@ oriented vie@@ wer is unable to keep the cu@@ cu@@ mbers back when it comes to the suffering of the cu@@ le cancer patients .
if a son falls into the House and his situation seems to be hope@@ less , father will finally understand the moral nature of his work and will do a good job for the elderly .
now I am lu@@ cky in my own sense - if the film has a flu , then I would reward my sense of vision after the film coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , then the st@@ and@@ le may be congratulated for at least one surprise .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ice coff@@ ee will be lost - when the hus@@ band calls a sick man and a man dri@@ ves a si@@ ck@@ ery along the road to the slow @-@ line .
however , the Po@@ e@@ g has been ama@@ zing , and although his father has lost his job , it is even positive , because now is time to deal with the family .
I can also feel very well - I can predict the end of the American dra@@ ma quite well .
in truth , film is well constructed , all the elements needed to do so are in place .
you get a Council , you get a laugh@@ ing , you can see , the players are a good and moral beau@@ ty : money is not the most important thing in life .
this film is well introduced by surprise .
the new Staff Com@@ man@@ der of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ m intends to limit President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps Mr Kelly will actually manage this .
in that case , it would be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff chief of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope that it will keep the excess in a more balanced way .
there is a full report from Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ an here :
&quot; when John F@@ . Kelly met high officials on his first day of work , the White House revealed a key problem with President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ ges Ma@@ in , which he plans to solve the poor flow of information to President Assad .
Mr Kelly told officials that information must be made available to him , either on paper or at meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried to do so and have failed to tame T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i by monitoring its media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades and , even now that he is in White Ma@@ in , his TV @-@ watching habits have not gone anywhere .
&quot; when the candidate T@@ ru@@ mp was a pa@@ use for unfair media coverage , he was shown to be fairly reflected in the statements affecting him , &quot; said S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg Poli@@ ti@@ co@@ s in February .
Poli@@ tic@@ o Star@@ Pal@@ mer wrote at the time that &apos; T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter &apos;s campaign officer said that the key to controlling the behaviour of the ter @-@ habits is to ensure that his individual media consumption is also accompanied by a stable endorsement . &apos;
well , it is .
but the idea that the habits of using T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter have once been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaig@@ ners know something that the rest of us do not know that the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i ro@@ b would have been even more hear@@ tening without these interventions .
we will probably never know about the s@@ kin@@ s that the T@@ ru@@ mp did not announce .
if he was hel@@ ple@@ ss able to save him a few times from the ca@@ mp@@ ments , his efforts were worth doing so .
but no one has been able to prevent T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i from constantly creating controversy .
part of the problem is that in the White House , which consists of competing tactics between them , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception by transferring materials to the T@@ ru@@ el that support their world views but may not always be reliable .
the policy de@@ pic@@ ting the whole story was written in May by advis@@ ers of the tendency to feed the President to provide strategic questionable information .
one of the examples of the report , Mr Gold@@ ma@@ cher , is as follows :
&quot; the current and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i sub@@ mits that T@@ ru@@ mp can react to negative press pressures , particularly harmful information spots , explo@@ ding , taking as a fi@@ xation the identification of their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February when someone gave the President a che@@ er@@ fully copy of the Internet provocation to Charles C. The website of G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com , which belongs to Joh@@ n@@ son , accused of being the chief officer , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , that he was a white house &apos; source of multiple le@@ aks &apos; .
it is no different that Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of his mo@@ use , or that he did not provide any specific evidence or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
the T@@ ru@@ mp read the article and started asking the sub@@ jective Wal@@ sh@@ i . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , the then staff chief of Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us and the White House , has tried to establish a system for managing and documentation documents reaching T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective than he is in the head of Pri@@ eb@@ us@@ s , but the T@@ ru@@ mp is still an impul@@ se and his assis@@ tant will still compete for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make the mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans from abroad will not be allowed to get a bitter address .
many foreigners are in the city of Tallinn .
those with whom the study came to the fire recognised that it was the elderly who played in the old era without the permission of the city government .
the first thing we found was the three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who had taken the same number of co@@ ws with Vir@@ u gates .
it was clear that the mus@@ ici@@ ans with the pat@@ tern and the broken hard@@ lin@@ ers were the Kosov@@ ars of ab@@ sen@@ tia , who would be taken away by one of the de@@ ser@@ ts .
despite the violence , the only woman in the company played a la@@ di@@ al de@@ se@@ cra@@ tion in the a@@ partment , while one man , alongside him , called the three faces and the de@@ scen@@ dants closer .
the third man had sat on his back home and smo@@ ked the fla@@ ir @-@ made farms themselves .
their three do@@ gs were not allowed to distur@@ b the people who have passed .
Mr Bo@@ b , who has been ž@@ mu@@ le@@ cted with his No@@ emi and the pal@@ lia@@ tes , said that he is we@@ aring the streets for both fu@@ n and money .
the purpose of the event was to collect ticket costs on a ship travelling to Finland on the same day .
as to whether they asked for permission from the city for ro@@ tation , No@@ emi and Bo@@ b were sha@@ king their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we never have more than a day or a few towns and , in most cases , we are allowed to do so for a month or so .
it makes no sense to pay for this , &quot; explained by Bo@@ b .
when we returned to Vir@@ u &apos;s gates some 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in mus@@ ici@@ ans and are going to go .
the Chamber had the cour@@ ty@@ ard to come to the gates of Vir@@ u Centre .
three Polish young men , one of whom played a f@@ ence , were also present on the street of Vir@@ u , and the third had even been able to carry out electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people enter@@ tainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and life , &quot; tri@@ o from the pi@@ pe M@@ iv@@ os@@ h explained .
according to M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there must be permission from the city Government to take part .
&apos;@@ We do not have it &apos; , of course , he said it jo@@ ke .
but we hope that , when people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
of course , when police comes , we go elsewhere , but try and do it , &apos; he added .
the Estonian bank purchased bonds worth EUR 149 million in the public sector programme of central banks in the euro area , with a bank bond portfolio of EUR 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank does not provide more detailed information on purchases .
Estonian bank President Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son has made it clear in the past that the Central Bank &apos;s assets buy @-@ up Scheme covers three different buy programmes : covered bonds ( SIS II ) , asset @-@ backed bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public debt ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases will fall from the production of lower @-@ risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks .
as a rule , under the public sector bond buy each Central Bank &apos;s own government bonds , other countries &apos; bonds are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank will be making &apos; substitute purchases &apos; within the amount allocated to them .
Central Ban@@ ks also shop in those countries where the bond offer is limited .
the Estonian bank , confirmed by H@@ ans@@ son , generally bu@@ ys bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian bank will purchase bonds under the asset buy @-@ up scheme as of March 2015 .
meanwhile , Ele@@ mp@@ ire bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian bank no longer bought up Ele@@ ction bonds in June 2016 .
on behalf of the central banks in the euro area , both Ele@@ t@@ ches and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds will be bought by the Bank of Finland from June .
migrants ignore degrees and return to the &apos; millions of business building &apos;
some of the West Mid@@ lands &apos;s most prosperous home owners have once again found themselves in fier@@ ce confrontation with determined migration , who have ignored the une@@ le@@ cted bureaucra@@ ts of the coun@@ ty to win back their walls .
migrants have par@@ ked their 20 tra@@ ilers on the brink of a wealthy &apos; mil@@ d &apos; of millions of business in the near So@@ meat ul@@ li street .
they have returned together with the army of hor@@ ses , children and lorries , after they were s@@ nat@@ ched out of the wall only in May , without being thrown into a cra@@ dle of the bureaucra@@ cies that were complaining of to block their invasion by the Council .
the group found a weak place in the protection limits , turning its vehicles through the un@@ blocked part that had been left to po@@ p .
the people of the City of Dis@@ tri@@ ct have been s@@ kir@@ ted by the So@@ meat Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless in dealing with the problem &apos; .
a anon@@ ymous person said : &apos; they cop@@ ied there on Monday evening after they were expelled from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ y , where they were st@@ oring fur@@ ni@@ ture .
the Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were delayed and now they are back again .
they came to the end of the night , probably more today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect his par@@ ks .
I live on the road of street et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k and I am not happy that I must continue to pay a total of authorisations if the Council cannot even block such a thing . &quot;
a local resident who also wanted to be anon@@ ymous said , &apos; this is ridiculous , and we have only seen the last of these migrants leave , and there is already a new offensive .
this time , the number has increased and even the hor@@ ror has been seen in ru@@ min@@ ence . &quot;
So@@ meat City Council said : &apos; we are aware that in the land near the street et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k road , there is an unacceptable camp and we are working with the So@@ meat ul@@ li police , we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
it will be very helpful to gather evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling a figure 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ na festi@@ val also visits the Minister for Culture , In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is pleased that he has been able to bring real world top names to Estonia .
the question of why so important for the Est@@ oni@@ ans at the We@@ ek@@ ise festi@@ val is Sa@@ ar that this should be asked of all those who enjoy three days at the festi@@ val .
but he will admit that the real players in his area have come to the Per@@ sian region .
&quot; looking at the level of artists that has been able to bring home to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music director - often not in our qu@@ ery - are spoken of a Minister for Culture .
however , which festi@@ val are artists who are most telling themselves ?
I consider myself to be relatively old and , for some of the elderly , one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ new@@ re@@ n , who stood up last night .
he has , after all , complicated all of us at some point , &apos; he says .
however , he will also mention a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ Roure i , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ bels .
of course , our own Estonian players : starting from NO@@ avian , and they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , this concentration of known names is very high , &quot; he says .

Au@@ di upgra@@ des up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the light of criticism by car manufacturers
the day before the Au@@ di announcement , B@@ M@@ W said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of B@@ M@@ W , the company believes that &apos; there are smarter alternatives than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the B@@ M@@ W home city of Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe are being upgra@@ ded to reduce emissions of diesel engines .
no company described these operations as a provocation .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide , which dri@@ ves from diesel engines , is considered carcinogenic and could lead to as@@ th@@ ma .
the cost of equipment installed for neutr@@ alising emissions from diesel vehicles will also increase for car manufacturers , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s Government is also accused of calling powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , who was silent about the use of &apos; pe@@ tro@@ le@@ ry &apos; that allowed emissions fa@@ res to be adapted to regulations when testing a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
several Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , a former head of the Au@@ di engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
former President Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o is Italian and therefore is not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Au@@ di in Germany was drawn to a criminal investigation into Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen when the authorities accused the installation of the Audit System to evade European emission performance requirements , thereby extending the investigation that had previously been focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Au@@ di in the investigation may be a major blow to the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen holder of Luxembour@@ luxury cars disproportionately generates the profits of a large proportion of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen .
Estonian schools are receiving 20 000 euro of EU flags .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags for the purpose of breaking the Presidency by 1 September .
a total of 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 c@@ enti@@ metres of the European Union &apos;s flag will be 5@@ 70 education institutions .
flags are intended to be used to in@@ ject in@@ voices , they must also be carried out in high quality printed material with a sense of at@@ testa@@ tion , and the ER@@ R news portal is facilitated .
the flag bank has a text : &apos; Kin@@ gi@@ tus to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education , or EUR 35 is paid by a flag .
murder of journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
the workers of the weekly newspaper , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , usually gather on Wednesday to review plans for the most recent chaos in the state of Blue authorisation , so@@ wed by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ stop@@ p@@ able drug wars .
but today they have gathered in the shadow of their personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their rou@@ tine .
two parents &apos; authors will be discussing which looks safer : whether to bring children to their offices , which were the target of the gran@@ ch@@ attack in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the leader of the space : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask repor@@ ters to provide the names of each water in each of them with evidence from theory is unnecessary , they are sufficient to impres@@ sions and in@@ ner feelings .
the presence of government or car@@ tels is suspected of being drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists alike , of being a pa@@ per@@ work list that makes it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
violence is not a s@@ tun@@ ning w@@ ound and the more dead people are accumu@@ lating across the country , the majority of which are journalists from Yemen , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists , since the election of President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ş@@ to at least 25 in December 2012 , 5@@ 89 journalists under public protection following attacks and threats , and this year at least 7 journalists have still died in seven countries .
the last death toll includes their edit@@ or and source of inspiration , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as , co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many reports on drug @-@ related violence .
his absence makes a deep felt , even though his presence can be felt anywhere in the scene of the Bu@@ il@@ ding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , a big picture of the Val@@ de@@ z@@ est , which shows an average finger , with the &apos; Justice &apos; and the &apos; two 30@@ n@@ ines repor@@ ters , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez &apos; , carries T s@@ nus images or a face of his s@@ mil@@ s or a pan@@ ac@@ ea characteristic of him .
the meeting will take place less than two months after death , and the Re@@ por@@ ters will discuss a common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , their hope@@ lessness , their paran@@ o@@ ia .
although a separate public Prosecutor &apos;s case was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders , which amount to thousands , the kil@@ lers of journalists rarely reach justice .
the edit@@ orial action of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce will continue to reflect the violence in your own country , even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and justice of murde@@ rers , the meeting on security will not be of great use , as I@@ bar@@ ra said .
&apos;@@ It is very nice to waste time here at the meeting &apos; .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , you will have a lot of trust . &quot;
Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the capital of the State , Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , on 15 May morning .
he managed to drive just a few quarters before two men stopped his red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ rol@@ la , forcing him to exit the car and shot him 12 times , which is expected to be the name of the newspaper , meaning &apos; twel@@ f@@ th river &apos; in translation .
the armed man went to the Val@@ de@@ z car and made an accident near it .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adult children .
the people who have been floo@@ ded are spreading freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
however , the Val@@ dez issue is mainly dominated by silence .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition of the United States in January , the Blue Card has been one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country , as ri@@ val f@@ ers are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
it is no different that people are thrown off every day on the streets of your licence , or even several , or that the dead are s@@ nat@@ ched from the gru@@ es@@ ome two @-@ time swe@@ ets of drug art , which are more than many homes .
let us forget for a moment that the time of peace indicates how valuable ports and the sea state with drug routes to the United States only leads one car@@ tel .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce is feeling the co @-@ foun@@ der and President , Is@@ May Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , who was the most innocent to defend his friend .
he believes that two mistakes were promoted by killing .
the first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons in the face of the S@@ ik@@ ame@@ he D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z@@ zi po@@ cket .
this piece of correspon@@ dence could have been allu@@ ded to by the supposedly suspect gang members , all cop@@ ies of the publications were bought as soon as they were reached in the newspapers .
another mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country for his own security , after the crackdown took place in another newspaper that has been equally respected .
Val@@ dez was leg@@ ally in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to be present forever .
he served as a ve@@ ter@@ an@@ repor@@ ter in the No@@ ro@@ este newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , sold 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said that in your blue &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without tou@@ ching on the drug problem &apos; .
the newspaper has extended its awareness and publicity with its courageous and honest labels , and sales and advertising grew .
the re@@ por@@ ters were keen to express vigorous studies without fear of censorship and read@@ ers s@@ le@@ ep in a print they could read stories that no one else da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after the launch of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspaper won the award of Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ oti for her reports in Latin America .
in the same year , the Committee for the Protection of Val@@ dez journalists ( AK@@ K ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow Mexic@@ an drug creation wherever it takes .
he admitted openly that he was afraid .
&apos;@@ I want to live on , &apos; he said that when he received the AK@@ K Prize .
last October , he said in an interview given to the television channel Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Y@@ our country .
&apos;@@ H@@ e to accept the task of becoming a second chance to play the game with the media office .
I do not want to ask me what I did when faced with so many deaths or why I did not talk about what is going on . &quot;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ lo@@ lo@@ vas lon@@ el@@ low Val@@ de@@ z , a jo@@ ke who ro@@ p@@ pered like mad@@ r@@ us , a friend who divided embry@@ os and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their support to his ru@@ ins .
he always we@@ ed his own village .
he went across the office to El Salvador ba@@ ari and was always on the same des@@ k .
now they ask whether his stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness was fatal .
his death has also cast them in doubt about how best to do his job and to stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the arrogance of their women , their children , their legitimate businesses , their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&apos;@@ Th@@ ese things should not have been touched , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination even in the best times .
tr@@ usted in your in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
if it is a matter of suspi@@ ci@@ ously fra@@ ming , it is a ho@@ le away .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce edit@@ or And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ ali said that the problem is that &apos; od@@ ality can be dece@@ ived ... and so it was J@@ avi@@ er@@ ga &apos; .
he and others say that in your blue @-@ like situation , there will no longer be old rules , just as they do not apply in the Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ k , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ ros or other states , which are home to the toxic composition of profitable smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in a space where Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only the pu@@ pi@@ l sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
two police officers were seeking a rela@@ xation of 40 degrees of heat in front of the house , hiding behind the pu@@ mps .
they have appointed a more elected Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office in the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an central class in the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an building .
some of the repor@@ ters were half jo@@ ke to wonder whether these police officers were among the 50 % of the police officers who themselves have been dis@@ credi@@ ted by the Governor .
several months have passed since reports have been travelling to mountainous rural areas where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gan@@ gs .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s publication this week dealt with three main features .
one of them was the murder of former po@@ x@@ om@@ al@@ leg@@ o Ju@@ li@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez ven@@ na in Sin@@ al@@ o .
they also had an ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant story of spending government funds on the city of the Governor .
and a group of people was kidna@@ pped from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants , which is a quarter of the public office .
there was no official announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how it happened , so caution had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of flu is a place of interest for drug traffickers and public authorities alike .
the Guard became public aware of documents that a restaur@@ ant is registered as a policy for the establishment of a ruling institution in the Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
recently , several IR@@ P Governor has been accused of widespread coverage of cases of corruption .
in Vil@@ lar@@ line , the report asked the report to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Gu@@ z@@ man , who wear the name of El Chap@@ o , was saved by military bet@@ ra@@ yal .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have been looking to the Qu@@ a@@ es@@ ty of Val@@ dez to obtain information about kidna@@ pping from the best sources .
&quot; in the past we would have known what happened , &apos; said 46 years old in Vil@@ lar@@ line , whose body construction has earned him a ban@@ ner El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all the channels of communication have broken down with our sources . &quot;
the Val@@ de@@ z office has become a reser@@ vo@@ id of bridges and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the workers who have been employed have become something they could never expect to wait for activists on behalf of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez seized a few bridges and a guide next morning to the local Prosecutor &apos;s office for another journalist .
Mr Salvador A@@ va disappeared in the western state of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an three days after the killing of Val@@ dez .
it has been found to be a dead body and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists have become more popular across the country and are cri@@ pp@@ ling the phrase &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; to the pa@@ vements and buildings as organised protest .
on that day , President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez will have an international contribution to put the justice in the Val@@ dez case .
a day after the death of Val@@ dez , when meeting with the Governor of the Y@@ our oa bar , Ra@@ mi@@ rez accused the authorities of c@@ rying out journalists and killing them for telling the truth .
after that , he asked for his or her to be diver@@ ted from the government &apos;s activities elsewhere , concerned that hatred had had had had had had had had an impact on objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ cul@@ p@@ able state officials and indifferent society .
in his last book &apos; drug media &apos; , he wrote that the repor@@ ters are not only killing drugs gan@@ gs , but also under the command of politicians and security forces who are at the mer@@ cy of organised crime .
Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , awarded more than half of the attacks on the police and public officials last year .
&apos;@@ In Mexico , you are going to be silent , &apos; Ra@@ mi@@ rez said .
the adverse effects are obviously bloody .
nobody will forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ ger , Mrs E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as , in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ k six years ago .
he was found dead with a letter that I think had been signed by the car@@ tel L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
his ma@@ pped @-@ up near the head of his home was found by computer glass and e@@ ars .
some publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the northern border state of El Nor@@ te , Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , following the killing of their correspon@@ dent missile fan B@@ Sot@@ h in March .
others will continue as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do did after their murder in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug car@@ tel with a flagship edit@@ orial &apos; What do you want ? &apos;
some journalists have fled their home states or even their country .
this is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
it is difficult to find work in this case and they still have to find out today to avoid dangers .
and sometimes they are being persecuted , as probably happened with the photo@@ graph Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered three months after the Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z break in 2015 , with four women in Mexico , in a year in 2015 .
those who remain in the ground and continue to work must be tan@@ g@@ led every day around risky decisions .
the I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to become a po@@ et ad@@ mits that the reporting of drug trafficking frigh@@ tens him .
&quot; Mexico is on the way to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
at a recent mid@@ night of Friday , when the latest number had already been s@@ nat@@ ched , the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was wal@@ ked up and be@@ ating to the office when suddenly all telephone lines began to be cal@@ ib@@ rated .
19 people were killed in fire @-@ fighting between ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces in the exceptionally cu@@ mber@@ some city of Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ is .
the war es@@ cor@@ ted the war , as did a number of messages left by car@@ tels found in the area .
according to the same pa@@ vements , repor@@ ters made news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce site using mobile phones .
in the front of next day , a change was needed .
the scen@@ es were seized by another arrival in the region of Constan@@ ţ@@ a .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pi@@ il@@ la was on the guard to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not at least show it .
the de@@ ser@@ t @-@ down foun@@ der , under a massive ban@@ kno@@ te , where his average finger is displayed on the whole blue , was carried out by the workers of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in his foot@@ steps .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w could you think about closure , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; on the same day that Javier Javier was killed , a practical inter@@ face asked me to send a report to the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur used the &apos; protective colour &apos; to avoid enemies
at first sight , it looks like a form , albeit rather frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now made public the first findings of the incredible rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ rate size discovered by Canadian min@@ ers , which has so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; din@@ osa@@ ur Mon@@ a Lis@@ a &apos; .
it has been so well preserved that it was even possible to establish that the sk@@ in covered by his so@@ oms was a red @-@ bo@@ y col@@ oured colour and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
in a magaz@@ ine published by Health Bi@@ ology , the report on status described as &apos; the best preserved so@@ om@@ om@@ al@@ ment of so@@ di@@ um , which has ever been found &apos; and &apos; one of the best Cur@@ ricul@@ um read@@ ings worldwide &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new category of no@@ do@@ sa@@ x@@ ist that lived in the middle of the seas@@ on@@ age , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
its incredibly good retention in Rab@@ a was carried out by theat@@ res describing it as &apos; truly significant &apos; .
this ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um @-@ covered plant feed has , according to National Ge@@ o@@ sian , remained the best preserved type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus ever found .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn functional , he found it when he extra@@ cted Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um in For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
he has caught something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into it .
the adver@@ tised ph@@ os@@ pha@@ te was sent to the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um .
for the next six years , it was designed to extra@@ ct the animal from 2 500 na@@ vi@@ es ( 1@@ 100 kilometres ) to land .
after all this hard work , the end result is now finally ready to bring the public to the table .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen you put a little eyes on your eyes , you can almost believe he s@@ le@@ ep , &apos; Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , the leading author , said , the theat@@ re Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell muse@@ um , where the presence is being w@@ aged .
&quot; this goes down in the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved din@@ osa@@ ur - din@@ osa@@ ur Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana .
when he studied his sk@@ in , he found that this vege@@ tation , although covered by so@@ di@@ um and rese@@ mb@@ ling a pal@@ p@@ able tan@@ k , was likely to be a significant threat to meat @-@ food din@@ osa@@ ences .
this high @-@ level din@@ osa@@ ur used a red and white defence col@@ ours to hide from pre@@ da@@ tors and applied shel@@ tering techniques , which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
this allowed the respondents to enter the din@@ osa@@ ur better , and the enemy to be prevented , as the major din@@ osa@@ urs probably thought he was hun@@ ted .
this figure , which is the family of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ic t@@ ree , aged 110 , was first reached in the news in May and is now visited in the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um .
researchers have now looked into the existence of the 400 400 researchers , giving it the name of the Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta Mar@@ mit@@ chel@@ li muse@@ um mark Mitchell , who spent more than 7 000 hours to reveal the suffering .
thanks to his ama@@ zing good survival , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the so@@ oms .
they found a dis@@ approval - a common method of protection in animal species - which meant that the title of status was a ve@@ ctor as a lower .
although the dis@@ approval is common , the bread comes as a surprise , as Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta is much greater than those of those with responsibility today .
this suggests that din@@ osa@@ ur pressure was sufficiently actively hun@@ ted by other meat additives , that the evolution preferred shel@@ tering rather than confrontation as a survi@@ v@@ ous policy .
however , most of the animals using modern forms of dis@@ approval - such as fear , se@@ als or ar@@ mad@@ weather - are far smaller and more vulnerable as a harvest , indicating that no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us had to really work to survive .
&quot; the strong me@@ ag@@ re @-@ me@@ ag@@ re of the huge and abundan@@ t so@@ aps shows how dangerous the endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered din@@ osa@@ ences could be , &quot; Brown said .
the chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds of So@@ om@@ organic comp@@ ounds also revealed that the comp@@ ound weight was a red ba@@ c@@ at .
scientists will continue to investigate the effects of this life , including the retained content of this salt style , in order to find out what the animal would last their sis@@ ter .
they believe that the din@@ osa@@ ur has fallen into the dead rivers , thereby entering the sea , where it was sun@@ k in the ocean .
at the time , Alber@@ tas was just as so@@ cc@@ able as it was today in South Flor@@ ence and rivers and oceans were likely to extend far beyond the internal land .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ sa@@ ur@@ us is truly significant , as it has fully covered so@@ di@@ um sk@@ in , but it has also remained three dimensions , maintaining the original shape , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal today sees almost the same thing as in the c@@ and@@ book era .
it does not have to be built with much imagination - it is enough simply to put bridges on the table and it seems he would be like s@@ lee@@ ping . &quot;
the time was for the crisis era , when huge swe@@ ets of meat feed - he@@ tero@@ sto@@ res - were s@@ tun@@ ned in the countryside .
although their Qu@@ e@@ en Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ u re@@ x lived millions years later than Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , this so@@ rely cher@@ ished din@@ osa@@ ur could have been w@@ et by some of his da@@ un@@ ting predecess@@ ors .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ sa@@ ur@@ us , a long and six @-@ tonne mon@@ ster with 38 leg@@ s ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) .
scientists whose recent findings are published in the Journal of Health Bi@@ ology believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta was u@@ hu@@ ta after death in the sea and this mu@@ z@@ ar@@ us did not .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn functional was detected when he extra@@ cted from For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near the Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um in Canada .
the muse@@ um says that it has been best preserved by so@@ om@@ om@@ al@@ sis in the world , including sk@@ in and so@@ oms , and it is comprehensive from concentration to pu@@ mps .
these assumptions were on average 18 leg@@ s ( five metres ) long and fixed at up to GBP 3 000 ( 1 300 kg ) .
two 20 customs miles were inva@@ ded from this .
scientists believe that this beautiful mon@@ as@@ tery , which was covered by so@@ aps , was through the current Western Canada until the river floo@@ ded in its opening sea was proud .
but the landing site of the din@@ osa@@ ur was instrumental in maintaining its so@@ y@@ ings in an excellent detail .
the ice of this particular father , coal , has so well preserved that my@@ g@@ arch@@ ical so@@ om@@ al@@ ate super@@ power stations are still covered by sk@@ in ice .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote in the National Ge@@ o@@ sian magaz@@ ine , &apos; such sta@@ teh@@ ood is as rare as lo@@ to@@ victory .
the more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
the bur@@ nt sk@@ in bears still cover the my@@ ste@@ rious so@@ di@@ um @-@ based .
a better front is lying alongside him and the five st@@ olen ones are si@@ len@@ ced .
I can count the so@@ y@@ ings he has on . &quot;
how did one activist find a response to the question of &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll was received a complete shock .
just a day after the trip to New York , it was the Mayor of Lou@@ ba Air@@ b@@ n@@ b on the le@@ ak@@ ed bed bed , si@@ x@@ iting Facebook on the phone .
he came on top of his former school teacher &apos;s post .
it said : &apos; the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ents and still han@@ g on the streets &apos; .
he was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his stream , so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
the P@@ ide@@ ga @ The@@ e@@ P@@ Mil@@ ah user &apos;s mail was repeatedly distributed on his time@@ line .
St@@ . Sy@@ n@@ chron@@ chron@@ ous Sch@@ ol@@ lin , from the Lou@@ ise region , sent a real @-@ time ta@@ g to Michael Brown , the death of an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by the Con@@ gus@@ s@@ our@@ is White Police officer .
he gave an image of the life of Brown in a body that was found in the street , leaving it for four hours .
&apos;@@ It is cra@@ zy , &apos; said Ferreira &apos;s modification .
however , death was nothing new for him or for the community .
he put his phone off but later this evening he saw the ta@@ g that announced the people &apos;s arrival in Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
the J@@ ag@@ ati photo@@ graph@@ s of the police and the people who were afraid and a man who claimed to be the father of Brown and kept the letter &apos; Fer@@ gus@@ on police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &apos;
he watched a real @-@ time flow where the police officer stood up to the protest group with a gra@@ ves do@@ zen .
another video was a police officer who said that &apos; I kill all ... animals &apos; .
Fer@@ rell will remember how it has caught up in the thought : &apos; it is unusual &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is not a murder of this kind that we are ac@@ custo@@ med to and which we could describe as typical &apos; .
I felt frigh@@ tened at that point .
I was ang@@ ry and I have asked . &apos;
he boo@@ ked a return flight and he was travelling home next day .
having bu@@ ried at 23 : 00 , she went on her father for his six @-@ year da@@ u@@ ghter and decided that they would travel to Fer@@ gus@@ on next morning .
what took place with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ ga over the next three years is the central issue of the new docu@@ mentary &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; . ( &apos; whose thanks ? &apos; ) , which will be present in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those living in this community who have delivered on their streets in demanding responses .
when Mrs Ferreira , with her da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a li@@ ps@@ y stic@@ ker and a ch@@ at with it - was travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ on , they re@@ talked about the subject that they had repeatedly spoken about before this morning - the experience and living conditions of black men .
&quot; remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &quot;
&quot; we are now travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ on because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on board , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll later .
&apos;@@ What is happening now is the cul@@ mination of ... what happened in the past .
it must know and see this and grow in the middle of it .
it must learn about the organisation of a activists and , at the same time , feel different la@@ yers of experience and living conditions for the Muslim people , and what we must do to be free and free .
even if I manage to raise him in such a way that he does not personally copy brutal racism , he does not distinguish between another black girl .
I feel I would be doing him a dis@@ service if I would protect him from this world . &quot;
the first stop they did in the vic@@ inity of Fer@@ gus@@ oni was by South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ ti - the police station in the filling of the road , which had become a kind of camp camp mak@@ er , where activists were waiting for news about the police officer Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not ultimately charged with charges .
there , Mr Ferreira and his da@@ u@@ ghter joined the local business owner who made lunch @-@ based plants .
they brought together food homes and helped to divide them to the prote@@ sters .
for Fer@@ rell , a new type of activist was slowly taken into shape .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ ise University , he was the President of the Alliance of Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organisation .
all this was just a fi@@ as@@ co . &quot;
weeks later , during the Ferreira evening demonstration , a film com@@ ra@@ de , Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ i , met with a film director .
Fo@@ lay@@ an said that he and the film operator , Mr Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , simply wanted to document what is happening .
the question that came to mind in the Fer@@ rell was &apos; are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to reap the benefits of its generosity and resilience .
Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born and growing in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Fo@@ lay@@ an had already put his hand in hand with a fellow director D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ ati , an artificial in the region , who was well known for activists in connection with prisoners who were sentenced to death .
his involvement made the project attractive for Fer@@ rell and the other six local cities who were watched for years following the shooting of Brown .
&quot; in this docu@@ mentary , nobody is talking for us or for us , but we are speaking to ourselves , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; it was important for me how these people are portra@@ yed , because that is how I am portra@@ yed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rell - the intention was to show that the Movement is not a &apos; donor leader but a community bringing together &apos; , as outlined by Fo@@ lay@@ an - he was the most open to the film .
as a result , the &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; ? &apos; pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar personal aspects of the life of Fer@@ rell , such as ru@@ th@@ lessness and marriage with their wife .
&quot; I felt I was original , &apos; said Ferreira , s@@ mil@@ ing the first time that he saw the city .
&quot; but I realised that the human vulnerability of this work and of the black people must be accompanied by a certain amount of vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the Fer@@ rell affair underlines and puts the role of black L@@ GB@@ T women at the centre again in the wider Black Sea Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three initi@@ ators of the movement , who thought in 2012 , after the killing of H@@ ur@@ tan@@ ker teen@@ ag@@ ers , Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , were ex@@ tradi@@ ted by the social media , the subject reference # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter is homosexu@@ als .
&quot; women who are black homosexu@@ als in leadership roles have kept the movement in the field in general , &quot; said Ferreira , and this is precisely because we must fight on a number of fronts .
Roma women must bear all the burden . &quot;
Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed , saying that &apos; movement is indeed alive for black women , and many of them black homosexu@@ als &apos; .
he says , however , that &apos; this is not a kind of &apos; equal opportunities &apos; - Fer@@ rell was not chosen as the film &apos;s centre for his identity .
&quot; he was someone who evening the right energy , &quot; said .
&quot; but it is no coincidence that he was directly on the front@@ line , because the black L@@ GB@@ T woman is at stake when living in such hu@@ bs .
his energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , news camer@@ as Fer@@ gus@@ onto have long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the conditional sentences imposed on Fer@@ rell during the demonstration for blocking the road will last 2.5 years .
he describes the social policy atmosphere in the region he calls home , simply as &apos; huge free &apos; .
nonetheless , it still considers the man@@ tra it has been eating since it took the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ on a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing but to lose our chains . &quot;
7 examples of how to overcome We@@ ek@@ ise &apos;s po@@ ta@@ cl@@ one after the We@@ ek@@ ise
some of the most frequent me@@ as@@ les find , after a little bit of hot air , that they are suffering , hence help .
or the slogan &apos; Be@@ yond po@@ ta@@ ll , py@@ ra@@ mid &apos; .
but this is only inevitable postponement and a decent ble@@ s@@ sing for health .
what can you do to get to know better and to get out of the po@@ pp@@ y as pain@@ fully as possible after today and tomorrow &apos;s We@@ ek@@ ise tr@@ all or other pi@@ pes ?
Jo@@ o Water .
to alcohol , after a great deal of pi@@ pe in the morning ... or possibly even alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when using alcohol , it must somehow be recovered .
mineral materials are also thrown out of the body , with water , and se@@ sta@@ p is a good ha@@ ir to mineral water .
since , after being thrown off , swe@@ pt up , the swe@@ et is often irri@@ tated , it is particularly good if it is free or easily ga@@ zed .
let us walk .
it would certainly not cost the bo@@ y to split trees into the grand@@ mother - it could prove fatal to be a wrong decision .
but a simple walk @-@ out helps the body to recall once again what sense it is in life .
Coun@@ selling in T@@ el@@ gis and s@@ lee@@ ping po@@ pp@@ y is a more time @-@ consuming way to get a full .
give poor energy back gradually and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are getting off the th@@ y@@ cle from yesterday &apos;s over@@ run , it is certainly not worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
for example , a fresh pi@@ pe containing c@@ oo@@ p f@@ ans is on the wall to market as a body .
if health is already suffering from the South , then for example , the w@@ ed@@ ding could be tried .
and a little later , the Pan@@ or@@ ama .
the I@@ DP was avoided .
this di@@ u@@ re ta@@ g will free the body from the last water .
as has already been said , water and volume are your friends .
Re@@ par@@ ing pain@@ kil@@ lers .
if you can take a pain@@ kil@@ ler to prevent po@@ ta@@ cl@@ one on the evening , you have to deal with par@@ at@@ se@@ ta@@ t or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ pro@@ ph@@ et , not only alcohol , but you have to deal with the smoke and lose so much .
so many more h@@ its and , in the future , boys will be worse .
in addition , the Hol@@ y bear in the coff@@ ee meat is not going to be long enough .
if you take the pain@@ kil@@ ler morning , you will do it with a bot@@ tle of th@@ ick air - it irri@@ ves your already dra@@ gged swe@@ et swe@@ at .
or if you do not have a partner , you can do well with you .
it is about doing the same thing as wal@@ king , but it does not get a org@@ ary when it comes to doing it .
however , too active a pace and outrageous bet were avoided : during the bo@@ as@@ h@@ ant , physical effort should be moder@@ ating .
a jo@@ ke .
the words of friends of time with friends of friends of friends of friends of the past , the easy hand of the car@@ pet and the na@@ era am@@ ic@@ ably over both himself and others ( suffering ) .
the l@@ ung@@ s and na@@ vi@@ er may not be dis@@ charged , but they certainly have resulted in a more indiscriminate form of violence .
once again , the bo@@ y goes over anyway !
University of North@@ w@@ ester and Ox@@ ford , a person who is being sought as suspects in murder
the police say that a professor of the University of North@@ w@@ ester and Ox@@ ford are sought nation@@ ally and that suspects have been sought after deadly pet@@ ty pet@@ ty w@@ rap@@ ping w@@ ings , to find a single Chi@@ ic@@ ago luxury .
according to the C@@ oo@@ k Coun@@ ty papers , on Monday , arrests were issued without a distance of opportunity for 42 years of W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 years for the arrest of Andrew War@@ ren@@ i , accused of first @-@ instance murder for their alleged association in T@@ ren@@ ton H. Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ han@@ u .
according to the documents , 26 years of Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ tag@@ u died after repeated na@@ ils .
according to a warning , the Ch@@ ic@@ ago police station issued to the community , the body was found to be dead on 27 July .
police officers received telephone calls and found a victim with several tor@@ teries in the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house .
according to the officials , Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ tag@@ y was admitted to death and investi@@ g@@ ators are treating the murder as a minor , while the police are actively seeking two suspects .
La@@ vid has been working as co @-@ profes@@ sors of micro @-@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at the University of North@@ w@@ ester since 2007 .
in a statement sent as an e @-@ mail , Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , Vice @-@ President of University Public Relations , said that La@@ dows has now been temporarily removed from work and is forbid@@ den to enter the towns of the University of North@@ w@@ ester .
&quot; this is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of North@@ w@@ ester works with the investi@@ g@@ ators , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ arre@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant in the financial department at the University of Ox@@ ford .
the representative of the University of Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist US research authorities in every way possible &apos; .
furthermore , the statement stated that War@@ ren@@ i colleagues were shocked and wish to be ex@@ tradi@@ ted .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , Head of the Communications Department of Ch@@ ic@@ ago , urges the authorities to give themselves , with suspicion .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are , but we are increasingly busy defining the exact where@@ ab@@ outs , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , suspects are helped by local , regional and national authorities .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police received telephone calls from the chief of the Grand Pri@@ x Cor@@ ter@@ house , who had just received a k@@ ry@@ p@@ tic hin@@ t that something had happened in Cor@@ ps No 10@@ 08 .
according to the police , this was a ma@@ gic view .
it is not clear , according to the G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , whether the event was also taking place on 27 July .
he said that the security camer@@ as confirm the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ res and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the Grand Chi@@ lean leadership sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police is currently working to find a background to events and victims , and will examine various mo@@ tives , including the possibility of a family dispute . &apos;
firms that help your businesses avoid getting next U@@ b@@ B
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ up company , but the surveys were un@@ profitable .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised anon@@ ymous , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is running the Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed Company , which sel@@ ls e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees in San Franc@@ is@@ co .
so he called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups with new types of human resources are emerging to help businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licen@@ sing software that aims to measure the involvement of workers , they enable companies to carry out a f@@ lash survey , target specific teams and demographic groups , provide anon@@ y@@ mity and complaint @-@ raising for workers and , in some cases , allow in@@ sure@@ rs to by@@ pass the level C management and address the Bureau directly .
&apos;@@ There are now tools such as Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ ler , which are meant to monitor health , but where is F@@ it@@ bi for your company ? &apos; asked Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O Reding City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ sts use companies to measure the inclusion of workers .
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , he has received a much better overview of what he thinks and knows about in three years when he has used G@@ lin@@ ti .
in addition to the investigation and the study for specific teams , it provides a company &apos;s heating card , which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , enabling them to identify the causes .
companies have started to understand that they must stay in touch with their culture of work , so as not to become the next U@@ b@@ bar , which has been ri@@ fe in scandals since the former worker published a blo@@ gg@@ er@@ mail , which described a men@@ tor@@ ing environment for those who da@@ red to speak .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , the desire to have an overview is a profitable business option .
global governance , regulation and conformity can be worth more than USD 118@@ .@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the Financial ethics Statis@@ tics website L@@ et &apos;s talk translations .
the Den@@ ver@@ is Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o start @-@ up company SR , which helps companies to prevent and identify inappropriate behaviour , noted this year interest and an increase in activity against the background of the dubious reputation of U@@ beria .
FIF@@ c@@ enti@@ l has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber recently registered himself as a customer .
like G@@ lin@@ les , FIF@@ 7.5 companies will be able to send tailor @-@ made impul@@ se polls , collect confidential answers in real time and look at the problematic areas of heat cards .
it also offers a anon@@ ymous message @-@ sheet that enables workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has an@@ cho@@ red regulators , &quot; said Integration cen@@ ti &apos;s foun@@ der and CE@@ O Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that if a company is found to be poorly treating its workers or acting une@@ th@@ ical , it could face serious consequences such as consumer boycot@@ ts , the departure of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by flu , restaur@@ ant , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of business , has used modulation for more than a year to ensure workers &apos; awareness of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way of communicating with the corpor@@ ation headquarters .
when a worker wanted to report the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address at the company headquarters , he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously .
this was often a da@@ m@@ ning and in@@ convenient process , and Mr Vit@@ ran@@ o , a general advis@@ er , said Ru@@ by Yemen , who said that there was no good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , now that the company uses ops , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices , which did not have previously reached management managers in other cities or states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I can get away to the hol@@ low experience of the workers 3@@ 60 degrees , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who is leading the Ru@@ by hood risk management group .
&quot; and we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and employee involvement more seriously in 2002 , after the collapse of the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Andersson , due to ethical violations in connection with the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; did businesses realise that they cannot stop their black was@@ hing on the web .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Sky offer their software as a service , taking companies perio@@ dic@@ ally paid for the use of their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors , which have been supported by both start @-@ ups .
3.4 cen@@ ti financed USD 10 million in February by companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and the Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by EUR 47 million .
USD 10 million invested in G@@ lin@@ ti Ven@@ ture partners in November , increasing the total company funding to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise if we take into account the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ tedness of companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more research shows that today &apos;s workers expect more jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are just on the table .
workers want to feel they are accepted and valued and devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy in the company , they feel they are listening to them and the work they do is satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ in , who has a general benefit and experience of workers , both Integration cen@@ p@@ ti and G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors will earn revenue if companies in their portfolio do well ; businesses will do well if workers are committed and involved .
if the analy@@ sts on the third side allow for greater commitment and involvement of workers , we are not sure they will be supported .
data on worker inclusion is important , according to experts in the professional culture .
however , these data will be useless if the company &apos;s supervisors do not follow up with them .
in fact , if a company asks its employees for feedback , it can create expectations of a change to come .
and if changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all , they could cause disappointment and decrease the involvement of workers .
&quot; when you ask 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; said President R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , the consul@@ tancy and business administration , who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&apos;@@ W@@ hile , if things do not stop , workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Mad@@ ison Re@@ e@@ val , which is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via G@@ lin@@ ti .
and , after receiving feedback from workers disappointed by the pace of decision making and the quality of communication , he was able to re@@ organise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems .
however , Ru@@ by Portugu@@ ille is collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will result in a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in industry known for its large turnover .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
euro area ben@@ ch is Baltic : revenues grow rapidly
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe , B@@ animal berg is writing the ECB report .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
there is a low debt burden , fast @-@ growing institutions and business @-@ friendly and free market @-@ friendly policies behind success .
&quot; the Baltic States , in one of Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where the EU average has been substantially closer to the purchasing power of the reactor per capita . &quot;
although the aim is that the overall output of the economy per capita would be equivalent to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2 / 3 / 15 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led the bal@@ lo@@ ers to seek a better wage abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees Baltic in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only one quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are going very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , this was considered a little less than half of the respondents about their economies .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel the double @-@ day trends makes the Bru@@ in@@ si days long
it is almost 23 : when the football club of the tro@@ chi@@ ond U@@ C@@ L@@ A stops talking at the end of a new exercise in the city of the team .
some of them have been burdened by a big shir@@ t , reve@@ aling their efforts for the first day of the training camp .
for a large part of the team , these Christmas Days offer mid@@ day couples .
the players on the courses will go back to the collective life endless , after three hours , before returning to the W@@ andar@@ man football front next morning .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mor@@ a , the Bru@@ in@@ si tre@@ ghter , a little before Monday was delivered on Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel the trends of players &apos; burden two times a day has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end of the day - to one side of the bar@@ gain on Friday .
for this reason , the three first operations of U@@ C@@ L@@ A were prompted to start at 19.@@ 15 to fit players into an already tight time@@ line .
the transition from two to two strikes a day means more of a day - the beginning of the Bru@@ in@@ si Border intervention Camp was increased almost a week ahead compared with the previous season , and for the first time , Mor@@ a &apos;s six W@@ es@@ tw@@ ood season is taking place during summer courses .
they have a plan of 18 tr@@ end@@ ars until 20 August before starting formal preparations for the opening game against T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M in September .
according to Mor@@ a , he is in favour of a change in the N@@ CA@@ A rule , although it adds another item to the close schedu@@ les of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they break through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are a nice young person .
I believe that when we come to Saturday and have more time , it is really a bit . &quot;
when the camp is closed , U@@ C@@ L@@ A &apos;s t@@ our operations will be closed , which is not an easy task , given the clear view of the par@@ king record and the by@@ passing L@@ us@@ kin@@ i centre , a higher class hotel that has already esca@@ ped football from the net around the gates .
since this weekend , ho@@ tel Bru@@ in@@ si players are occupying , but Mor@@ a recognised that there could be problems with free tobacco during the season .
&apos;@@ We are implementing security measures , &apos; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real concern and it is not exagg@@ erated to think that people can get a piece of a piece of fil@@ ter from there .
if you have a record of a train , you can do a good deal .
but we use the security team there and on the 8 par@@ king stations .
we are doing our best to use it .
I will try not to be very concerned about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the question of the election union of Sa@@ du@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , the reformist party , the campaign for the expulsion of Kris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ and and the ECB , which was set up to join forces of Maria Kal@@ j@@ ete , in our capital city and political parties , in Te@@ mes , which creates an electoral union for business@@ men in the middle of the central party , seems to be to be able to en@@ cro@@ ach on party politics on the initiative of the election unions created by the local elections at least as much as political parties this year .
however , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether there are enough frustra@@ ted voters .
who will remain with the port ?
if the support office of Ed@@ gar Sa@@ lev@@ are reduced , events may be expected to honour his electoral union .
one member of the national assembly , some former and current central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?

there are probably also those who openly re@@ jo@@ ice in advertising @-@ free television experience at the beginning , but in the end , though reluc@@ tantly , they pay for television and advertising .

Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
media publications are quoted by President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned , which will change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan foresees a 50 000 reduction in the number of legal immigrants per annum , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by Re@@ publi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill goes to the two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law reduces poverty , increases wages and sa@@ ves billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , because it changes the way in which green cards are issued to US citizens .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process will give priority to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and to the skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp in the US media publications .

I took note of this from the rum@@ ours of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to men , who have also thought about it .
it is difficult to say precisely that , because at that time up to 30 people could come to one group , but the passport was only given to a man .
the passport was given only one thing , but was children , sis@@ ters and others Nazi children .
look at how much the territory was here .
it was many times greater than the historic S@@ et@@ oma@@ y .
it was necessary to educate , to manage it in some way .
S@@ et@@ in@@ os came here as farmers , but their lives changed because they came to areas that were not only involved in agriculture but also in rivers ( pal@@ gi@@ par@@ ation ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New @-@ Pet@@ ser@@ is , many pigs later entered the city of K@@ ras@@ no@@ jar@@ sk @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P@@ . ) when it was formed .
did the se@@ tos constitute a majority of the population in this region at that time ?
yes , they lived in a com@@ pac@@ ket .
in addition , the tradition maintained long @-@ standing marriage and child pornography .
seven to eight children in the family were common .
how much does Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ pes have a different culture and different from that of mother land ?
they are different , although what was said here was once the same .
they brought a great many popular ideas .
they then made a difference ( the &apos; people &apos; ) , but they always made a distinction , which was the result and what was done here .
climate change has been severely affected by the traditional ri@@ val@@ ry of se@@ als , because there is a cold cold here .
the proposed changes were made .
for example , S@@ et@@ oma@@ al meat was s@@ kin@@ ned , but here it was simply frozen .
where are the villages of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ pes and what life are there ? / graph@@ ics : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ends
the link with mother countries was spiri@@ tually strong , it was considered very important .
it seems to me that now this Se@@ tu@@ ony is going to return to it , it will affect them .
those girls who have lived in families have listened to ama@@ zing stories .
Pi@@ ho is thinking of the people of the Estonian delegation , who came to the Qu@@ e@@ en of H@@ ai@@ da in early July and lived in homes for four days - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is very easy to come and go on to the train too , because the city has a wonderful location : railway par@@ hu@@ tes and road crossing point , &quot; says Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m , from T@@ ap@@ y .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a lot of nature , sports and cultural places , and the car@@ pet is going to be in every square .
the city is the ti@@ p of the tap !
there are small islands along the River White River , where the Ta@@ mil@@ s tend to be hi@@ jac@@ king .
&apos;@@ This beautiful place does not appear on the train window &apos; , ha@@ ils Re@@ ig@@ o .
anyone who does not fear cold water can flood in the river , because the river is full of resources .
I have been there , you can do it !
the river &apos;s water can be long and just a ro@@ man@@ tic one - it can look at the river and think about life and behind it .
I have also been there with my own abilities .
O@@ oper@@ is@@ ol@@ ist Tampere has been travelling between three other bridges on the river basin and three other bridges , and is ac@@ cru@@ ing : &apos; that place is along the city , no one can come in answer if I say my own stories &apos; .
&quot; the football moun@@ tains a wonderful view of the T@@ ap@@ y , but there are also health private players where you can drink , ski@@ p and play , for example , S@@ gol@@ f playing - gol@@ f tra@@ cks have been made , chains can borrow from sports centres , &quot; Re@@ ig@@ o is leading .
old pro@@ gen@@ ders are , of course , there with their own system , but I have not yet been able to play there .
obviously , Mrs Ras@@ mus Gol@@ l T@@ ap@@ ale must be invited , as she has experienced a dis@@ c@@ gol@@ f@@ enth@@ r and she has a chains .
perhaps he will lend me credit .
Re@@ ig@@ o and M@@ än@@ ni@@ ku@@ ll were in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably in@@ separ@@ able from the current n@@ om@@ ine@@ e .
at least during hours .
there are many te@@ ars , dis@@ appointments and you can have my sport .
not to mention the bel@@ ts and s@@ lee@@ ping bel@@ ls that have broken .
&quot; the city of the city is full of construction works , all of which is becoming unknown , &quot; says Re@@ ig@@ o .
however , the old and ti@@ red building is a very attractive place to play oral disco@@ veries .
I am pleased that in 2012 , the head of R@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ M adopted a note of my idea and had to be made to the summer theat@@ re with his theat@@ re .
although this year &apos;s theat@@ re &apos; Ale@@ Credit to K@@ aren@@ in &apos; has just passed , on 11 August , the railway station &apos; El@@ lu@@ är@@ da &apos; is in the railway station when the old building is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; from 11 to 13 August , T@@ ap@@ a has Day , which has opened up the doors of the building and clo@@ thes of cultural activities , including the crow@@ d , &quot; Re@@ ig@@ o , who recommends that he visit the city for a few days just now should visit 9 .
in a tiny three @-@ house , 1 May , the muse@@ um is already a muse@@ um since 1994 .
&quot; the house is small , but the s@@ kin@@ s are a lot and information vast , &quot; says Re@@ ig@@ o &apos;s place , full of the history of the city of T@@ ap@@ a , most of which focuses on rail and sis@@ ter .
Re@@ ig@@ o mu@@ ds that if you go through all the recommended sites in T@@ ap@@ al , you will be cut off a long distance , but fortunately the small city will be full of coff@@ ee .
&quot; when we sit in ca@@ f@@ és and ca@@ f@@ és , we sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad , he describes .
educated and young soldiers coming to T@@ ap@@ y spend a lot of time in bot@@ tles , se@@ sta@@ p in the seats there , feel that you are in Estonia and your home city , but that is the international community together .
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or American people .
the wars , yes , we are going a lot .
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ dering
television can@@ al b@@ TV quoted a foreign minister who reported that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ dering .
in the morning of 1 August , the police arrested people who illegally ordered a group of people who had been ja@@ iled by the Si@@ th@@ onia Pen@@ insula , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free ten@@ dering and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone who is caught in a place where there is no provision for it .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
the w@@ ol@@ ves that teach the people are breaking the sheep .
Fin@@ n farmers will have to give their her@@ bs a &apos; lesson &apos; again after year - the w@@ ol@@ ves that apparently teach the w@@ ol@@ ves have already broken a number of sheep .
this year , sheep in the Hi@@ i@@ u coun@@ ty have broken sheep three times , 23 sheep and eight have been injured , signing the Hi@@ i@@ u page .
soil was only three , one year earlier , 124 .
the environmental agency &apos;s data in syn@@ dro@@ me with the bur@@ ns also shows that soil was not born on Hi@@ shel@@ ls and that the Hi@@ shel@@ l hunting Council information is fixed this year on the island for two w@@ ol@@ ves .
the E@@ ESC rejected Monday &apos;s w@@ ol@@ ves in Em@@ tens Kab@@ ina , who opened 15 sheep in the village of K@@ ish@@ ena , and injured the 18 survi@@ v@@ ors .
in the early morning , the w@@ ol@@ ves in the village of Re@@ he@@ bas@@ la were s@@ kin@@ ned by a single sheep in the pas@@ ture of the village of Re@@ he@@ w and the other to whom an emergency was had to be made .
rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and a plant protection law to the fore .
the amendment to the law remo@@ ves the creation of a separate data collection for both GM and GM crops , using plant health records in the future .
in addition , the GM crop manager will be made obliged to have prior agreement with the designated radio beekeeping population .
although at the moment , no GM crops are grown in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least until decisions are taken to declare the Estonian GMO @-@ free , &quot; said S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , President of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs .
&quot; however , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors , in the Annex .
the draft law repe@@ als provisions relating to the collection and treatment of GM crops and operators , introduces requirements for the management of GM crops and for starting economic activities .
specifically , as regards beekeeping , the GM crop growers are replaced by the obligation so far to inform bee@@ keepers of the start of cultivation of GM crops with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with bee@@ keepers before starting cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to Minis@@ tries to coordinate .
all interested parties have the opportunity to see this in the draft information system and , if they so wish , to present their views to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , the people working in the plant farming sector , bee@@ keepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10 - has been authorised to grow .
however , so far no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops .
the reason is that there is no ma@@ gic talk in Estonia , no European media Observatory , with a rural link mon 8@@ 10 resistant .
the North Rhine is also being extended to the southern regions and is not appropriate to our climate conditions in May .
to be secure , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect potential contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various su@@ ra@@ pes , maize and so@@ y@@ bean vari@@ eties grown in Estonia .
the analysis of the sam@@ ples made showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and so@@ y@@ bean vari@@ eties in Estonia were not included in genetically modified organisms .
the above may in turn be concluded that in Estonia GM crops are not deliberately culti@@ vated and that there was no accident contamination .

&quot; I am even more happy if they can deliver four of the four , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
another warm po@@ et was delivered on the GSM E@@ mb@@ assy on 1 August and this time in M@@ uh@@ us .

the White House &apos;s er@@ r@@ on w@@ ins the taxpayers &apos; money
according to military documents printed in the magaz@@ ine , the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicop@@ ter last month to the southern American production event cost taxpayers as much as USD 24 000 .
the green and white colour S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , ter@@ med Marine One , during President &apos;s office , was the central figure of the event in White Ma@@ in on 17 July to introduce American construction programmes .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , senior officials of the White House , M@@ ike P@@ ence and White House , unve@@ iled industrial products from all 50 countries in their work@@ flows .
the helicop@@ ter built in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ tis was spon@@ sored with a cl@@ one from the repu@@ te , a fire @-@ fighting car from W@@ is@@ con@@ ten and a pal@@ let made in Mis@@ cel@@ lu@@ b .
according to the documents of the H@@ eli@@ Cop@@ ter , Marine H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) , the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 , the H@@ eli@@ Cop@@ ter Co @-@ Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship , the H@@ AR@@ G@@ O , ordered the presence of a helicop@@ ter to be held by a military office of a little 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter for the &apos; extraordinary &apos; event on the southern hor@@ ror .
&apos;@@ I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an un@@ usually great event , &apos; H@@ X @-@ 1 kom@@ and@@ ö@@ r said , day before the event , his over@@ statement , the chief officer of the naval force , the de@@ pu@@ tion in the field of aviation .
the message stated that the helicop@@ ter would arrive at a lunch hor@@ ror on 17 July morning at 7 : 00 , and will remain , a 15 @-@ clock event , until the same night , between 18 and 21 .
it was included that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed , a second e@@ pa@@ thy is needed because of the restrictions on working time .
the original flight team was at helicop@@ ter during the event and the chief c@@ abinet was keeping the aircraft close to the aircraft throughout the whole time it was on the ground .
the documents provided by the magaz@@ ine were not possible to read whether or not the second e@@ ye@@ ar@@ pa@@ thy was ultimately needed .
the H@@ at@@ ch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political ends .
the documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked whether this would violate H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law and we were told that &apos; the com@@ man@@ der wrote &apos; .
&apos;@@ You seem to have no choice , &apos; answered the Deputy Minister for the lead officers .
the White House declared the &apos; American &apos; event to be a formal event and the H@@ at@@ ch law would not have covered it .
but even official events have political under@@ ton@@ es .
the President backed the efforts of health reform during the Senate at the time and praised attempts to keep government regulations in check .
the use of a known aircraft under the Maritime One or Air Force for political gain is not a new phenomenon .
the Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them purely photo@@ graphic is unusual .
the T@@ ru@@ mp was brought to the attention in February when , at his first campaign event in Flor@@ idas Mel@@ bour@@ ne , he was a president flight to the background , and he s@@ pends Twitter &apos;s account on messages which complain about how his predecessor used his flight .
&quot; White l Ma@@ l is very pleased with the exhibition &quot; made in America , where products were represented in all 50 countries made up of American workers from American materials , &quot; said consci@@ enti@@ ously , L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the spokes@@ man of the White House .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often carry out tests around Washington and southern hor@@ ror to get the United States President &apos;s White house off with a c@@ enti@@ metres .
when the T@@ ru@@ mp was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , 58 sam@@ ples of H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House were ordered .
according to the Commissioner , the flight flight flight was considered to be the &apos; American &apos; flight crew &apos; &apos;s standard of monthly &apos; learning flights .
the first ar@@ mi@@ er helicop@@ ter flying for &apos; non @-@ President &apos; missions , in addition to 11 hours later .
according to the White House , no other actor in this event was s@@ las@@ hing the taxpayers &apos; w@@ alle@@ ts .
according to S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , the company was not involved in carrying out fil@@ tering on the southern hor@@ ror .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 will not maintain the budgetary documents of President flights and it will be difficult to identify the exact costs of the event .
however , the Ministry of Defence , at the h@@ our@@ ly prices for the financial year 2017 , has the V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D compensa@@ tory rate of 24 380 dollars per hour .
the primary documents referred to the flight extension of its base from the Li@@ an@@ tic@@ o flight to Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a for 30 minutes .
the White House claims that the real cost of using helicop@@ ter is well below that amount .
&quot; it is very misleading to calculate taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimates of compensation , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates of compensation include staff , maintenance and many other irre@@ vo@@ cable expenditure , which will be taken into account for annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 Pe@@ de@@ i study , the Ministry of Defence does not include cost of staff , but it covers fuel , maintenance and contract costs .
Se@@ an S@@ hari@@ er , former journalist of the White House , defended the use of helicop@@ ter at that time at the event .
&quot; the point is to show the things made in America this week , &quot; S@@ stop@@ er said .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ ti are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds , if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly on .
so it is right , of course , to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the T@@ ru@@ mp was involved in the southern hor@@ ror in the event with helicop@@ ter flying , but he was hiding behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
in White Ma@@ in , the T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky was addressing representatives by hand@@ ing out media ou@@ tle@@ ts over company products in his personal aircraft fleet .
&apos;@@ I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ skis very well , &apos; said the President , &apos; I have three of their products .

worse still lies ahead : a month later , his Olympic contest in Ri@@ os was broken down by the first obstacle to the Du@@ os Du@@ ma .
time had to be taken down - did you even have to continue with the seven competition ?
is it all worth the effort of two days ?
you thought a long time , but found peace .
I had to think twice !
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time for us to treat ourselves all and to think about it head on .
&apos;@@ You know that I am not putting a c@@ and@@ le on the picture &apos; , S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o is talking about his self @-@ determination .
I was able to turn a clean page and move on with a new momentum .
the de@@ vil , Anne hill and gentlemen , said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of neg@@ ligence , but she realised that , above all , the spor@@ ts@@ man himself had to get to the bottom .
after all , he had been so repres@@ sed by everyone .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; the G@@ ard said that he is not giving up and he wants to prove what he is worth , says remember .
now it is in the middle of some kind of peace .
it is doing so to joy .

one alcohol whose drinking equ@@ als the brain &apos; training &apos; .
Li@@ ves@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is a su@@ ici@@ dal wine game of such great importance that he believes that wine can teach the brain better than any other thing in the world .
She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist of Y@@ ale University .
his message is not about alcohol , or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
when we s@@ le@@ ep , wine was complicated by ta@@ iling , enjoying it and perceived after@@ taste , we are putting our brain on work to create taste for wine .
according to She@@ per@@ d , the bo@@ vine ole@@ cu@@ les do not actually contain taste , but taste arises from the way wine stimu@@ lates a@@ mus@@ cles .
he will set the &apos; brain &apos; as a benchmark for &apos; col@@ ours .
&quot; taste is not wine ; taste creates wine as a swe@@ et , &quot; says She@@ per@@ d .
things that affect the taste of wine are , for example , the number of our age , our summer and even the coal produced by man .
She@@ per@@ d of course man@@ es that wine is not full of July .
&apos;@@ There must be more &apos; , he says .
if you can have too much lon@@ g@@ lu@@ e , the system will be over@@ loaded .
excess wine drinking can do no harm to brain , but rather to the detriment of alcohol - according to a study in 2004 , people who drink more than three glass products with wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced spiri@@ tual capacity .
10 % less of Estonian ICT workers receive lower salaries than colleagues
the figures from the staff search company fund reveal that 10 % of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive lower salaries than colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , wri@@ tes the portal Ge@@ eni@@ us .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector &apos;s recruitment study .
a total of 8 5@@ 77 posts was examined .
63 % of posts were employed by men .
&quot; although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is for men and that the rest of businesses considered that there is no pay gap , in reality , the average salary of men is 10 % higher than that of women and men on average of 8 % higher than that of women in the year , &quot; said Fon@@ crates analy@@ sts Il@@ mar Nordic .

according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
on Wednesday , the head of the UN mission for Afghanistan said that elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , said that hundreds of women stand for election to local councils , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; it is impossible to exagg@@ lise women &apos;s role by underlining the importance of women , &quot; said in the statement made on Wednesday .
elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections in Afghanistan and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have threatened for their part the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with the transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is handed over cal@@ mly to one democratically elected government to the next .
according to Mr Ha@@ ys@@ om , women &apos;s strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan is increasing .
according to the independent Ele@@ ction Commission in Afghanistan , 1.2 million registered voters have been registered by the 3.@@ 6 million .
the joy of sharing is making every thing more acute , both for large and small .
there is always too little common time , but the trend with the p@@ aste is a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
and what a convenient solution - wherever you were s@@ le@@ ep in the summer , live animals are always on the ball and come to mind with your fine voice with a sa@@ y@@ alty : &apos; let us now also move to a tr@@ en@@ chment &apos; !
A@@ el@@ ta insu@@ lation - It is a very good thing to have a normal gold game or a flag on the coast .
a piece is the foundation for sta@@ mping down the sho@@ es and the sheep , who would then like to take the form of a s@@ and@@ y @-@ s@@ lee@@ ping alliance over the summer ?
it is a great thing to use children instead of a chic@@ ken !
firstly , it is secure and convenient , and the weight is gradually increasing at the same pace as the training staff .
the advanced village can also be s@@ wel@@ led with quite a large children .
the child is training a balance , counts the fla@@ mes and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
larger children may at the same time make their own villages .
the extent of the movement lies in the scarcity of land and in the w@@ ol@@ ling of hands .
the finger of the fin@@ gers is being held up directly , in the mini@@ ab@@ ic way .
a child can read the fla@@ mes and feel like a le@@ c@@ ture@@ r .
the planet is a hugely exciting but hope@@ less exercise for the child .
but it is easy to do it .
play @-@ plan@@ k : take a long plan@@ gu@@ Col@@ on@@ n to ni@@ p through .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much more a@@ mus@@ ing to do when , in the meantime , a friend can hand his hand .
to add burdens , plan@@ tations , pe@@ ts &apos; market can remain , and walk around in this place .
additional care may be made to plan@@ k the children &apos;s trees , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
while the cra@@ bs join the sand , the ro@@ ck , ash and k@@ ron@@ e meat burden , such as infections , are becoming tri@@ c@@ ki@@ ans .
the child is wal@@ king on his feet in such a way that his body is distributed equally and wanted .
security is the way to keep up the hands .
all the leg@@ s and the w@@ ool wal@@ ks up directly .
the pu@@ mp can fly , bur@@ y , strike a balance and be a matter of urgency .
a little le@@ c@@ ture@@ r &apos;s life is an ex@@ hor@@ tation if he gets little in every fire .
the extra burden is being put before the feet .
checks are made to keep the back on the neutral position .
children themselves have a lot more to do with ch@@ op@@ pressed meat in a few parts and with a pla@@ te .
a bul@@ l with a hand and a w@@ ed@@ ding .
after the child &apos;s safety , the place of the earth , and the holding of the back in a neutral position .
the fav@@ ou@@ rite and big fu@@ n of all children !
the elderly , meanwhile , have a truly effective overall body trend .
the sports tools were O@@ tt ( 10 ) , S@@ ä@@ de ( 8 ) , luck ( 4 ) .
from the Philippines to the heart of mo@@ pe@@ ds
the workshops that have been bun@@ dled from the t@@ our are the summer class , which has become a pe@@ as@@ ant product in recent years , which , even though it is right , has to han@@ g the hand and which has been able to display a price label on the bat@@ tery , despite its modest origin .
the home of the lessons learned is probably one of the things that has existed once in the life of the law and which has not been aro@@ used with particular emo@@ tion .
that is simply there and , if it is not , there is nothing at all .
now , however , the be@@ er bags are going to be making a real victory , and mo@@ pe@@ dest@@ rian plan@@ ters have replaced their mus@@ h@@ rooms by summer months against simple cop@@ ies of red bags .
this is not only a coastal col@@ ony , but today it is just as popular as a street , and older women are even filling it in office .
however , it is worth making it clear here before it is either that the summer is sitting on such an over@@ statement or it is worth postponing the s@@ lap@@ ping and s@@ lap@@ ping to a little more official .
however , the wealth of tolerance has made women &apos;s sho@@ es a real love of summer .
for example , when we read foreign mo@@ mo@@ tives , the first thing is that mo@@ e@@ gh@@ ur@@ ers are bringing their holidays to the local market as the first thing to do , and buying some be@@ er bags , which then comes the tru@@ ck of whole holiday and which goes on to the wall , the market and also friend in the city .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are so generous that they buy houses of hea@@ vier w@@ ol@@ ves and sell or give them to their loyal read@@ ers .
it is worth noting , however , that there is a demand among read@@ ers so that women ( and men ! ) in the real world obviously involve each other in the fishing ground in order to obtain the happy owners of some homes .
in some ways , this mad@@ ness is also understandable , because the char@@ ts are the times when , in the fashion of yesterday , some of the things brought into the lur@@ ch have been able to buy for just a few decades .
it is true that white traders have also discovered a simple way of ear@@ ning money here , and so more luxury br@@ ands sell their bags for a few hundred or a do@@ zen or a thousand euros .
obviously , in order to prevent richer customers from feeling easy to die , who pro@@ claim around some of the cheap do@@ gs .
for example , it is possible to buy a hand hand over EUR 1 000 in D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ on .
however , for the Chan@@ gel bre@@ g@@ ko@@ t interpretation , a sum of EUR 6 000 may be found in the circulation .
unlike most mo@@ tives , however , the l@@ ot@@ teries do not inher@@ it at all with some great mos@@ ques , but they were born far from .
it is that the bre@@ w@@ ers are allegedly coming far from the Philippines , where they have been we@@ aring them wide .
the bun@@ ch of rub@@ b@@ ish bags is there , particularly , and local export trading is not seen very often .
Ad@@ mittedly , the a@@ da@@ ge technique dates back to the 14@@ th century and is rather a series of normal cor@@ ps .
however , as the be@@ er does not need to be as hard red as cor@@ ps , they will be accompanied by mus@@ cles and other materials that make the cop@@ per more person@@ alised and , by extension , more reac@@ tive .
for example , recently , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y do@@ gs , where pa@@ ints or sk@@ in c@@ kers have been laid in .
however , the full print can be sent by the addi@@ cts , in particular , to the actor , J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , the biggest bun@@ dled hand @-@ to @-@ shoulder game , which had not been seen before .
he was exactly su@@ ed by the be@@ er of all kinds of clothing pac@@ ks and not even had to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val a great deal .
however , today &apos;s popul@@ arity of the people does not play a smaller role in caring for them , nor is it the case that water and the w@@ et are required to care , unlike all other summer produc@@ tions .
as usual , in addition to classi@@ cal na@@ ils , br@@ ands have come out of all interpretations .
for example , if they wish to have a hand @-@ red ri@@ ce or a little bit of a boo@@ m .
it is worth remembering , however , that the classic be@@ er will never be a mos@@ que , but a be@@ er @-@ flu .
but what is the classi@@ cal translation , then ?
for centuries , a co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il of be@@ er has been classified as &apos; closed &apos; , which rese@@ mb@@ les a flat from its style , is on the ice and is short , as are be@@ ers , cri@@ pp@@ les .

G@@ M@@ B is concerned about investments at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant
the company expects the managers of the mature producer and Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to be reas@@ sured of long @-@ term production plans at the company &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment .
more than 500 people are employed in H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich knowledge of the mature and other products .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s owner Pla@@ s said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years .
there were workers and trade union leaders who were employed there , &apos; are the first to hear &apos; when something changes to the operation of the factory change .
in a letter sent to the company &apos;s host , G@@ M@@ B Scotland company Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e called for &apos; to address the concerns that there is no use of funding to modernise production lines &apos; .
the fact that we do not get clarity from the chief president of the G@@ M@@ B on the customs / VIS &apos;s business needs and future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is largely made up of people from the local community and the G@@ las@@ go@@ w surrounding the border , an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social housing .
so , in the interests of jobs , wages and welfare in the East of G@@ las@@ go@@ w , Bre@@ x@@ ti , the rise in living costs and the constant fall in production , the top @-@ up production company in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e needs . &quot;
the Pla@@ dis@@ e representative said : &apos; the site of the customs was only written from the G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ t yesterday and the company responds directly to him , since we value active engagement with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers in customs and the representatives of the G@@ M@@ B , which openly discussed a number of issues .
we then discussed with workers that , like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are reviewing our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years we have invested over GBP 5 million on the site of customs Somalia , most of which have gone to production lines and to improve procedures .
we fully understand the heritage of customs as a production object and , if there were any changes to the activities of the object , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach to Ney@@ ra ?
la with a view to regrets its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not give up in its efforts to attract Ney@@ mar to his ranks by offering a bid of GBP 18@@ 9 million to be taken out of it , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of its record con@@ quest ?
this bold approach has opened summer as a transitional window and L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of buying over the last season , which was set at the time by returning Paul Po@@ g@@ ba to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ tle for GBP 89 million .
once completed , Ney@@ ra will become the world &apos;s most expensive player and also the most paid professional spor@@ ts@@ man in the world who will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from GPS .
Barcelona is also a source of concern , both because of the approach and the breaking down of Ney@@ ra , although the source close to the C@@ ae@@ lic leadership confirms that the club has always been doing the best to ensure that it is a football club for the benefit of football since its arrival in San@@ to@@ ise in 2013 .
but did the PS@@ G President warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blair Ma@@ tu@@ tis Agreement in 2014 , the N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all clubs who think about recru@@ iting some of the best players in the PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they are concerned about some of our players , we are going to accept them and contact them , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to get a deal with some of our players , they have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appears to have moved beyond this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the PS@@ G central player , Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave the ground , under any circumstances , and that Barcelona could be a set@@ back as a result of this interest , removing one of its precious assets in the form of Ney@@ ra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t .
&quot; Bre@@ x@@ it is in serious danger of losing a w@@ edge between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r of his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible to move the current free movement of people and goods , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; it is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; she stressed .
according to the former , Britain would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as it cannot be , it will remain part of the European single market .
it would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
another way to make Britain &apos;s departure smoo@@ ther would be to create a European Union @-@ United Kingdom Customs Union , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that there was such an agreement with Turkey , Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said : &apos; we could certainly have such an agreement with Britain . &apos;
the alternative to this would be a return to customs points , which would declare historical division and political failure .
&apos;@@ T@@ o bring about trade , prosperity and peace &apos; said the Irish Prime Minister .
he called Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t a &apos; challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that the result could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland .

Av@@ ja : I@@ ron@@ man is able to pass through everyone , a sign of her first half @-@ long tri@@ ath@@ on .
today , O@@ te@@ save l Bal@@ ti@@ fied , the biggest tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ors in winter , were held when nearly a thousand tri@@ ath@@ le@@ tes took over three out of ten countries to the competition of lon@@ gest I@@ ron@@ man .
7@@ 0.@@ 3 miles of dis@@ course consis@@ ted of 1.9 km of bar@@ ley , 90 km of bic@@ y@@ cle driving and 2@@ 1.1 km of cy@@ cling .
among others , a sign of Av@@ ril was also successful in the first tri@@ ath@@ on of her life .
&apos;@@ I thought it would prove difficult and , in the end , difficult &apos; , saying Av@@ and finally , &apos; .
despite the complexity of Av@@ ril , she said that in fact , the tri@@ ath@@ on is affordable for almost everyone .
&apos;@@ It is not a dance killing , but a pace that kills &apos; , he said , suggesting that , at a comfortable pace , almost everyone will reach the finishing line .
except for O@@ tt Se@@ pp , &apos; It is fine , but unfortunately it cannot sw@@ im@@ p &apos; .
Av@@ ril had already made a very keen move from February onwards .
at the beginning , 4 @-@ 5 hours a week , but later ten hours a week .
time 05 : 34 : 12 achieved 27@@ 60 in overall terms .
although Av@@ and lost both R@@ ai@@ o Pi@@ adz@@ ya ( time 04 : 59 : 53 ) and J@@ ür@@ gen L@@ ig@@ ale ( time 05 : 06 : 37 ) , she won other competing champi@@ ons in the so @-@ called &apos; prominent class &apos; .
last year , Tan@@ el Pa@@ da@@ r , who was a good example of a personal , lost A@@ van@@ le in seven minutes ( time 05 : 41 : 54 ) , journalist S@@ ten Te@@ pp@@ an in 16 minutes ( time 05 : 50 : 23 ) , Kal@@ e@@ v K@@ r@@ new and Ra@@ iv@@ o E.
