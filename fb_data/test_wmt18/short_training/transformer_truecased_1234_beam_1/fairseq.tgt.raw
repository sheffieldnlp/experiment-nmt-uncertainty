Four members of the Cabinet Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Posselt, in Spain, the police detained the leader of the so-called 'Cape Kallirovo Group' in Estonia, SpinGulevich, who is known as SpinKCape rovski in the criminal world.
Gulevich arrested in Spain was arrested at the court's permission.
Yesterday, the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia.
It is suspected that the so-called 'Cape Verde' criminal community is members of the so-called '27-57 years', who commit mainly drug crimes.
In the province of Mala Mijas in Spain, the alleged head of criminal community was detained.
Three men were detained in Estonia as a suspect, one of them collected according to the figures, as a criminal community leader, and two are members of criminal community.
The data collected indicates that tasks and roles had been clearly divided in the criminal community.
The purpose of criminal activities was to commit drug crimes and thus to earn criminal proceeds, "commented on the head of the criminal proceedings, Public Prosecutor Vaila Verte.
"We do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing," added the Prosecutor.
It is people who have previously been interested in law enforcement law enforcement, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and the weekly operation shows that cooperation is successful," said Public Prosecutor Verte.
The head of the central police service, ago in Leis, said that detention was preceded by a study lasting almost one and a half years.
"In the first half of the week, we had a long history of work and were simultaneously suspected of committing crimes in Estonia and Spain," said: "
In Leis, the central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain.
For years now we have a good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civil card.
These arrests are yet another message to criminals that we get them from another European end, "said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that, when there is a doubt, the men who have been suspected of continuing to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecution service has requested their arrest and also approved by the court.
The man arrested in Spain expects him to be handed over to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash are being seized to ensure confiscation in this criminal case.
The criminal prosecution procedure is carried out by the central criminal police organised crime office and is led by the prosecution service.
The city of Tallinn Tribunal in 2005 convicted SpinGulevich of blackmail and punished him with five years imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevitšit was held second in Estonia's criminal world after the Martyralir of the time, Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Cape Verde, appeared in the Estonian allige at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
Admittedly, he taxed taxi and prostitution on various hotels and ordered a monthly rotation tax on businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of proceeds of crime and the entry into force of court decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, the eight accused of a criminal offence in the so-called Dikynic Community, who seized EUR 80 000 in criminal proceeds, or the verdict against nine persons, in 2006, Igor Alexynikov created a criminal association aimed at illegal trafficking of illegal cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in Eastern Viruland and southern Estonia.
The confiscated criminal profits are worth almost EUR 71 500.
In these criminal cases, it has been successful that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and, if necessary, that they do business in any European Union country.
Civil Liberties Group warns of Missourisse travel
The National Association for the Advanancient People of Colored People (NANicaragua) has warned the people of the Muslim Muslim people travelling to the Missoula for discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the State.
The Group's statement states: 'The NASR issued for the State of Missoura, which applies until 28 August 2017, calls on all American passengers, visitors and souls to be particularly attentive and very careful when moving around the country, given the suspicious racial events that have taken place recently and also been highlighted here'.
According to NAUTS, the group urged both the recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, and the fact that the country's regular police protection targets are, in large part, minorities.
"Citizens' rights are violated.
They are being dried because of their skin colour, beaten or killed, "said Ros Chapel, President of NASR.
"We have never received such complaints so closely before."
This is the first warning issued by the organisation for the US state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults against musicians' students at Missouri University and the death of the 28-year-old black Sandersi.
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year, after he was beaten by the state in the petrol sector and the Missouri police arrested without being accused of a crime.
Furthermore, the report recently compiled by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri shows that the national flag state is likely to stop the cars of black drivers by 75% more likely than white drivers.
'A comment is designed to make people aware and to warn their families, friends and collaborators about what might happen in Missouris' said Chapel.
'People must be ready, whether it means taking fun money or informing relatives that they cross the state '.
The latest figures from FBI's programme for information on hate crime were documented in 2015 in Missouris, which puts the state in the 16th national position in the country in the number of similar offences.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult for the company to refer to court for reasons of discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Association (American Civil Guard Union) had previously issued travel barriers for Texas and Arizona following the adoption of immigration laws by those states, which obliged local authorities to arrest people for infringements in immigration, because according to ACLU, this increases racial profiling.
Usually, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is issuing warnings on other countries, but recently, interest groups have started to use this measure as a counterreaction to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease?
Hepatitis, or incinerator, may be caused by five different types of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses highlight the acute burst of the liver's homes.
However, the average cost is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can develop further into the liver's circus, the taxionist and the liver.
The epidemiology of the health profession, Kuniliner, talks about the fact that acute hepatitis disease is the same in all types of skimmed infection - fever, fatigue, Embrance, oinisation, spatitis, air pain, grey emissions, horse mackerel, meat and asylum pain, and the collapse of swine and limasters.
The last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of the liver burnt-up disease.
Children can undergo hepatitis without disease.
The various types of heat can only be determined on the basis of laboratory research data.
Allerally can be converted into chronic hepatitis and decades without disease phenomena, meaning that man may not know anything about his or her dangerous illness.
Mr Kunilr highlights various forms of hepatitis and describes their culmination more closely.
Ehepatitis virus infections are spread from a disease to human consumption and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, via seals, from infected person's emissions to hands and from hand foodstuffs, soils, objects, contact and consumption of drugs.
The risk of infection, or the risk of a disease, and the care of the risk of infection, chronic pay, sex people with infected infection, sex men, drug users, the high-hepatitis A, people who visit the countries.
Vaccination can be prevented, in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling a lot and at the risk group A hepatitis.
Furthermore, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: To wash or disinfect hands, before eating food, to wash all fruit and vegetables.
Hpatitis virus infections spread to the circulation of human blood, drugs incineration, therapeution, augmentation, blood-contaminated fodder (toothmeters, pregnancy tools), donator blood, hepatitis-bullors' person sex and infpatitis disease from infpatitis to animal foetal disease.
The Group of the hepatitis infection includes drugs, sex partners of infected person, sex men, infant infant mother with a person infected, family members and carers, health care, rescue workers and police officers, and people visiting countries with high-hepatitis B diseases.
In order to prevent hepatitis, people can be vaccinated; in particular, it recommends vaccination for people at risk, as well as chronic pay-related, HIV-infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
There is a hepatitis cure for other preventive measures: Prevention of the use of hygiene and manure, other sharp tools and needles, needles, prophytoisation and honour rape, and use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection or prevention of sexual risk.
Vaccination against hepatitis V is part of the National Immunisation Scheme and free of charge for children in Estonia.
Hepatitis virus infections spread to the person involved in the circulation of blood, in the incineration of drugs, in ineration, in augmentation, in the use of blood contaminated foeder, in the use of donor blood, in sex with hepatio-savic people and in the sick of hepatitis disease.
The risk group of hepatitis C infections includes drugs, sex partners of infected person, sex men, infant infant mother, sick family members and carers, blood and other body liquids, people with HIV infections and people with high-sufferers, and passengers visiting the countries with hepatitis C.
The preventive measure of hepatitis C is: Prevention of the use of xenophobia in the event of a dangerous compound infection, other sharp and heart-cell and needles, needinerator and honour and condoms.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
The hepatitis tis D virus is caused by hepatitis Bishy virus, which is much more in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
As a result, Dhepatitis Bhepatitis infections, together with hepatitis B or superinfant, occur on chronic hepatitis B sufferers.
Hpatitis virus infections spread from exposure to blood and other body liquid, contaminated systalls to needles, relatives and rarely infected animals.
The hepatitis-surgery is chronic hepatitis B virus proteins and people who do not have immunity from hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccines, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Ehepatitis virus infections spread by feudal means of drinking water and food, including low heat-treated beef, fish and marine carrots, donor blood, psychips and more infected animals.
Passengers may be infected with high levels of E hepatitis disease in countries.
Ehepatitis preventive measures are compliance with hygiene requirements: To wash or disinfect hands after the horse, before food production and eating, after care for the disease.
Fruits and vegetables are washing before consumption, avoiding eating little hot meat, fish and seafood, as a result of which only safe drinking water and preventing drug consumption.
Although the last round of competitors tried to printing four times the Olympic winner, 34 years of Farah's final day saw the power of Farah and won 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long, bringing the husband Tania and children to their own path after the finalist finch.
This was a special moment for me.
I am very much an advocate of my family.
Being with them was wonderful, "said Farah to journalists.
Farah is focusing its fifth edition in London on the golden dump of 5,000 and 10 000 metres of the runway.
Everything is possible if it is believed.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connorm in Daam gold, Gustav Klimti, Adel Bloch-Baueri's portfolio, has a special story of 'synonymous with one art works', much deeper than the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna.
But more deeply in history.
The anthem's inferrant gold, the sleep in the beach, the narrowly subject being put on the top of the title, would have been to have more influence on the extraordinary portfolio.
At the moment, there would be a double book between some of the Cubans: Gustav Klimti and his painting, Daam gold, the story of Adel Bloch-Bauer, and a much more extensive and comprehensive history of Honourable families and the German occupation, with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the flourishing cultural life of Vienna, who himself entered the Austrian capital, could hardly imagine how life was going around Ringstrass more than a hundred years ago or how all its head was turned when the climate invaded.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities and the name familiar with the book, as if you see it, it was more cultural to quote a gram.
However, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where the void arson and the highest level of suicide in Europe were not adding anything to development.
Or perhaps, however, every couple of paternalistic painting drives adds a colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
The Sajanditis was a person of nearly one in ten in Vienna.
Parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time the Arad relief was launched twice in the Czech sugar magnaad Ferdinja Bloch and Climate for his famous painting, his father had become the seventh largest bank in Habsbursts.
However, the whole life of the glaciers to which he belonged did not take the lead.
If you look at the 'Daam gold', it is difficult to believe that the end-of-life infection was more like a kind of crone of socialism and dreamt of travel to the Soviet Union.
For 1903rd, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband's luggage from Climate Kong, the painting maker in Vienna was the last moment.
The Climate KIC paid 4 000 kroons at the time, a quarter of the price of a good-place rural house.
The fact that some sports crews were suspected of a modelli of a master was not intimidated by sugar stunnatis.
As far as the delegate is concerned, the only certainty is that the relationship between modelli and the artist created during the work continued to reach life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - 'Daam gold'.
Gustav Klimti Cup, Adel Bloch-Bauer Corporate, exceptional story, "" Varrak 2016, Aldo Randland, who translated English.
Shortly before the start of the work with Adeleja, the climate had been visited Ravenna San Vitale in basiberia and the investigators think that it was precisely there that the gullious mosaic countries Erinna Theodort gave the artist the idea of making a golden portfolio called Adeledeledeledeler a a mosaic.
The climate presented in his Daam gold, Vienna in 1908, and around the same time (1907-1908), one of the golden terrestrial land was born.
Art historians were not left unnoticed by the similarities of two women.
How are Hitler connected with nature?
"I think I owe him to make his hand publicly available to the public," said Adel Bloch-Bauer a few years after his departure (Climate U died in February 1918) to the Director of the Belvedere museum and wanted their family Climate Kafmti to go to the muscle of the city of the city of Ormti.
Six years before the death, the customer had completed a succession of Adelest Kühga.
In his wills (Adel fleeing in February 1925), she also asked her husband to leave his two sports courses and four Gustav Klimti landscapes to Galeri in Austria.
His founding fathers inherited him to the sister of Mariana and Luda.
One year after the Climate Minister had finished the 'Austrian Mona' annex, Viin Kacarriart de Akademine had attempted to get 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed in the drawing.
Although sometimes Hitler's later anti-Semitism is considered to be the cause of the Jewish professors not accepting him in the academy, none of his excatheirs were actually Jewish.
In any case, the Austrian GalSpecial Undertaking's mission for 1939 had changed considerably, as referred to in Mrs Galeria, which had become important for finding decent works for the Maciras of the rich Jewish Jewish arts in Vienna.
Hitler's personal artistic muscle was also home to some work for As, but not for the climate.
Sixty years after the night of the Nazi arts, a 10-year-old trial dispute between the Austrian Government and the Bloch-Baukers was launched.
It should be noted here that if the 'novel' is seen in Belvedere Castle in Vienna, the Daam gold, which is portrayed by Adel Bloch-Bauer, must be seen as' trip to New York to the Neue Galeri.
And before the Vienna Times, the aforementioned book will be read.
Even if you do not plan to take the climate's work, because at least my emotions came across more laughing and Jewish issues after the closure of the book than the Main and modell Adel Bloch-Bauer, sold for USD 135 million.
So not so much a markscrew, rather a gay Embassy - and a very moving story.
The gender pumps of the Bauer people who were brought to the beginning of the book were considerably facilitated by events.
17-year-old swimming in Canada was very close to the Estonian Rebate.
In Eelelles, gold was very close to the personal record of the pig meat swamping of its 200 m of meat.
The Tippmark comes from 17-year-old pipes since the Canadian Jutuititititititship contest ran by 2.16.58, the Priit Aavnik Ujugation block.
Gold last escaped, or perhaps ten years, A to finish.
In Finally, he went through his distance to 2.15.76 and achieved a good 7th seat with a new powerful peak.
Estonia's record (2.15.13), which is due to Alina Kendziorn, remained just over half a second.
The gold third edition of all the time saw the Estonian gold increase and its fresh top-level mark is the fifth ever result of Estonia.
The young hope for the future is the launch of Canadian adult Championships of 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in baltution and 200 mmmm and 400 mm in bundling.
Last week, Canada's Jutuals' championships took place in Tuonto, and gold also took successful start there.
He won 200 m in balfire with a silver man's time of 2.03.22.
This distance was so quickly swamped by a previous resort in 2008.
Estonia has only distanced itself from the record Estonian BSE faster than the Golden era.
A vibrant Canadian champion won a further 100 m voucher in baltulation with an excellent personal record and 56.66 in Estonia.
For example, her year's old mother, Kertu ly Alnek, has distanced it by just one century.
He reached a further 100 m wall of university in the opening of the notification of the pub in the course of 1.03.69.
For half a long distance, he won only the seventh seat when he sleep in the final assembly of 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian ferry tables at four different distance.
President Trump goes on holiday, critics insured teeth
The holiday season is in hand - that is, the break with the President of the United States Donald Trul.
However, since the Trump has been one of the most holidaymakers, critics are already wearing teeth.
According to US theory and the CNN, the President intends to have 17 days' leave in the cannabis in Bedminsteris, which is located in New Jerseys.
Although President leave began yesterday, the anti-Trumpi has been speaking for weeks.
They are asking the Photoman to be too frequent to be cleaned.
It is precisely that the President will have a week of time in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey in the cotton.
Incidentally, the Trump has not cleaned the President for its 196 working days.
For example, Mr Bush had already had 67 days on holiday for that period, with Barack Obama halving the number of Trump, for just 21 days.
But the Olympic world tends to forget things quickly.
The days after becoming President, Trump in the Trut gave the green light to say that there will be no time for a holiday for his ametrict, because a great deal needs to be done.
He also expressed his outrage about Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current President wrote on Twitter: 'While Obama has a holiday, plays golf, the brakes and the jässers are on the front, journalists in the country are pulling their heads off the fire'.
According to the officials of the White House, 17 days of golf club visit to pollen is not a betrap.
It is officially called 'working leave', during which the Trul has no time to read or to take other pro-sporting activities.
Furthermore, there was also a second reason for working leave.
It is precisely that the western system of the White House's retirement is changed and that all staff had to leave it.
The West Bank is also located in Ovalkatst and other presidential premises.
"I do not think that anyone else would like to be in the West in August if there were 38 degrees and no conglomerates," said Lindsay Walters, the white house spokesman, who stressed that the President would continue to work during his leave.
If President Trump goes to 17 days, you will get an idea of video.
Blocking critics from Facebook to 07 do not stand for national positions if you do not tolerate the voices of the voters.
The father of our country knew so much about the unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved Mr Washington, but the newspapers did not take a long time to get him to be bullied for everything from internal politics to his political principles.
Of course, the criticism upset him.
But he did not make his critics quiet.
Because, in 1783, Washington said that 'freedom of expression may be taken away from us and, more quickly and in silence, we could be chaired by sheep on slaughterhouses'.
This brings me to Mrs Hogan, the Governor of Maryland's kup, who has to be struggling to be more in Washington.
The organisers' submissions have blocked and erased at least 450 people who expressed their views on their official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Guard Union) therefore brought the case to the courts.
The Kuberner official's office paved the action empty and web commentates slide from reactions in a style of 'who is interested?'
'This is just Facebook, 'many people said.
But that counts.
And this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an overwhelming democratic state of popular Republican.
His approval percentage is the second best place among the 50 Governor of the country.
Hogan is not a reactive sight.
He has led the state firmly and remains strictly firm in his principles.
Furthermore, he has used her top tool to communicate with his constituents quite deliberately Facebook, presenting his own brick head, for the first time after the chemical waste.
Therefore, the website of the Governor, appearing on the official marking, is a public forum managed by the staff who pay taxpayers' dollars to the people who visit Kenya, and ultimately dangerous.
The Kendardent spokesperson, Amelia Chasse, defended the behaviour of the Governor in an interview given to Washington's Posselt, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderecasting.
But it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet browsing online, cutting down internet browsers, or people full of hatred.
The post was interviewed with a number of people who were blocked by Hogan.
This is what they are, in fact, the people who are in possession of elected leaders. The teacher, the owner of the company and the passport, and not Internet controls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thought-out and not ropaste.
Pastor quoted milk in his post, underlining the Catholic movement of Hogan.
The lawyer from Marylan Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Raman, did not incite hatred but rather hate crime.
"I have politely commented that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news," he wrote the post news story in the Annex to the country.
"I also do not like the idea that, if many people comment on the same subject, some of them are now inextricably calling it a collective effort rather than acknowledging that it is a great deal of concern for citizens."
What the Governor's official called 'targeted junk attack' would probably be invited by others to 'public support'.
The age of Facebook allows messages to easily be matised by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much cleaner than the old one when it was necessary to send out workers to do the same, to gather and bury critical editorial newspapers and to hold them up or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that is exactly what is happening now, just digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media toothless.
President Trumpi has brought Twitter users to court who have been blocked from Twitter's bed.
One of the first key judgments on this matter was made last week in Virginia.
James C. Cacheris, the US's Chief Executive Board, decided in Alexandria that the director of the Loudouni County Board breached the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the voter on Facebook page.
In Ktucky, the Governor Matt Bevinit (R) also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter for use.
This should not be so difficult.
In Washington, affordable postal costs had similar effects to those on the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers were dispelled by his way of leadership.
Even then, Washington had to face anonymous controls.
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseudo-unionms like Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making the decisions of Washington painfully recouped.
According to historical documents compiled by the Water-based George Washington magazine, he burned his cabinet in petitions criticising his views on the British brotherhood, Trade and shipping agreements.
But he did not force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, opinions and debates are fundamental pillars of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.

Poverty and death in the gold-rich land of Indonesia
When Barina Degei is preparing dinner, he will not use lead.
He seldom uses even a boy.
The timber in the capital of the Municipality of Papua POL, the Republic of the District of Dublin, in the house of the majority rotal, places the house's house in the local language in the place of the bar calling for the 'nota' in direct replacement.
In half an hour 'time, the fire in the brains will be taken from fire and skinned with unbeleaded hands.
Degei is sitting on another ancient island of flu, not only does she not have anywhere, but it is also doing its daily household works, for example, washing the water of cradle with a nearby sex.
The role of the hotspot is played by a bag in the uncovered room.
As he is the four women of his wife, he has not been appointed to care for any skins.
Polügaamia is common here on May.
Late work may be dangerous, however, for most of the people of Somalis to be unemployed and many of them are eating hard, and there are still soldiers here.
'nobody dares to go around after 5 o'clock in the village ',' he says.
It is a rare pilok in Papua mäki, a former Dutch colony which was intercepted in Indonesia in 1969 following a referendum which only made 10-26 older people vote in front of the forces.
The Dutch people's movement, released from the rule of the Netherlands, is encouraging their rails to the Jakarta Government, which is still holding the region under its strong control, preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors from being expelled.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into a Pope and western Pope, so independent Papua New Guinea remained eastern of the island.
The majority is both a remote and a backward seat, and a five-hour journey from the province capital Jayapuru, which then makes it possible to fly to Nabimel, is the same as the one that is set up to commemorate the rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city of approximately 19 000 inhabitants consists of cats surrounded by carmbs and covers laininous iron rockets, which have been transformed into different ruins.
Very few indicators have taken the road here, not to mention journalists, nor have there been almost any foreigners here.
Before the Christian missionaries came, Mee Pago paints were marched by the Sikhs with the name of Tamee.
There were other changes.
'We were not used to wear such clothing 'says Degei, referring to the' wire-hunted 'of your colour-rotation, the' dark plug and the English '.
"Before that, we only had a plant cow in the body."
Papua Indonesia is the most poor province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia.
But it is also a gold-rich country in Indonesia.
Just 100 km away from Paniao, a mountainous province of around 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world is Grasberg, which belongs to the company Fbetporana McMoran, which operates in Phoenixis.
In 2015 alone, Frereexport from this place amounted to about USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
Furthermore, it is possible to conserve imports of raw wood, worth which it is estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of suffering for paints, which are causing a stifling presence of a powerful Iranian army.
The 2005 study by the New York Times showed that Frereexport paid about USD 20 million to local troops and military units between 1998 and 2004, including USD 150 000 to one of the victims.
The attempts of the Pope to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden hall and is seamlessly betrayed.
Human rights activists say that more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1959 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Iranian army.
According to the Asian Committee on Human Rights, the massacre in the mountains of the genocide in Papua tribal countries in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, over 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Iranian police in the region.
The 2016 report of the Grand Prix of Birsbane District, entitled 'We shall lose all', contains testimony to the atrocities committed last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (one second report shows that rape and power shocks are particularly widespread) and the brutal repression of peaceful protests.
"It is difficult to read the number of victims, because such incidents occur every week, 'says Andreas Harsono, a researcher of Human Rights Watch, Indonesia.
The corps have been tightened up even more strongly, as Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from other Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demographics are changing, as the Indonesian people, Mr Jaava, Mr Kalimantan, Mrs Sumatra and the Sulawes Islands are arriving at black economic migrants.
Prince riding shops are selling a kbalbey and mixing vegetables to gado-gado, which are stolen along with ground level.
They cannot compete with them.
"Migrants started selling more cheaply than local boats in the traditional market," "said Androulla Andersson born in Paniai, who came to the capital of the province of Jayapurtis, who worked in the name of her work.
'The Latvian paint Mercedes Techmama-Mama [women] is therefore losing its market share '.
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, who is known to the people as Jokow, promised in his election campaign in 2014 to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Pope.
The former pub won 27 constituencies, including Paniai, on his way to the presidential Palace of Jakarta.
But the Pope has changed very little and the local feel cheated.
"Our hearts have been broken, because in 2014, we voted in favour of Jokow in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes with regard to restoring justice," says apprenticeships.
In fact, only two months after the entry into office of Jokow in October, Paniai was barely affected.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children singing from the rotail to Christmas when two Indonesians were stunned by the dark motorteway.
Children who came to justice told them they should include the front lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers insulted their tone and returned later to four soldiers.
Victims and spectators say that in the 'drink-driving', soldiers were trying to take children away and hiding them with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot among children.
One child, 16 years old Yulianus Yeimot, was so brutally beaten that he fell into the home.
A few hours later, the building of the close electoral Commission was burnt and things were even more escorted next day.
Some 1 000 young people gathered in the football pitch in front of the local police and military command centre to claim justice.
They carried out direct repair chips and presented a mab pago trimming a waita tantsu in which poultry songs were buried and buried.
Some protesters started to lecture the police and the military.
'When the crowd is more than three times resistance, let them down, 'the official document, which has seen the magazine time but has not been issued to local media publications,'.
The mother of the city of Kego Koto, Yeremias Kayme (56), felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking the public to go home.
Nobody had the will to listen.
"Turning around me, I was shot in the left, saying 'he said time at night in his private colours at the blood of a tree.
Kayare still not aware who was shot, but says that the troops' troops' troops' staged in the month came from.
'There was a lot of people, a lot of sweet, 'adds it.
The local man, Alfius Youw, was shot at his guns three times, according to a puppet.
"I would expect him and I watched him through his body to make sure that he is a man," said the magazine holiday synnically in Yohanes, who use only one name as many indicators.
"I saw he dead... Snovel lew."
The Chief Police officer Yotje Mende said to the reporters that he was only putting his own department under the security of his or her services, because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when we are threatened with killing," said Vice-President Pudjo Sulistiyo, the spokesman of the Police Service in Papua SI in 2015.
"This is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and injured.
The news of the killings arrived in Jakartail only on the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapuras made a passionate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses to be dealt with in Pope.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
Security minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an alternative mechanism for dealing with human rights crimes.
But almost immediately the excuses were also followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes, 'he said.
However, when speaking at the moment at Christmas 5 June in Jakartas, Wiranto withdrew his words by saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Pope.
Instead, he said 'everything is resolved by law'.
The Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of committing crimes against human rights, with more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the bloody referendum on independence in 1999, said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Pope, including what happened in Paniais.
The families of the victims of Paniai adopted such statements with a gloomy disregard.
"I have been interrogated four times over the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
'I am tired '.
He says that he is still living in fear for years later.
'I am afraid, 'he says.
"I am afraid that the army is arresting me, I am afraid I am shot."
He confirmed his view that the people of Paniai fear this incident.
He said that he had got the army out of the hand after helping to bury four victims.
"After burying the bodies, I was had to be looked by the army, 'he says.
The celebrations have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the people of the Egyptian police were shot in the neighbouring Paniai in Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when he went to a war between the residents of the villages and the head of the construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to hospital.
This male people, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby sea in the searby, died on the way to hospital.
The recent inhabitants of villages protested on a construction site before the company office.
The police said that the village's inhabitants were lecturing police officers to be stoned, which was last answered by warning children.
But local claims that mobile British people (the Iranian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were very panic, we are afraid of revenge," said Assistant Domingles Baden, who lives near the hospital and saw injured insecticides.
"I have beaten myself in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the police mobile British hybrid from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia.
The lack of meaningful development is feeding the dissatisfaction of the meals, moni, dann and dammal tribes living in the central mountainous land of Papua haljendaendaeva.
Many of them have joined the People's army of the Liberation of Papua generously (VPL) Perbels, which, according to its own, protects the rights of paint tanks, by ordering attacks and abduction by Iranian soldiers.
Some of the VPL's leadership comes from Paniaia, including Tadius Yog and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, over the last few years, the army has arrested in Paniai, under the pretext of defending the sovereignty of the state, and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never again appear.
Among the people of Papua geney, Panians are known as' tragic forgotten place '.
Poverty is a source of dissatisfaction.
The little rice that is sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases.
The Leib is the same unavailable.
People themselves grow all their food, mainly from Bahrain, with a little more fruit and vegetables.
Farming is a job for women, each of whom can care for four or five of the Baha'clock.
They usually keep most of the receipt of the family, the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten Bahá's pay only 10 000 Indonesian premises (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the heavy paint trees and the new migrants who have arrived in a row since the opening of new routes at Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Pope themselves often lacks capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in leaving the village because there is no jobs or money," says John Gobai, President of the Council of Paniai tribal tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world out of the Pope.
Furthermore, there are tight restrictions on foreign media.
French journalists Franck Escudie and Babridge Longchamp were expelled earlier this year because 'they did not follow the relevant practices', although they had been given a rare film permit.
The Vice-President of the Human Rights Watch Asian department, Pichm Kine, said that the election pledges made by Jokow have not been implemented to lift the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development.
"Journalists who are trying to report from the most peaceful provinces in the East of Papua Helesia and the Western Pope are threatening new threats to the rejection and blacklist of Yemen," said in his statement.
The lack of a satellite watch on the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to Papua San Suu Kyi.
In March, six Pacific countries, Bahrain, Nauru, Belau, Tupain, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, urged the UN Human Rights Council to examine 'various large-scale crimes' in Pharlia, including the shooting of Paniai.
The same countries have also supported the VPL historically.
Arrmanatha Nasir heitis charges by the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying to the press: 'In Indonesia, democracy and freedom of the press still exist so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bury'.
The local people want more foreign governments to be taken into account.
When the Dutch official delegation visited Jayapurat, the country's human rights Ambassador, Kees, on 4 May, the local people interrupt the meeting but wanted to be anonymous with the source, saying they were anxious to remain silent, urging that 'we want freedom'.
In Indonesia, there will be new presidential elections in 2019, but the paints do not believe they will vote again in favour of Jokow.
"Jokow is a man with good intentions, but people around him who are involved in firing Paniai say Hobai, President of the Council of the tribal tribal people.
He wants to give Jokow a sense that, apart from the fact that the people of Paniai live under the threat posed by the army, they are suffering from poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like other boats, regard their voice as debt to Jokow, which he has to pay.
'You do not need money, they want justice, 'he says.
Despite the theft and intimidation, families of the victims of the Paniai fire were coping with another symbolic objection, NEAFid, which swept one victim's dead police office and the military into the country.
Knowing that justice can never be put on the ground, they at least do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
'One of our family members was killed 'says a shot of Yacobus.
'What else can we do? '
Negover the Trui Tuch pill had already come under his hand for the second time.
On Friday, hundreds of people died of this 337 metre of age and of 79-order buildings in the world.
This is the second fire that has been ravaged for just two years from the high level of radiation called the Turin case, the Thimvikur.
The building was evacuated, no direct fire-related damage was reported and no direct fire was submitted.
"We sleep and threw out the fire sub-prime and people's fears.
We would wait for a tour and we had about 10 minutes to fall to the 50 order, 'said to the Reuterans one of the people who called themselves George.
According to Dubai civil protection officials, fire fighters were also deleted at around 4: 00 GMT at local intervals and seized the building.
The government said that it was working to give the victims a shadow of shelter.
This incident may raise again questions about the safety of high-level materials used on foreign soil worldwide.
Following the fire of the Torch Bureau in 2015, the investigation found that the most damage was suffered by steep fabrics - decoral panels and insulation of foreign space.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenportfolio Tower and the embanches could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that took place there in June, which killed almost 80 people.
See: These phones are likely to receive sales cards in the autumn
The time has come for the electronic filters to recover, because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperipheral a Premium came to the sale, and new hitt telephones are expected for poelers in the autumn.
According to the Tele2 marketing and sales Director Christian Semother, today's flagship ships are characterised by innovation, the eye-wing shandnner, the serser-servani 4K resolution, and the ultra-fast process.
Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the top of the Estonian smart phone sales table, gave great visibility in the world of technology.
In autumn, smart hubs are allowed to be even harder to hire, more resilient avenue, better camera and more water and more pollination.
He added that rumours suggest that there are already four top-level models that will probably conquer street sales tables.
These four smart phones top-level models will reach potales in the autumn of this year.
The lonamed iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach poelers by mid-September.
However, the rumours that the new Apple model looks like and what can be done are spreading a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences between iPhone 6s, Apple is expected to be completely different from previous ones on the occasion of the 10th birthday of Apple.
Four colours have been spoken: Black, White, Swedish cup and croreom.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen covering the entire telephone front, the loss of the dog's and the fingerprints of the puppet have been built in the back door.
The new iPhone model would look like a glass, the Apple design director JonyIve.
There has also been talk of iPhone's keramic version.
In addition to the 'big deal', the unrunners and the even higher quality camera, the A11 process range is expected.
This is certainly one of the most expected smart phones for the year.
The ex-post order of the new model Galaxy Spring 8 will begin on 23 August.
Although there have been many rumours of what new Galaxy jet will look like.
Admittedly, even more business users are meant, and S pen allows even greater functionalities.
The telephone fund should have two cameras, one of which is a lainurt and another one with a narrow view to teleobjects.
Nobody knows what two rebells are capable of, but in any case it is the first test of Samsung, which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8 for quality.
However, we are waiting hard for 23 August.
Although Nokia has sold sales this year with three smart phones headed by Nokia 6, their flagship vessel - Nokia 8 - is still missing, which is already presented on 16 August.
We expect a screen stretching from 5.3 to the bottom of the bargain and a fast-crack Qualcomm Sscarce dragon 835 processes and more resilient agitation.
Nokia also talks about aluminium corps and about significant levels of water and security, IP68.
Like Samsungone, Nokia has two stunning camera, an optimist produced by Zeiss.
Once the Sony firm flagship has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smart phones will be added, with even more innovative functionalities.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is slightly more modest than XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with a camera.
For the new Sony model, it has been speculated that this screen is at least hot.
What the reality is, we can already see the very soon, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flag vessel at the International Technology Forum IFA, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to transcripts leaked telephone calls, Trump sunt Mexico on the payment of the border wall
The Washington post unveiled the telephone calls between US President Donald Trumpi and Mexican and Australian heads of state.
On 27 January, Enrique Pena Nietole, the Mexican President, went to the Trump telephone call for the latter to stop public proclaiming that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American President strokes him for his public condemnation of the wall, saying: 'You must not say this to the press'.
The Trump was setting out his presidential campaign's promise to build a wall and age on the southern border of the United States that Mexico would pay for this project.
Transcriptors were also published in his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turmes, which reveals a tense debate.
The Trump told Turunele that the agreement whereby the United States takes on refugees to Australia is' ridiculous', 'nervous' and 'rum', and he stated that the agreement that was made during the Obama Administration would give him the impression 'guide', because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
The Trump ended the speech by telling the Turunele that 'this was the day's most unpleasant speech'.
The national court did not take a complaint against the city of OC MRP Liine in the event that the city of Tartu rejected their offer for the transport of buses and coach transport between July 2019 and 2029.
This is a letter rejecting the supply of OC MRP to Tartu buses and buses, as the offer did not meet the requirements, Anneli Aputin, Head of the Tartu City Government, explained.
This is a procurement for public transport within the Tartu city for the period of 1 07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP city Liine referred to the national courts for the decision of the Tartu Lcademy.
The national court did not act on this.
Although many people complain in the social media that the clip from the Weekise festival is disturbing their night and that the entire city is full of drink-driving officers, there are also many who do not have any negative words to say about the ceremony that is going on in the coast.
I am even positively surprised that the brakes were so polite in the shop.
I saw no disapproval or courtesy.
Even if I saw the Gulf, a wonderful wave is a little bit like it.
"It is nice that, as it comes, there is and joy of the Persian, which has been lost like winter, 'he will gladly add.
A wave of iron cows does not crumble.
If, when he was living in a city of centre, he was still listening to music being played on a beach, then now music is not yet up to his home ethos.
'but I hope I hear ', he says goodbye.
The Agnes, who talked with a fire, also says that the Grand Festival is rather good for the Perter - it is a great contribution to the turnover of local merchants.
He also welcomes the fact that the Grand Capital of summer has come to such a large extent.
The woman of Peollian melu does not.
Although I am no longer going to be on the coast, it is nice that rand has revived.
And it is good that the people are moving, and this has been the case three times, 'the woman says.
I think it was a little worse for the first time.
'They there were complaints', he will reflect.
But what he said is the case with the capital cities of summer.
"This Weekise is a very good prophmo for our small city," says Harri, who is on the park.
Life and möll have not put his life in the möll.
But for it?
We should all be united.
Think about how this interethnic communication is better.
After all, the music man does not lie.
It does not happen, although I live near it.
'Good people can and have no menace ', he says.
Visitors coming to the Persian Republic are, he said, courtesy.
'With the bottles they have joined a little, of course, but young people are young people and mothers, but give them a hand, but be people and we can do! 'Says he.
The people who travel on the island have travelled to somewhere by then, whether to relatives or to acquaintances.
"But overall, the festival has a positive impact on people - people like this medal," says Persian as a Tiina with children.
His family's Festival is not a shame either, even though it was even further removed from today's work last year.
Last summer, the ground was the second one, we heard more.
We live outside the city itself, that it actually goes a long way there from the River Persian, 'he talks.
Pearson cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revive business
On Friday, the British educational company Pearson said that he is cutting 3 000 more jobs and reducing his interim dividend by 72%, thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with the risks of business pressures.
The jobs to be made redundant, according to John Fallon, the CEO, is likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will be accompanied by the loss of 4 000 posts during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May his intention to cut costs by another GBP 300 million (USD 394 million) under the third-cost reduction programme to try to revive business that has been hit by the transition to high-speed digital learning.
A company that agreed to sell last month a company in the enterprise Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann said that their expectation for a year had not changed since the sales income increase was announced to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.

The attack in Kabul: The suicide suicide attack killed a NATO soldier
According to the Enesetapuch bomber, military convoys were attacked by officials in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several other.
In NATO's statement, five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
In the case of the city of Qarabaghi, three civilians were killed in a radar, despite the local reports.
This bombing is the last act of violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herati mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, two people were killed by suicide bombers in Kabul near the Iraqi Embassy.
NATO's statement said that an explosion took place on Thursday evening when the Afghan army, the collective patrol, attacked 'a man-made explosives'.
The statement states that everything is injured in a stable state and treated on the US military hospital Bagram flight.
According to the Correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic state (in the country) are a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabagh, NATO, Bagram.

This violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country's military forces and police forces.
According to the Correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf.
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the regulation following the sharks
The United States Environment Protection Agency (United Nations Environmental Protection Agency) annulled the decision to delay the adoption of the Obama regulation, which obliges states to limit emissions from flying, one day after 15 states referred the Agency to the courts for its conduct.
The EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday 2015, saying that it demonstrates the Agency's commitment to cooperation with states.
"We believe that we must engage in dialogue with our partners in our countries and listen to them," said the President of the EPA in his statement, Scott Pruitt.
The Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the level of ostility content in Peru, which measured pollution in different parts of the country, in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year on to arrival in 2050.
15 mainly democratic states, together with the Colombian community, submitted a complaint on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trumpi's government has tried to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, which, according to the Trumpi, is part of a more comprehensive agenda for growth.
But these efforts have led to reactions among the groups of democrats and nature conservation who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that 'the breathing of poppy air' could reduce the ability of Copts to work and increase the risk of dying in respiratory diseases, for example at the asthma.
German cigarettes can come to pipe.
German pigs and cattle can come to the pipes, as heavy rain threatens the yields of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, Banimal berg writes.
This year, it can be said that centuries of saturation before harvest may mean that fruit intended for bread production can only be fed into animals.
"The quality of content is far worse than the price of the soil and the worse than in 2015," said Mr Raphard Nepal, the analysis of Agravis Raiffeen.
This year, up to 40% of German nomniture could be used for animal feed, which is from feed in the same way as the usual one, in Agratis.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to any weather this year.
First of all, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by heat waves in June.
In July, Germany was hit by the German drama, which has continued in August.
Many eyes are on northern Germany, where rain is an obstacle to harvesting.
So far, only five per cent of nicotine has been repeated.
Most of the regions have not yet started harvesting, notified the local buyer of catches in Ceravis.
'It is quite a difficult day, Mr Frank Deckert Rendsburg, senior traders in Ceravis, said.
Consistency in everything, i.e. the rotten rocks of the internal design of Finns
Nature plays a part in the internight of locals, because the mesh views of the Saimaa fish population are reached in many rooms through major windows.
Every step is marked by our attempts by our northern neighbours to create both shellfish and perfect (energy-saving) homes.
Ihoney, and also compliance, are worthy of the wood use of Finns as construction and reconstruction materials, furniture and beauty.
Virgised techniques and smart solutions are found in mesh houses both as a builder and (home) architects.
It highlights that the theft of black, white and grey links, if supplemented by wood rapes and topipes, can be very disturbing.
Good ideas can be given a week to go on the ground, as the air will run until 13 August.
Tarvians and spices suggest that this kitchen is often copied.
The Ööl today's line was watered down to Weekise Festival Balticen, and Martin Garrido did all he can to remember the last speaker.
The people were truly turning at the time of Mr Simpson's speech - songs, hubs, tanks were stunned.
When lunch stopped, a common mastery of the River Persian city was dispersed.
We will bring together the photographs that attempted our photographs for three days, via Weekise.
You are certainly also in your search for yourselves.
Müry Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible confrontation
Mr Vasyl Lomachenko and Mr Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face up to 66.7 kg of poxicy in the most attractive shop in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in the ESPN office in LOS Angeleres, in the same rooms as Garcia, the unwinning World Boavian Council lightweight champion, walked the other side of the corridor to welcome Lomachenkot, World Boassies assies Monitoring zationi sulgweight cheque.
Following a unanimous decision by Garcia, the victory achieved by the former four-time world champion, Adrien Broner, on Saturday in Showerial, both combatants belong to the top of the ranking.
Garcia extended its hand better and said: 'How does the summer go, the cheempiis?
I wish you luck. "
Lomachenko will defend his belts against Miguel Marriga on Saturday evening at 19 CZN.
When a couple of photos were available, Lomachenko's memory jer Egis Klimas stated that there would be a 'perfect yardstick' to possible confrontation between the fighters.
"I am former sultagic," said Garcia.
"I called on Bronger [63.5 kg], but I am not so big.
I am small for 63.5 kg.
I want to move downwards.
And he must move up to half the easy weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The Fänds have requested this.
Let us then get them back on the ground. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world needs this fight."
In the climate, the question raised was whether it should be paid for this, which is part of his strategy of allowing Lomachenkol to debate the end of this year at 61.2 kg in the class to make it possible for a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 novans), which also has an interest in fighting Jorge Linarese Linarese and Luke Campbelli's match with the winner of the Embassy after the easy title of the ceremony on 23 September.
"Looking at this fight could be worthwhile, as fans have asked for this opposition," said Garcia, later, that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial packages.
"We are the main players.
No other name can get so much attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said that she considers Lomachenkot 'a force fight' and could go to his Saturday's match.
However, Lomachenko was modest in praising Garcia, saying that he thought that the three divisjon championist from Riverge saw 'very slow; apologies, Mseley... you wanted it nodistant'.
According to Garcia, the aim was to show the strength of the blows and then to bow to the boy.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension to be growing to challenge them.
"This is a fight that is waiting for realisation.
No other confrontation causes so much attention and slander.
I am more than willing to work on this, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: 'I have been waiting for the best fighters, and Maey is precisely that.
This will be a good fight. "
What world-based pressures are being moved from Estonia?
The soil was extended and issued by the police and border control authority (PPA) record more than 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to study, study or family.
When, for example, the soil was decided to issue a fixed-term residence permit of 6702 foreigners, the Philippines was 4928.
The services cannot tell how many migrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared by the Ministry of the Interior.
While nearly 500 Ukrainians were knocked to Estonia 10 years ago, in recent years, this figure will reach around 2 000 close.
The number of applicants for a permit extension rose dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis, with 1087 people receiving fixed-term residence permits in 2014, up from 675 in the previous year.
In Estonia, the statistics office is the largest increase in the number of Ukrainian citizens, with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia in excess of their borders.
"The Ukrainian community has been a great one in Estonia all the time and, due to difficult circumstances, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already before the family, the spokesperson, Kristin Ramallah, at the Ministry of the Interior, declared.
Soil and Kabila had the number of Ukrainians admitted to a fixed-term residence permit even higher than that of Russian citizens, even though in 10 years the longest-term residence permits have been issued to the last ones.
If Ukrainians come to work mostly here, Russian citizens will be able to work for family migration.
"Given the historic Russian community here, they are more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia," said the Migration Consortium, Helina Mea.
"Looking at where Russian citizens who have been admitted to Estonian territory have moved to live, Harjumaa is now the Eastern Virgland," he added and pointed out that about 40% of them have been married by EU citizens.
Soil was granted a fixed-term residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permits was reduced.
"Compensation is due to the fact that, instead of extending residence permits, a new residence permit has been requested for Estonia to be established permanently," the journalist's spokesperson at the Ministry of the Interior explained that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonian residence permits has remained rather stable for years.
The new residence permit for Estonia to be permanently established will allow foreigners who have lived here to apply for at least three years from last year.
Its aim is to encourage the Silk-up of the people who have been adapted.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires five years, for example.
The extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased since the new residence permit.
For example, soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can exchange their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit was popular in the app - the holders of a bad passport in the soil (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Finns (36).
A total of 1968 people were able to live in Estonia for their part, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese people.
With the first half of this year, the total number of such applications is already 1269.
In 10 years, surprisingly Nigeria has become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residency.
When three residence permits were issued to nigerals in 2007, soil was 200.
Nigeria is coming to learn from this university.
The Estonian higher education institutions are also popular, for example, among Georgians, the Chinese and the Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased mostly thanks to learning games.
They also have the rule that where the community is in the pipeline, it is easier to come to others, "added Ramallah.
Over ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, just as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 South Korea, 40 Indonesia and four Uruguay.
If around 6 000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit a year, this is about 0.46% of the total population.
Even if you look at the citizens of the European Union, migration remains around a percentage, "the Main said that the figures are actually small.
A total of 14 822 people died in Estonia, according to the statistical agency, 13 792.
This means that immigration exceeded the second anniversary of emigration.
Most extraditions and movements are Estonian citizens, but more of them are among those who leave.
Therefore, Estonian citizens had a loss of the soil with 2 000 people.
The Estonians are particularly travelling between Finland and Estonia.
Mlong Couture printing tataincssimde lures with sats, weeds and tarrogance
However, in the north-west of the idea, there is a history for Mrs Tammeoru - old paints and defendants: 'I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire the early thieves and crats of the old era.
If you go a bit on the flip, you will study and learn to this every day.
This is a pleasure in finding out.
The world of MMMlong Couture's glacier may seem like some alien, but the designer does not think so.
You yourselves decide how much soul your life!
As a friend, I have a whole sail full of the wounds of mine, couture.
Because, and it is not his fault, he does not live in Hollywoos and does not go on a red whim every day; he wants to wear these most beautiful brokers, and he is suffering!
You can live your own life special!
The Moeman does not recognise the gap between the shining events and the grey day.
It was this reasoning that put the rolling stock in the land, forests and fields in Estonia, into the people that are often unable to reach.
For example, a joint collegiate was presented a long time ago, in comparison, in Jevening and in the Bay of Perlo moefinel, where 45 mosques were filled by Queen's Quefilee.
In Tallinn, there is often a hang, a dignified slogan, but there are more emotions elsewhere - slogans, bbavo, stand up, you want to thank you.
A large proportion of the audience had to be just news, but now they are the fans of Mammu Couture.
If you overshoot people's expectations, they are spirited!
And I like the feeling that I am with my motive like the summer.
Pernus had a 50-metre red carpet, a whole-day lorry full of stickers, seemed to be unable to come to an end.
Mrs Maria does not recognise that nature must be presented by a supersuperimperialist superb, she will be happy to bring ordinary women.
I often call on my own customers - they have always come with pleasure.
That is how much experience is so lax, the ice ice layer found a wonderful piece!
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own play, I am always behind the ground to give a final piece of things as a hopeless feisist.
My nervous would not allow a calm watch on the floor.
Mrs Maria Maria is this kind of moelogy who wants not only to play a representative role, but to be present in everything.
I have my sister in the nuclear field, most of the collections I carry out myself.
I like the whole process, where you play with details, to discover.
I am never far from my own creation and I am not afraid of work.
It is not limited to the subject, but also to the style, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything must fit the days of a woman of a temperment.
The fanatics are still receiving huge amounts of work.
I cannot say when my working day ends, for me it is just a happy day!
I am still very lucky - it is like an unstoppable happy joke: I do something beautiful, man gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
It has been said several times that my brokers have a land grace - they make themselves feel like a printing tag.

Martin Myrsep U18 boys: The weapon of the Estonians' alagropipipe is now turned against us.
The damage, the fairytale, ran out.
The first thing was to say that we could not get our own songs.
And when so much difference comes in the table, there is nothing to do, "Estonia said U18 corvpallipos 61: 75 fall to Britain, our only basketball, Mr Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsep.
Opponents took 28 Palace from the south-west and were so much more attacked as a result.
We were also not prepared to protect them aggressively and not to attack them, it created.
Many of the attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up protection.
However, in defence, they have been able to keep their hands between them everywhere, we could not combine.
It created the team from the bottom.
The anti-personnel homework was better done.
Myrsepa estimates that Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes to take the anti-missile.
The last quarter had a mistake - we had zero, but opponents had already received a number of quick records.
Atlessness and the intense offensive that was our weapon at alagropipipipipipipipipithic now all turned against us.
Today we did not have the strength to resist their aggressive behaviour.
The Myrrhenp remained satisfied with his negligent Kalevis, Matthias Tastery.
Security in general can say good words about the whole team, so far there was a single shock in the game.
It is a pity that such aggressive reactions had not been met before.
It has always been self-confident and played out today, but it seemed that he had tired - he has borne a huge burden.
But he made some of the fine gestures I have seen in the past, 'added a guide.
Appalling figures: EM-turnir, in the corvpallilip of neps, threw three less than 10 points in the EM-turnir with three quarter exceptions...
The U18 age class does not just work in the BDvisjon corvpallitinir in Tallinn, her first to start in Dublin on the day after yesterday.
And, unfortunately, the game with Poland was pulled in the area of anti-missile systems.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but after the third quarter, 9: 49, or only in the last ten minutes, opponents took their feet from the gas beet and 16 were left in the same period: 16.
Estonia, the third quarter, in the first and second quarter, threw Estonia 4, the third point...
In doing so, they initially caught two pieces of four minutes from four benches, but they played 25 pieces, then one yellow in the back door and then another 21 tales.
Perhaps in almost half an hour, 47 fingers were found to be caught one.
In addition, 2 points came from four free slogans.
The loss of allowances was a reasonable figure of 12.
Poland's surface hit by the game ultimately amounted to 33% and 13% (68 / 9).
Estonia has started with two losses, with 83 out of 56 of Portugal on the opening day.
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement supplies
Today, the NATO permanent "no-fly" group arrived in Tallinn for a week to complement the vessels' reserves and prepare for the pre-existing exercise.
Ships are preparing for landing on the sea during the course of the visit, thereby allowing crews to be allowed to leave the boat for a paternal holiday.
Following the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonia's waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations for the search of historic explosive remnants.
"The participation of indigenous people in and the combined activities carried out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the alliances," said the chief captain Arto Reinland, the overseas fleet's top office.
Since 29 June, NATO will chair the Latvian Navy Captain Captain, Gvido Laudups, a permanent mine mine of mine, who took over the team's duties from the Estonian capter Johan-Elias Seljab at the ceremony in Riga.
The group's flagship vessel is LVNS Virsaitis, a Latvian naval force which also has a group's leading office.
This semester, the Estonian Navy Museum Museum, is also part of the international unit.
As one of the four vessels under the NATO naval board, NATO is the first permanent mine group of primary responsiveness units, which the Alliance could send to different parts of the world within five days.
4. - Not 13 August, the Pirita kooter's refresh will once again become a place where Burma's Day of Birgitta, called by Maestro Er Kans 13 years ago, will be held down.
This year, Mrs Festival, the city of Tallinn, the artistic leader of the philosopopopononia, said, 'The Jootis (36), will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented'.
The risk of hearing from Joost: 'Traviita' and Tosca, balletilalaanswers from the Bolerost ', the' Karlssonin 'camp, and nor is there a lack of production of the scheme, which is this time Joseph Haydni's wonderful oraendo, by the same international team of creators who brought him to the Piriladen Hague square in 2015.
Mrs Festival has much more than just concerts and theatre replies.
This is higher than any music theatre in its usual form.
It is a festival that takes power and never gets rid of.
Because the experience that the listener receives in this superior and salvable environment puts human mind ringing and touches on human beings in a way that cannot be described.
Risk to you, you are the first year leader of Birgitta Festival.
Did the Maestro Eri Klaskins not feel a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus, it has been helpful.
I was pushed through a whole student career and also supported by the start of my diosote career.
Perhaps it is thanks to this that I will be easier to continue his work.
So much charity has been stunned by the Festival team of Burma in Klas, and of course it is also passed on to me.
It was excellent to join a team who knows how things are going to go.
It was Mr Klaska's great heart that gave me the power to move ahead very well with Mrs Festival in Tallinn.
And here I am and can do it.
What could the public at this ceremony today, what special offer do you offer?
We have the names of artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, surprisingly, the first baller, written on the speech by Mrs Lindgreni, is coming to presentation.
This is' Karlsson lb '.
And one criminal nuance in this regard is that the author of this ballel is the Latvian composer, Juris Karlinning, who himself declared a wish to write it to the tune.
Apparently she has already had a caraature of Karlsson, who has already lived in the breath of the child.
At the risk, how are you all the nuances?
My life-supporting fellow man is certainly thanks.
Such work requires a system of support and much love, and I am luckily cured of it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotion does not depend so much on people as I myself, or how I will be against every new day.
And such awareness of the way we have been held, of being positive and, in fact, of laughing ourselves into the mirror of the morning, was greatly increased by my happy percentage.
Especially now this week, when the most important tests are, I have been particularly keen on this and it is working.
To laugh itself is an act of amushall and it is raising the tone.
That is simply not a word.
I think that people do not know half the things of their own body that the universe offers them, but it is one that everybody himself is gradually admitting.
Now, it is an important moment.
Is there also a ritual before the dirigend was taken?
There are still clothing, and clothing must be changed against more convenient ones.
This is a small moment for ourselves.
But, generally speaking, I have no chance of pumping or making a little wool before I speak.
In fact, I even like to have active contact with people, even before they take dirigendium.
But come all to Birgitta Festival, what is also to be detected here, not least for the big manager and balleti war.
See a stark video with the risk of Joostiga!
New results of tests on the age of Swedish asylum seekers were published
In Sweden, the latest results of the tests show that more than 80% of the constitution was assessed as older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute for Pharmacovigilance (Rasytspreferably inalvert) started tests earlier this year.
The tests were set up to assess the age more accurately during the application of the asthma after Sweden's Office for Migration (IOM) criticised for failing to correctly appoint several allegedly juvenile refugees.
To date, Jordan has sent 680 cases of testing and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 24 81 tests between March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) was assessed for 18 years or over and 25 more cases, the Institute for Legal medicine assessed that the 'testing may be 18 years old'.
In 432 cases, it came to the conclusion that the person is' probably younger than 18 '.
The tests will only be used if the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson, who works in the Institute of Justice, the results are consistent compared with those of previous months.
"We do not see a big difference compared to the statistics of previous months, but rather consistent figures," he said to the newspaper The Local.
It is not necessarily the case that a large proportion of cases were assessed on average than 18, which does not mean that asylum seekers have been making their age known.
In May, the EIT issued the results of the 581 test and said that in 442 cases, there were indications that the person examining is 18 years old or older.
But when the newspaper Svensson ska Dagblad investigated the results of their 581 test, it became clear that in 243 cases, the person had stated directly that he would be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, whereby HL-toothmeters and swine-type MRT are carried out, then they are being criticised by dental doctors and radiologists in some circles.
One of the sceptics is the endokrinology of the Karolinska Institute, Mr RadMarcus, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to find out whether they were going through the audience sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the method of measuring what is currently being used should be used.
The designation of biological age in this way is very precarious.
If we cannot say firmly, we should not pretend that we get, 'said to the newspaper, he said forestry.
But Johan Göransson's trial Institute for medicine was able to protect the accuracy of the tests: 'Overall, it can be said that the risk of baby seating inaccurately is low.
Perhaps the biggest risk, with about 10%, is if you are in a little under 18. "

The 20-year-old newer, Anna Maria Orel, made a nice debate in London, receiving 67.37 places of good 18.
After that, MM noorim was a female jungle and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The contest went well and has had a good experience.
With the first test (64.80), I immediately took the risk of keeping my average result, the second (62.80), and the third one (67.37), very clearly said after the contest. "
I was able to have my own emissions, and I am very pleased that I found it.
Ms Maria Oreli MM's debate ended with a good 18-time session.
Vihmasadu Orelit did not mix, as he is training him through the Quartet stage.
'I am afraid ', he said a little bit of a muddle.
The London Olympic Assembly had almost a full house of people, did the people have their own house or were able to get rid of them?
I have been to Tajani, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says that this will add - that is the case.

After that, he confirmed that he would be satisfied with the MM debate and he is still waiting for a lot of good competition: 'I came here with the 32nd outcome of the season of the street, the last one, I closed down to 18.
This is a very good result.
I am 20 years old and More - that is the only thing that counts.
I take a good experience and, in some days, I want to compete on behalf of the medals.
Western Virgina kuberner announced party change
The Western Virginia-Democrat Governor, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening, together with President Trumpa, that he would change political parties.
'Whilst it or not, the democrats walked away from me, 'said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having been a lot of cheerful and thought for... today I say to you, the Western peaches, that I cannot help you any longer as a democratic Governor."
The rubber was applauded.
'Thereafter, I will be a Republican, 'added Justice.
"As a engineers, I would say to you that it is time to play a different game."
The Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Virginia.
Truary won a quarter in Western Virginia on 42 points and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forterai, is the only billion state-owned, was elected in 2016.
Forticent states that it has coal mines in five states and coal business quite from its own father.
It has a value of approximately USD 1.59 billion.
At the same time, on Thursday night, the Republican National Committee (RNC) published a declaration that 'the party exchange of Governor Justice is yet another blow to the democratic parade, which would rather prevent the country from being improved again rather than working for it'.
'Over 15 months of governors and controls over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent expression of parking that is out of the beginning and cannot find a positive and united message, 'said RNC representation, in the McDaniel CS Newsi statement.
It is hardly surprising that there are many people, there are many injured.
Urmet, who is in the medical hotel on Weekise, told the girl yesterday that posters had had to be distributed quite a lot.
The mountains and brands are fundamental, excuses and easy failures.
Of course, the main, left and foot-and-mouth.
According to Urmeti, visitors to the festival come with false footwear, and so the problems come.
Media have also had to help those who have suffered a few major injuries - there have been some panic and also one foot-out.
We have also made blessing when a person has put his hand or the finger at the head.
We are doing less haste here, we are sending more to hospital.
See the videos as to whether the brakes on the media would also be treated with painkillers.
Coe praised the Russians for their fair apologies for the Dingushall.
The international rallied Sebastian Coe, who said 'Russia's honest apology from Thursday' for the Dingushall, has given a clear signal, but has reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country to return to sport.
The Russian kronboard rhene Dmitry Shycehtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup that the competition ban imposed on his country is the right one and has a firm aim to fight doping.
He apologised 'for all light-entry groups who have been cut off in competitions by golden and silver medals'.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on competition in force, which was introduced in November 2015, following the report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today it was a very honest presentation, a very honest presentation, saying to the press the President of IAAF.
"The Council and the Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognised that they had had had had quite difficult times and that they are doing their utmost to reform the alunion."
He also welcomed Russia's acceptance of its own recovery criteria, according to Coe.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the proposal of the working group that this is not the time for withdrawal from Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything possible over the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always come to the principle that we want to separate clean sportspeople from the system that was broken, 'in his annex.
One hundred Russian blender who meets the strict criteria of IAAF is competing with the hybrid world championship in London on Friday as neutral sportsmen.
On Monday, Rune Andersson, head of the IAAF working group, said that Russia is still not meeting several criteria for reinstatement.
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that lecturers who have been banned are still operating freely.
The electric car revolution makes a significant difference in demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Little because the electric car revolution makes a significant difference to the fuel market until infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that they win from one place and lose another, smaller mining firms do not help.
Glencore coal and oil currently serve, but in the era of electric cars, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will increase.
This year, the votes of the UK, France and Norway governments on the spread of electric cars have increased their contributions to allow the ban on the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
Therefore, Volvo has already knew that he is planning to give up an internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper blue 3 electric car to the market.
Banimal berg's New Energy Finance Facility estimates that over two decades electric cars will be sold more than those using oil-fired fuels.
"For some metals, this will change everything," said Simona Gambranin Banimal, the raw materials analyst of Capital Economics.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, which have been growing demand for years.
Electricity cars have approximately three times more copies than the conventional car, publishing Glencore.
An even bigger response is needed at the charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paris estimates that it will increase demand by around 5% by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and humanans.
Glencore will be the income of electric cars from the rising wholesale price rise and the fact that there is the biggest cobaltier producer in the world, predicted by Jeffila's group.
This broker company estimates that the winners of the Fbetreport-McMoRan and First Quanma Minerconventions are other winners.
The market is reacting to a changing trend.
This year, 70% of the London metal stock exchange line has been mixed.
The price of the soil was 37%.
The answer has also been 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore shares rose by 20% in London, having exceeded the price rise to rival Rio Tonipa Group, BHP Billitoni and Anglo Stream.
On the side of the losers, lead companies such as Recyhtx and Campine are companies who have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of the Plic is the batteries supplying the start-up of cars with a diesel engine.
Electric cars use filter-based hysteums.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, the Bank of America's Merrill Lynch Methol, the analytical officer of the metal market.
The impact of the split in the form of price movements is still not visible.
The Plic has been fishing 17% this year, with the best methane in London among the main industrial metals.
Investors will see problems for metals in the long term.
"I am not sure that leads to such bad behaviour, because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, the chief company of the metal broker Triland Metals.
If lead is to fall, it will be slow.
Perhaps that will happen in about 10 years' time.
Meanwhile, stricter emission standards mean that hybrid subsidies are growing, which are more often dependent on advanced lead-based batteries, valued by international lead and by the investigative body.
Labortions like aluminium replacement are a replacement of steel, as a lighter car can drive less electricity.
This explains an additional 1.6 million tonnes of closed minimum demand between 2013 and 2016.
It represents 2.7% of the world's output of aluminium.
This trend is likely to grow, says Widmer.
Aluminium has been fishing 13% this year, as the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market shortages.
Steel manufacturers do not.
The holding of ak Slashing works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce wonderful car lights.
ArcelorMittal and Slanta Europe are also trying to develop a lighter meltdown from steel to oppose the minimum.
"The strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paris, the analysis of the matter, Sylvain Brunet.
Europe is seeing some progress.
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to the plate.
Soil took about half of this precious metal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars, and was announced by the metal finer Johnson Matteries.
"Many of the raw materials currently facing high demand, such as oil and plate, may not have a high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, the Natixid raw materials analyst.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Plaatinatatatine producers believe in the continued demand for diesel hybrid subsidies.
Marc Grynberg, leader of Uncore, said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025.
The great hope of Plaatinatatatatiners in the 10-year perspective is for cars based on hydrogen cells developed by Toyota Motors and Hymuni Motos, which depend on a plate to produce electricity from hydrogen.
However, until now, this technology has not yet commercially justified itself.
"The Diet appears to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars," said Exane BNP Paris from Brussels.
German car manufacturers were severely affected in July, as the Stuttgart court banned diesel in the cities of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How the monetary rules for football affect the shift of Neyra to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing the uncontrolled spending of European football clubs will not prevent the world-wide shift of Neyra from the Spanish football club to the Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences for UEFA, the governing body, which dominates the European game and which has the power to ban teams from participating in the security of the prestigious League of Ministers, are still waiting until Paris for Saint-GerMay.
The financial rules for fair play (FFP), established by UEFA in 2011, mean that the PSG must prove at some point that the Neyra transition was financed without huge losses.
EUR 222 million were paid to Barcelona (USD 262 million) for the fact that the Brazilians were able to buy out of its contract, and the Neyra salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here there are some aspects of the migration of Neyra to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to go out such money for the recruitment of Neyra and for inclusion in its stationary clothes, given that the team is funded by the family governing the Katar energy pipeline.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players, but they must balance it with legal sources of income that enable them to come out of football.
Mr FFFP laid the foundations for Michel Platini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs who are falling into debt in search of success would actually be engaged in fraud and risk buying out if the banks or owners were to give up support.
From 2011, the FFP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of their debts.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 in Chelsea - buying a club with potential and then spending heavily to improve the team and to create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During this three-year evaluation period, which runs until 2018, the FFFP can bear the cost of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini was dismissed in 2015 by the presidential Office, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," said last week The negotiator, Andrea Traverso, who is UEFA's FP Supervisor.
Although PSG tachored for the 'buy-in' clause for Neyra as one full payment, they will be able to allocate this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the contract.
Mrs Neymar concluded a five-year agreement, so it is possible to indicate a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
In 2014, the first wave of FFP sanctions was the most severe penalties imposed on the PSG, along with Manchester Cityga, which is part of Abu Dhabi.
The PSG was fined 60 million euros (USD 82 million at this point), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club required to limit the team of the League of Meists to 21 players during the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA seeks clubs which can try to override regulatory authorities by exposing their revenues through companies linked to owners of clubs.
The Katar company may sponsor the PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to be over-standard market levels, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Qatar's VAT Authority's PSG support was inextricably displayed.
It has been said that some of the GUE / G service could come from Qatar through contributions from the World Cup Management Committee for 2022.
However, the PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neyra could become a world championship and claim that UEFA regulators would easily be able to quash such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on GPS mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition pro-actively with PSG.
They spoke to the press on the condition that their anonymity is guaranteed, as they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PSG.
Latest reports show that the PSG made a profit of over €10 million in the 2015-2016 season at around €542.4 million.
The figures for the last financial year have not yet been published.
The PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have a positive impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and snus.
The club expects a minimum of 30% increase in turnover in relation to the conclusion of the contract.
Spain, too, having clearly upset one of the biggest football stars, sought to block the move by saying that the PSG is violating FP.
"This is a clear case of" financial doping "with a club and a country," said President Javier Tebas, in La vie, AS, to the Spanish newspaper, indicating that the PSG belongs mainly to the Katarias.
Arsenal mänejer ArţWenger, who belongs to the American sports magnage, shares with La Scotland the view that the state finances the club.
"This is the result of property rights and has changed the whole football landscape completely over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, then it will be possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player. "

Today 50 years ago: The suntest storm in Estonia, which was fodder off houses and windows.
The orchestra, which was designated as the stormy of the century, raging on 6 and 7 August caused major damage, particularly to the West, Harjuria and the Black Sea.
In the north-west of Estonia, during these days, the wind was over 30 m / s.
My old ametric was beating one of the maps trees from the other in Bavaria and citing them with orders.
All was blind and ragne, like the world stage.
The mother has already cut off the house, recalled in 2002 the old Mrs Linda Kurova Haapsecret magazine Estonian nature in this interview.
The wife of Linda's wife saw his own planted tour collapsed.
But what support you are still going to put in the hands of you, where you are coming up against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, the windows were sleeping in the water, "said Haapsalus Kalda, Mrs Linda tone, who lived on the streets.
The fact that the roads were full and the office office's office had been flying 20 to 30 metres, Linda most shark stores, just as it was next morning.
According to local authorities, the cage behind Paralepa was behind the sun, some were completely lengths, some boys.
Everyone saw it very frustrating, the storm went through the beautiful old trees as ragby and pragmatism like a war.
Western Viruland was not particularly badly affected by August 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the losses were also high there, Stalin's theatre in 2007.
The Batsalu Lfossil Park and the Padise Park were wiped out from the ground, but our achers were also severely affected.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured by up to 35 metres a second, or approximately 130 kilometres a hour.
In Tallinn Meriane, a few lead caste cries had been sounding 'mother, mother, on the evening of 6.August.
The Canaries are air and no longer get the buck! ', wrote Virumaa Official.
The generation's natural building in Viljandiland was so destroyed during the storm that it was decided to be dismantled later.
The August storr was not opposed to the design of the Türi District mountain, which was later not restored.
The newspaper Red Turot wrote on 12 August 1957 that the restoration of towns and cities and settlements from the trees that have been hit and their vehicles is progressing slowly, and the population could be involved in corrogation work.
Grains also suffered greatly in Turin, and the newspaper stated that 'party organisations must be both on corps and on fertility corps as an incentive and guidance'.
Orkaans can be spoken when average wind speeds exceed 32.7 m / s.
The watertight wind in Estonia will remain at the age of 2 November 1959, when Ruhnul was measured as a speed 48 m / s.
The island of the Vaindstory was broken by a metre, so the strong wind speed measured could not be recorded accurately.
Secret of holiday areas: Night corrotation and poor coastal waters
Younger summer weather also means less corroboration in the beaches of Tallinn.
"If there is no, people are on the ground, and if not, there are no people, then there are also people, 'the quares will be the quantum corners.
The city of Northern Tallinn in Stroom is being torn up by rogue.
They are offered meoloous competition by a pigic tractor on low turns, which is devoid of platinum triipe.
In fact, the last seven-cent of the deep-sea litter is travelling through the sea pit and the people's shelved shelters: Bottles, cigarettes and so on.
People are still coming to rank, whether they are warm or not.
If it is beautiful, people are on the ground, and if not, there are no people, 'the management of the private company hospital hospital as a beacon is said by Alexander Usov, President of the reconstruction works.
There is a pump-back at 6.30 p.m. and there is a bitter corps on the coast, because at 8: 8, the poster must be in order for people.
The job placement is already at four o'clock.
Apart from Stroom, he is still watching on the Pirita, Harta Lake, the Cakumäe and Palaraare Pikakari.
Landfill amounts have fallen.
Years ago, there was much more.
People can now already assess what is being done for them, "the Usov who has been raging the migrants for 15 years.
It was the case that, when something new had been stood up, it was already a test next day.
Now it is kept to what is on the ground.
Clean coast price
One of the biggest jobs on the Estonian coast is the repetition of the rubbish, the adru, which has been rabbed on the sea.
For example, in the Carta coast, it must be transported by 400 000 tonnes of coastline.
'This is an incredible amount ', marks Usov.
Another large category is municipal waste, or all that people are leaving behind.
There are eight large rubbish lines at a semi-kilometre stretch in Stroom, which need to be emptied three times a week.
So much is done about rubbish.
However, the cold summer days have meant that rubbish is five per cent less than otherwise.
The third species is abandoned.
These are mostly children's TV spots.
The old sov has broken ten towns and the sludge from the sand.
These owners will be waiting for a floating wood route.
"Usually they will be more out of them, but it is normal harvests," and the sun knows that soon it will find them again from the sand.
Children come to rank and take toys to bury them again.
Landfill knife
Erika Scholler, the administrative services representative, admitted to the hospital, is disturbing local careers in the tractor.
Noise, which lasts from night to night, is mixed up by people living in the neighbourhood.
On the day, however, this work is impossible.
In one month, rand has to be interrogated twice.
"If we do not do that, then we will be fined by the city," Scholler will mark.
However, like Pirita, Pikakka and Percauts, Stroom rand is also intended to get the international flag of the Stroom.
"Compared to Europe, Estonia has much more work to do to care for beaches," says Scholler.
We have more administer and more stone and more difficult to join the sand.
But we have less rubbish in our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Listening to the talk of rubbish, a man living near Stroom's beaches is moving around a conversation between a journalist and corrogation staff, highlighting current bottlenecks.
The picture of the morning is in the gallery everywhere.
The problem is birds and bottle slaves who have drawn the rubbish bags into the rock, "Martin says.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour so far, Martin hopes that the city Government will do something with the bars and, for example, put them on the rocks to prevent birds from being on the spot.
In general, however, Martin Stroom's beaches is satisfied with developments.
We can see that the city is looking after this.
It has become more pleasant with children's fields, enlightened and newly asphalt roads.
It was once that only one way could go on a single route, "Martin notes.
Findings of the Aardescent in Stroomis: Coins, only coins
A metal period of tomorrow has had to be exploited by 40 years old Dimitri, who, as a ardescent, is sailing on the coastline with metallic depression.
He does not believe that, today, and in the future, something is found to be worth.
Marine angles are not sufficiently generous to do so.
"I have been dealing with this for one year and has not found any value so far," says Dmitry.
As a refrigeration, there are some euro coins, bottles and also dangerous pounds that later throw in the rubbish.
Normally, coins are still.
'Well, finger and whatever else usually does not exist ', they are owned by the armies.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level as unprofitable growth and the easing of inflation have cushioned speculation in relation to the increase.
Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain a loophole, as household incomes have put interest rates on standby.
The monetary policy decision-makers of the Bank (MPC) voted for 6: 2% in favour of keeping the ceiling 0.25% and fewer members this month are calling for an increase, as slow growth has weakened support for the upsurge.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecast from 1.7% in 2017 to 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain, as inflation is still expected to rise to 3% in the autumn.
However, the Bank also signalled that the increase in rates is necessary to contain inflation from Brexon over the next few years and that a expected increase in lending costs could be necessary in financial markets.
Members also voted to partially withdraw the mammoth package which was launched a year ago following Brexti's economic recovery.
The Bank will terminate its fixed-term cash scheme in February, which offers banks cheap funding, although it said that it is now GBP 15 billion more than the scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the Bank says: 'The average forecast of MPC will remain gross domestic product (GDP) in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption'.
On the rates, it was reiterated that 'a slight effort to reduce inflation' is needed, and this is to a somewhat greater extent than expected in the markets.
The Eurostars is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any jump is gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecasts in May.
The forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained.
Since that new, the pound fell into the dollar and the euro.
Women fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures, which have led to a rise in expectations for the second quarter of the year, from 0.2% to 0.3%.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be a little bit more encouraging at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice households with rising inflation and pitiful wage increases, saying that the situation would go a little worse before the recovery was improved.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent a fall in income in the next few years, but a significant recovery is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The GBP 1 also encourages the economy to increase demand for British produce, which will partially compensate consumers for lower costs.
The decision comes one year after the rate was taken in August last year by 0.25% following the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden fall in the pound.
The Bank is likely to take four years to blow up life entirely to prices and to the economy.
Before the Bank's last decision, it felt that there was a growing demand for higher inflation, because it had increased pressure on households in distress; in July, three policy makers called for a 0.5% increase.
Inflation fell by 2.6% last month compared to 2.9% in June, although it was expected to be expected and there will be a return in the coming months.
The Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2% target was caused by a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: 'In the light of the recent downturn in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again, as creditors are losing their jobs and hoping to finish the year in a positive way.
The Böge exchange looks particularly favourable to those who are going to complete the existing transactions, as refinancing, often without service and low rates, has become increasingly popular. "
NHS writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV
Patients have since September had access to 'transformative' treatment for HIV prevention after the battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the drug.
NHS England announced that public health is now expected to make it available to 10 000 people during the initial three-year clinical trial to pre-catachographs (PrEP) - a tablet that is manned before the interim procedure and has shown a reduction of approximately 86% in the risk of infection for high-risk people.
The NHS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal backed the judgment last year that the NHS is able to pay for PrEP, despite the Agency's own claims that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
Mr Simon Ste186, Executive Director of NHS England, welcomed this on Thursday as a 'sweeping new intervention', while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as a 'momentous moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Bright ton, Manchester, Liverpol and Sheffield are among the first to register people, and in October, further clinics will be added before the programme is introduced in all parts of England by April 2018.
The disability-precursor (PrEP) is a hotline for HIV drugs that is taken before the incident to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people who are at risk of infection.
PrEP before taking the interim procedure means that there is sufficient amount of certain medicines in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can take place on a daily basis or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure.
The right candidates include LGBT men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-infected and do not receive treatment.
The people who find themselves in appropriate contact with HIV are willing to participate in clinical trials, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-related partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen to have their family doctor in the family in their own country will also be able to register their desire to participate in the local sex health clinics.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed the contract to get medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The clinical test aims to assess the true potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who is treated and how it is consumed and implemented in a large cloud.
Ste186 said: 'This new wide-ranging intervention should complement and enhance the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV.
This is another milestone in the fight for more than three decades against one of the greatest human health problems. "
Deborah gold, the chief executive of NAT, said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at those who need it and belong to risk level, will be able to change the British HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool, individually managed and not dependent on the partner negotiations, thereby improving many lives, through this clinical trial funded by the NHS.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, Executive Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: 'Now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is launched quickly across the country and that no person in the HIV risk group is excluded.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been received, we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV.
The Minister for Public Health, Sharon Hodgson, said: 'The beginning of the PrEP clinical trial is a very welcome and very late after months of delay and the census of government shoes.
Evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical attempt will lead us a step closer to a complete understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that a clinical trial is introduced as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV and to move us a step closer to stopping HIV in society. "
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania in electricity prices fell to EUR 1.94, compared with EUR 7.71 in June this year, Elering.
The main reason for the price gap is the rich links between Lithuania and Sweden.
In Estonia, the average electricity exchange rate was set at EUR 34.33 per megavage hour last month and the price rose by 12% compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five percent to EUR 36.27 per megavage hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the electricity exchange rate on Nord Stream was EUR 26.37 per megavavage hour.
Prices rose by 12 and 7% respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity was mobile by 75% last month in Estonia and 16% in the hours of Estonia and Finland.
The other nine per cent of the two-hour transactions between the two countries did not take place next day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity was mobile from Estonia to Latvia at 99% and 73% of the hours was used by the full transmission capacity.
According to the July last trading day, Nasdaq OMX on the market, the electricity exchange price for August could reach approximately EUR 34 and €37 per megavage hour.
The carbon price affecting electricity production prices came up last month and transactions were worth 5.04-5.47 €/ 5.47 per tonne.
Living a higher life - half-order and smart design schemes have made it a little bit of campine camples of Court of Justice's home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate building innovator, changed his home of Knightsbridge in 2014 against the Earls Court's koruna.
It is in the first order of Queen Anne Terţi, and that Joanne has not brought his bags together and sold the flats, has been a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived together with a former life-rich compass in Knightsbridge on much wider ground," said Joanne.
"I wanted something that would be equivalent to the price I have offered.
I was shown by the Earls Court of Justice's flat and had the same high waves.
I knew about this and made a offer on the same day. "
Since the first visit, this 93-metre corps have passed a complete innovation gap.
It was a sleeping paper and a complex fix - a paper had to be walk through kitchen to reach a sleeping wall - and a desire to add catering and semi-regulation to exploit high levels of talent.
"I wanted high, big windows, a lot of light.
These were my demands, 'he said.
He is asking Erfan Azad Notting, a design and design nuclear site, Duck & Order, to exploit 3.8 m ears and to create a home that is not just a development site but a place where Joanne can live.
It was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a quasi-order where to stand.
The Erfan had to approach the matter in a creative way.
"Aquaculture is rather complex," he explains.
"We had to reorganise the premises so that they were located on one another without having to be bogged down.
It was not just about building a platform, but using steel design to ensure that the upper and lower space is the right one. "
This emphasis allowed Erfans to create two flambles with full etude alongside each other in the room, with a lot of dramatic elements.
One-off is the old-day light of the Retrouvius window, which is looking at the glaciers under the carpet.
The gold furniture, silver details and retropacigne Serge Mouille's lighting highlight the style of space.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light courses.
Both sides of the short corridor have been included to ensure that it appears longer.
In the night, the mirror is giving the impression of another window opening up with the cannabis.
In the course of the exercise, the census provides a reflection of the deposit for all the eating disorders and glass requirements of Joanne.
The debt to live is added to the possibility of closing the vegetables if they are not used, creating a more dense space for the motive.
The cumbersome kitchen cucumbers are nothing new.
However, with this kitchen, it is unique that this is a sandboard of garage types of uprisings.
'This went a little into design, 'explains the image of the MDF, which has been spoiled with a multitude of Erfan terasasastronomy.
"This has a counterweight, so it is very simply a mixture of a quantum leap to reject it."
Thanks to the smart use of space and maintenance, Joanne now has 16 additional computers, additional sleeping rooms and better harvesting.
After all, the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to property - 'says Erfan.
'Kinnismineral land kler takes an outdated form of tup and makes calculations based on the area of land '.
Here they have been able to increase the surfaces, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
"Materials are what you have to do and thus help to create emotional links with your home," says Erfan.
'You do not love the electricity cables in my sein.
This is important, but it does not put heart languages ringing. "
This shows that good design and an increased area of land help to do something astonishing from a rather normal corps.
In fact, they can even cause a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
The chief figure, Jensen, is Chicago's piloquerold petroleum, who is competing with my colleague for his professionalism.
You cannot count on anything but the amount of money you earn, which is not forgotten about any ethics.
His wife and three children only see his husband on his property and on the late hour.
In the first part of the film, I find myself in the idea that it is a 'home of the Caardium' version of the business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech is similar.
What film will continue to do, the less the cabinet element remains, and the moralising intention of film makers is beginning to appear more and more.
A life-changing experience is the main driver's disease of poppy.
Now there is a need to make a choice between work and family life.
The poet dressing the doctor at the ruins of Chicago's great buildings is putting his father into thinking about matters of real importance such as religion, welfare, love... without even affecting the twin-scale disaster.
After the third astronomy, where the son's father opens the eyes, it is felt that film makers have certainly come to the target of getting the audience buried, because even the most neediest heart-oriented viewer is unable to keep the cucumbers back when it comes to the suffering of the cule cancer patients.
If a son falls into the House and his situation seems to be hopeless, father will finally understand the moral nature of his work and will do a good job for the elderly.
Now I am lucky in my own sense - if the film has a flu, then I would reward my sense of vision after the film coffee, if I am wrong, then the standle may be congratulated for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that the ice coffee will be lost - when the husband calls a sick man and a man drives a sickery along the road to the slow-line.
However, the Poeg has been amazing, and although his father has lost his job, it is even positive, because now is time to deal with the family.
I can also feel very well - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well.
In truth, film is well constructed, all the elements needed to do so are in place.
You get a Council, you get a laughing, you can see, the players are a good and moral beauty: Money is not the most important thing in life.
This film is well introduced by surprise.
The new Staff Commander of the Trumpm intends to limit President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps Mr Kelly will actually manage this.
In that case, it would be the first.
Politico writes that the new staff chief of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President Trumpin, including news, in the hope that it will keep the excess in a more balanced way.
There is a full report from Josh Dawseyan here:
"When John F. Kelly met high officials on his first day of work, the White House revealed a key problem with President Donald Trumpi Valges Main, which he plans to solve the poor flow of information to President Assad.
Mr Kelly told officials that information must be made available to him, either on paper or at meetings, because the President would make better decisions if he had good information. "
Mr Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried to do so and have failed to tame Trumpi by monitoring its media consumption.
President Trumpi's relationship with television dates back decades and, even now that he is in White Main, his TV-watching habits have not gone anywhere.
"When the candidate Trump was a pause for unfair media coverage, he was shown to be fairly reflected in the statements affecting him," said Sam Nunberg Politicos in February.
Politico StarPalmer wrote at the time that 'Trumpi Twitter's campaign officer said that the key to controlling the behaviour of the ter-habits is to ensure that his individual media consumption is also accompanied by a stable endorsement.'
Well, it is.
But the idea that the habits of using Trumpi Twitter have once been 'controlled' is ridiculous.
Perhaps those campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know that the Trumpi rob would have been even more heartening without these interventions.
We will probably never know about the skins that the Trump did not announce.
If he was helpless able to save him a few times from the campments, his efforts were worth doing so.
But no one has been able to prevent Trumpi from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing tactics between them, people are trying to promote their own interests without exception by transferring materials to the Truel that support their world views but may not always be reliable.
The policy depicting the whole story was written in May by advisers of the tendency to feed the President to provide strategic questionable information.
One of the examples of the report, Mr Goldmacher, is as follows:
"The current and former Trumpi submits that Trump can react to negative press pressures, particularly harmful information spots, exploding, taking as a fixation the identification of their source of origin.
This was also the case at the end of February when someone gave the President a cheerfully copy of the Internet provocation to Charles C. The website of GotNews.com, which belongs to Johnson, accused of being the chief officer, Katie Walshi, that he was a white house 'source of multiple leaks'.
It is no different that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of his mouse, or that he did not provide any specific evidence or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past.
The Trump read the article and started asking the subjective Walshi. "
Goldmacher added that Rob Porter, the then staff chief of Reince Priebus and the White House, has tried to establish a system for managing and documentation documents reaching Trumpin. "
How did it succeed?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective than he is in the head of Priebuss, but the Trump is still an impulse and his assistant will still compete for influence.
These unchanging factors make the mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad will not be allowed to get a bitter address.
Many foreigners are in the city of Tallinn.
Those with whom the study came to the fire recognised that it was the elderly who played in the old era without the permission of the city government.
The first thing we found was the three street musicians who had taken the same number of cows with Viru gates.
It was clear that the musicians with the pattern and the broken hardliners were the Kosovars of absentia, who would be taken away by one of the deserts.
Despite the violence, the only woman in the company played a ladial desecration in the apartment, while one man, alongside him, called the three faces and the descendants closer.
The third man had sat on his back home and smoked the flair-made farms themselves.
Their three dogs were not allowed to disturb the people who have passed.
Mr Bob, who has been žmulected with his Noemi and the palliates, said that he is wearing the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the event was to collect ticket costs on a ship travelling to Finland on the same day.
As to whether they asked for permission from the city for rotation, Noemi and Bob were shaking their heads.
Firstly, we did not know.
Secondly, we never have more than a day or a few towns and, in most cases, we are allowed to do so for a month or so.
It makes no sense to pay for this, "explained by Bob.
When we returned to Viru's gates some 20 minutes later, we saw that two women are in musicians and are going to go.
The Chamber had the courtyard to come to the gates of Viru Centre.
Three Polish young men, one of whom played a fence, were also present on the street of Viru, and the third had even been able to carry out electronic glass.
"We are here to offer people entertainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and life," trio from the pipe Mivosh explained.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be permission from the city Government to take part.
'We do not have it ', of course, he said it joke.
But we hope that, when people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when police comes, we go elsewhere, but try and do it, 'he added.
The Estonian bank purchased bonds worth EUR 149 million in the public sector programme of central banks in the euro area, with a bank bond portfolio of EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank does not provide more detailed information on purchases.
Estonian bank President Hardo Hansson has made it clear in the past that the Central Bank's assets buy-up Scheme covers three different buy programmes: Covered bonds (SIS II), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public debt (PSPP).
The Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
The impact of purchases will fall from the production of lower-risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, under the public sector bond buy each Central Bank's own government bonds, other countries' bonds are not purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds, the Estonian bank will be making 'substitute purchases' within the amount allocated to them.
Central Banks also shop in those countries where the bond offer is limited.
The Estonian bank, confirmed by Hansson, generally buys bonds from the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank bonds.
The Estonian bank will purchase bonds under the asset buy-up scheme as of March 2015.
Meanwhile, Elempire bonds were also purchased, but the Estonian bank no longer bought up Election bonds in June 2016.
On behalf of the central banks in the euro area, both Eletches and Estonia's energy bonds will be bought by the Bank of Finland from June.
Migrants ignore degrees and return to the 'millions of business building'
Some of the West Midlands's most prosperous home owners have once again found themselves in fierce confrontation with determined migration, who have ignored the unelected bureaucrats of the county to win back their walls.
Migrants have parked their 20 trailers on the brink of a wealthy 'mild' of millions of business in the near Someat ulli street.
They have returned together with the army of horses, children and lorries, after they were snatched out of the wall only in May, without being thrown into a cradle of the bureaucracies that were complaining of to block their invasion by the Council.
The group found a weak place in the protection limits, turning its vehicles through the unblocked part that had been left to pop.
The people of the City of District have been skirted by the Someat Council, saying that the Council is' useless in dealing with the problem '.
A anonymous person said: 'They copied there on Monday evening after they were expelled from Bentley Heathy, where they were storing furniture.
The Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The migrants were there in May, they were delayed and now they are back again.
They came to the end of the night, probably more today. "
He added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect his parks.
I live on the road of street etsbrook and I am not happy that I must continue to pay a total of authorisations if the Council cannot even block such a thing. "
A local resident who also wanted to be anonymous said, 'this is ridiculous, and we have only seen the last of these migrants leave, and there is already a new offensive.
This time, the number has increased and even the horror has been seen in ruminence. "
Someat City Council said: 'We are aware that in the land near the street etsbrook road, there is an unacceptable camp and we are working with the Someat ulli police, we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It will be very helpful to gather evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police, calling a figure 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them. "
The Weekna festival also visits the Minister for Culture, Indrek Saar, who is pleased that he has been able to bring real world top names to Estonia.
The question of why so important for the Estonians at the Weekise festival is Saar that this should be asked of all those who enjoy three days at the festival.
But he will admit that the real players in his area have come to the Persian region.
"Looking at the level of artists that has been able to bring home to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music director - often not in our query - are spoken of a Minister for Culture.
However, which festival are artists who are most telling themselves?
I consider myself to be relatively old and, for some of the elderly, one of the most experienced doctors, Armin van Bnewren, who stood up last night.
He has, after all, complicated all of us at some point, 'he says.
However, he will also mention a number of names, such as ChainRoure i, Deadmau5, Knifebels.
Of course, our own Estonian players: Starting from NOavian, and they can be read in a whole series.
In reality, this concentration of known names is very high, "he says.

Audi upgrades up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the light of criticism by car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the Chairman of BMW, the company believes that 'there are smarter alternatives than driving restrictions', referring to European cities, including the BMW home city of Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe are being upgraded to reduce emissions of diesel engines.
No company described these operations as a provocation.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide, which drives from diesel engines, is considered carcinogenic and could lead to asthma.
The cost of equipment installed for neutralising emissions from diesel vehicles will also increase for car manufacturers, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's Government is also accused of calling powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, who was silent about the use of 'petrolery' that allowed emissions fares to be adapted to regulations when testing a car, but returned to normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the Audi engine Development unit was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore is not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi in Germany was drawn to a criminal investigation into Volkswagen when the authorities accused the installation of the Audit System to evade European emission performance requirements, thereby extending the investigation that had previously been focused on the United States.
The inclusion of the Audi in the investigation may be a major blow to the Volkswagen holder of Luxembourluxury cars disproportionately generates the profits of a large proportion of Volkswagen.
Estonian schools are receiving 20 000 euro of EU flags.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags for the purpose of breaking the Presidency by 1 September.
A total of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union's flag will be 570 education institutions.
Flags are intended to be used to inject invoices, they must also be carried out in high quality printed material with a sense of attestation, and the ERR news portal is facilitated.
The flag bank has a text: 'Kingitus to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education, or EUR 35 is paid by a flag.
Murder of journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
The workers of the weekly newspaper, Riodoce, usually gather on Wednesday to review plans for the most recent chaos in the state of Blue authorisation, sowed by organised crime, corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of their personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change their routine.
Two parents' authors will be discussing which looks safer: Whether to bring children to their offices, which were the target of the granchattack in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words to the leader of the space: 'Enemies', 'neutrality', 'allies'.
They ask reporters to provide the names of each water in each of them with evidence from theory is unnecessary, they are sufficient to impressions and inner feelings.
The presence of government or cartels is suspected of being drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists alike, of being a paperwork list that makes it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
Violence is not a stunning wound and the more dead people are accumulating across the country, the majority of which are journalists from Yemen, according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists, since the election of President Enrique Pena Şto at least 25 in December 2012, 589 journalists under public protection following attacks and threats, and this year at least 7 journalists have still died in seven countries.
The last death toll includes their editor and source of inspiration, Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many reports on drug-related violence.
His absence makes a deep felt, even though his presence can be felt anywhere in the scene of the Building of Riodoce, a big picture of the Valdezest, which shows an average finger, with the 'Justice' and the 'two 30nines reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez', carries T snus images or a face of his smils or a panacea characteristic of him.
The meeting will take place less than two months after death, and the Reporters will discuss a common trauma, their nightmare, their hopelessness, their paranoia.
Although a separate public Prosecutor's case was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee for the Protection of journalists.
Like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders, which amount to thousands, the killers of journalists rarely reach justice.
The editorial action of Riodoce will continue to reflect the violence in your own country, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and justice of murderers, the meeting on security will not be of great use, as Ibarra said.
'It is very nice to waste time here at the meeting '.
"As long as the reason is not known, you will have a lot of trust."
Valdez left the office of Riodoce, the capital of the State, Culiacan, on 15 May morning.
He managed to drive just a few quarters before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla, forcing him to exit the car and shot him 12 times, which is expected to be the name of the newspaper, meaning 'twelfth river' in translation.
The armed man went to the Valdez car and made an accident near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two adult children.
The people who have been flooded are spreading freely in Culiacan.
However, the Valdez issue is mainly dominated by silence.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of the United States in January, the Blue Card has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival fers are fighting to fill the power vacuum.
It is no different that people are thrown off every day on the streets of your licence, or even several, or that the dead are snatched from the gruesome two-time sweets of drug art, which are more than many homes.
Let us forget for a moment that the time of peace indicates how valuable ports and the sea state with drug routes to the United States only leads one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce is feeling the co-founder and President, IsMay Bojorquez (60), who was the most innocent to defend his friend.
He believes that two mistakes were promoted by killing.
The first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Guzman's sons in the face of the Sikamehe Damaso Lopezzi pocket.
This piece of correspondence could have been alluded to by the supposedly suspect gang members, all copies of the publications were bought as soon as they were reached in the newspapers.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security, after the crackdown took place in another newspaper that has been equally respected.
Valdez was legally in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to be present forever.
He served as a veteranreporter in the Noroeste newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, sold 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that in your blue 'it was impossible to deal with the press without touching on the drug problem'.
The newspaper has extended its awareness and publicity with its courageous and honest labels, and sales and advertising grew.
The reporters were keen to express vigorous studies without fear of censorship and readers sleep in a print they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the launch of Riodoce, the newspaper won the award of Maria Moors Caboti for her reports in Latin America.
In the same year, the Committee for the Protection of Valdez journalists (AKK) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow Mexican drug creation wherever it takes.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
'I want to live on, 'he said that when he received the AKK Prize.
Last October, he said in an interview given to the television channel Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Your country.
'He to accept the task of becoming a second chance to play the game with the media office.
I do not want to ask me what I did when faced with so many deaths or why I did not talk about what is going on. "
Riodoce collelolovas lonellow Valdez, a joke who roppered like madrus, a friend who divided embryos and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They gave their support to his ruins.
He always weed his own village.
He went across the office to El Salvador baari and was always on the same desk.
Now they ask whether his stubbornness was fatal.
His death has also cast them in doubt about how best to do his job and to stay alive.
"They do not like the arrogance of their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing cards used to transport drugs."
'These things should not have been touched, 'said Bojorquez.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-determination even in the best times.
Trusted in your instincts.
If it is a matter of suspiciously framing, it is a hole away.
Riodoce editor Andres Villarreali said that the problem is that 'odality can be deceived... and so it was Javierga'.
He and others say that in your blue-like situation, there will no longer be old rules, just as they do not apply in the Tamaulik, Veracruz, Guerreros or other states, which are home to the toxic composition of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a space where Riodoce workers met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that only the pupil sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers were seeking a relaxation of 40 degrees of heat in front of the house, hiding behind the pumps.
They have appointed a more elected Riodoce office in the Culiacan central class in the Culiacan building.
Some of the reporters were half joke to wonder whether these police officers were among the 50% of the police officers who themselves have been discredited by the Governor.
Several months have passed since reports have been travelling to mountainous rural areas where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
Riodoce's publication this week dealt with three main features.
One of them was the murder of former poxomallego Julio Cesar Chavez venna in Sinalo.
They also had an exorbitant story of spending government funds on the city of the Governor.
And a group of people was kidnapped from Culiacan, one of the most expensive restaurants, which is a quarter of the public office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of flu is a place of interest for drug traffickers and public authorities alike.
The Guard became public aware of documents that a restaurant is registered as a policy for the establishment of a ruling institution in the Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several IRP Governor has been accused of widespread coverage of cases of corruption.
In Villarline, the report asked the report to write previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, who wear the name of El Chapo, was saved by military betrayal.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have been looking to the Quaesty of Valdez to obtain information about kidnapping from the best sources.
"In the past we would have known what happened, 'said 46 years old in Villarline, whose body construction has earned him a banner El Flaco.
"Now all the channels of communication have broken down with our sources."
The Valdez office has become a reservoid of bridges and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and the workers who have been employed have become something they could never expect to wait for activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez seized a few bridges and a guide next morning to the local Prosecutor's office for another journalist.
Mr Salvador Ava disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the killing of Valdez.
It has been found to be a dead body and, according to officials, it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become more popular across the country and are crippling the phrase 'SOS press' to the pavements and buildings as organised protest.
On that day, President Bojorquez will have an international contribution to put the justice in the Valdez case.
A day after the death of Valdez, when meeting with the Governor of the Your oa bar, Ramirez accused the authorities of crying out journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked for his or her to be diverted from the government's activities elsewhere, concerned that hatred had had had had had had had had an impact on objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were 'restricted' by organised crime, co-culpable state officials and indifferent society.
In his last book 'drug media', he wrote that the reporters are not only killing drugs gangs, but also under the command of politicians and security forces who are at the mercy of organised crime.
Articulo 19, the Media Monitoring Group, awarded more than half of the attacks on the police and public officials last year.
'In Mexico, you are going to be silent, 'Ramirez said.
The adverse effects are obviously bloody.
Nobody will forget the death of the blogger, Mrs Elizabeth Macias, in the northern border state of Tamaulik six years ago.
He was found dead with a letter that I think had been signed by the cartel LOS Zetas: 'I am here for my reports'.
His mapped-up near the head of his home was found by computer glass and ears.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, for example, in the northern border state of El Norte, Chihuahuahua, following the killing of their correspondent missile fan BSoth in March.
Others will continue as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after their murder in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a flagship editorial 'What do you want?'
Some journalists have fled their home states or even their country.
This is a nervous decision.
It is difficult to find work in this case and they still have to find out today to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are being persecuted, as probably happened with the photograph Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered three months after the Veracruz break in 2015, with four women in Mexico, in a year in 2015.
Those who remain in the ground and continue to work must be tangled every day around risky decisions.
The Ibarra who once wanted to become a poet admits that the reporting of drug trafficking frightens him.
"Mexico is on the way to hell, and that is why I am going to report," he said.
At a recent midnight of Friday, when the latest number had already been snatched, the editor of Riodoce was walked up and beating to the office when suddenly all telephone lines began to be calibrated.
19 people were killed in fire-fighting between rival gangs and security forces in the exceptionally cumbersome city of Mazatlanis.
The war escorted the war, as did a number of messages left by cartels found in the area.
According to the same pavements, reporters made news on the Riodoce site using mobile phones.
In the front of next day, a change was needed.
The scenes were seized by another arrival in the region of Constanţa.
Bojorquez piilla was on the guard to see whether they are vigilant.
If they were afraid, they did not at least show it.
The desert-down founder, under a massive banknote, where his average finger is displayed on the whole blue, was carried out by the workers of Riodoce in his footsteps.
'How could you think about closure, 'said Bojorquez,' on the same day that Javier Javier was killed, a practical interface asked me to send a report to the streets? '
Dinosaur used the 'protective colour' to avoid enemies
At first sight, it looks like a form, albeit rather frightening.
Scientists have now made public the first findings of the incredible rubbish-rate size discovered by Canadian miners, which has so well preserved that the experts have described it as' dinosaur Mona Lisa '.
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to establish that the skin covered by his sooms was a red-boy coloured colour and his past had been somewhat 'complicated'.
In a magazine published by Health Biology, the report on status described as' the best preserved soomomalment of sodium, which has ever been found 'and' one of the best Curriculum readings worldwide '.
In the case of fossil fuels, it is a new category of nodosaxist that lived in the middle of the seasonage, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good retention in Raba was carried out by theatres describing it as' truly significant '.
This chromium-covered plant feed has, according to National Geosian, remained the best preserved type of phosphorus ever found.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn functional, he found it when he extracted Suncor Millenium in Fort McMurray near Northern Albertas in Canada.
He has caught something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into it.
The advertised phosphate was sent to the Royal Tyrrell paleontology museum.
For the next six years, it was designed to extract the animal from 2 500 navies (1100 kilometres) to land.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to bring the public to the table.
'When you put a little eyes on your eyes, you can almost believe he sleep, 'Caleb Brown, the leading author, said, the theatre Royal Tyrrell museum, where the presence is being waged.
"This goes down in the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaur - dinosaur Mona Lisana.
When he studied his skin, he found that this vegetation, although covered by sodium and resembling a palpable tank, was likely to be a significant threat to meat-food dinosaences.
This high-level dinosaur used a red and white defence colours to hide from predators and applied sheltering techniques, which are called 'shelter' and which are also used by many modern animals.
This allowed the respondents to enter the dinosaur better, and the enemy to be prevented, as the major dinosaurs probably thought he was hunted.
This figure, which is the family of nodosaic tree, aged 110, was first reached in the news in May and is now visited in the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology museum.
Researchers have now looked into the existence of the 400 400 researchers, giving it the name of the Borealopelta Marmitchelli museum mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7 000 hours to reveal the suffering.
Thanks to his amazing good survival, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the sooms.
They found a disapproval - a common method of protection in animal species - which meant that the title of status was a vector as a lower.
Although the disapproval is common, the bread comes as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much greater than those of those with responsibility today.
This suggests that dinosaur pressure was sufficiently actively hunted by other meat additives, that the evolution preferred sheltering rather than confrontation as a survivous policy.
However, most of the animals using modern forms of disapproval - such as fear, seals or armadweather - are far smaller and more vulnerable as a harvest, indicating that nodosaurus had to really work to survive.
"The strong meagre-meagre of the huge and abundant soaps shows how dangerous the endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered dinosaences could be," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds of Soomorganic compounds also revealed that the compound weight was a red bacat.
Scientists will continue to investigate the effects of this life, including the retained content of this salt style, in order to find out what the animal would last their sister.
They believe that the dinosaur has fallen into the dead rivers, thereby entering the sea, where it was sunk in the ocean.
At the time, Albertas was just as soccable as it was today in South Florence and rivers and oceans were likely to extend far beyond the internal land.
"This nodosasaurus is truly significant, as it has fully covered sodium skin, but it has also remained three dimensions, maintaining the original shape," said Brown.
"As a result, the animal today sees almost the same thing as in the candbook era.
It does not have to be built with much imagination - it is enough simply to put bridges on the table and it seems he would be like sleeping. "
The time was for the crisis era, when huge sweets of meat feed - heterostores - were stunned in the countryside.
Although their Queen Tyrannosauru rex lived millions years later than Borealopelta, this sorely cherished dinosaur could have been wet by some of his daunting predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a long and six-tonne monster with 38 legs (11.5 metres).
Scientists whose recent findings are published in the Journal of Health Biology believe that Borealopelta was uhuta after death in the sea and this muzarus did not.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn functional was detected when he extracted from Fort McMurray near the Millenium in Canada.
The museum says that it has been best preserved by soomomalsis in the world, including skin and sooms, and it is comprehensive from concentration to pumps.
These assumptions were on average 18 legs (five metres) long and fixed at up to GBP 3 000 (1 300 kg).
Two 20 customs miles were invaded from this.
Scientists believe that this beautiful monastery, which was covered by soaps, was through the current Western Canada until the river flooded in its opening sea was proud.
But the landing site of the dinosaur was instrumental in maintaining its soyings in an excellent detail.
The ice of this particular father, coal, has so well preserved that mygarchical soomalate superpower stations are still covered by skin ice.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geosian magazine, 'such statehood is as rare as lotovictory.
The more I see it, the more incredible it seems.
The burnt skin bears still cover the mysterious sodium-based.
A better front is lying alongside him and the five stolen ones are silenced.
I can count the soyings he has on. "
How did one activist find a response to the question of 'whose thanks?'
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was received a complete shock.
Just a day after the trip to New York, it was the Mayor of Louba Airbnb on the leaked bed bed, sixiting Facebook on the phone.
He came on top of his former school teacher's post.
It said: 'The police killed 18-year-old adolescents and still hang on the streets'.
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The Pidega @ TheePMilah user's mail was repeatedly distributed on his timeline.
St. Synchronchronous Schollin, from the Louise region, sent a real-time tag to Michael Brown, the death of an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by the Congussouris White Police officer.
He gave an image of the life of Brown in a body that was found in the street, leaving it for four hours.
'It is crazy, 'said Ferreira's modification.
However, death was nothing new for him or for the community.
He put his phone off but later this evening he saw the tag that announced the people's arrival in Canfield Drive.
The Jagati photographs of the police and the people who were afraid and a man who claimed to be the father of Brown and kept the letter 'Ferguson police killed just my unarmed son!'
He watched a real-time flow where the police officer stood up to the protest group with a graves dozen.
Another video was a police officer who said that 'I kill all... animals'.
Ferrell will remember how it has caught up in the thought: 'It is unusual'.
'This is not a murder of this kind that we are accustomed to and which we could describe as typical '.
I felt frightened at that point.
I was angry and I have asked. '
He booked a return flight and he was travelling home next day.
Having buried at 23: 00, she went on her father for his six-year daughter and decided that they would travel to Ferguson next morning.
What took place with Ferrell and Fergusonga over the next three years is the central issue of the new documentary 'Whose street'. ('Whose thanks?'), which will be present in cinemas on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and defeat, strength and resilience from the point of view of those living in this community who have delivered on their streets in demanding responses.
When Mrs Ferreira, with her daughter - who had a lipsy sticker and a chat with it - was travelling to Ferguson, they retalked about the subject that they had repeatedly spoken about before this morning - the experience and living conditions of black men.
"Remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?"
"We are now travelling to Ferguson because the police killed 18-year-old boys and that is not right."
"I could not take him on board," said Ferrell later.
'What is happening now is the culmination of... what happened in the past.
It must know and see this and grow in the middle of it.
It must learn about the organisation of a activists and, at the same time, feel different layers of experience and living conditions for the Muslim people, and what we must do to be free and free.
Even if I manage to raise him in such a way that he does not personally copy brutal racism, he does not distinguish between another black girl.
I feel I would be doing him a disservice if I would protect him from this world. "
The first stop they did in the vicinity of Fergusoni was by South Florissanti - the police station in the filling of the road, which had become a kind of camp camp maker, where activists were waiting for news about the police officer Darren Wilson, who was not ultimately charged with charges.
There, Mr Ferreira and his daughter joined the local business owner who made lunch-based plants.
They brought together food homes and helped to divide them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activist was slowly taken into shape.
"My activist changed completely after 9 August," he said, saying that when he was a student at Missouri-St. Louise University, he was the President of the Alliance of Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities.
"I had no experience of organisation.
All this was just a fiasco. "
Weeks later, during the Ferreira evening demonstration, a film comrade, Sabaah Folayani, met with a film director.
Folayan said that he and the film operator, Mr Alvarado-Farrar, simply wanted to document what is happening.
The question that came to mind in the Ferrell was' are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited? '
Such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to reap the benefits of its generosity and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: 'We had heard that the voice of people born and growing in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do so differently'.
Folayan had already put his hand in hand with a fellow director Damon Davati, an artificial in the region, who was well known for activists in connection with prisoners who were sentenced to death.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and the other six local cities who were watched for years following the shooting of Brown.
"In this documentary, nobody is talking for us or for us, but we are speaking to ourselves, 'said Davis.
"It was important for me how these people are portrayed, because that is how I am portrayed."
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell - the intention was to show that the Movement is not a 'donor leader but a community bringing together', as outlined by Folayan - he was the most open to the film.
As a result, the 'Whose street'? 'Peculiar personal aspects of the life of Ferrell, such as ruthlessness and marriage with their wife.
"I felt I was original, 'said Ferreira, smiling the first time that he saw the city.
"But I realised that the human vulnerability of this work and of the black people must be accompanied by a certain amount of vulnerability."
Moreover, the Ferrell affair underlines and puts the role of black LGBT women at the centre again in the wider Black Sea Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement, who thought in 2012, after the killing of Hurtanker teenagers, Trayvon Martin, were extradited by the social media, the subject reference # BlackLivesMatter is homosexuals.
"Women who are black homosexuals in leadership roles have kept the movement in the field in general," said Ferreira, and this is precisely because we must fight on a number of fronts.
Roma women must bear all the burden. "
Folayan agreed, saying that 'movement is indeed alive for black women, and many of them black homosexuals'.
He says, however, that 'this is not a kind of' equal opportunities' - Ferrell was not chosen as the film's centre for his identity.
"He was someone who evening the right energy," said.
"But it is no coincidence that he was directly on the frontline, because the black LGBT woman is at stake when living in such hubs.
His energy can be perceived through the screen. "
Meanwhile, news cameras Fergusonto have long disappeared, but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile.
The conditional sentences imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the road will last 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy atmosphere in the region he calls home, simply as' huge free '.
Nonetheless, it still considers the mantra it has been eating since it took the streets of Ferguson a whole three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing but to lose our chains. "
7 examples of how to overcome Weekise's potaclone after the Weekise
Some of the most frequent measles find, after a little bit of hot air, that they are suffering, hence help.
Or the slogan 'Beyond potall, pyramid'.
But this is only inevitable postponement and a decent blessing for health.
What can you do to get to know better and to get out of the poppy as painfully as possible after today and tomorrow's Weekise trall or other pipes?
Joo Water.
To alcohol, after a great deal of pipe in the morning... or possibly even alcohol.
As the body loses a lot of liquids when using alcohol, it must somehow be recovered.
Mineral materials are also thrown out of the body, with water, and sestap is a good hair to mineral water.
Since, after being thrown off, swept up, the sweet is often irritated, it is particularly good if it is free or easily gazed.
Let us walk.
It would certainly not cost the boy to split trees into the grandmother - it could prove fatal to be a wrong decision.
But a simple walk-out helps the body to recall once again what sense it is in life.
Counselling in Telgis and sleeping poppy is a more time-consuming way to get a full.
Give poor energy back gradually and cautiously.
If you are getting off the thycle from yesterday's overrun, it is certainly not worth trying to charge a heavy fat.
For example, a fresh pipe containing coop fans is on the wall to market as a body.
If health is already suffering from the South, then for example, the wedding could be tried.
And a little later, the Panorama.
The IDP was avoided.
This diure tag will free the body from the last water.
As has already been said, water and volume are your friends.
Reparing painkillers.
If you can take a painkiller to prevent potaclone on the evening, you have to deal with paratsetat or ibuproprophet, not only alcohol, but you have to deal with the smoke and lose so much.
So many more hits and, in the future, boys will be worse.
In addition, the Holy bear in the coffee meat is not going to be long enough.
If you take the painkiller morning, you will do it with a bottle of thick air - it irrives your already dragged sweet sweat.
Or if you do not have a partner, you can do well with you.
It is about doing the same thing as walking, but it does not get a orgary when it comes to doing it.
However, too active a pace and outrageous bet were avoided: During the boashant, physical effort should be moderating.
A joke.
The words of friends of time with friends of friends of friends of friends of the past, the easy hand of the carpet and the naera amicably over both himself and others (suffering).
The lungs and navier may not be discharged, but they certainly have resulted in a more indiscriminate form of violence.
Once again, the boy goes over anyway!
University of Northwester and Oxford, a person who is being sought as suspects in murder
The police say that a professor of the University of Northwester and Oxford are sought nationally and that suspects have been sought after deadly petty petty wrapping wings, to find a single Chiicago luxury.
According to the Cook County papers, on Monday, arrests were issued without a distance of opportunity for 42 years of Wyndham Lathemi and 56 years for the arrest of Andrew Warreni, accused of first-instance murder for their alleged association in Trenton H. Cornell-Duranhanu.
According to the documents, 26 years of Cornell-Durantagu died after repeated nails.
According to a warning, the Chicago police station issued to the community, the body was found to be dead on 27 July.
Police officers received telephone calls and found a victim with several torteries in the Grand Plaza Corterhouse.
According to the officials, Cornell-Durantagy was admitted to death and investigators are treating the murder as a minor, while the police are actively seeking two suspects.
Lavid has been working as co-professors of micro-biology and immunology at the University of Northwester since 2007.
In a statement sent as an e-mail, Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of University Public Relations, said that Ladows has now been temporarily removed from work and is forbidden to enter the towns of the University of Northwester.
"This is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities, and the University of Northwester works with the investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior assistant in the financial department at the University of Oxford.
The representative of the University of Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: 'We have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist US research authorities in every way possible'.
Furthermore, the statement stated that Warreni colleagues were shocked and wish to be extradited.
Anthony Guglielm, Head of the Communications Department of Chicago, urges the authorities to give themselves, with suspicion.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are increasingly busy defining the exact whereabouts," said Guglielm.
According to Guglielm, suspects are helped by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielm said that the police received telephone calls from the chief of the Grand Prix Corterhouse, who had just received a kryptic hint that something had happened in Corps No 1008.
According to the police, this was a magic view.
It is not clear, according to the Guglielm, whether the event was also taking place on 27 July.
He said that the security cameras confirm the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building.
"We believe that Professor Lathares and the victim had a relationship," added Guglielm.
The Grand Chilean leadership sent a letter to the people: 'The police is currently working to find a background to events and victims, and will examine various motives, including the possibility of a family dispute.'
Firms that help your businesses avoid getting next UbB
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e-commerce start-up company, but the surveys were unprofitable.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even if he promised anonymous, some workers did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who is running the Madison Reed Company, which sells e-commerce products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called on external actors to help.
Start-ups with new types of human resources are emerging to help businesses to find out what their workers feel.
By developing and licensing software that aims to measure the involvement of workers, they enable companies to carry out a flash survey, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaint-raising for workers and, in some cases, allow insurers to bypass the level C management and address the Bureau directly.
'There are now tools such as Strava and Fitler, which are meant to monitor health, but where is Fitbi for your company? 'Asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO Reding City start-up Glint, whose software analysts use companies to measure the inclusion of workers.
According to Erretti, he has received a much better overview of what he thinks and knows about in three years when he has used Glinti.
In addition to the investigation and the study for specific teams, it provides a company's heating card, which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support, enabling them to identify the causes.
Companies have started to understand that they must stay in touch with their culture of work, so as not to become the next Ubbar, which has been rife in scandals since the former worker published a bloggermail, which described a mentoring environment for those who dared to speak.
For start-ups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business option.
Global governance, regulation and conformity can be worth more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Financial ethics Statistics website Let's talk translations.
The Denveris Colorado start-up company SR, which helps companies to prevent and identify inappropriate behaviour, noted this year interest and an increase in activity against the background of the dubious reputation of Uberia.
FIFcentil has almost 600 customers, including Airbus, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a customer.
Like Glinles, FIF7.5 companies will be able to send tailor-made impulse polls, collect confidential answers in real time and look at the problematic areas of heat cards.
It also offers a anonymous message-sheet that enables workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the executive director, complaints go directly to the Bureau.
"Public opinion has anchored regulators," said Integration centi's founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to be poorly treating its workers or acting unethical, it could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, the departure of workers and court cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby flu, restaurant, which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of business, has used modulation for more than a year to ensure workers' awareness of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way of communicating with the corporation headquarters.
When a worker wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find a telephone number or an email address at the company headquarters, he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
This was often a damning and inconvenient process, and Mr Vitrano, a general adviser, said Ruby Yemen, who said that there was no good way to monitor workers' complaints.
However, now that the company uses ops, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices, which did not have previously reached management managers in other cities or states, can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get away to the hollow experience of the workers 360 degrees," said Vitrano, who is leading the Ruby hood risk management group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers."
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement more seriously in 2002, after the collapse of the audit company Arthur Andersson, due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
However, only when 'social media became mature' did businesses realise that they cannot stop their black washing on the web.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," said.
Both Glint and Sky offer their software as a service, taking companies periodically paid for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, which have been supported by both start-ups.
3.4 centi financed USD 10 million in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and the Customs Capital, thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by EUR 47 million.
USD 10 million invested in Glinti Venture partners in November, increasing the total company funding to USD 60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise if we take into account the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that today's workers expect more jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just on the table.
Workers want to feel they are accepted and valued and devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, they feel they are listening to them and the work they do is satisfactory, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President Linkedin, who has a general benefit and experience of workers, both Integration cenpti and Glinti.
Investors will earn revenue if companies in their portfolio do well; businesses will do well if workers are committed and involved.
If the analysts on the third side allow for greater commitment and involvement of workers, we are not sure they will be supported.
Data on worker inclusion is important, according to experts in the professional culture.
However, these data will be useless if the company's supervisors do not follow up with them.
In fact, if a company asks its employees for feedback, it can create expectations of a change to come.
And if changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all, they could cause disappointment and decrease the involvement of workers.
"When you ask 4 000 proposals, you have to be ready for 4 000 conversations," said President Russell Raath, the consultancy and business administration, who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
'While, if things do not stop, workers will think: 'Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you do not care, why should I care? '
According to Erretti, the Madison Reeval, which is now carrying out six studies among workers, has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via Glinti.
And, after receiving feedback from workers disappointed by the pace of decision making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
However, Ruby Portuguille is collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that, in the long term, it will result in a longer-term commitment of workers in industry known for its large turnover.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose businesses. "
Euro area bench is Baltic: Revenues grow rapidly
Although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe, Banimal berg is writing the ECB report.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
There is a low debt burden, fast-growing institutions and business-friendly and free market-friendly policies behind success.
"The Baltic States, in one of Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where the EU average has been substantially closer to the purchasing power of the reactor per capita."
Although the aim is that the overall output of the economy per capita would be equivalent to the richer Western Europe, in 2015, the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2 / 3 / 15 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the balloers to seek a better wage abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees Baltic in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the local population is not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only one quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are going very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, this was considered a little less than half of the respondents about their economies.
NCAA's decision to cancel the double-day trends makes the Bruinsi days long
It is almost 23: When the football club of the trochiond UCLA stops talking at the end of a new exercise in the city of the team.
Some of them have been burdened by a big shirt, revealing their efforts for the first day of the training camp.
For a large part of the team, these Christmas Days offer midday couples.
The players on the courses will go back to the collective life endless, after three hours, before returning to the Wandarman football front next morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," said Jim Mora, the Bruinsi treghter, a little before Monday was delivered on Tuesday.
The NCAA decision to cancel the trends of players' burden two times a day has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end of the day - to one side of the bargain on Friday.
For this reason, the three first operations of UCLA were prompted to start at 19.15 to fit players into an already tight timeline.
The transition from two to two strikes a day means more of a day - the beginning of the Bruinsi Border intervention Camp was increased almost a week ahead compared with the previous season, and for the first time, Mora's six Westwood season is taking place during summer courses.
They have a plan of 18 trendars until 20 August before starting formal preparations for the opening game against Texas A & M in September.
According to Mora, he is in favour of a change in the NCAA rule, although it adds another item to the close schedules of players.
"They have a huge burden three or four days, and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they break through this challenge; they are struggling, they are a nice young person.
I believe that when we come to Saturday and have more time, it is really a bit. "
When the camp is closed, UCLA's tour operations will be closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of the parking record and the bypassing Luskini centre, a higher class hotel that has already escaped football from the net around the gates.
Since this weekend, hotel Bruinsi players are occupying, but Mora recognised that there could be problems with free tobacco during the season.
'We are implementing security measures, 'said Mora.
"This is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can get a piece of a piece of filter from there.
If you have a record of a train, you can do a good deal.
But we use the security team there and on the 8 parking stations.
We are doing our best to use it.
I will try not to be very concerned about this.
We have a plan in place. "
The question of the election union of Saduare-Ivanova, the reformist party, the campaign for the expulsion of Kristiina Ojuland and the ECB, which was set up to join forces of Maria Kaljete, in our capital city and political parties, in Temes, which creates an electoral union for businessmen in the middle of the central party, seems to be to be able to encroach on party politics on the initiative of the election unions created by the local elections at least as much as political parties this year.
However, buses will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there are enough frustrated voters.
Who will remain with the port?
If the support office of Edgar Salevare reduced, events may be expected to honour his electoral union.
One member of the national assembly, some former and current central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And why are some of the Saduare'customed 'and sisters prevented from standing in Tallinn, perhaps the reason why are the' Saduare list 'of companies, which are governed by corruption and suspected of corruption?
A civic government-based music cameras, film-made music cameras, to a Russian poem in which the urban part of the Lasnamäe is more elderly; and, in any case, a priest computer game in which the votes of the 1616 and 17 year-old voters who are allowed to be heard by Prime Minister Jüri Rata must avoid leather leather and hurricans when travelling - will the Central Party be trying to avoid the votes of the voters who are allowed to the ballot boxes for the first time?
We look forward to seeing other parties see their vision of a youth-based election campaign.
If the channel 2 or TV3 viewers are confronted with black hall from the beginning of August, there will be two options: To accept that in future, only the EIT, ETV2 +, Tallinn TV and English France24 channels or to donate 10-month TV operators.
There are probably also those who openly rejoice in advertising-free television experience at the beginning, but in the end, though reluctantly, they pay for television and advertising.
Innumerical music, folding people and rubbish left on the streets are unpleasant by almost every major music aflets.
If you do not want to be part of the measles, however, you have to leave the country to the festival for the Coptic amount of sleeping to the festival instead of painting at home.
Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
Media publications are quoted by President Donald Trumpi, who says that a new US immigration plan is planned, which will change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan foresees a 50 000 reduction in the number of legal immigrants per annum, stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republican and supported by the President.
The bill goes to the two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, because it changes the way in which green cards are issued to US citizens.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will give priority to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and to the skills that will benefit our economy, "said Trump in the US media publications.
Siberia seto young people move to the city, pensioners back to the land.
Jevseyev Anatol continues the famous seto gold miners along the River Maana.
She works 140 kilometres from home to Maana additional words at Kuvai as a motor driver.
This is a tough job: Two months and months after rest, 12 hours of work and only 10 days at home and again.
During the three years of the Archtel, Anatol has seen the gold in just one time.
'There is a loud procedure: When we go in, you will check thoroughly that you do not lead to the result, and if you go out that you do not take it ', you will talk Anatol.
Mare Piho, speaking in the village of Haida, to the local seto Jaga, who has spoken a great deal to him about the memory of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture that still remains in the Siberian setote will also affect home seals, because it is just so shocking, thinks the most far-sighted mixtures of Piho Mare.
His first investigation trip to Siberia will be 30 years later this year.
During that time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year.
How much was still needed to go out to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here?
This is a unresolved issue.
I would argue that 8 000.
I took note of this from the rumours of Siberian seto men, who have also thought about it.
It is difficult to say precisely that, because at that time up to 30 people could come to one group, but the passport was only given to a man.
The passport was given only one thing, but was children, sisters and others Nazi children.
Look at how much the territory was here.
It was many times greater than the historic Setomay.
It was necessary to educate, to manage it in some way.
Setinos came here as farmers, but their lives changed because they came to areas that were not only involved in agriculture but also in rivers (palgiparation), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New-Petseris, many pigs later entered the city of Krasnojarsk-45 (where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the setos constitute a majority of the population in this region at that time?
Yes, they lived in a compacket.
In addition, the tradition maintained long-standing marriage and child pornography.
Seven to eight children in the family were common.
How much does Siberian setopes have a different culture and different from that of mother land?
They are different, although what was said here was once the same.
They brought a great many popular ideas.
They then made a difference (the 'people'), but they always made a distinction, which was the result and what was done here.
Climate change has been severely affected by the traditional rivalry of seals, because there is a cold cold here.
The proposed changes were made.
For example, Setomaal meat was skinned, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the villages of Siberian setopes and what life are there? / graphics: Alari Paluends
The link with mother countries was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setuony is going to return to it, it will affect them.
Those girls who have lived in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho is thinking of the people of the Estonian delegation, who came to the Queen of Haida in early July and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
What is still here is shocking.
"It is very easy to come and go on to the train too, because the city has a wonderful location: Railway parhutes and road crossing point," says Reigo Tamm, from Tapy.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural places, and the carpet is going to be in every square.
The city is the tip of the tap!
There are small islands along the River White River, where the Tamils tend to be hijacking.
'This beautiful place does not appear on the train window ', hails Reigo.
Anyone who does not fear cold water can flood in the river, because the river is full of resources.
I have been there, you can do it!
The river's water can be long and just a romantic one - it can look at the river and think about life and behind it.
I have also been there with my own abilities.
Ooperisolist Tampere has been travelling between three other bridges on the river basin and three other bridges, and is accruing: 'That place is along the city, no one can come in answer if I say my own stories'.
"The football mountains a wonderful view of the Tapy, but there are also health private players where you can drink, skip and play, for example, Sgolf playing - golf tracks have been made, chains can borrow from sports centres," Reigo is leading.
Old progenders are, of course, there with their own system, but I have not yet been able to play there.
Obviously, Mrs Rasmus Goll Tapale must be invited, as she has experienced a discgolfenthr and she has a chains.
Perhaps he will lend me credit.
Reigo and Männikull were inextricably inseparable from the current nominee.
At least during hours.
There are many tears, disappointments and you can have my sport.
Not to mention the belts and sleeping bells that have broken.
"The city of the city is full of construction works, all of which is becoming unknown," says Reigo.
However, the old and tired building is a very attractive place to play oral discoveries.
I am pleased that in 2012, the head of R.A.A.A.A.M adopted a note of my idea and had to be made to the summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre 'AleCredit to Karenin' has just passed, on 11 August, the railway station 'Elluärda' is in the railway station when the old building is moving around in the 1980s.
"From 11 to 13 August, Tapa has Day, which has opened up the doors of the building and clothes of cultural activities, including the crowd," Reigo, who recommends that he visit the city for a few days just now should visit 9.
In a tiny three-house, 1 May, the museum is already a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but the skins are a lot and information vast," says Reigo's place, full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on rail and sister.
Reigo muds that if you go through all the recommended sites in Tapal, you will be cut off a long distance, but fortunately the small city will be full of coffee.
"When we sit in cafés and cafés, we sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad, he describes.
Educated and young soldiers coming to Tapy spend a lot of time in bottles, sestap in the seats there, feel that you are in Estonia and your home city, but that is the international community together.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or American people.
The wars, yes, we are going a lot.
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering
Television canal bTV quoted a foreign minister who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering.
In the morning of 1 August, the police arrested people who illegally ordered a group of people who had been jailed by the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but there is currently an investigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone who is caught in a place where there is no provision for it.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the Court may impose fines.
The wolves that teach the people are breaking the sheep.
Finn farmers will have to give their herbs a 'lesson' again after year - the wolves that apparently teach the wolves have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, sheep in the Hiiu county have broken sheep three times, 23 sheep and eight have been injured, signing the Hiiu page.
Soil was only three, one year earlier, 124.
The environmental agency's data in syndrome with the burns also shows that soil was not born on Hishells and that the Hishell hunting Council information is fixed this year on the island for two wolves.
The EESC rejected Monday's wolves in Emtens Kabina, who opened 15 sheep in the village of Kishena, and injured the 18 survivors.
In the early morning, the wolves in the village of Rehebasla were skinned by a single sheep in the pasture of the village of Rehew and the other to whom an emergency was had to be made.
Rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and a plant protection law to the fore.
The amendment to the law removes the creation of a separate data collection for both GM and GM crops, using plant health records in the future.
In addition, the GM crop manager will be made obliged to have prior agreement with the designated radio beekeeping population.
Although at the moment, no GM crops are grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence of GM and non-GM crops.
This is at least until decisions are taken to declare the Estonian GMO-free, "said Sigmar Suu Kyi, President of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs.
"However, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors, in the Annex.
The draft law repeals provisions relating to the collection and treatment of GM crops and operators, introduces requirements for the management of GM crops and for starting economic activities.
Specifically, as regards beekeeping, the GM crop growers are replaced by the obligation so far to inform beekeepers of the start of cultivation of GM crops with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeepers before starting cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to Ministries to coordinate.
All interested parties have the opportunity to see this in the draft information system and, if they so wish, to present their views to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes will affect, in particular, the people working in the plant farming sector, beekeepers and the agricultural profession.
In the European Union, including in Estonia, only one GM crop - maize mon 810 - has been authorised to grow.
However, so far no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
The reason is that there is no magic talk in Estonia, no European media Observatory, with a rural link mon 810 resistant.
The North Rhine is also being extended to the southern regions and is not appropriate to our climate conditions in May.
To be secure, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect potential contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various surapes, maize and soybean varieties grown in Estonia.
The analysis of the samples made showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soybean varieties in Estonia were not included in genetically modified organisms.
The above may in turn be concluded that in Estonia GM crops are not deliberately cultivated and that there was no accident contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United in the form of Nemanja Maticu, "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has paved the 'genius' in the form of Nemanja Maticu, after having given his debate against the central player, Samlov, on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million ball bought from Chell, started in Dublin the latest post-birth game in the UEFA Super Cupi line against Madrid on Tuesday 2-1 in the chief row, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on offensive orders.
However, having been left behind the White Year of Asia, Maticl was badly needed to bury and only have received 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, must be corrected by a firm before the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, genious nonsense - he has the courtesy of football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to get a shape as soon as possible."
Like SolSolesian, other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romeva lu Diamandouros were also inaugurated in the Aviva stadium and Mourinho suddenly started to put his novel man in place at the start of the season.
The Independent public this week said that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football clubs, but he confirmed that the club had already done a 'excellent job' by concluding contracts with three of its four priority languages.
"I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four," he added.
"I am even more happy if they can deliver four of the four, but they have worked hard for me."
Another warm poet was delivered on the GSM Embassy on 1 August and this time in Muhus.
The honeyeside Mati Martinson, who is living in Shuves, received the first battery in SCarves, and this washing cell is flying around, leaving the washing ground and joining the Grand Use of Mullutu.
This is because SCarves does not have fruit crops, the island's voice is written.
This Tuesday, to scorn the Kurds, was a relatively late, another cucup of pot was received on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of the embassies is actually an international project carried out by Aundr Leito and Ivar Ojete.
One cup, called Mati GSM, was supplied to Turkey.
"His activities are all on the internet: How he went to Spain in winter, back a long time in the German-Polish border and then the Saaren came, Martinson spoke.
British inventor's ability to install microchips in his own body to get into hand houses and cars
The British inventor received the first person in a country installed microchip to be able to open his own edge with a mere handful of hall, to get to the office and even to launch a car.
33-year-old Steven Northam children are being installed in a small chip between their fingers and their names, and now it is also offered by companies and private individuals who wish to make their lives easier through their own company, through BioTeq.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, the Queestesiologist of the Royal Carla Consorts, in Winchester, Hants, in Hanoi, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
Technology resembles the microchip installed on cats and cogs, and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure.
The Northam company will also replace the songs of houses and cars so that they can be compatible with the chip, asking for one snow GBP 300.
This child's father has been installed in his marriage, both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start when he has his hand in the rol.
The White House's erron wins the taxpayers' money
According to military documents printed in the magazine, the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicopter last month to the southern American production event cost taxpayers as much as USD 24 000.
The green and white colour Sikorsky VH-3D, termed Marine One, during President's office, was the central figure of the event in White Main on 17 July to introduce American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, senior officials of the White House, Mike Pence and White House, unveiled industrial products from all 50 countries in their workflows.
The helicopter built in Connecticutis was sponsored with a clone from the repute, a fire-fighting car from Wisconten and a pallet made in Miscellub.
According to the documents of the HeliCopter, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the HMX-1, the HeliCopter Co-Championship, the HARGO, ordered the presence of a helicopter to be held by a military office of a little 36 hours before the helicopter for the 'extraordinary' event on the southern horror.
'I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually great event, 'HX-1 komandör said, day before the event, his overstatement, the chief officer of the naval force, the depution in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at a lunch horror on 17 July morning at 7: 00, and will remain, a 15-clock event, until the same night, between 18 and 21.
It was included that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second epathy is needed because of the restrictions on working time.
The original flight team was at helicopter during the event and the chief cabinet was keeping the aircraft close to the aircraft throughout the whole time it was on the ground.
The documents provided by the magazine were not possible to read whether or not the second eyearpathy was ultimately needed.
The Hatch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political ends.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked whether this would violate Hatch's law and we were told that 'the commander wrote'.
'You seem to have no choice, 'answered the Deputy Minister for the lead officers.
The White House declared the 'American' event to be a formal event and the Hatch law would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The President backed the efforts of health reform during the Senate at the time and praised attempts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of a known aircraft under the Maritime One or Air Force for political gain is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely photographic is unusual.
The Trump was brought to the attention in February when, at his first campaign event in Floridas Melbourne, he was a president flight to the background, and he spends Twitter's account on messages which complain about how his predecessor used his flight.
"White l Mal is very pleased with the exhibition" made in America, where products were represented in all 50 countries made up of American workers from American materials, "said conscientiously, Lindsay Walters, the spokesman of the White House.
HMX-1 teams often carry out tests around Washington and southern horror to get the United States President's White house off with a centimetres.
When the Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, 58 samples of HMX-1 White House were ordered.
According to the Commissioner, the flight flight flight was considered to be the 'American' flight crew ''s standard of monthly' learning flights.
The first armier helicopter flying for 'non-President' missions, in addition to 11 hours later.
According to the White House, no other actor in this event was slashing the taxpayers' wallets.
According to Sikorsky, the company was not involved in carrying out filtering on the southern horror.
HMX-1 will not maintain the budgetary documents of President flights and it will be difficult to identify the exact costs of the event.
However, the Ministry of Defence, at the hourly prices for the financial year 2017, has the VH-3D compensatory rate of 24 380 dollars per hour.
The primary documents referred to the flight extension of its base from the Liantico flight to Virginia for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the real cost of using helicopter is well below that amount.
"It is very misleading to calculate taxpayers' expenditure on the basis of estimates of compensation," said Walters.
"These estimates of compensation include staff, maintenance and many other irrevocable expenditure, which will be taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 Pedei study, the Ministry of Defence does not include cost of staff, but it covers fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Sean Sharier, former journalist of the White House, defended the use of helicopter at that time at the event.
"The point is to show the things made in America this week," Sstoper said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticuti are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So it is right, of course, to highlight this. "
It is not clear whether or not the Trump was involved in the southern horror in the event with helicopter flying, but he was hiding behind the fire-fighting car.
In White Main, the Trump Sikorsky was addressing representatives by handing out media outlets over company products in his personal aircraft fleet.
'I know Sikorskis very well, 'said the President,' I have three of their products.
Gari Šadeiko - Very arrived through tears of peace and joy
In 2011, MMil Daetis hit Sadeikot in the last area, 800 m drinks were booked by footwear and a stadium was taken away with a weed.
Just before that, he had received zero on China's literary holiday.
The Helsinki Helsinki System in 2012 was a violation of cheap injuries, but he received 1013 items 23 in London.
However, I have continued to do so.
After the opening day 2013 Moscow MF received a "grandfather" injury in Estonia on the road map.
Two years later, he took Beijing's 15th seat and was in the Olympic Games, but that was more than what he wanted to see the athletes disappointed.
Sadeiko was only a bubble through the most heavy cab, when the outcome of the Amsterdam Embassy was not written at the beginning.
I would just like to put together one proper multilogue once.
Once, 'sprayed Sadeiko.
Worse still lies ahead: A month later, his Olympic contest in Rios was broken down by the first obstacle to the Duos Duma.
Time had to be taken down - did you even have to continue with the seven competition?
Is it all worth the effort of two days?
You thought a long time, but found peace.
I had to think twice!
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience, but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time for us to treat ourselves all and to think about it head on.
'You know that I am not putting a candle on the picture ', Sadeiko is talking about his self-determination.
I was able to turn a clean page and move on with a new momentum.
The devil, Anne hill and gentlemen, said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of negligence, but she realised that, above all, the sportsman himself had to get to the bottom.
After all, he had been so repressed by everyone.
It was difficult to tolerate.
"The Gard said that he is not giving up and he wants to prove what he is worth, says remember.
Now it is in the middle of some kind of peace.
It is doing so to joy.
The contest was returned in May when the Šadeiko set 6280 points at the GFjellzitself's multi-competition.
In a high level competition, he improved his personal top class with almost a metre (13.89) and drinks a record-close-time barrier.
Then, there was a feeling of multiple competition that it was not at all a sleep of ability, but only a hunger in the first competition.
She has been instructed for years by Nagorno-Dess that Sadeiko is a Muslim student.
She is ready to be sportsman, she is well trained.
If something does a problem or is wrong, then he says it immediately.
It feels its own body and has confidence in its own sense.
That is what we must do.
I cannot say what exactly must and will follow.
The new approach has also been found in the Šadeiko.
'I am not the one who makes the trend maximum ', he says and says that it is most important to get the right sense, because it also provides a good result.
Baby walkers of young people happy to do so
The good emotion has also offered the words of close relatives to the Šadesian Chamber.
Both his former teacher, Maris hill and nurse, was recently given children's parents and the multiple competition has received support from new citizens of weather.
'It has been rather interesting ', says Sadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking equals the brain 'training'.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is a suicidal wine game of such great importance that he believes that wine can teach the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist of Yale University.
His message is not about alcohol, or about how it affects our feelings and ideas, but about the 'very active' wine flavourings process.
When we sleep, wine was complicated by tailing, enjoying it and perceived aftertaste, we are putting our brain on work to create taste for wine.
According to Sheperd, the bovine olecules do not actually contain taste, but taste arises from the way wine stimulates amuscles.
He will set the 'brain' as a benchmark for 'colours.
"Taste is not wine; taste creates wine as a sweet," says Sheperd.
Things that affect the taste of wine are, for example, the number of our age, our summer and even the coal produced by man.
Sheperd of course manes that wine is not full of July.
'There must be more ', he says.
If you can have too much longlue, the system will be overloaded.
Excess wine drinking can do no harm to brain, but rather to the detriment of alcohol - according to a study in 2004, people who drink more than three glass products with wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced spiritual capacity.

The figures from the staff search company fund reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive lower salaries than colleagues.
The 10% pay gap is between men and women, writes the portal Geenius.

"Narcos" 3rd season advertising clip: Now that Pablo Escobar has gone, Netflix hittsars is at the heart of Cali cartel.
Despite the fact that the killer of Pablo Escobari was exposed in the second season of the 'Narcos', the 'Netflix' sari is far from over.
The third and fourth season has been confirmed by the quota-handling service and the first has already been produced by a clip of advertising that is stranglehold the sardines.
In the third season, DEA will turn its attention to the most rich drug trafficking organisation in the world - the Cali cartel.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
On Wednesday, the head of the UN mission for Afghanistan said that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women stand for election to local councils, three women stand as Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"It is impossible to exagglise women's role by underlining the importance of women," said in the statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The local council elections in Afghanistan and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have threatened for their part the electoral process, which coincides with the transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is handed over calmly to one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Mr Haysom, women's strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan is increasing.
According to the independent Election Commission in Afghanistan, 1.2 million registered voters have been registered by the 3.6 million.
The joy of sharing is making every thing more acute, both for large and small.
There is always too little common time, but the trend with the paste is a good opportunity to combine meetings, games, proximity and burdens.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you were sleep in the summer, live animals are always on the ball and come to mind with your fine voice with a sayalty: 'Let us now also move to a trenchment'!
Aelta insulation - It is a very good thing to have a normal gold game or a flag on the coast.
A piece is the foundation for stamping down the shoes and the sheep, who would then like to take the form of a sandy-sleeping alliance over the summer?
It is a great thing to use children instead of a chicken!
Firstly, it is secure and convenient, and the weight is gradually increasing at the same pace as the training staff.
The advanced village can also be swelled with quite a large children.
The child is training a balance, counts the flames and feels the opportunity to be high and important.
Larger children may at the same time make their own villages.
The extent of the movement lies in the scarcity of land and in the wolling of hands.
The finger of the fingers is being held up directly, in the miniabic way.
A child can read the flames and feel like a lecturer.
The planet is a hugely exciting but hopeless exercise for the child.
But it is easy to do it.
Play-plank: Take a long planguColonn to nip through.
In fact, it is more difficult than usual, but much more amusing to do when, in the meantime, a friend can hand his hand.
To add burdens, plantations, pets' market can remain, and walk around in this place.
Additional care may be made to plank the children's trees, but this exercise offers a break for all children.
While the crabs join the sand, the rock, ash and krone meat burden, such as infections, are becoming trickians.
The child is walking on his feet in such a way that his body is distributed equally and wanted.
Security is the way to keep up the hands.
All the legs and the wool walks up directly.
The pump can fly, bury, strike a balance and be a matter of urgency.
A little lecturer's life is an exhortation if he gets little in every fire.
The extra burden is being put before the feet.
Checks are made to keep the back on the neutral position.
Children themselves have a lot more to do with choppressed meat in a few parts and with a plate.
A bull with a hand and a wedding.
After the child's safety, the place of the earth, and the holding of the back in a neutral position.
The favourite and big fun of all children!
The elderly, meanwhile, have a truly effective overall body trend.
The sports tools were Ott (10), Säde (8), luck (4).
From the Philippines to the heart of mopeds
The workshops that have been bundled from the tour are the summer class, which has become a peasant product in recent years, which, even though it is right, has to hang the hand and which has been able to display a price label on the battery, despite its modest origin.
The home of the lessons learned is probably one of the things that has existed once in the life of the law and which has not been aroused with particular emotion.
That is simply there and, if it is not, there is nothing at all.
Now, however, the beer bags are going to be making a real victory, and mopedestrian planters have replaced their mushrooms by summer months against simple copies of red bags.
This is not only a coastal colony, but today it is just as popular as a street, and older women are even filling it in office.
However, it is worth making it clear here before it is either that the summer is sitting on such an overstatement or it is worth postponing the slapping and slapping to a little more official.
However, the wealth of tolerance has made women's shoes a real love of summer.
For example, when we read foreign momotives, the first thing is that moeghurers are bringing their holidays to the local market as the first thing to do, and buying some beer bags, which then comes the truck of whole holiday and which goes on to the wall, the market and also friend in the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy houses of heavier wolves and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting, however, that there is a demand among readers so that women (and men!) in the real world obviously involve each other in the fishing ground in order to obtain the happy owners of some homes.
In some ways, this madness is also understandable, because the charts are the times when, in the fashion of yesterday, some of the things brought into the lurch have been able to buy for just a few decades.
It is true that white traders have also discovered a simple way of earning money here, and so more luxury brands sell their bags for a few hundred or a dozen or a thousand euros.
Obviously, in order to prevent richer customers from feeling easy to die, who proclaim around some of the cheap dogs.
For example, it is possible to buy a hand hand over EUR 1 000 in Dolce & Gabon.
However, for the Changel bregkot interpretation, a sum of EUR 6 000 may be found in the circulation.
Unlike most motives, however, the lotteries do not inherit at all with some great mosques, but they were born far from.
It is that the brewers are allegedly coming far from the Philippines, where they have been wearing them wide.
The bunch of rubbish bags is there, particularly, and local export trading is not seen very often.
Admittedly, the adage technique dates back to the 14th century and is rather a series of normal corps.
However, as the beer does not need to be as hard red as corps, they will be accompanied by muscles and other materials that make the copper more personalised and, by extension, more reactive.
For example, recently, there are particularly trendy dogs, where paints or skin ckers have been laid in.
However, the full print can be sent by the addicts, in particular, to the actor, Jane Birkini, the biggest bundled hand-to-shoulder game, which had not been seen before.
He was exactly sued by the beer of all kinds of clothing packs and not even had to go to the Cannes Film Festival a great deal.
However, today's popularity of the people does not play a smaller role in caring for them, nor is it the case that water and the wet are required to care, unlike all other summer productions.
As usual, in addition to classical nails, brands have come out of all interpretations.
For example, if they wish to have a hand-red rice or a little bit of a boom.
It is worth remembering, however, that the classic beer will never be a mosque, but a beer-flu.
But what is the classical translation, then?
For centuries, a cocktail of beer has been classified as' closed ', which resembles a flat from its style, is on the ice and is short, as are beers, cripples.

GMB is concerned about investments at McVitie's Glasgow plant
The company expects the managers of the mature producer and McVitie to be reassured of long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent on the future of the investment.
More than 500 people are employed in Hobnobsi and rich knowledge of the mature and other products.
McVitie's owner Plas said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years.
There were workers and trade union leaders who were employed there, 'are the first to hear' when something changes to the operation of the factory change.
In a letter sent to the company's host, GMB Scotland company McVitie called for 'to address the concerns that there is no use of funding to modernise production lines'.
The fact that we do not get clarity from the chief president of the GMB on the customs / VIS's business needs and future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of people from the local community and the Glasgow surrounding the border, an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social housing.
So, in the interests of jobs, wages and welfare in the East of Glasgow, Brexti, the rise in living costs and the constant fall in production, the top-up production company in McVitie needs. "
The Pladise representative said: 'The site of the customs was only written from the GMB Scott yesterday and the company responds directly to him, since we value active engagement with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between the workers in customs and the representatives of the GMB, which openly discussed a number of issues.
We then discussed with workers that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: 'In recent years we have invested over GBP 5 million on the site of customs Somalia, most of which have gone to production lines and to improve procedures.
We fully understand the heritage of customs as a production object and, if there were any changes to the activities of the object, workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it. "
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach to Neyra?
La with a view to regrets its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in its efforts to attract Neymar to his ranks by offering a bid of GBP 189 million to be taken out of it, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of its record conquest?
This bold approach has opened summer as a transitional window and Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of buying over the last season, which was set at the time by returning Paul Pogba to Manchester Unitetle for GBP 89 million.
Once completed, Neyra will become the world's most expensive player and also the most paid professional sportsman in the world who will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from GPS.
Barcelona is also a source of concern, both because of the approach and the breaking down of Neyra, although the source close to the Caelic leadership confirms that the club has always been doing the best to ensure that it is a football club for the benefit of football since its arrival in Santoise in 2013.
But did the PSG President warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blair Matutis Agreement in 2014, the Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who think about recruiting some of the best players in the PSG.
"I am not worried because they know that when they are concerned about some of our players, we are going to accept them and contact them," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get a deal with some of our players, they have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona appears to have moved beyond this limit, as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the PSG central player, Marco Verratti.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave the ground, under any circumstances, and that Barcelona could be a setback as a result of this interest, removing one of its precious assets in the form of Neyra.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexitit.
"Brexit is in serious danger of losing a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," warned Varadkar of his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
"I cannot imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible to move the current free movement of people and goods, said Varadkar.
"It is our vision for the future: Building bridges, not borders," she stressed.
According to the former, Britain would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, as it cannot be, it will remain part of the European single market.
It would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a European Union-United Kingdom Customs Union, explained by the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that there was such an agreement with Turkey, Varadkar said: 'We could certainly have such an agreement with Britain.'
The alternative to this would be a return to customs points, which would declare historical division and political failure.
'To bring about trade, prosperity and peace 'said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexitit a 'challenge for our generation' and warned that the result could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met leaders of the main Irish parties when visiting Belfast.
