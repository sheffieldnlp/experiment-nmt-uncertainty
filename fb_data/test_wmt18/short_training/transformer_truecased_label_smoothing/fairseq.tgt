four members of the C@@ ro@@ Cape vo Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to the rule of law , the police in Spain detained S@@ bel Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch , leader of the so @-@ called C@@ olum@@ ro@@ vo Group , which is known as S@@ bel K@@ Cape ro@@ v@@ ski , who is known in the criminal world .
Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch , detained in Spain , was arrested on the Court &apos;s list .
yesterday the Court also held three arrests of suspected persons detained in Estonia .
according to suspicion , it is a so @-@ called C@@ Cape ro@@ vo criminal community member of the age of 27 @-@ 57 , who mainly commit drug crimes .
the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained in the province of M@@ ala in Spain .
three men were arrested in Estonia as a suspect , one of them according to data collected is the leading figure of a criminal community and two are members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicate that tasks and roles were clearly divided into the criminal community .
the purpose of the criminal community &apos;s activities was to commit drug crimes and thus to earn criminal revenue , &quot; commented the head of the pre @-@ trial criminal proceedings , the Public Prosecutor Va@@ conne@@ Ver@@ te .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspects in this criminal case will increase , &quot; the Prosecutor added .
these are people who have previously been involved in the interests of law enforcement , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Mrs Ver@@ te stressed that cooperation with my Spanish counterparts has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common@@ place for us and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; commented the Prosecutor Ver@@ te .
the head of the central criminal police service , ago Le@@ is , said that nearly one and a half years of pre @-@ trial was preceded by detention .
&quot; in the first half of the week , long @-@ term work was realised and , at the same time , we were suspected of crimes in Estonia and Spain , &quot; said , &quot;
in Lithuania , it added that central criminal police officers were assisting in the detention process in Spain .
for years now , we have good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil card force .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are yet another message to the criminals that we will also get them to the other end of Europe , &quot; said Le@@ is .
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that when they are at liberty , the suspected men can continue to commit new crimes , which is why the prosecution service asked for their arrest and was also approved by the Court .
a man arrested in Spain expects him to be sur@@ rendered to Estonia .
under this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been confis@@ cated in order to ensure confiscation .
criminal proceedings are carried out by a central criminal police agency for organised crime and are led by a public prosecution service .
the Tallinn City Court sentenced S@@ bel Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch in 2005 to blackmail and punished him with five years &apos; imprisonment .
in mid @-@ last decade , Mr Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ š@@ it was considered the second most important figure in the criminal world of Estonia following the then alli@@ ances of T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch , from Cape Verde , emerged from the sources of Estonia at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
he allegedly taxed tax@@ i drivers and women on different ho@@ tels and demanded a monthly loss tax on business@@ men .
international joint operations , confiscation of criminal proceeds and entry into force judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest court rulings , eight accused of so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ ye@@ v criminal offences in the Community , of whom EUR 80 000 were confis@@ cated , or against nine individuals that Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v created a criminal connection in 2006 aimed at illegal trade in cigarettes and the crime of trafficking in human beings in Eastern Vir@@ u@@ land and southern Estonia .
there are around € 71 500 worth of confis@@ cated criminal revenue .
these criminal matters have succeeded in ensuring that police officers exchange information and prosecutors on a daily basis with foreign colleagues and , where necessary , take action together in any country of the European Union .
civil rights group war@@ ns against Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ se travelling
the National Association for the People &apos;s Party for Europe of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ IP ) has warned the black people travelling to Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ s about the discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the State .
the Group &apos;s statement states : &apos; the NA@@ T travel company issued for the State of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i State until 28 August 2017 calls for all African American passengers , visitors and gay people to be particularly attentive and very careful as they move around the country , given the dubious racial events that have recently taken place across the State and are also highlighted here &apos; .
NA@@ SE said that the group urged a group to issue a travel warning , both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it harder to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that the destination of justice defenders in the State is unequal to a large extent the minorities .
&quot; people &apos;s civil rights are being violated .
they are sc@@ at@@ tered because of their sk@@ in colour , beaten or slaugh@@ tered , &apos; said R@@ os Cha@@ pel &apos;s newspaper The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r , President of the NA@@ M@@ s@@ our@@ i industry .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints before . &quot;
this is the first such warning that the organisation has issued about the state of the United States .
the group referred to events such as racist aff@@ ront to black students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of S@@ and@@ er@@ si , 28 years of T@@ en@@ nes@@ this .
S@@ and@@ ers died at the beginning of this year under dubious circumstances after he ran from the State to petrol and was arrested by the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the comment refers to the recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which shows that , in the State , the cars of black drivers are 75 % more likely to be stopped than those of white @-@ col@@ lar drivers .
&apos;@@ The comment is for people to be aware and to warn their families , friends and working partners about what might happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it means taking money away or informing relatives that they are going through the State . &quot;
according to the latest figures from the F@@ B@@ I hate crime programme , 100 hate crime crimes were recorded in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is in 2015 , which places the State in a cross @-@ country position in 16 .
a travel warning is also in response to the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i new law , which makes it difficult for a company to appeal to the Court for discrimination in the search for housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( IG@@ AC@@ L@@ U ) had previously issued travel fees for T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona following the adoption of immigration laws by these states , which obliged local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences , as the AC@@ L@@ U said it would increase racial profiling .
as a rule , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter @-@ reaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what could everyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or li@@ ver bur@@ n , may be caused by five different types of he@@ pati@@ tis A , B , C , D and E vir@@ uses .
all of these vir@@ uses provo@@ ke a li@@ ver co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il bur@@ n .
however , there is a chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B and C , which can continue to develop into a b@@ lun@@ t , that is to say , a be@@ er and a li@@ ver cancer .
the epidemi@@ ology Ad@@ vis@@ er of the Health Agency , Ku@@ ul@@ o Ku@@ wait , talks about the same phenomenon of he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis cancer in all types of li@@ ver combustion - f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ gue , pl@@ ot@@ ism , fa@@ therhood , fa@@ iry , ch@@ air pain , grey emissions , we end up with horse mackerel , meat and excess pain , and sk@@ in @-@ meat and hy@@ dra@@ g@@ ren@@ adi@@ c children .
the last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of the li@@ ver bur@@ n .
children can experience he@@ pati@@ tis without disease .
the various types of organic combustion can only be identified on the basis of laboratory research .
not he@@ pati@@ tis can turn into chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and go for decades without disease phenomena , which means that you may not know anything about your dangerous cost @-@ harm disease .
Si@@ ul@@ o Ku@@ wa@@ r sets out different forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their evolution more closely .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread from a hospital to a person and infec@@ te us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , on a mix@@ ture , on the way , on the way to the hands of infected people and on food , on the ground , on objects , on the sk@@ im@@ ming and on the consumption of drugs .
a he@@ pati@@ tis is a he@@ pati@@ tis disease risk , that is , family members and carers , people suffering from chronic diseases , people who are sexu@@ ally sexu@@ ally infected , men sex , drug users , people of he@@ pati@@ tis A visit countries .
vaccination can be prevented , in particular , vaccination is recommended for people who travel a lot and who belong to the he@@ pati@@ tis A risk group .
furthermore , daily compliance with hygiene requirements is important : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands before consumption of food to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
b he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread from a hospital to a person &apos;s blood when he comes into contact with a person &apos;s blood , drugs injec@@ tion , he@@ pati@@ tis , dis@@ h@@ ment , blood @-@ contaminated me@@ als ( too@@ th@@ ma , pregnancy ) , donor blood , he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ har@@ med sex and he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ ill animals / inf@@ ants .
the he@@ pati@@ tis disease risk group includes heart drugs , infected people &apos;s sex partners , sex sex sex sex men , pregnant women , hospital families and carers , blood and other body liquids , health , rescue workers and police officers , and passengers visiting countries with a high level of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
in order to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis , people can be vacc@@ inated ; in particular , people belonging to a risk group are recommended to be vacc@@ inated , as well as people suffering from chronic pay diseases , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
other preventive measures are he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis : prevention of the use of alien hygiene and man@@ ure , other sharp instruments and need@@ les , the use of need@@ les , he@@ ck@@ ness and honour , and use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection or the prevention of sexual risk .
anti @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis vaccination is part of the national immunity scheme in Estonia and is free of charge for children .
he@@ pati@@ tis C vir@@ uses spread from a hospital to a person &apos;s blood when he comes into contact with a person &apos;s blood , drugs injec@@ tion , he@@ pati@@ tis , dis@@ h@@ ment , use of blood @-@ contaminated me@@ als , blood , blood of donors , he@@ pati@@ tis AIDS , sex and he@@ pati@@ tis disease to animals / inf@@ ants .
the he@@ pati@@ tis C risk group includes injec@@ tion drugs , infected people &apos;s sex partners , sex sex partners , men with men , pregnant women , family members and carers of the infected mother , blood and other body liquids , health , rescue workers and police officers , people with HIV infection and people visiting the countries with high levels of he@@ pati@@ tis C .
he@@ pati@@ tis C is a preventive measure : avoiding the use of alien hygiene and man@@ ure , other sharp instruments and need@@ les , and need@@ le @-@ stick , humili@@ ation and honour @-@ recognition and use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis causes he@@ pati@@ tis D virus , which is much closer to the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B virus .
this leads to he@@ pati@@ tis D infection , along with he@@ pati@@ tis B or super@@ information as chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B .
H@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread exposure to blood and other body liquids , contaminated need@@ les , sexu@@ ally and rarely infected animals .
the he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis risk group is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B vir@@ uses and people not immun@@ e from he@@ pati@@ tis B .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination with a he@@ pati@@ tis B vaccine , which also protects people from he@@ pati@@ tis D infection .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread on a f@@ at@@ ty road to drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and marine pota@@ toes , donor blood , common @-@ use need@@ les and infected animals .
passengers may be infected with E he@@ pati@@ tis in high @-@ mor@@ bid@@ ity countries .
the measures to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis are compliance with hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ ate hands after going into the ash , before food production and feed , after hospital care .
fruit and vegetables are was@@ hing before consumption , preventing low levels of heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , drink only safe drinking water and avoid consumption of drugs .
although in the last round competitors tried to get rid of four @-@ fold Olympic winners , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ara@@ h final found its strength and won 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 in time .
F@@ ara@@ h did not think for a long time , drawing on his wife , T@@ ania , and children , after the fin@@ i@@ ch .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much support my family .
it was wonderful to be with them , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h to journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h is targeting the fifth prize in London for an increasing 5 000 and 10 000 metres of the gol@@ den du@@ mp .
everything is possible if that is the case .
despite the head@@ lines , Mrs Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ standard &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; : a reas@@ suring cli@@ m@@ t &apos;s mas@@ ter@@ piece , Mr B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri &apos;s extraordinary story &apos; comes from the birth of a single art works to a much deeper end of the 19th century and the cultural life of Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century .
but in more detail in history .
the cul@@ mination of the Au@@ car@@ ic@@ ation Information Ex@@ peri@@ ation is , in other words , a th@@ war@@ mer in the b@@ read@@ th , the narro@@ w@@ ly subject would have been put on the extraordinary story of the con@@ scri@@ pt allowed in the title to gain more influence .
at the moment , the story of A@@ le B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri and the much more extensive and comprehensive history book of the Jewish families and the German occupation , together with its aftermath in Austria , would be as if one were one of the cha@@ mbers .
the first third of the book leads , in the middle of the cultural life of Vi@@ in , and who is himself in the Austrian capital , to a lesser extent than a hundred years ago , to the way in which life went around R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ s or how the Cen@@ tr@@ ali coff@@ ee turned all its heads when the climate came into being .
the concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the rich@@ est cities of Europe and when you saw the name familiar in the book , you felt a little more cul@@ turally than a grams .
at the same time , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a town where the in@@ cure in the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary and was Europe &apos;s highest level of suicide is not giving anything more to development .
or perhaps , however , every couple of honest t@@ issues also add colour to cultural life in Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in the last few decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had explo@@ ded , becoming the greatest Jewish community in Western Europe .
almost one in ten people in Vienna had a Jewish exchange .
the parents were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time that A@@ id relief itself was two times open to the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ ad Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch@@ i and Climate for his famous pa@@ ir@@ ds , his father had already become the seventh largest bank in the H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg E@@ mp@@ ire .
but let us not make the whole of the la@@ isse@@ z @-@ fa@@ ire life to which he was a member .
if you look at the &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the final half of life was infected by this kind of b@@ older soci@@ alism and dre@@ am@@ t of travelling to the Soviet Union .
by 19@@ 33 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s t@@ ree from the customer , the last month was a hot @-@ day pain@@ ting officer in Vienna .
a customer ordered a payment at that time of 4 000 kro@@ on , a quarter of the price of a good @-@ location rural house .
the fact that , in some t@@ ree t@@ ree , a champion was suspected of a mo@@ del@@ le , sugar mag@@ na@@ t , was not intimi@@ dated .
as far as A@@ dele@@ tes are concerned , the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the mo@@ del@@ li and the ar@@ tist that emerged during the course of the work continued life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; .
G@@ va Climate C@@ up , A@@ le B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri portfolio &apos;s extraordinary story &quot; , Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , Al@@ do R@@ and@@ land translated English .
just before the start of the work with A@@ dele@@ t , the climate had been visited by Ra@@ ven@@ nas San V@@ ita@@ l , and the investi@@ g@@ ators think that it was precisely the mag@@ nific@@ ent mo@@ sa@@ ts there that gave the ar@@ tist the idea of making a gol@@ den t@@ ree from A@@ dele@@ te as a mo@@ sa@@ ic .
the climate presented its &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; in Vienna in 19@@ 48 and around the same time ( between 19@@ 07 and 19@@ 08 ) , one of the gol@@ den land &apos; S@@ innovative &apos; was born .
artists did not fail to notice the simil@@ arity of two women .
how is Hitler involved in the story ?
&quot; I think I owe him to remember my friend , the climate , to make his hand available to the general public , &quot; A@@ le B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer wrote a few years after he left the ar@@ tist ( Climate died in February 19@@ 18 ) to the Director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere muse@@ um and wanted their family climate college to go to muse@@ um .
six years before the death , the climate had drawn from A@@ dele@@ e to each other &apos;s t@@ ree .
in his wil@@ dlife ( A@@ ad left in February 19@@ 25 ) , he also asked the hus@@ band to leave his two por@@ tals and four G@@ usta@@ m@@ t &apos;s landsca@@ pes to Austrian Gal@@ er .
his newspapers inh@@ eri@@ ted his sis@@ ter words to Mari@@ ana and Lu@@ i .
one year after the climate had finished the &apos; Austrian Mon@@ a Annex &apos; , Vi@@ ini Ka@@ w@@ ag@@ mun@@ de A@@ ka@@ de@@ mine had tried to escape from the 17 @-@ year @-@ old Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , but failed to do so .
although Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is sometimes seen as the reason for the fact that Jewish profes@@ sors did not accept him in anti @-@ S@@ ca@@ de@@ my , none of his ex@@ cus@@ es was really Jewish .
in any case , the role of Austrian Gal@@ eri@@ i , referred to in Maria ite@@ men@@ d , had changed considerably by 19@@ 39 , and it was important that Vienna &apos;s rich Jewish art colle@@ ctions have become a bri@@ lli@@ ant job of the female Par@@ tici@@ p@@ ation .
some of the work that was at home , but not those of the climate , were also so@@ aring in Hitler &apos;s personal artistic beau@@ ty .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the March of the Naz@@ is art , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old dispute between the Austrian Government and the he@@ irs of B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ ers began .
at this point , it should only be noted that , if the &apos; New deal &apos; is seen in the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle in Vienna , the &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , which character@@ ises A@@ de B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ er , must be seen as travelling to New York in Ne@@ ue Gal@@ eri .
and before the Vienna war , we will also read the aforementioned book .
even if you do not plan to look at the work of the climate , because my emo@@ tions at least came more about after the closure of the book on the topic of Naz@@ is and Jews than about the ma@@ il that was sold at USD 135 million and the mo@@ ll A@@ id B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer .
so not so much as a t@@ ree , rather than a relatives &apos; emb@@ assy - and a very moving story .
it considerably facilitated the dis@@ orientation of the Bau@@ ers &apos; relatives at the beginning of the book .
17 year old flood and very close to Estonia &apos;s record in Canada
in live life , gold was 200 m m to the personal record of s@@ lee@@ ping sw@@ im@@ ming very close to 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 .
the Ti@@ pp@@ mark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ old pi@@ pe a week ago , when Canada received 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 at the time , Pri@@ it A@@ P@@ ope U@@ ju@@ mis@@ h will medi@@ ate .
the final decade - A @-@ fin@@ alists - esca@@ ped from gold .
in the Fin@@ ally , he went through his distance to 2.@@ 15.@@ 76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful peak .
A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or@@ i , Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) remained a little over half a second .
in Estonia &apos;s top @-@ ever ranking , gold has risen and its fresh personal excellence is the fifth ever result of Estonia .
a young hope for the future is still starting 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in the C@@ up , as well as 200 m@@ m and 400 m in bun@@ dling at the Canadian adult champi@@ on@@ ships .
last week , in Tor@@ onto , Canada took place at the Ju@@ th@@ ora Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships &apos; Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships , and gold also made successful start @-@ ups there .
he won 200 m in a wh@@ i@@ p in a sil@@ ver me@@ dal with 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
it was floo@@ ded so quickly as a remote champion last 2008 .
more quickly than ever , Estonia has only remo@@ ved this distance from Estonia &apos;s record , E@@ lina Par@@ tar@@ ka .
as a leading player in Canada , the 100 m m h@@ all of the Me@@ dal was won in a great personal record and 5@@ 6.@@ 66 new Estonian season .
for example , his year old Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k has distan@@ ced it by just one hundred more quickly .
he reached a further 100 m a personal top @-@ level threshold in his opening of a theat@@ re wave of 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 .
for half a long distance , he only achieved the seventh place when he dro@@ ve in the final , 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
gold is currently leading the ranking of the Estonian season at four different distance .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critical teet@@ h
the time for the holidays is in the hands of the President of the United States , Donald T@@ ru@@ ll , too .
however , since the T@@ ru@@ mp has so far been one of the most holiday days , critics are already giving teet@@ h .
a 17 @-@ day holiday period is scheduled by the US T@@ EE@@ N , as announced by the President , in the B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , which is located in New Del@@ se@@ ys .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , anti @-@ T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has already spoken for a week .
they are bo@@ wing too often to the Olympic Games to rest .
it is the President who has until a quarter of his weekend exchange in the cotton of his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey .
incidentally , the T@@ ru@@ mp has no longer clean@@ ed the President during his 19@@ 6 term .
for example , George W@@ . Bush has already reached 67 days on holiday , with Barack Obama half as much as T@@ ru@@ mp , just 21 days .
however , the Olympic Games tend to be quick to forget things .
in the days after becoming President , T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s programme said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; that there will be no time for longer holiday for his successor , because a great deal needs to be done .
he also expressed his outra@@ ge at Barack Obama &apos;s leave three years ago .
the current President wrote on Twitter at that time : &apos; while Obama has a holiday , gol@@ f is playing , the brak@@ es and the j@@ ung@@ le groups are going on , journalists are sun@@ set their heads in the country &apos; .
according to the officials of the White House , 17 @-@ day gol@@ f clubs &apos; visit does not have a kind of rela@@ xation .
instead , it is officially called &apos; working time &apos; , during which the Olympic era does not have time for reading or other pro @-@ active activities .
in addition , working time had to have another reason .
in particular , the White House will be replaced by a Western pension system and therefore all staff had to leave it .
the West Bank also has O@@ ri@@ c@@ abinet and the other working rooms of the President .
&quot; I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West Bank in August , if there are 38 degrees and there is no traditional pension , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the spokes@@ man of the White House , who stressed that the President would continue to work on holiday .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp is going to spend 17 days , you have an idea of a video .
blocking critics from Facebook do not stand for state office if you do not tolerate the criticism of the voters .
the father of our country knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to start che@@ ating him for everything from internal politics to his political principles .
he was , of course , irri@@ tated by the criticism .
but he did not force his critics to remain silent .
because , in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression can be taken away from us and that , in lou@@ der and silent terms , we could be led to slaugh@@ ter@@ houses &apos; .
this brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land Governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who is struggling to be more like Washington .
the ho@@ sts have blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
at the beginning of the week , the American Civil Liberties Union ( American Civil Society Union ) therefore brought him to court .
the Ku@@ ber@@ ner official wal@@ ked the action empty and web commen@@ ta@@ tors sli@@ pped out of counter @-@ reaction in a style &apos; who is interested ? &apos;
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is just Facebook , &apos; many said .
but that is what counts .
and this counts particularly much when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
it is an ama@@ zing popular Re@@ publi@@ can Governor in an overwhelming democratic state .
his discharge percentage is the second highest among the 50 Governor of the country .
I am not an un@@ thin@@ kable , reac@@ tive stance .
he has been steering the State firmly and he has remained strictly firm on his principles .
in addition , he has used Facebook quite b@@ lun@@ tly as the main tool for communicating with his constituents , for example by presenting his b@@ right head after che@@ mis@@ try for the first time .
thus , a public forum with a formal label , managed by taxpayers &apos; money @-@ paid staff , is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
the journalist &apos;s press representative , Mr Ch@@ in , defended the conduct of the Governor in an interview to Mr Washington , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than pa@@ ci@@ fication .
but it is all too easy to pa@@ use the picture of online screening sites , spa@@ m@@ mers or people full of hatred online .
the post spoke to a number of people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and that is what they are the people who are in contact with their elected leaders : the teacher , the owner of the company and the passport , not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , well thought @-@ out and not at all Roma .
in his post , Pas@@ tor quoted milk , highlighting Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic traffic .
L@@ ak@@ sh@@ m Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , a lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan@@ st Bo@@ wi@@ e , did not inci@@ te hatred , but rather hate crimes .
&quot; I poli@@ tely repli@@ ed that I was disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or to other recent news , &quot; he wrote the news story in the State of The mail .
&apos;@@ nor do I like the idea that , when a lot of people comment on the same subject , some call it an in@@ difference immediately to collective effort rather than to admit that this is a great deal of concern to citizens &apos; .
what the Governor &apos;s officer called &apos; targeted spa@@ m attack &apos; would probably call &apos; public support &apos; .
the messages can easily be reconci@@ led by simply blocking criticism or dele@@ ting negative comments .
it is much cleaner than it was before when , in order to do the same , the workers had to be sent out , so that they collect and bur@@ n the newspapers with critical instructions , or arrest them , and force them to remain silent .
but that is exactly what is happening now , just digital .
I am not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media too@@ th@@ less .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has brought to court Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter &apos;s stream .
one of the first sta@@ ggering sentences on this subject was made last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
the US Qu@@ ali@@ bi , James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is , decided in Alexand@@ ria that the chair of the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or of the Coun@@ ty of Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i was a breach of the first amendment of the constitution when he blocked the vo@@ ter from his Facebook page .
K@@ har@@ ck@@ ys also visited AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter following the use of Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in@@ it ( R ) .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar effect to the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters da@@ m@@ bled his leadership .
and even then Washington had to face anon@@ ymous border controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers from pseu@@ ud@@ on@@ y@@ ms such as Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , making decisions in Washington rec@@ k@@ less .
on @-@ line George Washington &apos;s collection project , according to the historical documents written together in the framework of his correspon@@ dence , he bu@@ ried a c@@ abinet under petitions criticising his views on the friendship , trade and shipping agreements with Britain .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , disagreement and debate are the foundations of our country .
and proper governance means accepting this .
R@@ on@@ an R@@ aff@@ er@@ ty hopes the comfort of R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ance &apos;s home territory

the Northern Irish , who was in the vic@@ inity of Ar@@ ch@@ field L@@ in@@ aks in the past year ahead of the last round before Paul E@@ al@@ rec@@ tion , has been driving a new site and is performing the role of the Ambassador of the club foun@@ der and CE@@ O , Mr S@@ ony , rather than the Ambassador of the tur@@ f .
&quot; I saw the R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ner sitting built , and we now see how the club is now pul@@ ling in full with this attempt , &quot; said R@@ aff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; players see the way in their best shape , it is in a splendid state .
Mr Jer@@ ry has done an excellent job in establishing this place .
he is a keen supporter of the gol@@ f f@@ ence and is proud of what has been achieved here .
this will allow the way to be presented exc@@ el@@ len@@ tly . &quot;
Ing@@ rid ever looks forward to being able to defend the mas@@ ter@@ ary for the first time , even though the man has won the European Toubon and the European challenge Tou@@ l during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this is a very special feeling , &quot; said Sou@@ th@@ por@@ tis &apos;s be@@ ating player .
&quot; I could not defend my Ex@@ t@@ rema@@ du@@ ra O@@ Antwerp title because it was taken one year after my victory from the contest .
it is iron@@ ic to come back to this channel .
this is an excellent place to play the gol@@ f .
I recall the memor@@ ies of last year , for me and for my wife , Mrs Shar@@ on , last year &apos;s victory was a special one .
it was a very special period that we will always be at the heart of the day . &quot;
on the ground of the country , G@@ ary Or@@ r , who joined the European architecture of se@@ gen@@ e , is returning to the competition once again , when he received 50 .
this is his first event in Scotland after the participation of A@@ ber@@ de@@ en asset Management Scottish O@@ pen@@ il in 2013 .
&quot; at home it is always a little more significant to play , &quot; said Or@@ r , the Hel@@ en@@ s@@ burg man .
&quot; the good thing to do , but also the extra feeling .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and have shown quite a decent gol@@ f game .
I am satisfied with the progress made so far . &quot;
in Tri@@ o , ian W@@ oo@@ s@@ na@@ m , winner of the former MasterCard tur@@ ni@@ te , and the ch@@ em@@ pi@@ ons Paul Brok , Ro@@ ger Chap@@ man , mark James and mark Mc@@ N@@ ul@@ ty , will join .
Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cap@@ tain S@@ am Tor@@ tu@@ on are two out of six cha@@ mbers of competition , the rest of which are Andrew O@@ ld@@ cor@@ n , Ste@@ p@@ hen Mc@@ Allis@@ ter , bill L@@ ong@@ mu@@ ir and ross D@@ ru@@ mon@@ d .

poverty and death in Indonesia &apos;s gold @-@ rich land
if Bar@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i is preparing dinner , he will not use lead .
he rarely uses the po@@ t .
the wood in the majority of the wood in the province of Papua P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , the Mayor of the Republic of Indonesia , places the home family majority in the local language in the direct place of the bar called the local language &apos; .
half an hour after the coal slu@@ dge will be taken from fire and the un@@ sca@@ th@@ ed hand will be s@@ tun@@ ned .
De@@ ge@@ i is sitting on the other side of EGNOS , at the same time he does not have a MasterCard , at the same time he does his daily ho@@ mework , for example , was@@ hing the water of the ne@@ ar@@ by sex .

Pol@@ y@@ ga@@ a@@ mia is common here on May .
working too late may , however , be dangerous for most of the men in the village of Bucharest to be unemployed and many of them drink very hard , as well as being soldiers here .
&apos;@@ nobody da@@ res to go around after five o &apos;@@ clock in the village &apos; .
it is a rare cloud in Papua mä@@ ki , a former Dutch col@@ ony , which was brought under Indonesia in 19@@ 69 after a referendum that caused controversy , whereby only 10@@ 26 elderly people were forced to vote in their hands by raising their hands before the forces .
the move to its own ra@@ ids quickly against the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta Government , which is still keeping the region under its strong control by keeping away from foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially appointed as a P@@ ope and a Western P@@ ope , so the independent Papua New Guinea remained the east of the island .
in order to be able to get here , 90 minutes from Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ r , the capital of the province , N@@ abi@@ ja , will have to go through a five @-@ hour journey that will then make a ren@@ tal car grow .
there is no public transport .
a city of around 19 000 inhabitants consists of t@@ ree houses surrounded by ba@@ mb@@ les and covered by la@@ in@@ less iron ro@@ of@@ s , which have turned different tone into y@@ el@@ low Brown .
very few indicators have taken the route here , not to mention journalists , nor have there been almost any foreigners here .
before the arrival of Christian gan@@ gs , Me@@ e P@@ ago boats were mar@@ ried by God called T@@ ame@@ e .
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not used to we@@ aring this kind of clo@@ thes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , referring to his col@@ our@@ ful approach to the co@@ ding of the market , to the plu@@ mber and to the private seed .
&quot; before that , we only wear a plant cow . &quot;
Papua on Indonesia , the poorest province of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold @-@ rich country .
just 100 km away from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , which is about a mountain province of 153 000 inhabitants , the largest and most lu@@ cra@@ tive gold mine in the world is G@@ ras@@ berg , a company operating in P@@ ho@@ gen@@ x , F@@ end@@ Mc@@ Mor@@ an .
in 2015 alone , F@@ Friday &apos;s exports extra@@ cted around USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ per .
in addition , Papua m@@ our@@ ning with food supplies is estimated to be worth USD 78 billion .
however , these tre@@ asures are the source of the suffering of boats , as they result in the suff@@ oc@@ ating presence of a powerful Venezuel@@ an army .
a 2005 study by The New York Times showed that F@@ Friday &apos;s exports cost local military and military units around USD 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to USD 150 000 per victim .
the attempts made by the P@@ ope to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den h@@ all and are f@@ itted with ru@@ th@@ lessly .
more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 69 , according to human rights activists , and thousands more have been ra@@ va@@ ged , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesia army .
according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights , the mass killing of the mountain states belonging to Papua tri@@ bes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide .
last year alone , over 3@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ors were arrested by the Che@@ chen police in the region .
the 2016 Annual Report on &apos; We shall all lose all &apos; of Burma &apos;s main b@@ ish@@ ops contains testi@@ mony to the atrocities committed in the previous year , such as extra@@ judicial executions , torture ( according to another report , rape and electric shock ) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to read the number of victims because such incidents take place every week , &quot; says Human Rights Watch , Indonesia &apos;s research@@ er , Andreas Har@@ son .
the kid@@ napp@@ ings are even more strongly closed , because Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new set@@ tle@@ rs from other parts of Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing , because the people of Indonesia are coming from many of the islands of Jaa@@ va , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ es .
S@@ ho@@ b@@ ens are sold in the gallery as ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do with mixed vegetables , which are being st@@ olen along the ground level .
the local community cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started selling chic@@ ken and vegetables on traditional markets more cheap@@ ly than local boats , &quot; explain the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ oni@@ ans born in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i who , in the name of their work , wal@@ ked into Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ i , the capital of the province .
&quot; the pil@@ ots of the indigenous population will therefore lose their market share . &quot;
the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , who is known as Jo@@ ko@@ w among the people , promised to address these inequalities and human rights violations in P@@ ope in his 2014 election campaign .
the former Ar@@ ch@@ bis@@ ho@@ p won his way to the presidential Pal@@ ace of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta in Papua 29 constitu@@ encies 27 , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
but the P@@ ope has changed very little and the local feel dece@@ ived .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w &apos;s expectation that he will fulfil our hopes of restoring justice , &apos; says you will .
in fact , only two months after Jo@@ ko@@ w took office , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i was in a low position .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of children s@@ tun@@ ned on Christmas when two Indonesia &apos;s soldiers were s@@ tun@@ ned on a dark motor@@ cycle .
the children who arrived told them that they should be included in the front .
according to what was said by the local passport Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ ala@@ i , one of the soldiers was insul@@ ted by their voting ton@@ es and later lan@@ ded with four soldiers .
according to the victims and specta@@ tors , under the influence of d@@ run@@ k soldiers driven children and beaten them with their gun@@ s .
one of the soldiers then shot among children .
one child , 16 years old , Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ o , was beaten so bla@@ tantly that he fell into his homes .
a few hours later , the close electoral Commission &apos;s building was bur@@ nt down and the next day things were even more expensive .
around 1 000 young people , Papua men , women and children , gathered in front of the local police force and the military leadership centre to demand justice .
they were we@@ aring private ref@@ urb@@ ishment buses and putting forward Papua me@@ e pa@@ go tri@@ bes of wa@@ ita @-@ tan@@ ker , during which the baby was drink around and bu@@ ried .
some of the prote@@ sters started to le@@ cture the police and the military .
when you raise your mind , you sent your ha@@ bit to the soldiers via the internal sta@@ di@@ um . &apos; when the mass of the population shows more than three times resistance , leave them behind , &apos; it was said in accordance with a official document that has been seen by a magaz@@ ine but has not been issued to local media reports .
the oldest city of Kenya Ko@@ to , the parent of Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ am ( 56 ) , experienced a threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking for a crow@@ d to go home .
no one was willing to listen .
&quot; with his re@@ versal , I was suddenly shot into the left , &quot; he said to the magaz@@ ine in his private colour on the blood of the disability house .
we still do not know who the fire was , but says that the month came from the soldiers gathered .
&apos;@@ The people were a lot , the House had plenty of children , &apos; she adds .
the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w received three times on her fire .
&quot; I would like to come to him and study his body to make sure that it is with him , &quot; said a letter of time syn@@ chron@@ ically in Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who , like many indicators , uses only one name .
&quot; I saw him dead ... I have visited him . &quot;
the Chief Police officer of Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ud , said to the repor@@ ters that he only guaranteed the safety of his department because it was attacked .
&quot; we need to protect ourselves when we are threatened with killing , &quot; said P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , Commissioner for the Press in Papua police in 2015 .
&quot; this is a question of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ors were killed and many injured .
the news about the killings only reached J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ka the following day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra made a passion@@ ate speech in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with abuses in P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
in October 2016 , the Minister for Security , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , said that he would introduce an alternative mechanism for the resolution of human rights crimes .
but almost immediately , the ex@@ cus@@ es were followed .
&quot; most crimes took place a long time ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and early 200@@ 0s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
however , speaking on 5 June in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to has withdrawn his words by saying that he has no intention whatsoever of creating a P@@ ope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything will be resolved by law &apos; .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights of more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the bloody referendum on independence in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , including what happened in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i accepted such claims with a g@@ loom@@ y dis@@ course .
&quot; I have been heard four times over the past three years , but there has been no progress , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&apos;@@ I am afraid he says &apos; .
&quot; I fear that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I will be fired . &quot;
his bro@@ d Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed the view that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are afraid of this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bur@@ n four victims .
&quot; after bur@@ ying dead bodies , the army had to look to me , &quot; he says .
the protests have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the village population in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i was fired by the Venezuel@@ an police .
one person died and 17 injured , including children , when it went to war between the village population and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an un@@ conscious man into hospital .
this male people , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ iel@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ w@@ ned close to fish , died on the road to hospital .
the young village people prote@@ sted at the construction site in front of the company office .
according to the police , the village people were stoning , after which the latter responded to the aler@@ ts .
however , according to local claims , mobile British ( the military @-@ driven police in Indonesia ) started fir@@ ing at the people , killing one person .
&quot; we were big panic , we fear re@@ tali@@ ation , &quot; said a letter of 29 years old , Dom@@ ing@@ ge Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near a hospital and saw injured in@@ sec@@ tici@@ des .
&quot; I have been hiding myself in my house for two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i Parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for the police to get the British back into the region .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ i has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development fe@@ eds the dis@@ content of the honey , m@@ one , dan@@ ces and da@@ m@@ mal tri@@ cks living in the middle coun@@ ty of Papua hal@@ j .
many of them have joined the Liber@@ ation A@@ ca@@ de@@ bels &apos; army , which , in its words , defends the rights of the boats by or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra@@ ting attacks and abduc@@ tion of human resources among Indonesia &apos;s soldiers .
some V@@ PL leaders come from P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , under the pretext of &apos; defending state sovereignty &apos; , the army has arrested in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i over recent years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them never appear again .
the people of Papua urs are known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty fe@@ eds dis@@ satisfaction .
the low ri@@ ce that is sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
I find it equally in@@ accessible .
people are growing all their food themselves mainly at source , in addition to a little fruit and vegetables .
agriculture is the work of women , each of whom can care about four or five b@@ ars .
they usually keep most of the crops on the family , the rest are sold on the local market .
ten bases cost only 10 000 Indonesia &apos;s premises ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have intensified between indigenous boats and new migrants , who have come a lot since the opening of new routes at N@@ ab@@ ire Air@@ port .
these few jobs , which exist , go better to educated and more prosperous migrants .
P@@ ope himself often lacks capital or the skills needed to conduct a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the gu@@ est because there is no jobs or money here , &quot; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , President of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i Council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from the P@@ ope .
furthermore , strict restrictions on foreign media remain .
earlier this year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ bridge L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were expelled from P@@ ope , because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , even though they had been given a rare film authorisation .
according to Mr K@@ ine , Vice @-@ President of the Asian department of Human Rights Watch , the election promises made by Jo@@ ko@@ w have not been implemented to remove the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development .
&quot; in Indonesia , journalists trying to report from the most une@@ as@@ y provinces in the east and Western P@@ ope , new threats are threatening the rejection and blacklist , &quot; he said in a statement .
the lack of a press look means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua a@@ vans .
in March , six Pacific States called for &quot; a wide range of &quot; crimes &quot; in P@@ ope , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , six Pacific States , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ be , Mar@@ shall Islands and Sol@@ om@@ on Islands .
the same countries have historically supported V@@ PL .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , a journalist at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed group charges , saying J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas journalists : &apos; there is still a democratic regime and freedom of the press in Indonesia , so that evidence of cases of human rights is difficult to bur@@ n down &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to be taken into account .
when the Dutch official delegation , chaired by the leader of the country &apos;s human rights Envoy , K@@ ette Van B@@ ari , visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra on 4 May , the local people interrupted the meeting , but anon@@ ymous to remain the source of silence , urging : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
there will be new presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019 , but the boats do not believe they will vote again in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w .
&quot; Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man with good intentions , but the people around him who are involved in the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , &quot; says Ho@@ ba@@ i , President of the tri@@ bal Council .
he wants to give Jo@@ ko@@ w an understanding that , in addition to the fact that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are constantly living under the threat of a pre@@ da@@ tory army , they are suffering from misery due to education and health services .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , like other boats , consider their voice to Jo@@ ko@@ w to be the debt they have to pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the atrocities and intimidation , the families of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i fire @-@ fighting victims were still coping with the last symbolic counter @-@ attack they swe@@ pt one victim to death in the body of police officers and military bases .
knowing that justice can never be done , at least they will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us &apos;s head .
&apos;@@ What else can we do ? &apos;
he came to himself for the second time in Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch &apos;s cloud .
on Friday , one of the highest residential buildings in the world was eating through Du@@ ba@@ i , forcing hundreds of people to escape from this 3@@ 37 metres and 79 @-@ me@@ tre building .
this is the second fire which , for just two years , has devastated the high @-@ ranking that is being called the Tu@@ rin case , that is to say , the T@@ har@@ vi@@ v pipeline .
the building was evacu@@ ated , no injuries were reported and no direct fire causes were presented .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and let us wake up to the fires and the fear of people .
we would be waiting for a lea@@ f and we took around 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th straight , &apos; said to Re@@ u@@ ter@@ li a resident who called himself George &apos; .
according to civil protection officials in Du@@ ba@@ i , fire @-@ fighters also deleted at around 4 o &apos;@@ clock in local time ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and cut down the building .
the government said that it would work to ensure that the suffering people had a shelter .
this incident may once again raise questions about the safety of high @-@ cal@@ ib@@ re materials used outside the world .
following an investigation carried out by the Tor@@ ch Bureau following the fire in 2015 , the most damage was caused by fa@@ ci@@ ans - de@@ acti@@ vating panels and isolation on external soil .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London portfolio T@@ ow@@ er and the fast @-@ track panel could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June , which killed around 80 people .
see : these phones will probably be sold in the autumn
language and coal are a time when technical players have their feet , because then the telephone manufacturers will make their new models of excellence public .
in the spring , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um came to sale , and new H@@ it@@ t @-@ phones are also expected for boys in the autumn .
according to the Director for the marketing and sale of Tele@@ 2 , Christian Se@@ ma , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by innovative design , by an eye @-@ to @-@ mouth s@@ and@@ ner , by the ser@@ ver @-@ servan@@ i 4@@ K resolution , by a screen and by an ultra @-@ fast process .
in the technological world , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , which has also come to the forefront of the Estonian smar@@ t@@ phone sales table .
in autumn , smart cal@@ ib@@ re allows even more ti@@ er high @-@ speed re@@ charging , a more resilient brain , a better quality camer@@ as and greater water and pollin@@ ation .
he added that , on the basis of rum@@ ours , we can already make assumptions and predict four top @-@ level models that will probably con@@ qu@@ er street sales details .
these four &quot; smart phone top &quot; models will be available to boys later this autumn .
the long @-@ awaited i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach the boys as early as mid @-@ September .
however , what new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it is spreading a great deal .
if the i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not bring significant differences to the i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of Apple , it is expected that the new model will be completely distinct from previous ones .
four col@@ ours have been spoken about : black , white , rosé and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the whole of the phone front , lost the home and fingerprints are built on the screen .
J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve , the head of Apple design , demands that the new i@@ P@@ hone model be seen as like a glass .
there has also been talk about the i@@ P@@ hone cer@@ a@@ mic version .
in addition to an eye @-@ to @-@ the @-@ eye airport , a wireless charge and a more high @-@ quality camer@@ as , a faster A@@ 11 process can be expected .
it is certainly one of the most expected smart phones for a year .
a new model , G@@ ala@@ x@@ y channel 8 , will start on 23 August .
there have been many rum@@ ours that the new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y Can@@ 8 will look like .
Ad@@ mittedly , there are even more business users and S pen allows for even greater fun@@ ction@@ ality .
the telecom fund should have two camer@@ as , one of which is a wave and the other should be television @-@ oriented with a narrow view .
at the moment , no one knows what two camer@@ as are capable of , but in any case it is the first attempt by Sam@@ sun@@ g , which is certainly comparable to the i@@ P@@ hone 8 in terms of quality .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August .
although Nokia has sold three smart phones with Nokia 6 this year , there is still a lack of their flag , Nokia 8 , which is already to be presented on 16 August .
we expect a scre@@ ens stret@@ ching from No@@ ki@@ ra to 5.@@ 3 p.m. and an ultra fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ iv@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and a more resilient brain .
in the case of Nokia , there is also talk about alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and significant levels of water and security IP@@ 68 .
like the Sam@@ su@@ mark , Nokia has two re@@ ar camer@@ as on the new model , which is produced by Z@@ e@@ iss , an opti@@ mist .
once S@@ ony &apos;s fixed flag has been X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smart phones will be added , with even more innovative functions .
we are waiting for a smar@@ t@@ phone that is slightly more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least with the same good or better camer@@ a .
on the new model of S@@ ony , speculation has been made that its screen is at least cu@@ rious .
what the reality brings us to see soon , because traditionally S@@ ony has unve@@ iled its autumn flagship vessel IF@@ A at the International Technology Ex@@ po , which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September .
according to the trans@@ cri@@ es le@@ ak@@ ed by television calls , T@@ ru@@ mp Mexico pressed for payment of the border wall .
the Washington post unve@@ iled trans@@ cri@@ ptions of phone calls between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i and Mexic@@ an and Austr@@ alian leaders .
on 27 January , the T@@ ru@@ bun@@ ch &apos;s phone address to the Mexic@@ an President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ o was to put an end to public pro@@ cla@@ mation that he does not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President lo@@ ved him for his public condemnation of the wall , saying : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ mp set up his presidential campaign &apos;s promise to build a long distance on the United States &apos; southern border wall and age to make Mexico pay for this project .
it also published trans@@ cri@@ es of his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turmes , which reveal a ten@@ se exchange of views .
he said to Tur@@ ner that the agreement that the United States would take refugees to Australia is &apos; lu@@ dic@@ rous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; fo@@ ol@@ ish &apos; ; he said that the agreement that was made during the Obama Government would give him the impression of &apos; lead &apos; because he had proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees into the United States .
the T@@ ru@@ mp ended the speech by telling the Tur@@ ner that &apos; this was the most un@@ pleasant speech of the day &apos; .
the Court of Justice did not take stock of the complaint by the town of O@@ C MR@@ P Li@@ ines , where the town of Tar@@ tu rejected their offer for the procurement of bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 20@@ 29 .
it is a hand@@ book rejecting the offer of Li@@ ines Tar@@ tu bus and coach procurement in the city of O@@ C , because the offer did not meet the requirements , An@@ 4 A@@ sil@@ tin , President of the Tar@@ tu City Law Service , explained .
this is a public transport service for the Tar@@ tu town for the period from 0@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 to 3@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
the city of MR@@ P Li@@ ines compla@@ ined to the Court of Justice about the judgment of the Tar@@ tu district Court .
the national court did not take this action .
although many people complain in the social media that the g@@ loom@@ y festi@@ val is disrup@@ ting their night and the whole city is full of the brak@@ es , there are also many who do not have any bad words to say about the festi@@ val on the ground .
I am even positively surprised that the shops were so poli@@ te .
I did not see any confusion or mis@@ cour@@ tes@@ y .
even with my generosity , I saw &apos; a pi@@ tiful wave of words .
&quot; it is good that it is coming , there is a lot of joy and a joy that has remained like winter , &quot; she will be happy to add .
the wave of ty@@ rann@@ y coming from a do@@ se does not b@@ other .
when he lives in a central town , he is still playing music on his be@@ aches , the music has not yet arrived at his home .
&quot; but I hope I hear , &quot; he says happily .
the discussion in Ag@@ nes also tells us that the Grand F@@ esti@@ val is rather good for the rest - it will make a significant contribution to the VAT of local merchan@@ ts .
he also welcomes the fact that the summer capital has come to such a large extent .
women of conscience do not come into contact with women .
although I am no longer on the floor , it is nice that rand has revi@@ ved .

Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revita@@ lise business
the British education company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that he would cut 3 000 more jobs and reduce his intermediate dividen@@ ds by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to address the risk of business hard@@ ship .
the jobs to be created , which , according to John F@@ all@@ on , are likely to be concentrated at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will be added to the 4 000 posts lost in the previous restructuring .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced his intention in May to cut costs by a further GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) under the third cost reduction programme to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning .
the company that agreed last month to sell its participation in the Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House to its partner company , Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , said that their expectation of a year has not changed since the 1 % increase in sales income was announced in the first half of the year to GBP 2.@@ 05 billion .

attack in K@@ abu@@ l : suicide attack killed NATO soldi@@ er
the suicide bom@@ b@@ ers attacked military con@@ vo@@ ys in K@@ abu@@ l , the capital of Afghanistan , killing one NATO soldi@@ er and several others injured .
the NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in an incident on the Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ h line .
this bom@@ bing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people died in the mos@@ que attack on Her@@ at .
on Monday , two people were killed close to the Iraqi E@@ mb@@ assy in K@@ abu@@ l .
the NATO statement said that the explosion on Thursday night took place when a joint pat@@ ro@@ l with the Afghan army was attacked with &apos; explosives made by man @-@ made persons &apos; .
according to the statement , everything has been injured in a stable state and is being treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ra@@ m airport .
according to the correspon@@ dence , the Taliban and group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic country ( Thailand ) , are an ever @-@ increasing force for the forces in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi in Bag@@ h@@ dad NATO , are a serious source of concern .
according to the UN , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital city .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l was killed mainly by at least 30 people on the S@@ hi &apos;@@ ite line .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in central cities , which has resulted in the most deaths of the military attack on the country since the US @-@ led forces failed the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan , while the President of the United States , Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country &apos;s army and the police .
according to respondents , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also caused a public confidence crisis against the government , its policies and , in particular , the President , Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
economic partnership agreement annul@@ led the decision to postpone the du@@ b@@ bing regulation
the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency ) annul@@ led the decision to delay the adoption of the Obama regulation , which obliges states to limit their emissions from the summer , one day after 15 countries were brought to court by the Agency due to this move .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday with the &quot; procedures for determining the ozone content in 2015 , &quot; by saying that it shows the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with the states .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage and listen to our national partners , &quot; said Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t , the head of the EPA .
the June EPA had announced its intention to postpone the ozone content levels in the framework of the SS@@ GI system to measure pollution in different parts of the country in order to establish where its level of compliance with the highest air quality standard should be reduced by a further year in 2018 .
15 mainly democratic states , together with the Colom@@ bian community , put an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s Government has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to him , is part of a more comprehensive plan for growth .
however , these efforts have provoked counter @-@ reaction among the democrats and nature conservation groups , who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that the introduction of a ozone @-@ containing air can &apos; reduce the working capacity of lun@@ g wages and increase the risk of res@@ pira@@ tory diseases &apos; , such as as@@ th@@ ma .

M@@ ain@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ ain@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should be on a col@@ lisi@@ on course to face up to the most attractive po@@ lem@@ y@@ sis of the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were on a separate tobacco at the ES@@ P@@ N office in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ le@@ s until Gar@@ cia , the vic@@ torious World Bo@@ ş@@ Coun@@ c@@ il ligh@@ t@@ weight champion , wal@@ ked the second side of the corridor to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , the World Bo@@ TF@@ z@@ ation@@ i sul@@ g@@ yn@@ i@@ pi@@ on .
following the unanimous decision by Gar@@ cia , the victory of the former four @-@ day world champi@@ ons , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er , will be on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ ws , both fighters will be at the top of the table .
Gar@@ cia gave her better hand and said : &apos; how does you go , the che@@ que goes ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko will defend his bel@@ ts against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ ka on Saturday night at 19 ES@@ P@@ N .
when a few photo@@ graph@@ s were available , the Mayor of L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko , E@@ g Climate , stated that a possible confrontation between mili@@ tants would be &apos; perfect moder@@ ation &apos; .
&quot; I am a former che@@ mist , &quot; I recall Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I called for B@@ ron@@ er &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so large .
I am small about 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move down to ligh@@ t@@ weight .
and he needs to move up the light &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the players have asked for this .
so let us offer them this intervention . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world of Po@@ x@@ ony needs this fight . &quot;
the question raised by the climate was whether it should be cost @-@ effective , and is part of his strategy of allowing L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to hold a debate to the end of this year at 6@@ 1.2 kg in a class to make it possible for next summer to meet with Gar@@ ci@@ er ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ vans ) , who also have an interest in combating Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ li &apos;s match with their fav@@ ou@@ rite title of For@@ u@@ tis , which will take place on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile because f@@ ans have called for it to be opposed , &quot; said Gar@@ cia later , saying that he was open to fighting any channel that offers the best financial package .
&quot; we are the main players .
no other name can gain so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that he considered L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t to be a &apos; powerful champion &apos; and that he could go to his da@@ u@@ ghter on Saturday .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko , however , was ti@@ mid in pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia , saying that he thought that the three champi@@ ons of di@@ vis@@ j@@ on from Ri@@ ver@@ ts saw &apos; very slow &apos; ; I am sorry , M@@ ain@@ y ... you wanted it to be no@@ distant &apos; .
according to Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show strength and then to shop .
they both confirmed that they felt how the tension between them is increasing in order to cope with their prosperity .
&quot; this is a fight that awa@@ its realisation .
none of the other confron@@ tations raise so much attention and gender .
I am more than prepared to work on this , &apos; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters , and M@@ ain@@ y has done just that .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
what world pressure is being moved to Estonia ?
soil extended and issued a record of over 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals mostly travelling to Estonia to work , study or family .
for example , when it was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit for 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreign nationals , this figure was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the agencies cannot tell us how many immigrants will finally remain in Estonia permanently , but this analysis will be drawn up in the Ministry of the Interior .
when , ten years ago , nearly 500 Ukrainians went to Estonia a year , this figure will reach 2 000 in recent years .
the number of applicants for residence permits increased expon@@ enti@@ ally during the Ukrainian crisis - 10@@ 87 people received fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 - 6@@ 75 a year earlier .
in Estonia , the statistical agency provides the largest number of Ukrainian citizens growing , with 850 Ukrainian citizens getting soil in Estonia more than they left .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been great in Estonia all the time and , due to the difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are being sought from a country where the community and many others are already ahead of the family , &quot; said Chris@@ tin Ram@@ mus , a spokes@@ man at the Ministry of the Interior .
the number of Ukrainians authorised for fixed @-@ term residence was even higher than the number of Russian citizens , even though , in ten years , the most fixed residence permits have been issued .
if Ukrainians come to work here for the sake of family migration , Russian citizens will be able to do so .
&quot; given this historic Russian community , they are also most likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said the migration theat@@ re Hel@@ ina Me@@ ing , the Internal Defence A@@ ca@@ de@@ my .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen you look at where the Russian citizens who have received a residence permit from Estonia have moved to live , after Har@@ ju@@ land , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them had mar@@ ried with a European Union citizen &apos; .
soil was authorised for fixed @-@ term residence of 16@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit has decreased .
&quot; compensation is because , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested for Estonia to be permanently established , &quot; the press representative of the Ministry of the Interior , Ram@@ mus , said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia &apos;s residence permit has remained rather stable for years .
the new residence permit for the permanent establishment of Estonia can be applied by foreign nationals living here for at least three years from last year .
its aim is to encourage the transition of adapted people .
however , a long @-@ term residence permit requires five years , for example .
the extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased .
for example , soil was granted such a residence permit for 146 Ukrainians , who have been working here for at least three years .
now the Ukrainians can change their jobs and the Estonian state no longer takes the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit was popular - the holders of a bad passport ( 10@@ 29 ) , the Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , the individuals ( 54 ) and the teen@@ ag@@ ers ( 36 ) would be applying for a residence permit .
a total of 19@@ 68 people received residence permits to reside in Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and just as many Chinese , for example .
this first half of this year , the total number of such applicants is already 12@@ 69 .
in ten years , Nigeria has become a country with one of the most active Estonia &apos;s residence applications .
when , in 2007 , three residence permits were issued to teen@@ ag@@ ers , there were 200 soil .
from Nigeria , lessons are being learned to universities here .
higher education institutions in Estonia are also popular among Georgi@@ ans , Chinese and Turkish , for example .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to student games .
for them , too , the rule applies that where the community is ahead , there will be more simple others , &quot; added Ram@@ mus .
for ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , just as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 from South Korea , 40 from Indonesia and four from U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit every year , this is around 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if we look at the citizens of the European Union , migration will remain around a percentage , &quot; the Me@@ use commented that the figures were actually small .
overall , 14 8@@ 22 people were exposed to soil in Estonia , 13 7@@ 92 out of it , according to the statistical agency .
this means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration .
most of them are citizens of Estonia , but there are more of them among those who are leaving .
therefore , the migration balance of Estonian citizens was in a mine with 2 000 people .
children mig@@ rate , in particular , between Finland and Estonia .
M@@ ou@@ dam pr@@ inc@@ ess s@@ lu@@ n with sa@@ ts , chic@@ k@@ ens and b@@ lun@@ t
in the north @-@ west of ideas , however , there is a history for Maria Tampere , an old pa@@ int and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream somewhere for hours , somewhere in the muse@@ um , and I can ad@@ m@@ ire old theft and degrees .
if you study and learn something about it every day .
that is a deli@@ ght !
a world that has long been C@@ ou@@ dam &apos;s stra@@ y may seem like a few living ali@@ ens , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourself decide how much your life is !
as a friend , I have a whole sa@@ un full of the shar@@ ks I have created , cou@@ ple bro@@ kers .
because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hol@@ ly@@ wood and does not go into a red bo@@ y every day , he also wants to wear the most beautiful bro@@ kers , and that is what he is suffering !
you can live your own life special to your life !
a mobile ar@@ tist does not recognise the divide between sta@@ ggering events and a bad day .
it was precisely this reasoning that prompted a plan to shift the high @-@ cal@@ ib@@ re into the land area of Estonia , between forests and fields , to the people who often do not get the ha@@ bit .
M@@ ong a colle@@ c@@ tus was presented , for example , on the comparison , J@@ air and Ko@@ ka &apos;s motto , where with 45 mo@@ del@@ les King &apos;s de@@ fi@@ les , the whole street was carried out .
in Tallinn , you are often han@@ ged in a shop , they are no@@ d@@ ding with dignity , but there are more emo@@ tions elsewhere - there is a c@@ olum@@ vo , you rise up , you want to thank you for your involvement .
a large proportion of the audience had to be equally cu@@ rious , but they are now M@@ ou@@ dam f@@ ans .
if you are above people &apos;s expectations , they are dis@@ ma@@ yed !
and I like the feeling that I am with my mo@@ tive as if I were in summer .
Per@@ nus had a red car@@ pet of 50 metres , a whole street full of these bro@@ kers , it seemed they did not come to an end !
nor does Mrs Maria accept the mo@@ tive that creation must be presented with a super@@ ficial super@@ mo@@ tive , she is happy to bring ordinary women to the wrong end .
I often invite my own customers to la@@ ke - they have always been happy to come .
after all , it is so la@@ x to see experience , you got a wonderful ch@@ at on the bottom line !
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own role , I am always behind the shel@@ f to give the last meat to things as a hope@@ less com@@ phe@@ cy .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow a calm eye from the Chamber .
Mrs Maria ong is the author of this kind , who wants not only to play a representative role but to be present in everything involved .
I have my own sis@@ ter at the core , most of the colle@@ ctions myself .
I like the whole process in which you played with details , you will find out .
I am never far from my nature and I am not afraid of the work .
it is not the only thing to do , but also the style , logistics , organisation , organisation - everyone has to take away one sta@@ un@@ ch woman &apos;s day .
these hours of work are still huge for fana@@ tics .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me this is simply a day full of joy !
I have still been very lu@@ cky - it is like a never @-@ ending jo@@ ke : I am doing something beautiful , a man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compli@@ ments .
it has been said many times that my bro@@ thers have a land - they make themselves feel printed .
the generous t@@ reas@@ ure that Mrs Maria talent made to hear yesterday has been left to date for the M@@ ong C@@ ou@@ dam signals .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ u U@@ 18 boys : the al@@ bin@@ ary tur@@ f of the Est@@ oni@@ ans was now turned against us
the damage , the fa@@ iry tale , came to an end .
the first thing to do was to see that we were not able to sit on our table .
and if there is such a big difference in the table , there is nothing to do &apos; , Estonia commented 61 : 75 falling to Britain our only cor@@ ps in N@@ B@@ B , Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p .
the opponents took 28 faces from the south and suffered so many more attacks as a result .
nor were we prepared for their aggressive defence or attack , it created .
many attacks by the English ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
in defence , however , they managed to keep their hands everywhere ; we were unable to combine .
this team created its feet .
the ho@@ mework of the opponents was better done .
according to the M@@ y@@ se@@ pa , Estonia had to make more tac@@ tical mistakes in order to remove the momentum of the opponents .
in the last quarter , we had a zero error , but the opponents have already received several quick records .
the ad@@ missi@@ bility and intense insistence , which was our weapon on al@@ ag@@ ro@@ tur@@ dy , all of us now turned against us .
today , we did not have the strength against their aggressive nature .
the centre remained satisfied with its neg@@ ligence in Kal@@ ev@@ is , Mat@@ th@@ ia T@@ as@@ s .
in general , tourism can say good words about the whole team ; to date , there was a single shock .
it is a pity that such aggressive responses had not been met in the past .
he has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but he seemed to have been ti@@ red - he has borne quite a heavy burden .
but he made some of the beautiful moves I have seen before in a tr@@ en@@ ni@@ te , &quot; added the leader .
terrible numbers : the ne@@ aring cor@@ ps were thrown down by less than 10 points at E@@ M tur@@ ni@@ a with three quarter ...
in U@@ 18 age classes , not only do the young men of the House B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on Cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ tur@@ ni@@ ir in Tallinn , she started in Dublin the day after yesterday .
and , unfortunately , Estonia &apos;s game with Poland was han@@ ging into anti@@ re@@ es .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , there was a state of play of 9 : 49 , that is to say , 49 , only in the last ten minutes , adopted an oppon@@ ent from the gas pe@@ at , and that period remained at 16 : 16 .
in the first and second quarter , Estonia had 4 , the third point ...
in so doing , at the beginning of the four minutes , two pieces of the first two , but another 25 pieces of play , then one of the tri@@ cks in , and then 21 more ti@@ ll ...
perhaps , in almost half an hour , one of the 47 s@@ log@@ ans was tic@@ ked .
in addition , 2 ( 4 ) came from the j@@ ung@@ le .
the many losses were a reasonable figure of 12 at that time .
at the end of the game , Poland faced 33 and 13 % of Estonia ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses on the open day to recognise Portugal &apos;s 83 : 56 better .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement stocks
today , NATO arrived at the 1 permanent mine group for the weekend between Tallinn and the planned port visit , to complement the stocks of vessels and to prepare for the forthcoming exercise .
during the course of the visit , vessels are preparing to land and , at the same time , provide cre@@ ws with the possibility of a pa@@ ro@@ chi@@ al holiday .
following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future historical explosives search operations .
&quot; the participation of children in and in local waters of NATO is a good illustration of our integration with the alli@@ ed forces , &quot; said the upper Operation and Planning unit of the naval flo@@ til@@ la in the top @-@ up of the operational and planning station , Ar@@ to Rein@@ land .
as of 29 June , NATO will chair 1 permanent anti @-@ personnel group of Latvian na@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , who , at a ceremony in Riga , took over the tasks of a group from the Estonian naval officer , Cap@@ ten@@ it@@ n@@ ant Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as , Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as Sel@@ ja@@ b .
the group &apos;s flagship ship has been designated as L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ tas , a Latvian naval spon@@ sor , which also operates the group &apos;s leading position .
this half @-@ year , the Estonian seab@@ ed of the naval force is also part of the region .
as one of the four groups of vessels subject to NATO &apos;s naval management , NATO is the 1 permanent mine group , which is among the primary quick reaction actors , a task force that can be sent within five days by the Alliance to different locations in the world .
4 . until 13 August , the mu@@ tu@@ als of the P@@ iri@@ ta mon@@ as@@ tery will once again become a place where the Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ id , who was called for by Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , is being bu@@ ried 13 years ago .
this year , Burma , F@@ esti@@ val , says that the artistic leader of the Tallinn Film F@@ esti@@ val , is going to be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented .
risk J@@ oo@@ st : Cuba will end up in the clas@@ s@@ rooms of the &apos; Tra@@ vi@@ eta &apos; and &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; , bal@@ le@@ ti@@ la@@ answers from the lu@@ m@@ m &apos; B@@ ole@@ ro@@ st &apos; L@@ ike &apos; Kar@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ ini &apos; , and neither will the plan be left with its own production , this time by Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ni &apos;s wonderful or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra , by the same creative team , who , in 2015 , even brought the creation of P@@ iri@@ la@@ ta Ha@@ y@@ d@@ n , even into the works of the Hague .
Mrs F@@ esti@@ val has much more than just groups and theat@@ res .
it is greater than any music theat@@ re in its normal form .
it is at a festi@@ val whose s@@ now is taking hold and is never completely dis@@ pel@@ led .
because the experience that the lis@@ her receives in this sup@@ erior and insi@@ di@@ ous environment makes human beings b@@ lun@@ t and concerns human values in a way that cannot be described .
to the risk , you are the art leader of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val for the first year .
did the ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ id not feel a little big ?
of course , because I had a very personal relationship with E@@ ri Klaus , it has been very helpful .
he went through my entire student career and also supported the change at the beginning of his career .
perhaps thanks to this , it will be easier for me to continue his work .
the Burmese F@@ esti@@ val team has coal so much well and , of course , all of this goes to me .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things go .
it was Mrs K@@ ess &apos;s great heart that also gave me the strength to go well with her F@@ esti@@ val in the F@@ esti@@ val of Tallinn in harmony with Bir@@ git@@ ta .
and here I am and I can do it !
what could be the audience this year &apos;s festi@@ val , what are you offering in particular ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , surpris@@ ingly , the first bal@@ le@@ tt written by Mrs L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i comes to the presentation .
that is &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson fly &apos; .
and one criminal nu@@ ance about this is that the author of this bal@@ le@@ ti is the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ ance , who himself expressed a desire to write on this work .
obviously , she has already been living in a child &apos;s b@@ reat@@ h in Kar@@ l@@ sson &apos;s car@@ a@@ ter .
to the risk , how are you all ang@@ ry about this ?
thanks to my supportive life com@@ patri@@ ot certainly .
such work needs a support system and a lot of love , and I am happy to have it col@@ lu@@ ded .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tions are not so much dependent on other people , as I myself may be , how I am going to oppose every new day .
and such a conscious tone , keeping positive and actually na@@ ming ourselves into the mir@@ ror this morning has greatly increased my happy % .
especially this week , when there are the most important tests , I have been particularly keen to practise it and it is working .
self @-@ promotion ac@@ centu@@ ates the brain and highlights the tone .
that is not just a word .
I think that people do not yet know anything about their own body that the univer@@ se offers them , but everyone himself is slowly finding it out .
now , this is an important moment .
does you have a kind of clo@@ thes before you take a di@@ ri@@ gen@@ t ?
there is still , clothing must be replaced against more convenient ones .
this is a small moment for ourselves .
but , in general , yes , I do not have the opportunity to fle@@ e or make a little s@@ tun@@ t before you speak .
in fact , I even like to engage actively with people , even before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ e is taken .

new results of the Swedish age assessment tests for asylum seekers were published
in Sweden , there were asylum seekers who assessed their age with a medical approach , and the latest results of the test show that more than 80 % of the constitu@@ tions were judged to be older than 18 , but not all believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for Justice medicine ( R@@ ou@@ ts@@ tis@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ t ) started with tests later this year .
the tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of age in the context of asylum application , after the Swedish Migration Office ( migration ) criticised for failing to correctly define the age of a number of allegedly under@@ age refugees .
up to now , migration has sent 68@@ 80 cases to testing and the Institute for medicine has issued 24 81 tests between mid @-@ March and 31 July 2017 .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) was estimated at 18 years or older , and 25 more cases , the Institute assessed that the test &quot; may be 18 years old or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , it was concluded that a person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
tests will only be used if the age of the person is called into question .
according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ Control son , who works in the institution of justice , the results are consistent compared to those of the previous months .
&quot; we do not see a great deal of difference from previous months &apos; statistics , the numbers are quite consistent , &quot; he said to the newspaper The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were estimated to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have chosen their age .
the Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that in 4@@ 42 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person surve@@ yed is 18 or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson Dag@@ bla@@ v examined the results of his 581 test , it became clear that in 2@@ 43 cases , people had directly claimed that they would receive 18 this year .
this method of assessing medical age , through which th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic r@@ ö@@ n@@ gen@@ i@@ s and s@@ lee@@ ping tra@@ cks MR@@ T are carried out , have been criticised in some quarters , after which they will be allowed to be analysed by too@@ th@@ m doctors and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts .
one of the sceptics is the En@@ k@@ rin@@ olo@@ gist Claude Mar@@ cus , the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute of Technology , whose task is the assessment of people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they were going through audi@@ ences sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement method currently being used should be used .
the definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot be clear , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he said forestry to the newspaper .
but Joh@@ an Gö@@ Control son from the institution of judicial medicine defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; generally speaking , the risk of leaving the child in@@ accurate to adults is low .
perhaps at around 10 % the greatest risk is that a person is just under 18 . &quot;

the 20 @-@ year @-@ old last @-@ old newspaper Anna Maria O@@ rel made a beautiful debate on the London M@@ il M@@ il , with 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7 receiving a good 18 seats .
O@@ rel , M@@ M was a no@@ ori@@ m of women &apos;s fin@@ gers , and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for the med@@ als in the future .
the contest went well and had a good experience .
with the first attempt ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , I immediately took the risk of my average result , the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) , and the third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) I was able to keep it almost clear , &quot; said O@@ ther after the contest .
I chose my emissions , and I am very pleased that I found it .
Mrs O@@ re@@ li M@@ M &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 seats .
Vi@@ h@@ mas@@ ad@@ u O@@ reli@@ t did not mix , because he is training through the winter at the LTTE stage .
&apos;@@ I am fea@@ red &apos; , he said with little mu@@ d@@ dle .
the London Olympic Games almost had a full house of people , did O@@ rel dra@@ g people around him or were he able to get himself off ?
I did , but in a positive sense .
everyone says it will add - that is the case !
if you compete yourself , you can experience it .
after all , it was confirmed that M@@ M &apos;s debate would be satisfied and that there are still many good competitions ahead of him : &apos; I came here with 3@@ 2nd , the last result , I ended at 18 .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and I am a man - that is the only thing that matters .
I am taking a good experience and , some days , I want to compete on behalf of the med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina Governor announced party change
at the meeting on Thursday night with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ er , the democratic Governor of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , Jim Justice , announced that he would change the parties .
&quot; whether it or not , the democrats spoke from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I say to you , having c@@ ree@@ ped up a lot and won@@ dered ... today I am telling you , the Western P@@ ole , that I can no longer help you as a democratic t@@ reas@@ ure . &quot;
there were some positive conver@@ sa@@ tions at the meeting .
&quot; so I am going to be Re@@ publi@@ can tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as an engine@@ er , I would say to you that it is time to play another game . &quot;
the T@@ ru@@ mp had previously promised a major announcement at the meeting of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
the T@@ ru@@ mp won 42 points in Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and Justice did not support the Democrat candidate , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
justice , which , according to For@@ ter@@ i , is the only billion dollars in the State , proved to be elected in 2016 .
it notes that it belongs to coal mines in five states and to the coal business in its own right .
its value is around USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday night , the National Committee of Re@@ publi@@ can ( R@@ N@@ C ) published an announcement that &apos; the party exchange of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would prevent the country from improving rather than working for it &apos; .
&apos;@@ One out of just 15 t@@ issues and controls on the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent expression of the par@@ ade , which is not able to find a positive and united message &apos; said R@@ N@@ C &apos;s representative R@@ on@@ na Daniel Mc@@ in his statement to C@@ B@@ S New@@ si .
it is no surprise that there are many people there , there are also many injured .
Mrs Ur@@ ker , who was in charge of her medicine , said yesterday to the Lady that they had to distribute quite a lot of pos@@ ters .
fruit and fa@@ ts are fundamental , lies and beg@@ ging falls .
of course , the pos@@ sessions - , behind and over .
according to the Ur@@ me@@ ti , visitors will come to the festi@@ val with false foot@@ steps , and so the problems will come .
the media have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic and also one foot of the foot .
we have also made le@@ af@@ lets when a person has made a hand or a finger break .
we are doing fewer nur@@ ses here , we are sending more to hospital .

Co@@ e gave honest apolo@@ gies to the Russians for D@@ oping
S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , the International front of the Ker@@ ge@@ an , has , according to his words , praised &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apolo@@ gy on Thursday &apos; for doping , but reiterated that this is not the time to allow sport back to the country .
in the run @-@ up to the World C@@ up of the gi@@ ft of the ligh@@ ter Russian Chancellor , D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin , said at the Congress of the IA@@ AF that the ban on the contest imposed on his country was the right one and that he had a clear objective to combat doping .
he asked for an apolo@@ gy &apos; from all ligh@@ t@@ weight classes who have been dra@@ ined away from the contest by gol@@ den and sil@@ ver med@@ als &apos; .
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the entry into force of the contest ban , which was introduced in November 2015 after the W@@ AD@@ A report found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think this was a very honest response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said President Co@@ e , the President of the IA@@ AF .
&quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that Russia itself acknowledged that they had quite difficult times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Union . &quot;
in addition , according to Co@@ e , she was pleased that Russia accepted its own recovery criteria .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but the Congress supports the group &apos;s proposal that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything possible to norm@@ alise the situation in the next few months .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean ath@@ le@@ tes from the system that has been breached , &quot; he added .
one of the si@@ x@@ teen Russian light workers who meet the strict criteria of the IA@@ AF will compete as neutral ath@@ le@@ tes at the World C@@ up in London on Friday .
R@@ une Andersson , leader of the IA@@ AF Group , said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet a number of criteria for forecas@@ ting .
following a presentation to the IAEA Council , she told journalists in London that doping controls were still insufficient and that trained engineers were still operating freely .
the revolution in electric cars will significantly change the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
not only does the revolution in electric cars change significantly from the fuel market to infrastructure , it will also create new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although mining companies like G@@ len@@ core can say that they will win from one place and lose out on the other , smaller mining companies will not help .
today , G@@ len@@ core coal and oil are serving , but in the age of electric cars , co@@ ding , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ ot@@ ine demand are growing .
this year , the decisions taken by the governments of the United Kingdom , France and Norway to allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades have increased their contributions to the spread of electric cars .
S@@ es@@ vo has therefore already knew that they intend to abandon the internal combustion engine , and T@@ es@@ la will bring a cheaper 7.5 electric car onto the market .
B@@ in@@ berg New Energy Finance estimates that over two decades more electric cars will be sold than fuel produced from oil .
&quot; on some metals , this will change everything , &quot; the Capital Ö@@ ic@@ si raw materials analy@@ st Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ in B@@ beef said .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as co@@ ding and li@@ thi@@ um , which have increased demand for years .
there are about three times more cop@@ ies in electric cars than in the ordinary car , G@@ len@@ ner announced .
more answers are needed at charging stations , which is why Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that this will increase domestic demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ bal@@ t , gra@@ pe and man@@ gan@@ ese .
G@@ len@@ ner will benefit from the growing trend of electric cars from domestic prices and the fact that it is the world &apos;s largest co@@ ding manufacturer is predicted by the J@@ omen@@ tr@@ ale Group .
this bro@@ ker estimates that F@@ Friday &apos;s @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ ma Min@@ er@@ ma will be the winners of the other electric car race .
the market is responding to a changing trend .
this year , there has been a 70 % increase in the London me@@ tal stock code .
the increase in soil prices was 37 % .
the last has also risen by 14 % this year , mainly because of economic growth .
the share of G@@ len@@ ner rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price increase to the ri@@ val , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ on and Ang@@ lo Plus .
on the side of the defen@@ dants , there are lead companies such as Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine , which must adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ use use of petrol and diesel is the bat@@ teries supplying the b@@ read@@ ers with the flow of cars with the petrol and diesel engine .
electric cars use gla@@ ci@@ ers .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand except if it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; the Bank of America , Mer@@ ri@@ ll Gy@@ ch , analysed the me@@ tal market , Michael W@@ id@@ mer , said .
the price movements of the sun have not yet seen the effects of the un@@ ri@@ val@@ led trend .
P@@ li@@ i has risen by 17 % this year , the best meta@@ ph@@ or@@ ic in London among the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems with me@@ tal in the future .
&quot; I am not sure that this is so bad for lead , because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive , &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the me@@ tal bro@@ ker Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ si &apos;s sales leader .
if the demand for lead falls , it will be slow .
that may be the case in about ten years &apos; time .
at the same time , however , stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which depend on the frequent introduction of engines of lead @-@ based bat@@ teries , will assess the international lead and research organisation .
me@@ tal metals such as alu@@ mini@@ um replace steel , as a ligh@@ ter car can drive further away from less electricity .
this explains the additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes between 2013 and 2016 .
this represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s alu@@ mini@@ um &apos;s output .
this trend is likely to grow , says W@@ id@@ mer .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um has risen by 13 % this year , as growing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
steel producers do not .
ak S@@ way holding works with General Motors to use nano@@ technologies to produce mira@@ cul@@ ous cars .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and S@@ way Europe are also trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down from steel to resist a minimum .
&quot; one @-@ strong steel should respond to this development , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris &apos;s analysis , Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to a pla@@ te .
soil took around half of this to the cataly@@ sts of cars with a precious diesel engine , according to Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ mers , the me@@ tal re@@ fin@@ er .
&quot; many raw materials with high demand , such as oil and pla@@ te , may not have a high demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h , Na@@ ti@@ x@@ is the analysis of raw materials .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole are becoming less important , but their importance will change within 15 years .
the planned producers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , leader of Un@@ core , said that more hybrid cars would continue to be sold in 2025 .
in the 10 @-@ year perspective , the great hope of the planned manufacturers is that the cars based on the hydrogen element , based on To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ gus@@ i Mo@@ to@@ si , are developed , depending on the pla@@ tin@@ um to produce hydrogen electricity .
so far , however , this technology has not yet been commercially justified .
&quot; the dialogue seems to be clear on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P from Paris to Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers suffered a major set@@ back in July because the S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art Court refused diesel in the home town of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how financial rules for football affect the transition of Ney@@ ra to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the uncontrolled spending of European football clubs do not prevent the record transition of Ney@@ mark from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona club of Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences from UEFA , the governing body , which domin@@ ates the game of Europe and which has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the pres@@ ti@@ gious League of Me@@ is@@ ministers &apos; tur@@ ni@@ el , await Paris in the front of Saint @-@ Ger@@ May .
the financial rules on fair play established by UEFA in 2011 ( F@@ F@@ P ) mean that PS@@ G must demonstrate at some point that the transition of Ney@@ mark was financed without huge losses .
EUR 2@@ 22 million ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) were paid to Barcelona alone for the sale of a brow@@ ser from his agreement , and the Ney@@ mar@@ i wage will reach tens of millions of dollars a year .
there are some financial aspects of Ney@@ mar@@ i &apos;s transfer to the French club .
the PS@@ G will undoubtedly be able to bail out such money to recruit Ney@@ mar@@ i and add its sta@@ rs to a ri@@ val , given that the team is funded by the family dominated by the Ka@@ tar Energy bill .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recru@@ iting players , but they must balance it with legal sources of income that will enable them to come out of the football business .
F@@ P was founded on Michel Pla@@ tini after he was elected as President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs , who are successful in search of large debts , are actually dealing with fraud and risk ruin if banks or owners were to give up their support .
from 2011 onwards , F@@ P will focus on monitoring the losses instead of the debts of clubs .
this change means that the business model that Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch first used in C@@ hel@@ sea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then to make major costs in order to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement .
in the current three @-@ year evaluation period of F@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can bear up to € 30 million in losses .
and despite the shame@@ less rejection of the presidential office by Pla@@ tini in 2015 , his successor , Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , is still committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; last week said The Em@@ ble@@ le Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , UEFA @-@ s F@@ P , who is a watch@@ dog .
although PS@@ G &apos;s atta@@ chment for the over@@ purchase clause of Ney@@ mark as one of the full payments , they are able to distribute this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire contract &apos;s duration .
Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why the transitional fee can be shown in paragraph 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros over the next five years .
for the first wave of sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G , together with Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga , was the hardest hit .
the PS@@ G was charged with a fine of EUR 60 million ( currently EUR 82 million ) , which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million , and a club was requested to limit the team of Me@@ is@@ ters in the season 2014 @-@ 2015 to 21 players instead of normal 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs who can try to drive over @-@ regulate financial institutions by pul@@ ling up their incomes through companies linked to the owners of the club .
the company of Q@@ a@@ tar may spon@@ sor PS@@ G , but if the value of spon@@ sorship is deemed to exceed standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as official income .
this was the case in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar Tourism Authority PS@@ G &apos;s support value was brea@@ thing .
it has been said that a certain part of the Mor@@ mar@@ i PS@@ G service can come from Ka@@ infrastructure through payments from the World C@@ up Committee in 20@@ 22 .
however , PS@@ G and Q@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ ra could become a member of the World C@@ up and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities can easily reveal such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on the PS@@ G mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition to PS@@ G Ney@@ ra pro@@ actively .
they talked to The P@@ ope on condition that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed because they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PS@@ G .
the latest reports show that more than € 10 million of revenue in the PS@@ G &apos;s 2015 @-@ 2016 season is worth around € 54@@ 2.4 million in turnover .
the latest financial year data has not yet been published .
PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ ra will have a good impact on spon@@ sorship transactions , on trade and on the sale of labels .
the club expects an increase of at least 30 % in connection with the conclusion of the agreement .
Spain too , being clearly irri@@ tated by the departure of one of the largest football sta@@ rs , tried to prevent Ney@@ ra &apos;s transition by claiming that the PS@@ G would be in breach of the F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with a club and a country , &quot; President Javier T@@ eb@@ as said to the Spanish newspaper AS , referring to the fact that the PS@@ G was primarily a member of Ka@@ tari@@ al .
Ar@@ ş@@ W@@ en@@ ger , a man from Ar@@ sen@@ al , whose club belongs to the American sporting mag@@ nific@@ ent , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of ownership rights and has changed fully the whole football landscape in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; when a club belongs to a state , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , because the country may have other ways or other interests to ensure that such a large player represents the country . &quot;

today 50 years ago : the hur@@ ric@@ an@@ ic storm in Estonia , which h@@ eral@@ ded houses and win@@ dows .
the hur@@ ric@@ ane mentioned as the storm of the century , which on 6 and 7 August caused major damage , particularly to the Baltic States , to Har@@ ju@@ land and to the Bay of Rap@@ kay .
over 30 m / s was at the heart of these days in Estonia .

everyone was blind and on track , as was the lesson of the world .
in 2002 , the old Mrs L@@ inda K@@ uro@@ va was already flying from the houses , recalling the magaz@@ ine of the old newspaper , L@@ inda K@@ uro@@ va , in an interview in Estonia &apos;s nature .
the hus@@ band of L@@ inda saw how the animals he was sitting together collapsed .
but what did you come back with your hands , where are you receiving such a storm ?
the sea came under the window , from win@@ dows to water , &quot; said Mrs L@@ inda tone , who was living on the streets of Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us Kal@@ da .
the fact that the roads were full of trees and that the cab@@ in of the railway station had flights to 20 @-@ 30 metres long saw L@@ inda L@@ inda the majority of shar@@ ks just next morning .
according to the local saying , the trees behind Par@@ ale@@ pa were behind nature , some were completely long , some were boys .
everyone saw very de@@ pressing , the storm went through beautiful old trees as a ra@@ g@@ ba@@ g and pragmatism like war .
Western Vir@@ u@@ a was not particularly hard hit by August 1967 compared to Western Estonia , but the losses were even large there , and the Vir@@ u@@ land Official wrote in 2007 .
the maize Par@@ k and P@@ ad@@ ise Par@@ k were swe@@ pt away from the am@@ ble , but our entire par@@ ks were also severely affected .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured as a matter of up to 35 metres per second , or around 130 kilometres per hour .

books are in the air and they are no longer getting under ! &apos; , the Vir@@ u@@ land Official Journal wrote .
at the time of the storm , the generation &apos;s concept of G@@ ood was destroyed so much that it was decided to be disman@@ tled at a later stage .
the design of T@@ ü@@ ri &apos;s ski moun@@ tains , which was not subsequently restored , was not opposed to August .
the newspaper Red T@@ é@@ t wrote on 12 August 1967 that cleaning up towns and settlements from swe@@ pt trees and their ox@@ y@@ gen is progressing slowly , and the population could get involved in cleaning work .
cereals also suffered a great deal from the Tu@@ rin , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party organisations must be an incentive and direction for both cleaning and fer@@ tility &apos; .

secret of bathing areas : night cleaning and poor coastal land
faster summer spring also means less cleaning in the bathing areas of Tallinn .

price of clean be@@ aches
one of the biggest works on Estonian be@@ aches is the se@@ af@@ ood of marine rub@@ b@@ ish , that is , the repetition of ad@@ ru .
for example , on the surface of P@@ iri@@ ta , this must be transported 400 000 tonnes from the coastal season .
&apos;@@ It is an incredible amount &apos; notes U@@ so@@ v .
the second large category is municipal waste , that is to say everything that people are leaving behind .
there are eight large waste can@@ tons on the one @-@ kilometre scale S@@ tro@@ om coast , which need to be disman@@ tled three times a week .
so much is happening with rub@@ b@@ ish .
however , the cold summer weather has meant that the waste is a fifth less than it was .
the third category consists of neglected things .
in most cases , they are children &apos;s TV .

the administrative services representative , Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler , admitted that the screening work of the tra@@ ctor was disrup@@ ted by local communities .

&quot; in Estonia , compared to Europe , there is much more work in place to ensure that the be@@ aches are maintained , &quot; says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .

although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the urban Government will do something about the rub@@ b@@ ish b@@ ars and , for example , will put the ca@@ ts on them to prevent at least birds from spreading there .

Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at the same level as weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have sof@@ tened speculation on the rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain a lo@@ opho@@ le , as households &apos; hard incomes have put interest rates on the waiting .
policy makers in the Bank &apos;s monetary policy committee ( MP@@ C ) voted 6 : 2 % to keep to 0.@@ 25 % , and fewer Members are calling for an increase this month because slow growth has weakened support for growth .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 from 1.7 % to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households &apos; incomes would persist , as inflation is expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in the rates would be necessary to curb inflation due to Bre@@ x@@ y over the next few years , and that the financial markets could need to be more than expected to increase their lending costs .
Members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package into the economy triggered by Bre@@ x@@ s .
the Bank will end its fixed @-@ term financing scheme in February , which offers banks cheap funding , although it said that it now has GBP 15 billion to be expected under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain power@@ less in the near future , as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
as regards the rates , it was reiterated that &apos; some effort on monetary policy is needed to reduce inflation &apos; and &apos; somewhat higher &apos; than the markets are expected .
Mr rs is currently predi@@ cting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any goodwill is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this year and for next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % comparable to May &apos;s forecasts .
the forecast for 1.8 % growth in 2018 remained .
after that boo@@ m , the dollar and the euro fell .
women have fallen by 0.5 % to USD 1.@@ 31 and 0.@@ 4 % to EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have raised growing expectations of the rise in energy GDP in the second quarter of the previous three months by 0.2 % to 0.@@ 3 % .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will recover a little of momentum .
the Bank &apos;s most recent inflation report gave little reason to so@@ aring inflation and pi@@ tiful wage increases to households , saying that the situation will be slightly worse before the improvement is made .
it was added that monetary policy cannot prevent the loss of income in the next few years , but a marked recovery is expected at the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
the weak p@@ ound also encourages the economy to grow demand for British production , partly benefiting from lower costs for consumers .
the decision comes one year after the rates were taken at 0.@@ 25 % last August after the shocking EU referendum , which caused a sudden weakening of the p@@ ound .
the bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to fully brea@@ the life into prices and the economy .
before the bank &apos;s last decision , there was a growing demand for growth , as inflation had increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households ; in July , three policy@@ makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell from 2.6 % last month to 2.9 % compared to 2.9 % in June , although it was expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was due to a completely weak p@@ ound .
Mr Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , the head of Co@@ rec@@ o &apos;s mortgage bro@@ kers , said : &apos; in view of the recent decline in exchange rates , the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive once again , as creditors want to get out of work and hope to complete the year in a positive way .
Mr rs seems to be particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as re@@ financing , often without service and with a low rate , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS signs 10 000 HIV drugs that have led to conflict
patients will have access from September to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; treatment for HIV prevention after the battle held by the Supreme Court over whether the N@@ HS should finance the medicine .
the N@@ HS announced that public health is now estimated to make available to 10 000 people in the initial three @-@ year clinical trial ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t that is man@@ ned before the mid @-@ term and which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection for people with high risk by around 86 % .
the N@@ HS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the Court of appeal supported last year &apos;s ruling that the N@@ HS would be able to pay for Pr@@ EP , despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
the Man@@ aging Director of the N@@ HS Eng@@ land , Simon Ste@@ ps@@ m , welcomed this launch unve@@ iled on Thursday as &apos; new , large @-@ scale intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as &apos; pivotal moments &apos; .
mental health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ oli@@ s and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to register people ; in October , there will be more clin@@ ics before the programme is introduced everywhere in England by April 2018 .
the col@@ lisi@@ on @-@ pro@@ phy@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) is a t@@ ree of HIV drugs to be taken before the mid @-@ term review in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people with the risk of infection .
the Pr@@ EP &apos;s take @-@ up before the weekend means that there are a sufficient number of medicinal products that prevent HIV from being infected .
such medicinal products can be taken every day or no later than two hours before the break .
equal candidates include les@@ bian or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment .
routes identify suitable people who agree to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate in a local sexual health clinical trial participating in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and N@@ HS England signed the contract to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the aim of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended for and how it is consumed and implemented in a large cloud .
Ste@@ Sea said : &apos; this new , wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and intensify a wide @-@ ranging and increasingly successful fight against HIV proliferation .
this is another milestone in more than three decades &apos; struggle against one of humanity &apos;s greatest health problems . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , CE@@ O of NA@@ T , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
the Pr@@ EP , if it is properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk she@@ er , offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risks in England will have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian Green , Executive Director of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Fund , said : &apos; now it is a priority to ensure that a clinical attempt at a rapid transition across the country is made and that none of the HIV risk groups is left aside .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been received , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister for Public Health , said : &apos; the start of the Pr@@ EP clinical test is very welcome and very late after months of delay and counting government feet .
evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to HIV prevention and to the end of the spread of its life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt takes us a step closer to full understanding of the benefits of the Pr@@ EP .
it is now important that a clinical attempt is deployed across the country as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV and take us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the price of electricity rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the difference between the prices of next day &apos;s electricity between the Estonian and Latvian and Lithuanian prices decreased to EUR 1.@@ 94 , compared to EUR 7.@@ 71 this June , announced Ele@@ ring .
the main reason for the price gap is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , the average stock exchange price for electricity was set at EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 33 / hour last month and the price rose by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five per cent to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ x@@ ic .
in Finland , the price was EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 17 and the electricity exchanges &apos; Nord &apos; system price was at the same time EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ k@@ y @-@ hour .
prices rose by 12 and 7 % respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity moved from 75 % last month to Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland to Finland .
the remaining nine % of the hours between two countries did not take place on the next day .
electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the hours used the full transmission capacity .
according to transactions on the last trading day in July on the Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X market , the price of the electricity exchanges in August could be around 34 and EUR 37 per me@@ ga@@ k@@ le in September .
the carbon price affecting electricity production increased last month and transactions took place at 5.@@ 04 @-@ 5.@@ 47 per tonne .
life of higher education - semi @-@ order and smart de@@ sig@@ ners have turned this small Ear@@ ls into a house of the Court &apos;s house
Jo@@ anne Le@@ cio , a former ban@@ ker who is a passion@@ ate building ref@@ urb@@ ished his great K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge home in 2014 against the Ear@@ ls Court .
it is in the first order of Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ ş@@ i , and the fact that Jo@@ anne has not pac@@ ked his co@@ ts and sold the fla@@ me forward is an honour for a new design .
&quot; before that , I lived on a much larger soil with a former life co @-@ member , K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I did something that would be equivalent to the price I offered .
I was shown by the Ear@@ ls Court &apos;s fla@@ x and had the same high la@@ kes .
I experienced it and made an offer on the same day . &quot;
since its first visit , this 93 @-@ me@@ tre cor@@ ps have gone through a full innovation t@@ ree .
at the beginning , it was one of the s@@ lee@@ ping rooms and a complex one @-@ stop shop - to get a s@@ lee@@ ping as@@ hes through the kit@@ chen , and Jo@@ anne wanted to add savings and qu@@ asi @-@ order in order to take advantage of the high levels of proposals .
&quot; I wanted high @-@ profile , big win@@ dows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he asked Er@@ fan Az@@ ad N@@ ot@@ ting from the archite@@ ctural and de@@ sig@@ ner radio Du@@ ck &amp; D to take advantage of 3.@@ 8 m of the e@@ ars and to create a home that is not just an object of development , but a place where Jo@@ anne can live .
L@@ ia was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create half @-@ order , where one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to take a creative approach to the matter .
&quot; the design is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we needed to re@@ organise the premises so that they are located on each other without having to bo@@ w .
it was not just about building a platform , but about steel construction so that we can get the right balance between over@@ shooting and lower space . &quot;
this emphasis enabled Er@@ fan@@ o to create two full @-@ e@@ ars in space with a lot of dramatic elements .
from the R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us window to the b@@ read@@ th of mass housing under the sun , the answer to the old era is open .
the gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ spe@@ ct Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille lighting highlight space style .
the use of her@@ bs plays a role in adding communication , space and lighting .
the mir@@ rors have been added to both sides of the short corridor so that it looks longer .
in K@@ ong , the second win@@ dows with the mir@@ ror will give the impression .
at its introduction , a reflection on maintenance will be provided to all wal@@ ks of Jo@@ anne &apos;s feed and glass requirements .
the possibility of closing the portion of vegetables will be added to housing , if not used , by creating a more imag@@ in@@ ative space .
all @-@ round kit@@ chen is nothing new .
however , this kit@@ chen is a unique fact that it is a type of u@@ pris@@ ings of gar@@ den .
&quot; it was a little bit of a design effort , &quot; Er@@ fan will explain the spa@@ wn M@@ D@@ F .
&quot; it has a counter@@ weight , which is why it very simply mer@@ ges if it is to be pushed up . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne now has 16 additional metres , an additional s@@ lee@@ ping room and a better building plan .
after all , what you sell - or what gives value to property - is the flo@@ til@@ la flo@@ til@@ la , &apos; the word is Er@@ fan &apos; .
&quot; the anch@@ or is running out of date and makes calculations on the basis of the surface area . &quot;
here they have been able to increase can@@ na@@ bis , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to space .
&quot; the materials are the ones you are missing and thus help to create an emotional link with your homes , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ You do not love the electricity cable within the se@@ ams .
it is important but does not raise heart languages . &quot;
this shows that good design and an increased area of area help make something aston@@ ishing about the rather normal order .
in fact , they may even give rise to a desire not to leave , as happened with Jo@@ anne .
the main figure , Mrs Jen@@ sen , is the K@@ ic@@ ago cloud village in Ch@@ ic@@ ago , who is competing with her colleague for her profession@@ alism .
there is no read of money that is earned , but which is forgotten by all ethics .
a woman and three children only see a man in a st@@ oma@@ ch and late night .
in the first half of the film , I come from the idea that it is a business version of the &apos; Ka@@ ar@@ di@@ House &apos; - even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ing and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ ri &apos;s speech - it is similar .
however , what the film goes on , the less co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il element remains , and the mor@@ alising intention of the film @-@ makers is increasingly beginning to appear .
life @-@ changing experience will become a key player in cancer .
now a choice must be made between work and family life .
the de@@ pu@@ tising po@@ t makes the father think about the great buildings in the foot@@ steps in Ch@@ ic@@ ago about matters of real importance , such as religion , welfare , love ... , without even having to do with the disaster of the twin c@@ ables .
after the third village where the son opens his eyes , the feeling is that the film makers are certainly on the basis of the objective of getting audi@@ ences down is certainly not enough , because even the most ob@@ ses@@ sive specta@@ tor is unable to keep the te@@ ars back by seeing the suffering of a doctor &apos;s cancer .
if the son falls into the home and his situation seems to be almost hope@@ less , the father will finally understand the mor@@ ality of his work and will work for the old man who is looking for a good act .
now , in a sense , I am lu@@ mping myself - if a film has a technology , I will reward my specta@@ cle after a film &apos;s coff@@ ee , if I may be wrong , one can be commen@@ ded for at least one surprise .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that a residu@@ al coff@@ ee will be lost - when a hus@@ band calls a hospital to a doctor and a man dri@@ ves over a corridor .
the Po@@ e@@ g has , after all , been stran@@ g@@ ingly healthy , and although his father has just lost his job , it will prove to be positive , because it is now time to deal with the family .
I can be well known - I can already predict the end of the American dra@@ ma quite well !
in truth , the film is well structured , all the necessary elements are there .
there will be a Council , there can be a s@@ mile , the actor will be a good and moral beau@@ ty : money is not the most important thing in life .
that sur@@ prises the film well .
the new staff over@@ head of T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i intends to limit President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F@@ . Kelly will really do this .
in that case , he would be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff member of the White House intends to limit the flow of information reaching President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope that it will keep the upper balance in water .
here , there is a report from Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ i :
&quot; when the new staff member of the White House , John F@@ . Kelly , came together on his first day of work with high officials , he highlighted the key problem with President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ ges Ma@@ as , for which he intends to resolve the dis@@ information he intends to get into the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through him , whether on paper or at meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis makes perfect sense , but others have tried to do so and have failed to monitor his media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades and , even now that he is in White Ma@@ in , his TV watching habits have not gone away .
&quot; when the candidate , T@@ ru@@ mp , was ang@@ ry about unfair media coverage , showed him that he was also fairly reflected in the reports that he was affected , &quot; said S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , a former campaig@@ ner , S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , in February .
Poli@@ tic@@ o Pal@@ mer wrote at that time that &quot; according to six former campaig@@ ners , T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter is the key to managing habits by ensuring that her personal media consumption also contains a stable s@@ ong of praise . &quot;
a good thing .
however , the idea that T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter &apos;s habits have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps these campaig@@ ners know something that the rest of us do not know would have been even more hear@@ tening without these interventions .
we will probably never know about the ro@@ y@@ alties that were not broadcast by the T@@ ru@@ mp .
if he was able to save him a few times from his hi@@ jac@@ king , their efforts were worth it .
but no one has been able to prevent T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i from systematically causing controversy .
part of the problem is that , in Val@@ ges Ma@@ ks , who are competing with each other , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception by transferring material to the Olympic Games that supports their global views , but is not always credible .
political tic@@ o , which reflects the whole story &apos;s cul@@ mination , wrote in May the advis@@ ers &apos; tendency to feed the President with strategically questionable information .
one example described by the repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is as follows :
&quot; the current and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i are saying that the T@@ ru@@ mp can respond to a negative press , in particular , to the harmful effects of information le@@ af@@ lets , with an ob@@ ses@@ sive idea of identifying their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone happily gave a copy of the Internet provocation to the President , Charles C. The website of G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ telecom , which is part of Joh@@ n@@ son , accused of having a staff chief Deputy , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , of being a white house &apos; source of multiple information &apos; .
it does not matter that Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked or that he has not offered any specific evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them .
he has read the article and started to complain about Wales . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that at that time , the top of the staff staff at Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Head of the White House &apos;s office , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , have tried to establish a system for managing and documentation documents reaching T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Pri@@ eb@@ ent , but T@@ ru@@ mp is still an impul@@ se and his hel@@ ple@@ ss is still competing for influence .
these changing factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans coming from abroad will not be allowed to make a bitter speech .
there are many foreigners in the central city of Tallinn .
those with whom the le@@ af@@ let came to mind acknowledged that they played an old town without the permission of the urban government .
the first was to find three street mus@@ ici@@ ans close to the Vir@@ u gates , who had taken on with them just as much .
it was clear to see that the mus@@ ici@@ ans with r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms and broken ri@@ vals were the co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils to whom one du@@ š@@ š would be spending a mar@@ ry .
despite the violence , the only woman in the company played a ch@@ orus of a@@ cor@@ di@@ on@@ ry with r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , while one man , along with three pal@@ es in Hong K@@ ong and called the fur@@ th@@ ens closer .
the third man , alongside them , was sitting on one side of their feet and smoking a war@@ mest self @-@ prepared farm .
their three do@@ gs did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the passing people .
Bo@@ b , who has played with A@@ cor@@ di@@ oni , has said that he would be ang@@ ling the streets for both fu@@ n and money .
the purpose of the exhibition was to collect ticket charges on the same day of night for a ship travelling to Finland .
on the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for extremism , No@@ emi and Bo@@ b sha@@ tte@@ red their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never be in one town for more than a day or a few , and mostly for a month , we will be given permits or something like this .
there is no point paying for this , &apos; Mr Bo@@ b explained .
when we returned to the Vir@@ u gates about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are at mus@@ ici@@ ans and are driving them to go .
the exhibition , in ab@@ sen@@ tia and co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils , made good luck with the Vir@@ u Centre &apos;s cross .
there were also three Polish young men on the Vir@@ u street , one of whom played a fifth , another k@@ ni@@ fe , and the third had even transported electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people enter@@ tainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living , &quot; the tri@@ o from the pi@@ pe to M@@ iv@@ os@@ h explained .
according to M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there must be permission from the urban Government to speak .
&quot; of course we do not have it , &quot; he said in jo@@ ke .
but we hope that when people enjoy our music , there is no problem whatsoever .
of course , when the police come , we go elsewhere , but you have to try to do it , &apos; she added .
the Estonian bank purchased EUR 149 million of bonds under the public asset buying programme of the Central Bank in the euro area in July , with a bank bond portfolio increasing to € 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , has made it clear in the past that the asset buying plan of the central banks of the Euro@@ system includes three different purchase programmes : bonds covered by the financial sector ( SS@@ GI ) , early bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public bonds ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank will buy bonds on the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases reduces the productivity of low @-@ risk assets and encourages investors to take greater risks .
as a general rule , every central bank purchases its own national government bonds under the public bond shopping programme , other bonds are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank makes so @-@ called substitu@@ tion purchases within the amount allocated to them .
the central banks also shop in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian bank generally bu@@ ys the bonds of the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian bank will purchase bonds under the asset buying programme from March 2015 .
in the meantime , Ele@@ round bonds were also acquired , but in June 2016 the Estonian bank will no longer purchase bonds .
on behalf of the central banks of the euro area , both Ele@@ ring and Estonia are buying energy bonds from the Finnish Central Bank from June onwards .
migrants ignore their degrees and return to &apos; millions of business @-@ based &apos;
some of the most prosperous domestic owners of the West Mid@@ lands have once again entered into a fier@@ ce confrontation with firm , tough , hard @-@ pressed , who have ignored the c@@ lan@@ ded bureaucra@@ cies to win back from their cotton @-@ free fields .
migrants have improved their 20 tra@@ ilers on the streets of So@@ hat@@ ul@@ li , a prosperous &apos; millions of businesses &apos; line &apos; .
they have returned with the army of hor@@ ses , children and trucks , after they only came out there in May , without letting themselves be confused with the degree of bureaucracy that was complaining about to prevent their invasion by the Council .
the group found itself weak when it came to protection limits , turning its vehicles through un@@ blocked parts that were left to football .
the cle@@ r@@ gy people are passion for So@@ hat@@ ul@@ li coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors by saying that the Council is &apos; useless in dealing with the problem &apos; .
one anon@@ ymous person said : &apos; they moved there on Monday night after they were excluded from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ on , where they st@@ oned the fur@@ ni@@ tors .
the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors must be ashamed to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
migrants were there in May , they had to go there and they are now back .
they came back yesterday evening , probably more so today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors know how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect their par@@ ks .
I live on the street , and I am not happy that I must continue to pay the mandate to pay the total tax if the Council cannot even prevent this from happening . &quot;
a local resident who also wanted to remain anon@@ ymous said : &apos; that is ridiculous ; we have only seen the latter left the migrants , and we have already seen a new offensive .
this time the number has increased , and even the horse has been seen in the grass@@ land . &quot;
the representative of the So@@ hat@@ ul@@ li Council said : &apos; we are aware that there is an unacceptable camp shel@@ l in the country near the street route , and we are working with the So@@ hat@@ ul@@ li police ; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
the gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any kind of antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling for a figure 101 .
this will help create a picture of the situation for the Court when we present the case to them . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ ise F@@ esti@@ val will also visit the Minister for Culture In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , among others , who is pleased that it has been possible to bring real world top names to Estonia .
the question of why it is so important for the Est@@ oni@@ ans at the We@@ ek@@ ise F@@ esti@@ val that this should be asked by all those who enjoy the full front of the festi@@ val for three days .
however , he says that the real players in his area have come into being .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen we look at this level of artists that has been able to bring to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music gesture are being sent home - often not in our grasp &apos; , the culture of culture speaks .
however , which artists on the festi@@ val speak most about Sa@@ art himself ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person and , for the old people of some kind , one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ illi@@ re@@ n , who took up yesterday evening .
after all , according to his pos@@ ter@@ ary , all of us have complicated their own feet at some point . &quot;
however , he still points out a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ ş@@ i , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ ts .
of course , our own Estonian players too : starting with NO@@ TI@@ P , and they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , this concentration of well @-@ known names is very large , &quot; he says .

car manufacturers will be upgra@@ ded by up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of criticism
the day before the Au@@ di announcement , B@@ M@@ W said that it would offer a software coverage for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of B@@ M@@ W , the company believes that &apos; smarter options exist than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the town of B@@ M@@ W , Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that three million plastic vehicles would be upgra@@ ded to reduce diesel engines in Europe .
no company described these operations as a retro@@ gra@@ de call .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide em@@ itted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , the cost of the equipment installed to neutr@@ alise emissions from diesel vehicles will increase for the automotive industry , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of calling on powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs referring to the problem .
companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , who remained silent about the use of so @-@ called &quot; fraudulent devices , &quot; which made it possible to adapt the model of exha@@ ust gases to regulations when testing a car , but which were withdrawn under normal driving conditions .
several leaders of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen have been charged in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic investigation .
last month , a former president of the Au@@ di engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
the former President , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Au@@ di , Germany , was drawn into a criminal investigation into Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , when the authorities accused of instal@@ ling the discharge system in order to circum@@ vent the requirements for European emissions of gas , thereby extending the investigation previously focused on the United States .
the involvement of the author in the investigation may be a great blow to Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen &apos;s manufacturer of the transmission luxury cars , which disproportionately attra@@ cts the profits of a large proportion of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen .
schools in Estonia are acquiring EU flags of EUR 20 000 .
the Ministry of Education intends to purchase European Union flags to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency .
in total , 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 c@@ enti@@ metres of the European Union &apos;s flag is 5@@ 70 education institutions .
Li@@ ps are intended to be used in in@@ door spaces ; they must also be carried out in high @-@ quality printed technology with a record assurance , and the ER@@ R news portal is being bro@@ ke@@ red .
on the flag label , the text reads : &apos; the confirmation of Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union of Estonia .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags is EUR 20 000 per Ministry of Education , or one flag costs EUR 35 .
murder of the journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
N@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the State of the Blue permit , which is so@@ aring by organised crime , corrupt officials and relen@@ tless drug wars .
but today , under the gu@@ ise of a personal tragedy , they have gathered to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their rou@@ tine .
two older wri@@ ters will discuss which they feel safer : either to bring children to a office that was targeted at a grant attack in 2009 or to leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the will of the space at the forefront : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutral &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking the repor@@ ters to offer their names to every water , they do not need any evidence of technology , they are enough to listen and to their internal feeling .
in the presence of government or car@@ tels , drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists are suspected of being on board , a whole list of bo@@ gus people who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
there are no b@@ reat@@ h of violence , and the more dead bodies across the country accumu@@ late , the majority of them are journalists from the Committee on the Protection of journalists , according to information from the Committee on the Protection of Telecoms journalists , since the resigna@@ tion of President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena BON@@ to , in December 2012 , of at least 25 ; 5@@ 89 journalists , after the attacks and threats to national protection , are still killed in at least seven countries .
the latest deaths include their edit@@ or and source of inspiration , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as , co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books on drug violence .
his absence makes a deep sense , even though his presence can be perceived throughout the fa@@ ti@@ gue of the MO@@ Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building , a large picture of the average lies in the Val@@ de@@ z@@ ia with the letter of &apos; justice &apos; and &apos; justice &apos; and the two 30@@ n@@ ine@@ e repor@@ ters , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , bear the T @-@ shir@@ t , which has been portra@@ yed with his s@@ na@@ ked private pri@@ cks or the ama@@ oil bar@@ t he ow@@ ns .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death , and the Re@@ por@@ ters will discuss common trau@@ mas , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , their dre@@ ams , their correction .
although a separate public prosecution service was set up in 2010 to deal with cases of journalists , only two cases have been brought before the Committee on the Protection of journalists .
like most annual drug trafficking and organised crime @-@ related murders , which amount to thousands , journalists &apos; kil@@ lers rarely come to justice .
the effects of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce continue to reflect the violence in the Y@@ al@@ o , even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without murde@@ rers &apos; data and justice , the meeting on security , Mrs I@@ bar@@ ra , said , will not be of much use .
&apos;@@ It is very nice to waste his time at this meeting &apos; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , you dis@@ trust everyone . &quot;
Val@@ dez left the National Capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an from the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office on 15 May morning .
he has only succeeded in travelling a few quarters before two men stopped the roles of the Red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ aver@@ la : he was forced to withdraw from the car and was fired 12 times , probably because of the language of the newspaper , which means &apos; twelve rivers &apos; in translation .
an armed man went to the car in Val@@ de@@ z and made an accident near it .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adults .
the flood is spreading freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
however , on the Val@@ dez issue , there is basically only silence .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition to the United States of America in January , the Blue authorisation has been one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country , as ri@@ val ch@@ lor@@ ds are fighting for the implementation of the power vacuum .
it does not matter that , every day , a person or even several people are being shot down on the streets of a blue permit or that the dead are so@@ aring from the double @-@ dream swe@@ ets of drug festi@@ vals , which are larger than many homes living .
let us forget for a moment that the time for peace indicates how valuable ports and the maritime state with drug routes to the United States are led by only one car@@ tel .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , the co @-@ foun@@ der and President of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , Is@@ May Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , is feeling the enormous sense of inno@@ c@@ ence that he was unable to defend his friend .
he believes that the killing process was encouraged by two mistakes .
the first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s son and a bar@@ rel of car@@ tel on a war @-@ ri@@ g shel@@ f shel@@ f .
this piece of correspon@@ dence could also be allu@@ ded to by the gan@@ g@@ sters who are suspected of being f@@ itted up , all cop@@ ies of the publication bought off as soon as they ended up in historical bat@@ teries .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security after the crackdown took place in another piece of newspapers reflecting the same story .
Val@@ dez was leg@@ end both in Mexico and abroad , and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had survi@@ ved for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to be permanently present .
in 2003 , he worked as a ve@@ ter@@ piece report at No@@ ro@@ ise when he joined five colleagues to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling up to USD 50 .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said that &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without the problems of drugs &apos; .
the newspaper took a long time to feel with its courageous and honest reports , and sales and advertising increased .
the Portuguese liked to express their vigorous research without the fear of censorship and reading read@@ ers in a newspaper that they were able to read stories that no one else da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after the launch of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspapers won the pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot Prize for their Latin American reports .
in the same year , Val@@ dez &apos;s Committee on the Protection of journalists ( AK@@ K ) won the International Press Freedom Prize for its courage to follow the Mexic@@ an drug story wherever it leads .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&apos;@@ I want to live on , &apos; he said by accepting the AK@@ K Prize .
last October , he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV that drug trafficking was a way of life in Y@@ al@@ o@@ a .
&quot; your head will face up to the challenge that the journalist &apos;s office will have to play in the second place .
I do not want me to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not talk about what is happening . &quot;
the group of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce lon@@ gs for Val@@ de@@ z , a jo@@ ke who was like a jo@@ ke , a friend who kind@@ ly shared embry@@ os and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they supported her rou@@ tine .
he always gave his oil bar@@ rel .
he went from the office to El pole@@ y@@ ab@@ o bar and was always sitting on the same table .
now they are asking whether his rou@@ tine love was fatal to him .
his death has also questioned them about how best to do his job and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity of their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing pla@@ tes used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not be touched , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
even in the best times , the result will be strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination .
trust in your in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
when it comes to suspi@@ ci@@ ously , the hotel is thrown away .
according to the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ rez , the problem is that &apos; the fra@@ gran@@ ces can be dece@@ ived ... and so it was the case with J@@ iel@@ eri &apos; .
he and others say that the old rules no longer apply in the Y@@ al@@ o , just as they do not apply in the Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ sis , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ iro or in other states that are home to the toxic combination of profitable smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the spectrum is constantly changing .
in the space where Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only a but@@ ton sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
two poli@@ ce@@ men came to the house under the gu@@ ise of a t@@ ree of 40 degrees .
they were appointed by the government by the Office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , which is located in the centre @-@ class neighbourhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , on Thursday &apos;s building .
some of the repor@@ ters won@@ dered half @-@ jo@@ king whether these police officers were among the 50 % of the police , whose head of the head has himself dra@@ gged un@@ reliable .
several months have passed since repor@@ ters have moved to mountain areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gan@@ gs .
the publication this week by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce dealt with three main ideals .
one of them was the murder of former po@@ x@@ ist Ju@@ li@@ o Chan@@ ar Cha@@ vez ven@@ na in Y@@ al@@ o .
in addition , they had a reve@@ aling story of spending government funds on the home town of the Governor .
and one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants outside the office of the public Prosecutor , Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , was kidna@@ pped by a group of people .
there was no official announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how this happened , so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows about as being a fer@@ vent place both for drug traffickers and for public authorities .
the theat@@ re learned from public documents that a restaur@@ ant was registered as a politician belonging to the ruling Institu@@ tional Party for the Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of politics for almost the last century .
recently , several IR@@ P Governor has been accused of widespread coverage of cases of corruption .
in Vil@@ lar@@ li , the repor@@ ter asked to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Gu@@ z@@ man , who is we@@ aring the name El Chap@@ o , esca@@ ped a military record .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have been looking to Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il to get information on kidna@@ pping from the best sources .
&quot; in the past , we would have already known what happened , &quot; said a 46 @-@ year @-@ old Vil@@ lar@@ li , whose cle@@ ver body construction has earned him a sh@@ ou@@ ting name , El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all communication channels have broken with our sources . &quot;
the office of Val@@ de@@ z has become a safe place for bridges and stic@@ kers that protest against the killing of journalists , and the edit@@ orial workers have become something they could never expect in the name of the press .
the Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez took a few eyes and went to the local public Prosecutor &apos;s c@@ abinet next morning for another demonstration of a journalist .
Mr Salvador A@@ me disappeared in the Western State of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an three days after the killing of Val@@ dez .
it has been bur@@ nt down to death and , according to officials , it is based on DNA tests .
journalists have become more vo@@ cal all over the country and underline the word &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; as an organised protest .
on this day , the President , Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , is in Washington , trying to gather international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
the day after the death of Val@@ de@@ z in meetings with the Governor of the Blue authorisation , Ra@@ mi@@ rez &apos;s authorities accused journalists of be@@ ating and killing them because of telling the truth .
after that , he asked that he be diver@@ ted from the government &apos;s activities elsewhere , while he was concerned that he had been affected by his objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , by co @-@ guilty state officials and by an indifferent society .
in his latest book &apos; the drug press &apos; , he wrote that researchers are not only killed by drug gan@@ gs , but also by politicians and security forces , who are at the mer@@ cy of organised crime .
last year , the media monitoring group Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 gave more than half of the attacks on the police and public officials .
&quot; in Mexico , you will keep quiet , &quot; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
the delicate effects are obviously bloody .
no one will forget the death of the blo@@ gg@@ er , Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as , in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ k six years ago .
his body was found together with a letter that was probably written by the car@@ tel L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
in addition to the head of his swe@@ at , the computer glass and the de@@ ser@@ t were le@@ ak@@ ed .
some of the publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , the northern border state of El Nor@@ te , following the killing of their correspon@@ dent , Dag@@ sla@@ va B@@ illi@@ h , in March .
others will pass on as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do did after the murder of their president in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z spoke publicly about the front line &apos; What do you want of us ? &apos; .
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
this is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
it is difficult to find a job in exile and they still need to be on the streets in order to avoid risks .
and sometimes they are driven , as was probably the case with the photo@@ graphic Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who , together with four women , was murdered at one of the cor@@ ps in Mexico in 2015 , three months after Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z was hi@@ jac@@ ked .
those who remain at a stand@@ still and continue to work must be tan@@ g@@ led around risky decisions every day .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to become a po@@ et , ad@@ mits that a reflection of the drug business frigh@@ tens her .
&quot; Mexico is on the road to hell and that is why I am going to be repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
at one of the most recent Friday mid@@ night , when the latest number had already passed its b@@ reat@@ h , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce edit@@ orial in front of the office and loo@@ ted the be@@ er of how suddenly all phones were to be cal@@ ib@@ rated .
19 people were killed in fire @-@ fighting between ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces in the R@@ and@@ uro@@ r@@ ra town of Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ i , according to confirmed data .
the war continued to es@@ cor@@ t , as did a number of messages from car@@ tels found in the region .
on the back of the same hard line , repor@@ ters ordered the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website using a mobile phone .
a change was needed in the front of next day .
the safety risks were over@@ stret@@ ched in the area of energy security .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez &apos;s pa@@ thetic police to see if they are vigilant .
when they fea@@ red , they did not at least show this .
the workers of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , under the mass t@@ ree of a de@@ scen@@ ded foun@@ der of the newspaper , which has his average finger on the whole of the Y@@ al@@ o@@ de@@ my , were carried out by the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers in his foot@@ steps .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w can one think of closing down at all , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; when on the same day that Javier Solana was killed , the tra@@ ine@@ e asked me to be able to report back to the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa used protection col@@ ours to prevent enemies
at first sight , it seems like a form , albeit quite frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now made public the first findings regarding the incredible intr@@ usion of the numbers discovered by a Canadian min@@ ster , which has so well preserved that the experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lis@@ at , &quot; a of a &apos;s sur@@ ger@@ y .
it has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that a lea@@ ther covered by his soya was the colour of a red box Brown and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the current Bi@@ ology report published in the magaz@@ ine described the present present present status as &apos; the best preserved so@@ om@@ al@@ y test ever &apos; and &apos; one of the best northern parts of the world &apos; .
in the case of coal , it is a new type of no@@ do@@ sa@@ he@@ x@@ us that was living in the middle of the cri@@ es era , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
its un@@ beli@@ eva@@ bly good survival was ra@@ ped by a theat@@ re who describes it as &apos; truly significant &apos; .
this her@@ bal feed covered by soya has best preserved the type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus that has ever been found , according to National Ge@@ o@@ news .
on 21 March 2011 , it was found in Sha@@ wn &apos;s fun@@ k when he extra@@ cted a Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine in For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
he has suffered something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into it .
the identified ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus was sent to the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um .
the next six years were designed to withdraw the animal from 2 500 p@@ ounds ( 1@@ 100 kilometres ) .
after all this hard work , the end result is now finally ready to bring the public to the fore .
&apos;@@ I@@ e@@ b Brown , a scien@@ tist Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell M@@ use@@ um , said he would almost believe that he is s@@ lee@@ ping , &apos; said the leading author , Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , said , in a muse@@ um of the Ro@@ yal Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell , where being mis@@ ti@@ red .
&quot; this will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved gar@@ den components , Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &quot;
when he studied sk@@ in , he found that this animal feed , although covered by soya and re@@ minis@@ cent of a hard tan@@ k , was likely to pose a significant threat to the food needs of meat .
this multi@@ tude of so@@ ws used red and white defence col@@ ours to hide themselves from pre@@ da@@ tors and applied shel@@ tering techniques , which are called &apos; responsible &apos; and are also used by many today &apos;s animals .
this enabled experts , as they say , to enter the north @-@ east better and to avoid enemies , because they were likely to be struck by the major pressures on the north .
this presence of the 110 million old @-@ year @-@ old family of no@@ co@@ sa@@ ic sur@@ ger@@ y for the first time reached news in May and is now being visited by the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rel@@ li Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um .
researchers have now studied and given it the name to Boeing as a Mar@@ mit@@ let@@ l muse@@ um , mark Mitchell , a famous team that spent more than 7@@ 000 hours making it difficult to reveal .
thanks to the ama@@ zing maintenance of the father , Dr Mitchell and the International Re@@ search@@ ers &apos; team were able to record the shape and size of so@@ ws .
they found a &apos; no &apos; approach - a defen@@ sive method in animal origin , which means that the pro@@ cla@@ mation of being was a me@@ tre as a lower .
although the over@@ shadow is widespread , the bread comes as a surprise , because Boeing is much greater than the animals today living under a &apos; no &apos; shadow .
this suggests that the North P@@ ole was sufficiently actively hun@@ ted by other animal feed sur@@ prises , that the evolution preferred to be over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed instead of being opposed to the survival ta@@ ctic .
however , the majority of animals used today to escape from ca@@ tering - such as fears , pigs or doctors - are much smaller and more vulnerable as a crop , which suggests that no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ se had to make a real effort to survive .
&quot; a robust g@@ rub@@ bing @-@ up of the col@@ ours covered by huge and large numbers of so@@ ws shows how dangerous the pre@@ da@@ tory animals could be , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds of So@@ om@@ ers also revealed that the sp@@ in of the north was a red c@@ at .
scientists will continue to carry out an investigation to obtain ra@@ inf@@ all about its life , including the st@@ olen content of this salt style , in order to find out what the animal is going to do for its last spring .
they believe that the north @-@ east fell into the dead rivers , thereby entering the sea , where it came to the bottom of the ocean .
at that time , Alber@@ tas was as warm as it was at the moment in South Kivu , and rivers and oceans were likely to spread much further to the internal land than they are today .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ se is truly significant because he has been fully covered with a so@@ om@@ ic sk@@ in , but he has remained three @-@ dimensional , while preserving the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , today , the animal looks almost the same as in the era of cri@@ es .
in order to recon@@ stru@@ ct it , there is not much imagination to be used - it is enough simply to ti@@ p our eyes and it seems that he seems to be s@@ lee@@ ping . &quot;
the time of the crisis was when enormous two foot @-@ and @-@ mouth mus@@ cul@@ pri@@ ts - he@@ tero@@ gene@@ ous shops - were bur@@ nt into the land .
although all of them , King Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x , many millions of years later than Boeing , it could have been s@@ tun@@ ned by a g@@ igan@@ tic din@@ n@@ ant pressure from some of his for@@ mi@@ dable predecess@@ ors .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ ot@@ he@@ us , 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) long and six tonnes of mon@@ ster .
the scientists whose recent findings have been published in the current Bi@@ ology magaz@@ ine believe that Bo@@ real@@ l@@ ta was s@@ tun@@ ned after death in the sea and this mu@@ tation .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn &apos;s operation discovered when he extra@@ cted For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near the Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mining in Northern Alber@@ tas , Canada .
according to the muse@@ um , it is the best preserved so@@ om@@ al@@ y in the world , including sk@@ in and soya , and it is a complete concentration up to a bot@@ tom@@ less .
these assumptions were on average 18 foot ( five metres ) long and were at up to GBP 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .
two 20 customs @-@ long Pand@@ ora came out of it .
scientists believe that this man of flora and fauna covered by soya was se@@ aring through the current Western Canada until the floo@@ ded river was sa@@ iled into its offshore sea .
however , the seab@@ ed of bottom @-@ up marine bu@@ ried helped to maintain its Fin@@ ns in an excellent way .
the polar bears of this particular father coal have been so well preserved that the head@@ lines of my@@ ste@@ rious soya pla@@ tes are still covered by sk@@ in residues .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote in the National Ge@@ o@@ sanitary Journal : &apos; such a retention is as rare as a l@@ ot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
the residu@@ als of bur@@ ned sk@@ in continue to cover the creation of my@@ ste@@ rious soya pla@@ tes located in the y@@ el@@ low .
the better front line lies with him and the five early ones have been dra@@ gged up .
I will be able to read the so@@ y@@ ages at his farm . &quot;
how did one act answer the question of &apos; W@@ ho thanks ? &apos; ?
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferreira received complete shock .
just one day after New York &apos;s travel , it was a father of St@@ . Lou@@ kas who , through Airbus , was ren@@ ted on a do@@ or@@ step , on Facebook on the phone .
he came to the post of his former school com@@ patri@@ ot .
it says : &apos; the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old young people and they are still on the streets &apos; .
he was confused why no one else had posted this information on his stream , so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
P@@ ide@@ ga @ The@@ e@@ P@@ sha@@ ah &apos;s user &apos;s postal services were repeatedly distributed on her timetable .
in real time , Mr Brok , an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black young man , killed by a white police officer in Fer@@ gus@@ on Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is , was transferred from the region of St@@ . Lou@@ ise .
he gave a picture of the life of Bro@@ w@@ n &apos;s body , which was on the streets , remaining there for four hours .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is cra@@ zy , &apos; Mr Ferreira thought out addi@@ tions .
but death was not new for him or for the community .
he put his phone off , but saw a re@@ ar @-@ up later this evening , which announced this time that people had gathered in Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
J@@ ag@@ at photo@@ graph@@ s of police and sh@@ ell@@ fish people and a man who claimed himself to be the father of Bro@@ w@@ n and kept the label &apos; the Fer@@ gus@@ on police killed my un@@ armed son &apos; .
he watched a real @-@ time stream in which a police officer stood before a group of prote@@ sters with a be@@ ating dog .
in the second video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
the Fer@@ rell is reminded of how he struck himself from the point of view : &apos; that is unusual &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is not a murder of this kind that we are used to and which we could call typical &apos; .
I felt frigh@@ tened at that point .
I was ang@@ ry and I was c@@ rying . &quot;
he boo@@ ked a return flight and travelled home the next day .
having swe@@ pt at 23 o &apos;@@ clock , he went to his father for his six @-@ year @-@ old da@@ u@@ ghter and decided that they would be travelling next morning to a two @-@ whe@@ el Fer@@ gus@@ oni .
what happened to Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ gus@@ on next three years will be the central theme of a new docu@@ mentary entitled &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; ( &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; ) , which will be presented in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who took the streets to demand answers .
when , with a da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a flow@@ er bro@@ ker and a fine ch@@ at it - they once again talked to Fer@@ gus@@ on , they talked about a subject that they had repeatedly been talking about before this morning - black experience and living conditions .
&apos;@@ D@@ o you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; it will remind itself to ask itself .
&quot; we are currently travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ on because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on board , &quot; said Ferreira later .
&quot; what is happening now is the cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and grow in the middle of it .
he has to learn about the organisation and organisation of a activist and , at the same time , the different la@@ yers of black experience and living conditions , and what we need to do to be free and free .
even if I manage to grow him in such a way that he does not co@@ exist personally with brutal racism , he does not differenti@@ ate from another black girl .
I feel I would do her a dis@@ service if I were to protect him from this world . &quot;
the first halt they made when they came to Fer@@ gus@@ on was South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ ti - from the police station to the ground - which had become a kind of camp pla@@ te , where activists were waiting for news about the police officer , Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was ultimately not charged .
there , Mrs Ferreira and her da@@ u@@ ghter joined forces with a local business@@ man who produced lunch .
they brought together food bags and helped to share them with prote@@ sters .
a new type of activist slowly started to take shape for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; said , when he was a student at the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . University of Lou@@ y , he was President of the Alliance of Re@@ search@@ ers and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organisation .
that is simply la@@ isse@@ z @-@ fa@@ ire . &quot;
a week later , a film co @-@ author , Sab@@ a@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ ana , met during a March demonstration .
Mr Fo@@ lay@@ an said that he and the film operator , Mr Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , simply wanted to document what is going on .
a question came to mind from Fer@@ rel@@ li : &apos; are you trying to document what is going on or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
this scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to profit from its vigilance and resilience .
Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born in Fer@@ gus@@ on was not listened to and growing , and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Fo@@ lay@@ an had already taken its hands with D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ on , an ar@@ tist in the region who was known for a activist in relation to sentenced prisoners .
his involvement made the project attractive for Fer@@ rell and six other local communities , who were watched for years after the &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; team , following the shooting of Bro@@ w@@ n .
&quot; in this docu@@ mentary , nobody speaks for us and we are talking about ourselves , &quot; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; it was important to me how these people are portra@@ yed , because that is how I am portra@@ yed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rell - the intention was to show that the movement is not about &apos; the head of the organ , but about bringing the community together &apos; , as Mr Fo@@ lay@@ an said - he made his film the most open player .
as a result , &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of the lives of Fer@@ rell , such as can@@ ing and marriage with his wife , are documented .
&quot; I felt as if I had always done so , &quot; said Ferreira , s@@ mil@@ ing over the first time he saw a complete copy of the city .
&quot; however , I realised that this work and the human dignity of black people must be accompanied by a certain degree of vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the Fer@@ rel@@ li story emphasises and puts the role of a black homo@@ sexual woman at the centre of the wider Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three initi@@ ators who thought about the killing of a black teen@@ ag@@ er Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in the social media in 2012 , following the killing of a black teen@@ ag@@ er , are homosexu@@ als .
&quot; in a leading role , black homo@@ sexual women have kept the movement generally high , &quot; said Ferreira , &quot; and this is precisely because we must constantly fight on a number of fronts .
Roma homo@@ sexual women have to bear all this burden . &quot;
Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed to state that &apos; H@@ on@@ ourable women do indeed keep their lives alive and many of them are black homo@@ sexual women &apos; .
at the same time , he claims that &apos; this is not a kind of equ@@ alisation of opportunities &apos; - Fer@@ rell was not chosen as the centre of the film because of his identity .
&quot; he was a person who took the right energy in the evening , &quot; he said .
&quot; however , this is not a coincidence that he was directly placed on the front line , because a black homo@@ sexual woman is much at stake in living in such addi@@ cts .
his energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , news camer@@ as Fer@@ gus@@ on have long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the conditional penalty imposed on Fer@@ rell during the demonstration for road liberalisation will continue for 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in a region he calls home simply as a &apos; huge threat of freedom &apos; .
nevertheless , it still attaches importance to the man@@ tra it has been eating since the time when it went to the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing but our chains to lose . &quot;
7 pic@@ tures of how to overcome We@@ ek@@ ise du po@@ k@@ bo@@ t
some of the war@@ mer me@@ als find aid after a scarce pi@@ pe , even though they are suffering from it .
or on the basis of the saying &apos; B@@ un@@ t bo@@ dy@@ t , py@@ ra@@ mid &apos; .
however , this is just an unavoidable postponement and a proper ble@@ s@@ sing for health .
what can you do to make yourself felt better this morning and to get through the bo@@ y as pain@@ fully as possible after today and tomorrow &apos;s We@@ ek@@ ise tr@@ all - or whatever else - as pain@@ fully as possible ?
Jo@@ o Water
under the coff@@ ee , after a lot of car@@ goes in the morning ... or even , if possible , instead of alcohol .
as a body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it has to be withdrawn in some way .
along with water , miner@@ als are also being thrown out of the body and se@@ ine is a good ha@@ ir of mineral water .
as the soil is often irri@@ tated after the slu@@ dge , it is particularly good that it is free of soil or easy to find itself .
let us walk .
certainly , it would not be worth turning to the grand@@ mother with a bo@@ gus ta@@ g - that might prove to be a fatal wrong decision .
but an easy foot@@ steps will help the body to recall once again what it is like to be alive .
S@@ lee@@ ping in T@@ el@@ g and s@@ lee@@ ping is a more demanding way of getting healthy .
give us energy back to the body slowly and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are already going to be over@@ drinking yesterday , it is certainly not worth trying to charge a heavy fat fat .
to begin with , for example , a ref@@ res@@ h@@ ment containing fruit crops that are qui@@ et@@ ly re@@ aring their body .
if the health of the South is already suffering , one could try the w@@ et , for example .
and a little later on , it was clear .
the coff@@ ee was removed .
this di@@ u@@ ten@@ um exemp@@ ts her from the last water in the body .
as has already been said , water and volume have your friends .
contribute to pain@@ kil@@ lers .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler last night to prevent po@@ k@@ bo@@ t , you have to deal not only with alcohol , but also with a per@@ fu@@ me or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ ph@@ et , and thus lose strength .
so the ri@@ vals pay even more and , in the future , boys will be worse off .
in addition , the pain will not remain entirely in the coff@@ ers anyway for a long time .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler this morning , you will do it with a empty th@@ read - it irri@@ ta@@ tes your already tor@@ n .
or if you do not have a partner , you cannot get through ourselves well .
it affects around the same way as wal@@ king , but by wal@@ king it , it will not be more expensive .
however , too active a pace and a sta@@ ggering half - a physical effort should be moderate at a time of po@@ k@@ bo@@ t .
the road is a jo@@ ke .
talk to friends of the time about their fellow suff@@ e@@ rers , easy fu@@ tures and a woman @-@ friendly approach to the suffering of himself and others ( ) .
the Naz@@ is and the woman may not be pul@@ ling off the po@@ t , but they certainly have the effect that they have come to terms with more len@@ i@@ ency .
once the shop goes over anyway !
North@@ w@@ ester@@ n professor and staff at Ox@@ ford University are being sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , the profes@@ sors of the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and the staff of Ox@@ ford University are being sought nation@@ ally , who have become suspects of having to find the body of the male people killed by death from one of Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s luxury bas@@ ins , after death .
according to judicial documents in the coun@@ ty of C@@ oo@@ k , on Monday , un@@ authorised arrests were issued for 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i , accused of being arrested because of their alleged involvement in T@@ ren@@ ton H. Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ é@@ u .
according to the documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ é@@ u died after repeated smoking .
according to the warning that the Ch@@ ic@@ ago police station issued to the community , the body was discovered on 27 July .
police officers received telephone calls and found a victim at the arrival of the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house , whose body had several stor@@ ming programmes .
according to officials , the Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ é@@ u event was recognised to death and investi@@ g@@ ators consider hunting to be murder , while the police are actively seeking two suspects .
La@@ cia has been working as co @-@ profes@@ sors of micro@@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at North@@ w@@ ester@@ n University since 2007 .
Mr K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations , said in a statement sent as an e @-@ mail that La@@ cia has now been temporarily removed from the workplace and has been banned from entering urban areas of the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter to be investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ w@@ ester@@ n University cooper@@ ates with researchers , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ arrested is a senior assis@@ tant in the finance department of Ox@@ ford University .
the representative of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and are ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible &apos; .
in addition , the statement stated that the War@@ ren@@ i colleagues were shocked and that they wanted to be ex@@ tradi@@ ted .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , President of Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s communication department , urges the authorities to be brought to justice on grounds of suspicion .
&quot; the police have an idea of where they are , but we are increasingly busy in defining the exact location , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , suspects can be sought by local , regional and national authorities .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a telephone call from the grey house of the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house , who had just received a cru@@ ci@@ fix that something has happened at cor@@ ps No 10@@ 08 .
according to the police , this was a ma@@ gic view .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July .
he said that the security camer@@ as confirmed the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ ka and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the Grand Pla@@ za leadership sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police are currently working on finding the cru@@ ology of events and the background of the victim , and are examining various mo@@ tives , including the possibility that this was a family dispute &apos; .

A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers at his start @-@ up company in e @-@ commerce , but the polls were un@@ profitable .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust this process .
&apos;@@ The system was simply not consistent and objective , &apos; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is leading an e @-@ commerce company Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , which sel@@ co@@ s , with 75 employees , in San Franc@@ is@@ co .
so he called for assistance from outside .
start @-@ ups dealing with new types of human resources are starting to help businesses find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licen@@ sing software that aims to measure the involvement of workers , they will enable companies to conduct direct surveys , to target specific teams and demographic groups , to offer workers anon@@ y@@ mity and a hot line of complaints and , in some cases , to allow manufacturers to move from C @-@ level management and to go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; now there are tools like Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ bps for monitoring health , but where is F@@ it@@ bps for your company ? &quot; asked Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O Reding , G@@ lin@@ t City company , whose software analytical tool is used by companies to measure the inclusion of workers ?
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , for three years when he has used G@@ lin@@ ti , he has received a much better picture of what his workers think and feel .
in addition to inter@@ views on intervention and specific teams , this company &apos;s heat card provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , enabling them to identify the causes .
companies have started to realise that they need to stay informed about their working culture so as not to change to the next U@@ b@@ hur , which has been emb@@ ed with scandals since the former worker published a blo@@ gg@@ ling , describing the har@@ ming environment , where those who da@@ red to speak were punished .
there is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business opportunity for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t .
the global area of governance , regulation and compatibility can be worth more than USD 118@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the financial statistics website L@@ et 2020 .
this year , in the face of the dubious reputation of U@@ b@@ erian , the head @-@ in @-@ Office of Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o observed an increase in interest and activity .
the VIS has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
the U@@ ber recently registered himself as a customer .
like G@@ lin@@ gi , the N@@ HS allows 100 companies to send adjusted impul@@ ses , collect real @-@ time confidential answers and look at the problem areas of heat cards .
it also offers an anon@@ ymous message that enables workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive manager , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has been delivered by regulatory authorities , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , foun@@ der and CE@@ O of the Code .
I Q@@ in@@ lan said that if a company were found to mis@@ treat its employees or behave une@@ th@@ ically , the company could face serious consequences , such as consumers &apos; boycott , the departure of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by Satellite , restaur@@ ants with more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of activity , has used the CS@@ S for more than a year to ensure worker &apos;s awareness of rules and procedures and to provide a simple way of communicating with the company headquarters .
when a worker wanted to report a problem earlier , he had to find a company headquarters or an email address , submit a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously .
this was often a discoura@@ ging and un@@ comfortable process , Mr Vit@@ ran@@ o , the general advis@@ er , said that there was no good way of monitoring workers &apos; complaints .
however , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices , which did not previously reach leaders who acted in other contexts in other cities or states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I can get closer to the holistic 3@@ 60 degree experience of workers , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who is leading the Ru@@ by Satellite risk Management Group .
&quot; and we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and worker involvement much more seriously in 2002 , following the failure of the audit@@ or , Ar@@ th@@ ur Andersson , because of ethical irregularities in the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when &apos; the social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they cannot prevent their black was@@ hing from openly hiding online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and UM@@ cent offer their software as a service , with companies receiving perio@@ dic fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors , who have supported both start @-@ ups .
CER@@ cen@@ ti financed USD 10 million in February by companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and the then Capital , thereby increasing the capital collected to USD 47 million .
the G@@ lin@@ ti invested USD 10 million in November in the B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ice partners , increasing total company funding to USD 60 million .
this investment will not come as a surprise , given the inter@@ connectivity between businesses , culture and venture capital .
more and more studies show that today &apos;s workers are waiting for more than before .
in more competitive markets , such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are merely on the table .
the workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy about the company , they feel they are listened to and that the work they are doing is more satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President of the Department for General profit and the experience of workers , L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , who uses both the CER@@ cen@@ t and the G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors earn their income when companies belonging to their portfolio do well ; companies are doing well when workers are committed and involved .
if analytical tools from the third party allow for an increase in the commitment and involvement of workers , it is no wonder that they will receive support .
data on the involvement of workers is important , according to experts in professional culture .
however , these data will be useless if the company &apos;s supervisors do not do anything with them .
in fact , if a company asks for feedback from its employees , it can raise expectations of change .
and if the changes do not take place quickly or at all , this may cause disappointment and a reduction in workers &apos; involvement .
&quot; when you ask for 4 000 proposals , you must be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; said President K@@ ot@@ ter International of the Con@@ sul@@ tative and Business Administration , R@@ us@@ tle@@ Ra@@ ath , who has seen how companies are making a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&quot; because if things do not end up , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &quot;
according to Er@@ ret@@ t , the Netherlands , which now organis@@ es six studies among workers , has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through G@@ lin@@ ti .
and after receiving feedback from workers who were disappointed with the speed and quality of communication of decisions , she was able to restructure a number of teams in the company and provide communication training to address the problems .
however , it will collect new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , this will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment of workers to an industry known for its high labour flows .
&quot; if you are not committed to transparency , you will lose people , &quot; Vit@@ ran@@ o said .
&apos;@@ and if you lose people , you will lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
the euro area remains the Baltic Sea : incomes grow rapidly
although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic Sea , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , B@@ ol@@ berg is writing a report from the European Central Bank with reference to the report .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
there is a low debt burden for success , and fast @-@ track institutions and business and free market @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , along with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where the population of the reactor &apos;s per capita GDP is well approaching the EU average , &quot; announced the Central Bank .
although the aim is for the total economic output per capita to be equal to a richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies accounted for only 2 / 3 of the average 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement .
low wages have led the Bal@@ tics to look for better wages abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local people are not enthusiastic at all .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies were doing very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , this was considered by little less than half of those surve@@ yed about the economies of their countries .
N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel trends twice a day will change Bru@@ in@@ si &apos;s long days
there are almost 23 o &apos;@@ clock , when the thro@@ p@@ host , U@@ C@@ L@@ A , comes to talk at the end of a new ha@@ bit in a team city .
some of them have put their backs on the back door , reve@@ aling the efforts of their training camp for the first day in a single day .
for a large part of the team , they offer minutes of strength from mid@@ day to day .
after a three @-@ hour trend , the players involved in the course of their courses are going to learn to learn from the end of their lives before returning next morning to 6.@@ 30 a.m. for meetings in W@@ ood@@ man &apos;s football es@@ c@@ ala@@ mity .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said the Bru@@ in@@ si Man@@ or , Jim Mor@@ a , a little earlier than Monday became Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel trends twice a day to reduce the burden of players has in fact changed their days longer - at least until the end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ day extra@@ ctions to one side on Friday .
for this reason , the first three training courses of U@@ C@@ L@@ A were ti@@ med to start at 19.@@ 15 in order to fit into the already close schedule of players .
the transition from two strikes per day means more days than one trend - the start of the Bru@@ in@@ si training camp was raised almost a week before last season , and for the first time , during the six days of the Mor@@ a W@@ es@@ tw@@ gold season , a training takes place during the summer courses .
they will have 18 trends up to 20 August before the official preparation starts for the opening game against T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M in September .
according to Mor@@ a , he is in favour of changing the N@@ CA@@ A rules , although it adds another item to the close schedule of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they are breaking themselves through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that when the clock comes and we have more time , it is really a few . &quot;
once the camp is finished , U@@ C@@ L@@ A &apos;s training will be closed , which is not at all an easy task , given the clear view of the par@@ king pla@@ te close to their fields and the side @-@ by @-@ step L@@ us@@ kin@@ i centre , a high @-@ class hotel , which has already passed through a network of protection around the gates .
from this weekend &apos;s exchange , ho@@ tels Bru@@ in@@ si players are occupying , but Mor@@ a acknowledged that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&quot; we are implementing security measures , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real concern and it is not at all exagg@@ erated to think that people can rent a fil@@ ter and fil@@ ter there .
if you have a record of a training , you can make quite a good deal .
but we are using a security team there and on 8 par@@ king pla@@ tes .
we will do our best to use the available .
I will try not to be very concerned about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
in writing . - ( PT ) The electoral Union of Sa@@ ten@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , the election union of the Central Party born from Sa@@ ten@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , Chris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ range from the Reform Party and the ECB , forced to leave to the hands of our Tallinn and the parties , created by the mer@@ ging of the forces of Maria Kal@@ j@@ re , Te@@ ga Tallinn , the electoral union of creative business@@ men - seems to be at least as much as the participation of the local elections this year on the initiative of the parties .
however , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether they are all sufficiently disappointed by the voters .
who will remain in Sahel ?
how small the support centre of Ed@@ ri Sa@@ ten@@ are has fallen , can be predicted of events organised as the honour of his electoral union .
one member of the Assembly of State , some former and present middle @-@ party and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and can the reason why , in Tallinn , some of the true supporters and friends of Sa@@ ten@@ are being side@@ lined by Sa@@ ten@@ are , be it seen that the &apos; Sa@@ sta@@ are list &apos; of companies , led by corruption and suspected of corruption , is becoming a reality ?
a central computer game in which , in all respects , the music f@@ ever from the city administration to the Russian @-@ speaking po@@ p of the parent of the town of Las@@ na@@ mä@@ e and , in all respects , the original computer game , in which Prime Minister J@@ ü@@ ri Ra@@ tas must avoid the votes of 16 and 17 @-@ year @-@ old voters who have been on his way to his feet - is the Central Party trying for the first time to allow election bo@@ xes ?
we look forward to the views of the other parties on the young election campaign .
if Can@@ al 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 view@@ ers are to be opposed instead of enter@@ tainment from early August , there will be two options : to accept that , in future , only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn TV and English @-@ language Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels will be available to some ten TV operators every month .
there are probably also those who , at the beginning , openly welcome free TV experience , but in the end - albeit reluc@@ tantly - pay for television and advertising .
high @-@ door music , s@@ ounding people and rub@@ b@@ ish left on the streets are almost every major music ou@@ tle@@ t &apos;s un@@ pleasant side @-@ effects .
however , if you do not want to be part of the me@@ al themselves , it will be worthwhile going home instead of pain - and leaving the s@@ lee@@ ping seat for the l@@ ung@@ le to the general public at the festi@@ val .
Washington changes the rules on the Green Card
media publications are quoted by President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who said that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year , stricter rules on temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Re@@ publi@@ can people and are supported by the President .
the draft legislation will be discussed in two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law reduces poverty , increases wages and sa@@ ves billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money because it changes the way in which US citizens are issuing green cards to citizens of other countries .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process will provide an advantage for candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp , according to the media reports in the United States .
young people are moving back to the city , pensioners , to the land .
J@@ ev@@ se@@ ye@@ v A@@ na@@ oli will continue with the tradition of the famous se@@ ams along the Ma@@ ana River .
he works 140 km from home to Ma@@ ana additional nur@@ ses at Ku@@ vai as a motor driver .
it is a tough job : two months of working 12 hours without rest days and then only ten days at home and again again at home .
for three years in the Ar@@ ch@@ bis@@ ho@@ p , A@@ na@@ tol has seen gold only once .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is the order of the day : when you go there , you are going to have a thorough check so that you do not lead , and when you go it out you do not take it &apos; , you are talking about A@@ na@@ ka .
in the village of H@@ ai@@ da , M@@ are Pi@@ ho is speaking to a local se@@ to Ja@@ ga , who has talked a lot about his family &apos;s memor@@ ies in Si@@ beria .
the archa@@ ic culture still preserved by Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ ines will also have an impact on home @-@ se@@ ams , because it is simply so shocking that it is the most comprehensive view of Pi@@ ho M@@ are .
his first research trip to Si@@ beria will be 30 years since this year .
during this period , he has been there 14 times and has lived there for one year .
how much did Si@@ beria mig@@ rate at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took this into account in the words of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to men , who have himself thought about it .
it is precisely difficult to say , because at the time , up to 30 people could come into one group , but the passport was only given to a man .
the passport was only given one , but it was children , sis@@ ters , etc .
look at how great this territory was here .
it was many times greater than historical S@@ et@@ oma@@ ise .
after all , it needed to be educated , managed in some way .
the ic@@ ks came here as farmers , but their lives changed , because here they found themselves in areas that were not only related to agriculture but also to the river ( pal@@ m par@@ king ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New Pet@@ ser@@ is , many se@@ als later went to work on a classified town , K@@ ras@@ no@@ to@@ ck @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power was built - J. P@@ . ) when it was formed .
did the pigs at the time represent the majority of the population in this region ?
yes , they lived co@@ her@@ ently .
in addition , a long tradition maintained a marriage and a great deal of child clarity .
seven @-@ eight children in families were common .
how much did Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ ines differ and differ from that of the mother country ?
they are different , although what was brought here was once the same there .
they brought a great deal of popular ideas .
they did so themselves ( ideas of the people ) , but they always made a distinction between what had been brought about and what had been done here .
climate change was heavily influenced by the traditional ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity of se@@ als , because it is so@@ wn here .
the proposed changes were made .
for example , S@@ et@@ oma@@ al meat was warm , but it was simply frozen here .
where are the villages of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ ines and what life is there ? / graph@@ ics : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ends
the relationship with mothers was spiri@@ tually strong , which was considered to be very important .
it seems to me that now the Se@@ tu@@ land is going to be returning there , they are going to be affected .
the girls who have lived here in families have listened to ama@@ zing stories .
Pi@@ ho is thinking of the people of the Estonian pig delegation who came to the daily day of the H@@ ai@@ da village Se@@ to Kingdom at the beginning of July and lived four days in homes - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is very easy to come and go ahead , because the city has an excellent location : on the railways and at the crossroads of the roads , &quot; says from T@@ ap@@ t to Re@@ ig@@ o Tampere .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a lot of nature , sport and culture and we have a nic@@ he in every corner .
T@@ ap@@ a is a ti@@ p @-@ fleet city !
there are small islands at the bottom of the river through the present river of White , where the al@@ pal@@ ed b@@ os@@ s tend to be kept .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at Re@@ ig@@ o does not see this beautiful place from the train window &apos; .
anyone who does not fear cold water can flood into the river , because the river is full of resources .
I have been there to sw@@ allow , you can do it !
the river &apos;s water supply can be kept long and can simply be done by ro@@ man@@ tic - the flow of the river can look at and think about life and beyond .
I have also been on my feet there with my own b@@ ars .
O@@ oper@@ is@@ ol@@ ist Tampere , apart from everything else , has been on the river between three bridges to get used : &apos; that is a place around the city , no one can come to an end if their stories are u@@ tte@@ red &apos; .
&quot; a wonderful view of the T@@ ap@@ t is opening up from a football mountain , but there are also health professionals who can drink , drink the winter w@@ ound and play , for example , a dis@@ c@@ gol@@ f - the gol@@ f route has been done , the chains can be borro@@ wed from the sports environment , &quot; is chaired by Re@@ ig@@ o .
the old professionals will , of course , go there with their th@@ read , but I have not yet been able to play there .
obviously , my colleague , Mr Oettinger , must be invited to visit T@@ ap@@ t , because he has experienced a dis@@ c@@ gol@@ f@@ ima@@ gi@@ er and he has a chain .
perhaps he len@@ ds me .
Re@@ ig@@ o and M@@ än@@ ni@@ ku@@ ll were in@@ separ@@ able from the current years of self @-@ operation .
at least during the summer hours .
many te@@ ars , fraud@@ sters and you can live in my sports have remained on this mountain .
not to mention the broken @-@ down bat@@ teries and b@@ ars .
&quot; the whole city is now full of construction works , all this is changing to feeling , &quot; pra@@ ises Re@@ ig@@ o .
however , the old and ti@@ red bo@@ y building is a very attractive place where disco@@ veries are played .
I am pleased that in 2012 , the leader of R@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ M , noticed t Me@@ os , adopted my idea and had to make a full summer theat@@ re with his theat@@ re .
although this year &apos;s communication season was just over with Ale@@ ey@@ i K@@ aren@@ in , on 11 August , the &apos; El@@ lu@@ wake @-@ up &apos; railway station is going around the age of 1980 .

a muse@@ um has already been on its way to a separate three @-@ chamber from 1 May 1994 .
&apos;@@ The house is small , but there is a lot of mis@@ pon@@ ds and there is a huge amount of information &apos; , pra@@ ises the Rhine in a place full of the history of the town of T@@ ap@@ a , most of which focuses on the rail and the war .
Re@@ ig@@ o mu@@ ts that if you go through all the recommended sites in T@@ ap@@ al , you are going to be empty for a long time , but fortunately you are full of a small town &apos;s coff@@ ee .
&quot; we have such good eating places and sometimes when you sit in ca@@ f@@ és you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad , he describes . &quot;
well @-@ educated and young soldiers who have come to T@@ ap@@ ale spend a lot of time in t@@ issues , and there is a rub@@ bing @-@ up feeling that you are in Estonia and your home town , but there is a global com@@ mu@@ te together .
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to the stories from the French or the Americans .
the wars , yes , we are going a lot !
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal ten@@ dering in Greece
TV b@@ TV quoted a Foreign Ministry who announced that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal ten@@ dering in Greece .
in the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of people illegally ordered on the Pen@@ insula of Si@@ th@@ onia , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but the investigation is currently taking place .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said b@@ TV to the television channel that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free ten@@ dering and are already imposing severe fines on all those who are sometimes stranded in a place that is not intended for it .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may impose a fine .

the rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a round of coordination on the Law on the Environment of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and a draft amending Law on plant Protection Products .
the amendment to the law will give up the creation of a separate set of data for both GM crops and business operators , using the plant health register in the future .
in addition , GM crop management will be changed the obligation to have prior agreement with the person involved in ap@@ ic@@ ulture .
although there is currently no cultivation of GM crops in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM crops and non @-@ GM crops .
at least as long as it is not up to the decision to declare the Estonian GMO &apos; , the Chairman of the plant health department , S@@ ig@@ mar , said ,
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures that have been developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burdens incurred by both the private and public sectors . &quot;
the draft law repe@@ als the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of data on GM arable locations and operators in the V@@ S , introduces requirements for the management of GM crops and the launch of economic activities .
in relation to the specific beekeeping sector , the current obligation for GM farmer to inform bee@@ keepers about the cultivation of GM crops by means of an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with bee@@ keepers before growing .
the draft law has been sent to the minis@@ tries for coordination .
all interested parties will have the opportunity to famili@@ arise themselves with the draft information system and , if they so wish , to give their opinion to the Department of Rural Affairs .
the planned changes affect , in particular , people working in the field of plant farming , bee@@ keepers and the Agriculture Agency .
only one GM crop - mon 8@@ 10 - is allowed to grow in the European Union , including Estonia .
so far , however , no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops .
the reason for this is that Estonia does not have a ma@@ co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il , a European early media , on which mon 8@@ 10 is resistant .
also , this maize line has been culti@@ vated to the southern regions , and this is not appropriate to our climate conditions in May .
in order to be secure , in 2015 and 2016 , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies to detect potential GM organisms for the detection of pollution from various su@@ rate , maize and soya and vari@@ eties grown in Estonia .
the analysis of the sam@@ ples carried out showed that seeds were not present abroad and that the study concluded that the seeds of increased ra@@ inf@@ all , maize and soya and vari@@ eties in Estonia were not included in genetically modified organisms .
the previous one may conclude , in turn , that in Estonia , GM crops are not deliberately culti@@ vated , and it was also confirmed that no random contamination took place .

a white house ti@@ p cost taxpayers thousands
according to military documents published in the magaz@@ ine , the decision of the White House to fly a naval helicop@@ ter to a southern hor@@ ror for an American production event last month cost taxpayers as much as USD 24 000 .
the Green and White colour S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , called the President &apos;s Par@@ k office , was the central indication of the event presenting the American construction programmes in White on 17 July .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House reported industrial products from all 50 states on their way around .
a helicop@@ ter built in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ t with a ban@@ ner from a reputation , a fire @-@ fighting car from W@@ is@@ con@@ blue and a pal@@ let made in Mis@@ in@@ hi@@ on .
according to the documents of Mrs H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter , who has been responsible for the operation of H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter , Mrs H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) , the white house called for the presence of a helicop@@ ter in a military c@@ abinet , known as the F@@ AR@@ G@@ O , just 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter was swe@@ pt for the &apos; unusual &apos; event on the southern side .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 com@@ man@@ der a day before the event in an e @-@ mail , the Chief Executive officer of the na@@ vy in the field of aviation .
the message stated that the helicop@@ ter would come to the southern hor@@ ror at 7 : 15 : 00 on the morning of 17 July and will remain there until the same evening between 18 and 21 were clean@@ ed .
it was added to the fact that , if the departure from the White House were to be present , a second b@@ rick is needed for a return flight due to the restrictions on working time .
the original airline team was at the helicop@@ ter during the event and the security team of the es@@ c@@ ad@@ er remained close to the aircraft for all the time it was on the ground .
it was not possible to read from the documents given to the magaz@@ ine whether or not the second b@@ rick took place at last .
the H@@ at@@ ch Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes .
the documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 examined whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked whether it was in breach of H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law and we were told that it did not violate , &quot; wrote com@@ man@@ der .
&apos;@@ It seems that you do not have a choice , &apos; responded to the Deputy Deputy victim .
the White House announced the &apos; made in America &apos; event as an official event , and the H@@ at@@ ch law would not have covered it .
but even official events have political under@@ sco@@ res .
at the event , the President supported the health reform efforts at the time in the Senate and praised efforts to keep government regulations under threat .
the use of an aircraft known as Mrs One or the Air Task Force for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them purely as photo@@ graphic is unusual .
the cell came to the attention in February when , at his first campaign event , a President &apos;s plane at the water background , F@@ ar Mel@@ bour@@ ne , was han@@ ged down , and he is complaining about the way in which his predecessor &apos;s aircraft were used .
the White House is very pleased with the &apos; made in America &apos; issue , where products were represented from all 50 states produced by American workers in American materials , &quot; said the acting spokes@@ man of the White House , L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often carry out tests around Washington and on the southern hor@@ ror to get used to putting a single cent @-@ me@@ tre back on the White House of the President of the United States .
when the T@@ ru@@ mp was at the G20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July , 58 sam@@ ples of H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House were organised in the care of the H@@ M@@ X .
according to the official , the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; Air Force was considered to be the norm for flights at the time of the month .
on that day , the helicop@@ ters of Es@@ ka@@ r flying for &apos; non @-@ President support missions &apos; .
according to the White House , none of the other expon@@ ents of this event burden taxpayers &apos; money .
according to S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky &apos;s representative , the company was not involved in organising the helicop@@ ter on the southern hor@@ ror .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 will not maintain the budgetary documents and the precise costs of the President &apos;s flights and the event will be difficult to find out .
however , according to the prices of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017 , V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D has a compensation rate of USD 24 380 per hour .
in Es@@ ka@@ r &apos;s documents , the distance of the flight from its main base point of departure , Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o , was indicated from Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ o airport to both directions .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicop@@ ter is well below its amount .
&quot; calculating taxpayers &apos; costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimated compensation rates include staff , maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account for annual appropriations . &quot;
according to a study by rand in 2015 , the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation rates for staff costs , but they cover fuel , maintenance and contract costs .
the former press officer of the White House , Se@@ an S@@ â@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ter at the time .
&quot; the point is to show things made in America this week , &quot; said S@@ tun@@ er .
&quot; and I know that the State of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ ti are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are presu@@ ma@@ bly hundreds , if not even thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that , just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicop@@ ter and other military equipment on which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether the T@@ ru@@ mp was exposed to a helicop@@ ter or not as part of the southern hor@@ ror event , but he did not want a fire @-@ fighting car .
in the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky addressed representatives by turning the media ex@@ cus@@ es on the products of a company into a jo@@ ke in his own aircraft fleet .
&apos;@@ I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ ská very well , &apos; the President said , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .

the most difficult ca@@ d@@ ali@@ p@@ u was through the village of Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o , when it did not receive a letter of results from the Amsterdam E@@ ESC at the outset .
I would just like to put one proper multi@@ contest together once .
once &apos; , spra@@ yed Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
worse still lies ahead : a month later , his Olympic contest in Ri@@ os was already covered by the first barrier due to the dra@@ in@@ age .
the time had to be withdrawn - did the 7 competitions have to continue ?
is it still worth two days of effort ?
N@@ ei@@ u thought for a long time , but found peace .
I was able to think twice about it .
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time for a healthy cure and a head to think .
&quot; I knew I would not yet put my fin@@ gers on the picture , &quot; he is talking about his self @-@ cle@@ ans@@ ing .
I was able to pick up a clean page and go on with a new momentum .
according to Mrs Anne mountain , it was very difficult to look at the suffering of neg@@ ligence , but she realised that , above all , the spor@@ ts@@ man himself had to get clear .
after all , he was so bur@@ nt down by everyone .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&apos;@@ G@@ ri said , however , that he will not give up and he wants to prove what he is worth &apos; says mountain .
now there is some sort of peace going on .
he will do so to his satisfaction .
the contest came back in May , when Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o set 6@@ 280 points in Estonia on several occasions at the G@@ oods contest .
at the high @-@ level contest , he improved his personal peak bul@@ l with almost me@@ ters ( 13.@@ 89 ) and drink a record down@@ right @-@ to @-@ date barrier to drinking .
at that time , there was a lot of competition that it was not at all a capacity scale , but a first contest hunger was deleted .
he has been guided for years by the memory that Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o is a black student .

that is what we have to do .
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we will follow it .
the new approach has also been found in Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
&apos;@@ I am not the one who makes the trend to the maximum &apos; , he says and he says that the most important thing is to get the feeling right , because it also provides a good result .

one alcohol with drinking is tanta@@ mount to &apos; training &apos; .
Li@@ ves@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is such a big wine f@@ ans that he believes - wine can be trained better than any other thing in the world .
She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist of Y@@ ale University .
his message is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and ideas , but rather about the &apos; very active &apos; process of flav@@ ouring &apos; wine .
by s@@ ounding the glass , by compli@@ cating wine , enjoying it and perce@@ iving the after@@ taste , we are putting our ha@@ bit into work to create a taste for wine .
according to She@@ per@@ di , cattle s@@ lee@@ ping does not actually contain a taste , but a taste arises from the way in which wine stimu@@ lates the brain .
he will make a comparison of how the brain sees &apos; colour &apos; .
&apos;@@ The taste is not wine , the taste creates the taste of wine &apos; says She@@ per@@ d .
things that affect yet another taste of wine are , for example , our age , gender and even the amount of heart that man produces .
Ali@@ per@@ d , of course , ad@@ mits that wine is not full of Jews .
&apos;@@ There must be more in action &apos; , he says .
if you take too much , the system has been over@@ taken .
excessive drinking of wine can be damaged instead of benefiting the brain : according to the 2004 study , people who drink more than three glass with wine , a loss of memory , a loss of balance and reduced mental capacity risk .
10 % of staff in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay from colleagues
data from the Staff search firm Fon@@ tes reveal that 10 % of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , the Ge@@ ci@@ us portal wri@@ tes .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay survey .
a total of 8 5@@ 77 posts were examined .
63 % of the posts were employed by men .
&quot; while only 3 companies said that the pay gap was in favour of men and the rest of the companies did not see a pay gap , in reality , compared to the reality , the basic gender pay per month is on average 10 % higher than that of women , and the total annual pay of men is on average 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said the Fon@@ crates analy@@ Group Il@@ mar Nordic .

according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of Afghan women in politics
on Wednesday , the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
the head of the UN Assistance Mission , Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , said that hundreds of women would stand for local Soviet elections , three women would stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; it is not possible to over@@ state the importance of the role of women , &quot; he said in the statement made on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with a transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is transferred cal@@ mly from one democratically elected government to the next .
according to the Ha@@ ys@@ om , women &apos;s strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan is increasing .
according to the independent Afghan electoral Commission , 1.2 million women are registered in 3.@@ 6 million .
the joy of sharing makes every case more acute , both large and small .
there is always too little time in common , but the tr@@ en@@ n is a good opportunity to combine meetings , game , proximity and burden .
and what convenient solution - wherever you run in the summer , live han@@ g@@ ings are always with you , and you will be im@@ pati@@ ently reminded of your fine voice : &apos; let us now move to a trend ! &apos;
without insu@@ lation , it is very good to have a normal gold game or to sli@@ p along the coast .
one piece is the foundation for keeping its feet and win@@ ds in shape - who would then like to take the form of an exagg@@ erated sand from the waves during the summer ?
it is nice to use children instead of chic@@ ken !
firstly , it is secure and convenient , and the difficulty is gradually increasing at the same pace as the trained .
villages with quite large children can also be made available .
the child is training a balance , reading the cor@@ ps and giving up the opportunity to speak high and be important .
larger children can at the same time make their own heating .
the scale of the movement is in place with regard to land scarcity and you are pul@@ ling up .
I am going to keep the fin@@ gers right , the mini @-@ j@@ ung@@ le , properly .
the child can read the fla@@ mes and feel like a training engine@@ er .
the planet is a huge , but hope@@ lessly b@@ older ha@@ bit for the child .
but it is easy to rela@@ x .
game @-@ plan@@ k : take a long plan@@ g@@ archy from which to te@@ ar through .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much more a@@ mus@@ ing , to do if , in the meantime , a friend can hand his hand .
to add the burden , a plan@@ ce , a small tur@@ n@@ out can be kept , and there will be a s@@ ounding t@@ ree in that place .
in addition , the baby can be plan@@ ted for the pu@@ p@@ pet , but this exercise offers a break to all children .
at the same time as the tap is sand , the tri@@ cks , ash and ch@@ lor@@ inated meat are getting the burden as the infection .
a child leaves his feet in such a way that his body is distributed equally and over .
security can be kept on its hands .
live up to the foot and get straight up .
P@@ lu@@ n can fly , bur@@ n , strike a balance and be difficult .
the life of a small engine@@ er is an ex@@ termination if he gets a small deal in every fire .
the additional burden will be to dra@@ g the feet in advance .
check that the door will remain in a neutral position .
children themselves have a lot of fer@@ ry buses to do in a boat and with a pla@@ te .
a stone with a pul@@ ling and a w@@ et .
follow the safety of the child , the location of the land , and the back of the child in a neutral position .
the fav@@ ou@@ rite of all children and a great b@@ reat@@ h !
at the same time , the entire physical tr@@ en@@ n is truly effective for the mother .
the means of sport were O@@ tt ( 10 ) , S@@ ä@@ de ( 8 ) , congratulations ( 4 ) .
travelling from the Philippines to the heart of mo@@ phe@@ ts
B@@ oo@@ ked bags are a summer class that has become a self @-@ active product in recent years , one of the right ski@@ es has to han@@ g at their hands and which the merchan@@ ts , despite its modest origin , have been able to use more h@@ our@@ ced price labels .
a co@@ ck@@ ta@@ iled co@@ t is probably one of the things that has existed once in a single life and which has not aro@@ used much emo@@ tion .
it simply does exist , and if there is nothing at all .
now , however , be@@ er bags are on the ver@@ ge of a real victory , and mo@@ efficient de@@ sig@@ ners have swit@@ ched their mus@@ ical designs from simple be@@ er to red bags by the summer months instead .
it is not only a coast@@ line , it is just as popular today as it is in the street , and b@@ older women are even wal@@ king into office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear before the day whether a summer such as this one is sitting or whether it is worthwhile to postpone the w@@ et and lap@@ top@@ s to a little more official .
however , the wealth of talent has made women &apos;s real summer love of be@@ er bags .
the first thing to do , for example , when reading foreign fashion logistics , is to note that mo@@ e@@ gh@@ ur@@ ts will be the first thing to do when they travel for holidays to the local market and will buy a few be@@ er bags to which the whole holiday time is then on the ver@@ ge and which go along with the be@@ aches , the market and also , as a friend , the Naz@@ is , in the b@@ read@@ ings of the town .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are so generous that they buy more w@@ ol@@ f from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal read@@ ers .
at the same time , it is worth noting that there is such a high demand among read@@ ers that women ( and men ) are apparently involved in each other &apos;s fishing area in order to become a happy owner of some homes in the real world .
in some ways , this mad@@ ness is also understandable , because it is rare to have these arrangements when , in the motto of yesterday , it is possible to buy a few euros in a ha@@ bit to ourselves .
it is true that a few hundred traders have also found a simple way of making money here , and in this way , the more expensive luxury br@@ ands are also selling co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils for a few hours and a thousand euros .
obviously , in order for richer customers not to feel easy to die , who are trying around with some cheap bags .
for example , it is possible to buy a be@@ er of over EUR 1 000 from D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ b@@ a .
however , for the interpretation of Chan@@ el be@@ er , a figure of EUR 6 000 can be proposed .
however , unlike most of the mo@@ tives , the be@@ er do@@ gs do not come at all from some of the great Cape Verde , but their story began far from the point of view .
indeed , the be@@ er bags allegedly come far from the Philippines , from where they have been dra@@ gged .
the bun@@ dling of chic@@ k@@ ens there is , in particular , an export business and very often does not see them going on very often .
Ad@@ mittedly , the 14 @-@ century war@@ fare technology comes from the 14@@ th century and is quite a series of normal cor@@ ps .
however , since the be@@ er does not need to be red as hard as the fla@@ me , they will be able to absorb mus@@ cles and other materials that will make the cop@@ ies more person@@ alised and , by extension , more active .
for example , recently , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y bags with red @-@ col@@ oured pa@@ ints or sk@@ im@@ ants .
however , in particular , be@@ er bags may send an ac@@ tress J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , the largest red be@@ er of whom had not been seen before .
in fact , he mat@@ ised the be@@ er to all kinds of clothing complex , and he did not even consider it to have to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
however , today , the popul@@ arity of the applicants does not play a smaller role , nor does it have a smaller role to play , that caring for them is a j@@ ung@@ le and , unlike any other ski , they do not have to be ca@@ red for by special means , but also by water and mar@@ ty@@ r .
as in the case of tr@@ end@@ y rob@@ bing , in addition to classi@@ cal stra@@ its , the br@@ ands have come up with all possible interpretations .
for example , if you like , you can acquire a bun@@ dled clo@@ thes or a tiny piece of rub@@ b@@ ish from the be@@ er .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that classi@@ cal be@@ er co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils never go from mo@@ use to be@@ er flu .
but what is the classic be@@ er , then ?
for centuries , such a red co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il , which rese@@ mb@@ les its style , has been classified as classi@@ cal and is short , as well as be@@ er , san@@ ctu@@ ary .

G@@ M@@ B concerns about investments at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;@@ s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant
the trade union expects the leaders of Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to confirm long @-@ term production plans at the G@@ las@@ go@@ w factory .
G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land said that the company has remained silent on the future of its investment .
more than 500 people work in H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich know @-@ how and other products .
the owner of Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e said in Pla@@ dis that they have invested more than GBP 5 million in objects over the last few years .
workers and trade union presidents there &apos; are the first to hear &apos; when something changes in the operation of the factory .
in a letter sent to the head of the company , G@@ M@@ B of Scotland called on Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to &apos; dis@@ pel concerns about the lack of funding to modernise production lines &apos; .
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ ator D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said : &apos; the fact that we cannot get clarity from the head of the subject on the business needs of Customs and the investment plan for the future makes our members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around the G@@ las@@ go@@ w region , as an essential pillar for ensuring proper employment in a region with high unemployment and social exclusion .
therefore , in view of the jobs , wages and welfare of the east of G@@ las@@ go@@ w , Bre@@ x@@ ti , the rise in living costs and the chronic reduction in production , a thri@@ ving productivity company Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e is urgently needed . &quot;
the planned representative said : &apos; the head of Customs received a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ ten only yesterday and the company will respond directly to him because we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between workers and representatives of the G@@ M@@ B in Customs , which discussed a number of issues openly .
at that time , we discussed with the workers that , like all the other companies that operate in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are going to review our activities from now on - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years we have invested more than GBP 5 million in customs equipment , most of which has gone into production routes and improvements .
we fully understand Customs as an object of production and , if any change were to be made to the subject , the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear it . &quot;
did PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago about its approach to Ney@@ ra ?
you can regret this interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main does not give up in its efforts to attract Ney@@ mar to his back @-@ up of GBP 18@@ 9 million , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record con@@ qu@@ it@@ ance ?
this el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent approach has opened the summer &apos;s transition window and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of over@@ purchase set by the return of Paul Po@@ g@@ ba to Manch@@ ester , for GBP 89 million in the previous season .
once the transition has been completed , Ney@@ ra will , as a result , become the most expensive player in the world and , at the same time , the most remun@@ erated professional ath@@ le@@ tes in the world , who will be employed by over GBP 500 000 per week after taxes from the PS@@ G .
Barcelona is , of course , ang@@ ry by both the approach and the break @-@ up of Ney@@ ra , although the close source of Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ i &apos;s management confirms that the club has always done the best for football since its arrival in San@@ to@@ v in 2013 .
but did the President of the PS@@ G warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City showed interest in the conclusion of the Blair @-@ Ma@@ tu@@ ga agreement in 2014 , N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all clubs who think about some of the best players and recruitment of the PS@@ G .
&apos;@@ I am not worried because they know that , when they concern some of our players , we are going to meet them and contact their players &apos; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but when they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have gone beyond this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the PS@@ G central player Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they will not be allowed to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could be a set@@ back as a result of this interest by eliminating one of its expensive assets in the form of Ney@@ mark .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t .
&quot; Bre@@ x@@ it is threatened with a serious blow between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r at his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; he emphasised .
he said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , because it cannot , he would be part of the European common market .
this would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
another way to make Britain &apos;s departure smoo@@ ther would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said : &apos; certainly we could have this kind of deal with Britain &apos; .
the alternative to this would be to return to customs items that would declare historic divisions and political failure .
&apos;@@ S@@ tr@@ eng@@ th@@ ening trade , prosperity and peace &apos; said the Irish Prime Minister .
he called Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t &apos; our generation &apos;s challenge &apos; and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of the everyday life of Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met with leaders of the main Irish parties in Bel@@ fast .
through her first half @-@ long tri@@ ath@@ l@@ on , Av@@ ja : I@@ ron@@ man is able to go through everyone .
today , around a thousand tri@@ gg@@ ers from more than thirty countries were held in the winter capital , O@@ te@@ ver the Baltic States &apos; largest tri@@ ath@@ ons , when the one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ long I@@ ron@@ man competition came into being .
7@@ 0.@@ 3 miles of a bat@@ ch consis@@ ted of 1.9 km of flooding , 90 km of cy@@ cling and 2@@ 1.1 km of cy@@ cling .
among others , the first tri@@ gg@@ le of his life also ended up with Av@@ ele .
&quot; I thought that it would be difficult and , in the end , it was a difficult one . &quot;
despite the complexity of the report , Av@@ ele has shown that , in fact , the tri@@ ck is well @-@ suited to almost everyone .
&apos;@@ not a but@@ ton kills , but a speed kills &apos; , he said , suggesting that , at a rate of prosperity , almost everyone would reach the fin@@ gers .
with the exception of O@@ tt Se@@ p , &apos; everything is fine , but unfortunately he cannot flood &apos; .
Av@@ ele had already done a lot to a tr@@ en@@ n since February .
from 4 to 5 hours a week to 10 hours a week .
in time 05 : 34 : 12 he achieved 27@@ 00@@ th place in general calculation .
although Av@@ cian lost both R@@ ai@@ o Pi@@ ony ( time 04 : 59 : 53 ) and J@@ ür@@ gen L@@ ig@@ i ( time 05 : 06 : 37 ) , she won other so @-@ called &apos; prominent class &apos; ten@@ ts .
last year , Tan@@ el Pa@@ da@@ r lost A@@ van@@ i in seven minutes ( time : 54 : 54 ) , journalist S@@ ten Te@@ pp@@ an in 16 minutes ( time : 05 : 23 ) , Kal@@ e@@ v K@@ r@@ new and Ra@@ iv@@ o E. Tampere ( times as follows : 06 : 31 : 53 and 06 : 45 : 18 ) .
the overall winner of O@@ te@@ pä@@ ä &apos;s male account was chronic German , Johannes Mol@@ dan , with 3 : 58 : 27 ; 27 , Est@@ oni@@ ans with the best time of 04 : 14 : 09 .
women were won by Dan@@ es Hel@@ le Fre@@ der@@ ik@@ sen with 04 : 24 : 01 , but also by Maria J@@ än@@ ese , who lost almost half an hour to Fre@@ der@@ ik@@ sen and received 04 : 58 : 58 .
