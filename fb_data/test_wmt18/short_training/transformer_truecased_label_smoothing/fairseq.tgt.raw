Four members of the CroCape vo Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the rule of law, the police in Spain detained Sbel Gulevitch, leader of the so-called Columrovo Group, which is known as Sbel KCape rovski, who is known in the criminal world.
Gulevitch, detained in Spain, was arrested on the Court's list.
Yesterday the Court also held three arrests of suspected persons detained in Estonia.
According to suspicion, it is a so-called CCape rovo criminal community member of the age of 27-57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
The alleged leader of the criminal community was detained in the province of Mala in Spain.
Three men were arrested in Estonia as a suspect, one of them according to data collected is the leading figure of a criminal community and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that tasks and roles were clearly divided into the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal community's activities was to commit drug crimes and thus to earn criminal revenue, "commented the head of the pre-trial criminal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor VaconneVerte.
"We do not rule out that the circle of suspects in this criminal case will increase," the Prosecutor added.
These are people who have previously been involved in the interests of law enforcement, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Mrs Verte stressed that cooperation with my Spanish counterparts has been high throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," commented the Prosecutor Verte.
The head of the central criminal police service, ago Leis, said that nearly one and a half years of pre-trial was preceded by detention.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work was realised and, at the same time, we were suspected of crimes in Estonia and Spain," said, "
In Lithuania, it added that central criminal police officers were assisting in the detention process in Spain.
For years now, we have good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil card force.
These detentions are yet another message to the criminals that we will also get them to the other end of Europe, "said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that when they are at liberty, the suspected men can continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecution service asked for their arrest and was also approved by the Court.
A man arrested in Spain expects him to be surrendered to Estonia.
Under this criminal case, property, vehicles and cash have been confiscated in order to ensure confiscation.
Criminal proceedings are carried out by a central criminal police agency for organised crime and are led by a public prosecution service.
The Tallinn City Court sentenced Sbel Gulevitch in 2005 to blackmail and punished him with five years' imprisonment.
In mid-last decade, Mr Gulevitšit was considered the second most important figure in the criminal world of Estonia following the then alliances of Tarankov.
Gulevitch, from Cape Verde, emerged from the sources of Estonia at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and women on different hotels and demanded a monthly loss tax on businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal proceeds and entry into force judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, eight accused of so-called Dikyev criminal offences in the Community, of whom EUR 80 000 were confiscated, or against nine individuals that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal connection in 2006 aimed at illegal trade in cigarettes and the crime of trafficking in human beings in Eastern Viruland and southern Estonia.
There are around €71 500 worth of confiscated criminal revenue.
These criminal matters have succeeded in ensuring that police officers exchange information and prosecutors on a daily basis with foreign colleagues and, where necessary, take action together in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against Missourisse travelling
The National Association for the People's Party for Europe of Colored People (NAIP) has warned the black people travelling to Missouriss about the discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the State.
The Group's statement states: 'The NAT travel company issued for the State of Missouri State until 28 August 2017 calls for all African American passengers, visitors and gay people to be particularly attentive and very careful as they move around the country, given the dubious racial events that have recently taken place across the State and are also highlighted here'.
NASE said that the group urged a group to issue a travel warning, both the recent Missouri law, which makes it harder to win cases of discrimination, and the fact that the destination of justice defenders in the State is unequal to a large extent the minorities.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are scattered because of their skin colour, beaten or slaughtered, 'said Ros Chapel's newspaper The Kansas City Star, President of the NAMsouri industry.
"We have never received so much complaints before."
This is the first such warning that the organisation has issued about the state of the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist affront to black students at Missouri University and the death of Sandersi, 28 years of Tennesthis.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year under dubious circumstances after he ran from the State to petrol and was arrested by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the comment refers to the recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that, in the State, the cars of black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of white-collar drivers.
'The comment is for people to be aware and to warn their families, friends and working partners about what might happen in Missouris' said Chapel.
"People need to be ready, whether it means taking money away or informing relatives that they are going through the State."
According to the latest figures from the FBI hate crime programme, 100 hate crime crimes were recorded in Missouris in 2015, which places the State in a cross-country position in 16.
A travel warning is also in response to the Missouri new law, which makes it difficult for a company to appeal to the Court for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Association (IGACLU) had previously issued travel fees for Texas and Arizona following the adoption of immigration laws by these states, which obliged local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences, as the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
As a rule, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What could everyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease?
Hepatitis, or liver burn, may be caused by five different types of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All of these viruses provoke a liver cocktail burn.
However, there is a chronic hepatitis B and C, which can continue to develop into a blunt, that is to say, a beer and a liver cancer.
The epidemiology Adviser of the Health Agency, Kuulo Kuwait, talks about the same phenomenon of hepatitis-hepatitis cancer in all types of liver combustion - fever, fatigue, plotism, fatherhood, fairy, chair pain, grey emissions, we end up with horse mackerel, meat and excess pain, and skin-meat and hydragrenadic children.
The last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of the liver burn.
Children can experience hepatitis without disease.
The various types of organic combustion can only be identified on the basis of laboratory research.
Not hepatitis can turn into chronic hepatitis and go for decades without disease phenomena, which means that you may not know anything about your dangerous cost-harm disease.
Siulo Kuwar sets out different forms of hepatitis and describes their evolution more closely.
Hepatitis viruses spread from a hospital to a person and infecte us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, on a mixture, on the way, on the way to the hands of infected people and on food, on the ground, on objects, on the skimming and on the consumption of drugs.
A hepatitis is a hepatitis disease risk, that is, family members and carers, people suffering from chronic diseases, people who are sexually sexually infected, men sex, drug users, people of hepatitis A visit countries.
Vaccination can be prevented, in particular, vaccination is recommended for people who travel a lot and who belong to the hepatitis A risk group.
Furthermore, daily compliance with hygiene requirements is important: To wash or disinfect hands before consumption of food to wash all fruit and vegetables.
B hepatitis viruses spread from a hospital to a person's blood when he comes into contact with a person's blood, drugs injection, hepatitis, dishment, blood-contaminated meals (toothma, pregnancy), donor blood, hepatitis-harmed sex and hepatitis-ill animals / infants.
The hepatitis disease risk group includes heart drugs, infected people's sex partners, sex sex sex sex men, pregnant women, hospital families and carers, blood and other body liquids, health, rescue workers and police officers, and passengers visiting countries with a high level of hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis, people can be vaccinated; in particular, people belonging to a risk group are recommended to be vaccinated, as well as people suffering from chronic pay diseases, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures are hepatitis hepatitis: Prevention of the use of alien hygiene and manure, other sharp instruments and needles, the use of needles, heckness and honour, and use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection or the prevention of sexual risk.
Anti-hepatitis vaccination is part of the national immunity scheme in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses spread from a hospital to a person's blood when he comes into contact with a person's blood, drugs injection, hepatitis, dishment, use of blood-contaminated meals, blood, blood of donors, hepatitis AIDS, sex and hepatitis disease to animals / infants.
The hepatitis C risk group includes injection drugs, infected people's sex partners, sex sex partners, men with men, pregnant women, family members and carers of the infected mother, blood and other body liquids, health, rescue workers and police officers, people with HIV infection and people visiting the countries with high levels of hepatitis C.
Hepatitis C is a preventive measure: Avoiding the use of alien hygiene and manure, other sharp instruments and needles, and needle-stick, humiliation and honour-recognition and use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis hepatitis causes hepatitis D virus, which is much closer to the presence of hepatitis B virus.
This leads to hepatitis D infection, along with hepatitis B or superinformation as chronic hepatitis B.
Hpatitis viruses spread exposure to blood and other body liquids, contaminated needles, sexually and rarely infected animals.
The hepatitis hepatitis risk group is chronic hepatitis B viruses and people not immune from hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with a hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from hepatitis D infection.
Hepatitis viruses spread on a fatty road to drinking water and food, including little heat-treated beef, fish and marine potatoes, donor blood, common-use needles and infected animals.
Passengers may be infected with E hepatitis in high-morbidity countries.
The measures to prevent hepatitis hepatitis are compliance with hygiene requirements: To wash or disinfecate hands after going into the ash, before food production and feed, after hospital care.
Fruit and vegetables are washing before consumption, preventing low levels of heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid consumption of drugs.
Although in the last round competitors tried to get rid of four-fold Olympic winners, the 34-year-old Farah final found its strength and won 26.49.51 in time.
Farah did not think for a long time, drawing on his wife, Tania, and children, after the finich.
This was a special moment for me.
I very much support my family.
It was wonderful to be with them, "said Farah to journalists.
Farah is targeting the fifth prize in London for an increasing 5 000 and 10 000 metres of the golden dump.
Everything is possible if that is the case.
Despite the headlines, Mrs Anne-Marie O'Constandard 'Daam gold': A reassuring climt's masterpiece, Mr Bloch-Baueri's extraordinary story 'comes from the birth of a single art works to a much deeper end of the 19th century and the cultural life of Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century.
But in more detail in history.
The culmination of the Aucarication Information Experiation is, in other words, a thwarmer in the breadth, the narrowly subject would have been put on the extraordinary story of the conscript allowed in the title to gain more influence.
At the moment, the story of Ale Bloch-Baueri and the much more extensive and comprehensive history book of the Jewish families and the German occupation, together with its aftermath in Austria, would be as if one were one of the chambers.
The first third of the book leads, in the middle of the cultural life of Viin, and who is himself in the Austrian capital, to a lesser extent than a hundred years ago, to the way in which life went around Ringstrass or how the Centrali coffee turned all its heads when the climate came into being.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities of Europe and when you saw the name familiar in the book, you felt a little more culturally than a grams.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a town where the incure in the vocabulary and was Europe's highest level of suicide is not giving anything more to development.
Or perhaps, however, every couple of honest tissues also add colour to cultural life in Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century.
Dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In the last few decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the greatest Jewish community in Western Europe.
Almost one in ten people in Vienna had a Jewish exchange.
The parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time that Aid relief itself was two times open to the Czech sugar magnaad Ferdinand Blochi and Climate for his famous pairds, his father had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But let us not make the whole of the laissez-faire life to which he was a member.
If you look at the 'Daam gold', it is difficult to believe that the final half of life was infected by this kind of bolder socialism and dreamt of travelling to the Soviet Union.
By 1933, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband's tree from the customer, the last month was a hot-day painting officer in Vienna.
A customer ordered a payment at that time of 4 000 kroon, a quarter of the price of a good-location rural house.
The fact that, in some tree tree, a champion was suspected of a modelle, sugar magnat, was not intimidated.
As far as Adeletes are concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the modelli and the artist that emerged during the course of the work continued life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - 'Daam gold'.
Gva Climate Cup, Ale Bloch-Baueri portfolio's extraordinary story ", Varrak 2016, Aldo Randland translated English.
Just before the start of the work with Adelet, the climate had been visited by Ravennas San Vital, and the investigators think that it was precisely the magnificent mosats there that gave the artist the idea of making a golden tree from Adelete as a mosaic.
The climate presented its' Daami gold 'in Vienna in 1948 and around the same time (between 1907 and 1908), one of the golden land' Sinnovative 'was born.
Artists did not fail to notice the similarity of two women.
How is Hitler involved in the story?
"I think I owe him to remember my friend, the climate, to make his hand available to the general public," Ale Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after he left the artist (Climate died in February 1918) to the Director of the Belvedere museum and wanted their family climate college to go to museum.
Six years before the death, the climate had drawn from Adelee to each other's tree.
In his wildlife (Aad left in February 1925), he also asked the husband to leave his two portals and four Gustamt's landscapes to Austrian Galer.
His newspapers inherited his sister words to Mariana and Lui.
One year after the climate had finished the 'Austrian Mona Annex', Viini Kawagmunde Akademine had tried to escape from the 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed to do so.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes seen as the reason for the fact that Jewish professors did not accept him in anti-Scademy, none of his excuses was really Jewish.
In any case, the role of Austrian Galerii, referred to in Maria itemend, had changed considerably by 1939, and it was important that Vienna's rich Jewish art collections have become a brilliant job of the female Participation.
Some of the work that was at home, but not those of the climate, were also soaring in Hitler's personal artistic beauty.
Sixty years after the March of the Nazis art, a 10-year-old dispute between the Austrian Government and the heirs of Bloch-Bauers began.
At this point, it should only be noted that, if the 'New deal' is seen in the Belvedere Castle in Vienna, the 'Daam gold', which characterises Ade Bloch-Bauer, must be seen as travelling to New York in Neue Galeri.
And before the Vienna war, we will also read the aforementioned book.
Even if you do not plan to look at the work of the climate, because my emotions at least came more about after the closure of the book on the topic of Nazis and Jews than about the mail that was sold at USD 135 million and the moll Aid Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much as a tree, rather than a relatives' embassy - and a very moving story.
It considerably facilitated the disorientation of the Bauers' relatives at the beginning of the book.
17 year old flood and very close to Estonia's record in Canada
In live life, gold was 200 m m to the personal record of sleeping swimming very close to 2.16.62.
The Tippmark comes from 17-year-old pipe a week ago, when Canada received 2.16.58 at the time, Priit APope Ujumish will mediate.
The final decade - A-finalists - escaped from gold.
In the Finally, he went through his distance to 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful peak.
Alina Kendziori, Estonia's record (2.15.13) remained a little over half a second.
In Estonia's top-ever ranking, gold has risen and its fresh personal excellence is the fifth ever result of Estonia.
A young hope for the future is still starting 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in the Cup, as well as 200 mm and 400 m in bundling at the Canadian adult championships.
Last week, in Toronto, Canada took place at the Juthora Championships' Championships, and gold also made successful start-ups there.
He won 200 m in a whip in a silver medal with 2.03.22.
It was flooded so quickly as a remote champion last 2008.
More quickly than ever, Estonia has only removed this distance from Estonia's record, Elina Partarka.
As a leading player in Canada, the 100 m m hall of the Medal was won in a great personal record and 56.66 new Estonian season.
For example, his year old Kertu ly Alnek has distanced it by just one hundred more quickly.
He reached a further 100 m a personal top-level threshold in his opening of a theatre wave of 1.03.69.
For half a long distance, he only achieved the seventh place when he drove in the final, 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the ranking of the Estonian season at four different distance.
President Trump goes on holiday, critical teeth
The time for the holidays is in the hands of the President of the United States, Donald Trull, too.
However, since the Trump has so far been one of the most holiday days, critics are already giving teeth.
A 17-day holiday period is scheduled by the US TEEN, as announced by the President, in the Bedminster, which is located in New Delseys.
Although the President's leave began yesterday, anti-Trumpi has already spoken for a week.
They are bowing too often to the Olympic Games to rest.
It is the President who has until a quarter of his weekend exchange in the cotton of his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
Incidentally, the Trump has no longer cleaned the President during his 196 term.
For example, George W. Bush has already reached 67 days on holiday, with Barack Obama half as much as Trump, just 21 days.
However, the Olympic Games tend to be quick to forget things.
In the days after becoming President, Trump's programme said '60 minutes' that there will be no time for longer holiday for his successor, because a great deal needs to be done.
He also expressed his outrage at Barack Obama's leave three years ago.
The current President wrote on Twitter at that time: 'While Obama has a holiday, golf is playing, the brakes and the jungle groups are going on, journalists are sunset their heads in the country'.
According to the officials of the White House, 17-day golf clubs' visit does not have a kind of relaxation.
Instead, it is officially called 'working time', during which the Olympic era does not have time for reading or other pro-active activities.
In addition, working time had to have another reason.
In particular, the White House will be replaced by a Western pension system and therefore all staff had to leave it.
The West Bank also has Oricabinet and the other working rooms of the President.
"I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West Bank in August, if there are 38 degrees and there is no traditional pension," said Lindsay Walters, the spokesman of the White House, who stressed that the President would continue to work on holiday.
Where President Trump is going to spend 17 days, you have an idea of a video.
Blocking critics from Facebook do not stand for state office if you do not tolerate the criticism of the voters.
The father of our country knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not take a long time to start cheating him for everything from internal politics to his political principles.
He was, of course, irritated by the criticism.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
Because, in the year 1783, Washington said that 'freedom of expression can be taken away from us and that, in louder and silent terms, we could be led to slaughterhouses'.
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who is struggling to be more like Washington.
The hosts have blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.
At the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Society Union) therefore brought him to court.
The Kuberner official walked the action empty and web commentators slipped out of counter-reaction in a style 'who is interested?'
'That is just Facebook, 'many said.
But that is what counts.
And this counts particularly much when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazing popular Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state.
His discharge percentage is the second highest among the 50 Governor of the country.
I am not an unthinkable, reactive stance.
He has been steering the State firmly and he has remained strictly firm on his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook quite bluntly as the main tool for communicating with his constituents, for example by presenting his bright head after chemistry for the first time.
Thus, a public forum with a formal label, managed by taxpayers' money-paid staff, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
The journalist's press representative, Mr Chin, defended the conduct of the Governor in an interview to Mr Washington, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than pacification.
But it is all too easy to pause the picture of online screening sites, spammers or people full of hatred online.
The post spoke to a number of people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that is what they are the people who are in contact with their elected leaders: The teacher, the owner of the company and the passport, not Internet controls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, well thought-out and not at all Roma.
In his post, Pastor quoted milk, highlighting Hogan's Catholic traffic.
Lakshm Sarma Raman, a lawyer from Marylanst Bowie, did not incite hatred, but rather hate crimes.
"I politely replied that I was disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or to other recent news," he wrote the news story in the State of The mail.
'nor do I like the idea that, when a lot of people comment on the same subject, some call it an indifference immediately to collective effort rather than to admit that this is a great deal of concern to citizens'.
What the Governor's officer called 'targeted spam attack' would probably call 'public support'.
The messages can easily be reconciled by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much cleaner than it was before when, in order to do the same, the workers had to be sent out, so that they collect and burn the newspapers with critical instructions, or arrest them, and force them to remain silent.
But that is exactly what is happening now, just digital.
I am not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media toothless.
President Trumpi has brought to court Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter's stream.
One of the first staggering sentences on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
The US Qualibi, James C. Cacheris, decided in Alexandria that the chair of the councillor of the County of Loudouni was a breach of the first amendment of the constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
Kharckys also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter following the use of Governor Matt Bevinit (R).
It should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers dambled his leadership.
And even then Washington had to face anonymous border controls.
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseuudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making decisions in Washington reckless.
On-line George Washington's collection project, according to the historical documents written together in the framework of his correspondence, he buried a cabinet under petitions criticising his views on the friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he did not force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, disagreement and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper governance means accepting this.
Ronan Rafferty hopes the comfort of Renaissance's home territory
The former European representative, Ronan Rafferty, hopes for the convenience of the home territory within the next three days when the Renaissance Club golf courses take place 25.
The Northern Irish, who was in the vicinity of Archfield Linaks in the past year ahead of the last round before Paul Ealrection, has been driving a new site and is performing the role of the Ambassador of the club founder and CEO, Mr Sony, rather than the Ambassador of the turf.

Half an hour after the coal sludge will be taken from fire and the unscathed hand will be stunned.
Degei is sitting on the other side of EGNOS, at the same time he does not have a MasterCard, at the same time he does his daily homework, for example, washing the water of the nearby sex.
The role of the channel will be played in a dozen uncovered dogs.

'nobody dares to go around after five o'clock in the village '.
It is a rare cloud in Papua mäki, a former Dutch colony, which was brought under Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that caused controversy, whereby only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote in their hands by raising their hands before the forces.
The move to its own raids quickly against the Jakarta Government, which is still keeping the region under its strong control by keeping away from foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially appointed as a Pope and a Western Pope, so the independent Papua New Guinea remained the east of the island.
In order to be able to get here, 90 minutes from Jayapurr, the capital of the province, Nabija, will have to go through a five-hour journey that will then make a rental car grow.
There is no public transport.
A city of around 19 000 inhabitants consists of tree houses surrounded by bambles and covered by lainless iron roofs, which have turned different tone into yellow Brown.
Very few indicators have taken the route here, not to mention journalists, nor have there been almost any foreigners here.
Before the arrival of Christian gangs, Mee Pago boats were married by God called Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing this kind of clothes," says Degei, referring to his colourful approach to the coding of the market, to the plumber and to the private seed.
"Before that, we only wear a plant cow."
Papua on Indonesia, the poorest province of Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold-rich country.
Just 100 km away from Paniao, which is about a mountain province of 153 000 inhabitants, the largest and most lucrative gold mine in the world is Grasberg, a company operating in Phogenx, FendMcMoran.
In 2015 alone, FFriday's exports extracted around USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua mourning with food supplies is estimated to be worth USD 78 billion.
However, these treasures are the source of the suffering of boats, as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Venezuelan army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that FFriday's exports cost local military and military units around USD 20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150 000 per victim.
The attempts made by the Pope to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden hall and are fitted with ruthlessly.
More than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1969, according to human rights activists, and thousands more have been ravaged, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesia army.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killing of the mountain states belonging to Papua tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, over 3900 peaceful protestors were arrested by the Chechen police in the region.
The 2016 Annual Report on 'We shall all lose all' of Burma's main bishops contains testimony to the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electric shock) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to read the number of victims because such incidents take place every week," says Human Rights Watch, Indonesia's researcher, Andreas Harson.
The kidnappings are even more strongly closed, because Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demographics are changing, because the people of Indonesia are coming from many of the islands of Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes.
Shobens are sold in the gallery as gado-gado-gado with mixed vegetables, which are being stolen along the ground level.
The local community cannot compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables on traditional markets more cheaply than local boats," explain the 24-year-old Estonians born in Paniai who, in the name of their work, walked into Jayapuri, the capital of the province.
"The pilots of the indigenous population will therefore lose their market share."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, who is known as Jokow among the people, promised to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Pope in his 2014 election campaign.
The former Archbishop won his way to the presidential Palace of Jakarta in Papua 29 constituencies 27, including Paniai.
But the Pope has changed very little and the local feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014, we voted in favour of Jokow's expectation that he will fulfil our hopes of restoring justice, 'says you will.
In fact, only two months after Jokow took office, Paniai was in a low position.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children in the majority of children stunned on Christmas when two Indonesia's soldiers were stunned on a dark motorcycle.
The children who arrived told them that they should be included in the front.
According to what was said by the local passport Yavedt Talai, one of the soldiers was insulted by their voting tones and later landed with four soldiers.
According to the victims and spectators, under the influence of drunk soldiers driven children and beaten them with their guns.
One of the soldiers then shot among children.
One child, 16 years old, Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so blatantly that he fell into his homes.
A few hours later, the close electoral Commission's building was burnt down and the next day things were even more expensive.
Around 1 000 young people, Papua men, women and children, gathered in front of the local police force and the military leadership centre to demand justice.
They were wearing private refurbishment buses and putting forward Papua mee pago tribes of waita-tanker, during which the baby was drink around and buried.
Some of the protesters started to lecture the police and the military.
When you raise your mind, you sent your habit to the soldiers via the internal stadium. 'When the mass of the population shows more than three times resistance, leave them behind,' it was said in accordance with a official document that has been seen by a magazine but has not been issued to local media reports.
The oldest city of Kenya Koto, the parent of Yeremias Kayam (56), experienced a threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking for a crowd to go home.
No one was willing to listen.
"With his reversal, I was suddenly shot into the left," he said to the magazine in his private colour on the blood of the disability house.
We still do not know who the fire was, but says that the month came from the soldiers gathered.
'The people were a lot, the House had plenty of children, 'she adds.
The local man Alfius Youw received three times on her fire.
"I would like to come to him and study his body to make sure that it is with him," said a letter of time synchronically in Yohanes, who, like many indicators, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I have visited him."
The Chief Police officer of Papua police, Yotje Mud, said to the reporters that he only guaranteed the safety of his department because it was attacked.
"We need to protect ourselves when we are threatened with killing," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, Commissioner for the Press in Papua police in 2015.
"This is a question of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many injured.
The news about the killings only reached Jakarka the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokow Jayapura made a passionate speech in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with abuses in Pope.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Wiranto, said that he would introduce an alternative mechanism for the resolution of human rights crimes.
But almost immediately, the excuses were followed.
"Most crimes took place a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes, 'he said.
However, speaking on 5 June in Jakartas, Wiranto has withdrawn his words by saying that he has no intention whatsoever of creating a Pope mechanism to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said that 'everything will be resolved by law'.
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights of more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the bloody referendum on independence in 1999, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Paniao, including what happened in Paniai.
The families of the victims of the Paniai accepted such claims with a gloomy discourse.
"I have been heard four times over the past three years, but there has been no progress," said Yohanes.
"I am tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
'I am afraid he says'.
"I fear that the army will arrest me, I am afraid I will be fired."
His brod Yacobus confirmed the view that the people of Paniai are afraid of this incident.
He said that he was beaten by the army after he had helped to burn four victims.
"After burying dead bodies, the army had to look to me," he says.
The protests have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the village population in Deiyai was fired by the Venezuelan police.
One person died and 17 injured, including children, when it went to war between the village population and the head of the construction company, who refused to transport an unconscious man into hospital.
This male people, the 24-year-old Rielanus Douw, who drowned close to fish, died on the road to hospital.
The young village people protested at the construction site in front of the company office.
According to the police, the village people were stoning, after which the latter responded to the alerts.
However, according to local claims, mobile British (the military-driven police in Indonesia) started firing at the people, killing one person.
"We were big panic, we fear retaliation," said a letter of 29 years old, Domingge Badii, who lives near a hospital and saw injured insecticides.
"I have been hiding myself in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for the police to get the British back into the region.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the honey, mone, dances and dammal tricks living in the middle county of Papua halj.
Many of them have joined the Liberation Acadebels' army, which, in its words, defends the rights of the boats by orchestrating attacks and abduction of human resources among Indonesia's soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of 'defending state sovereignty', the army has arrested in Paniai over recent years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them never appear again.
The people of Papua urs are known as' tragic forgotten '.
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The low rice that is sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases.
I find it equally inaccessible.
People are growing all their food themselves mainly at source, in addition to a little fruit and vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care about four or five bars.
They usually keep most of the crops on the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten bases cost only 10 000 Indonesia's premises (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have intensified between indigenous boats and new migrants, who have come a lot since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport.
These few jobs, which exist, go better to educated and more prosperous migrants.
Pope himself often lacks capital or the skills needed to conduct a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the guest because there is no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, President of the Paniai Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from the Pope.
Furthermore, strict restrictions on foreign media remain.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Babridge Longchamp were expelled from Pope, because 'they did not follow the relevant practices', even though they had been given a rare film authorisation.
According to Mr Kine, Vice-President of the Asian department of Human Rights Watch, the election promises made by Jokow have not been implemented to remove the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development.
"In Indonesia, journalists trying to report from the most uneasy provinces in the east and Western Pope, new threats are threatening the rejection and blacklist," he said in a statement.
The lack of a press look means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua avans.
In March, six Pacific States called for "a wide range of" crimes "in Pope, including the shooting of Paniai, six Pacific States, Nauru, Belau, Tube, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands.
The same countries have historically supported VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a journalist at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, dismissed group charges, saying Jakartas journalists: 'There is still a democratic regime and freedom of the press in Indonesia, so that evidence of cases of human rights is difficult to burn down'.
The local people want more foreign governments to be taken into account.
When the Dutch official delegation, chaired by the leader of the country's human rights Envoy, Kette Van Bari, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the local people interrupted the meeting, but anonymous to remain the source of silence, urging: 'We want freedom'.
There will be new presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the boats do not believe they will vote again in favour of Jokow.
"Jokow is a man with good intentions, but the people around him who are involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, President of the tribal Council.
He wants to give Jokow an understanding that, in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are suffering from misery due to education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like other boats, consider their voice to Jokow to be the debt they have to pay.
"They do not need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the atrocities and intimidation, the families of the Paniai fire-fighting victims were still coping with the last symbolic counter-attack they swept one victim to death in the body of police officers and military bases.
Knowing that justice can never be done, at least they will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus's head.
'What else can we do? '
He came to himself for the second time in Dubai Torch's cloud.
On Friday, one of the highest residential buildings in the world was eating through Dubai, forcing hundreds of people to escape from this 337 metres and 79-metre building.
This is the second fire which, for just two years, has devastated the high-ranking that is being called the Turin case, that is to say, the Tharviv pipeline.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct fire causes were presented.
"We sleep and let us wake up to the fires and the fear of people.
We would be waiting for a leaf and we took around 10 minutes to get down from the 50th straight, 'said to Reuterli a resident who called himself George'.
According to civil protection officials in Dubai, fire-fighters also deleted at around 4 o'clock in local time (00.00 GMT) and cut down the building.
The government said that it would work to ensure that the suffering people had a shelter.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of high-calibre materials used outside the world.
Following an investigation carried out by the Torch Bureau following the fire in 2015, the most damage was caused by facians - deactivating panels and isolation on external soil.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London portfolio Tower and the fast-track panel could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June, which killed around 80 people.
See: These phones will probably be sold in the autumn
Language and coal are a time when technical players have their feet, because then the telephone manufacturers will make their new models of excellence public.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony XZ Premium came to sale, and new Hitt-phones are also expected for boys in the autumn.
According to the Director for the marketing and sale of Tele2, Christian Sema, today's flagship ships are characterised by innovative design, by an eye-to-mouth sandner, by the server-servani 4K resolution, by a screen and by an ultra-fast process.
In the technological world, Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also come to the forefront of the Estonian smartphone sales table.
In autumn, smart calibre allows even more tier high-speed recharging, a more resilient brain, a better quality cameras and greater water and pollination.
He added that, on the basis of rumours, we can already make assumptions and predict four top-level models that will probably conquer street sales details.
These four "smart phone top" models will be available to boys later this autumn.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the boys as early as mid-September.
However, what new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it is spreading a great deal.
If the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences to the iPhone 6s, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of Apple, it is expected that the new model will be completely distinct from previous ones.
Four colours have been spoken about: Black, white, rosé and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the whole of the phone front, lost the home and fingerprints are built on the screen.
JonyIve, the head of Apple design, demands that the new iPhone model be seen as like a glass.
There has also been talk about the iPhone ceramic version.
In addition to an eye-to-the-eye airport, a wireless charge and a more high-quality cameras, a faster A11 process can be expected.
It is certainly one of the most expected smart phones for a year.
A new model, Galaxy channel 8, will start on 23 August.
There have been many rumours that the new Galaxy Can8 will look like.
Admittedly, there are even more business users and S pen allows for even greater functionality.
The telecom fund should have two cameras, one of which is a wave and the other should be television-oriented with a narrow view.
At the moment, no one knows what two cameras are capable of, but in any case it is the first attempt by Samsung, which is certainly comparable to the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
However, we are looking forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has sold three smart phones with Nokia 6 this year, there is still a lack of their flag, Nokia 8, which is already to be presented on 16 August.
We expect a screens stretching from Nokira to 5.3 p.m. and an ultra fast Qualcomm Sivdragon 835 processes and a more resilient brain.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk about aluminium corps and significant levels of water and security IP68.
Like the Samsumark, Nokia has two rear cameras on the new model, which is produced by Zeiss, an optimist.
Once Sony's fixed flag has been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smart phones will be added, with even more innovative functions.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is slightly more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
On the new model of Sony, speculation has been made that its screen is at least curious.
What the reality brings us to see soon, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flagship vessel IFA at the International Technology Expo, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
According to the transcries leaked by television calls, Trump Mexico pressed for payment of the border wall.
The Washington post unveiled transcriptions of phone calls between US President Donald Trumpi and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On 27 January, the Trubunch's phone address to the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was to put an end to public proclamation that he does not intend to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American President loved him for his public condemnation of the wall, saying: 'You must not say this to the press'.
The Trump set up his presidential campaign's promise to build a long distance on the United States' southern border wall and age to make Mexico pay for this project.
It also published transcries of his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turmes, which reveal a tense exchange of views.
He said to Turner that the agreement that the United States would take refugees to Australia is' ludicrous', 'nervous' and 'foolish'; he said that the agreement that was made during the Obama Government would give him the impression of 'lead' because he had proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees into the United States.
The Trump ended the speech by telling the Turner that 'this was the most unpleasant speech of the day'.
The Court of Justice did not take stock of the complaint by the town of OC MRP Liines, where the town of Tartu rejected their offer for the procurement of bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 2029.
It is a handbook rejecting the offer of Liines Tartu bus and coach procurement in the city of OC, because the offer did not meet the requirements, An4 Asiltin, President of the Tartu City Law Service, explained.
This is a public transport service for the Tartu town for the period from 01.07.2019 to 30.06.2029.
The city of MRP Liines complained to the Court of Justice about the judgment of the Tartu district Court.
The national court did not take this action.
Although many people complain in the social media that the gloomy festival is disrupting their night and the whole city is full of the brakes, there are also many who do not have any bad words to say about the festival on the ground.
I am even positively surprised that the shops were so polite.
I did not see any confusion or miscourtesy.
Even with my generosity, I saw 'a pitiful wave of words.
"It is good that it is coming, there is a lot of joy and a joy that has remained like winter," she will be happy to add.
The wave of tyranny coming from a dose does not bother.
When he lives in a central town, he is still playing music on his beaches, the music has not yet arrived at his home.
"But I hope I hear," he says happily.
The discussion in Agnes also tells us that the Grand Festival is rather good for the rest - it will make a significant contribution to the VAT of local merchants.
He also welcomes the fact that the summer capital has come to such a large extent.
Women of conscience do not come into contact with women.
Although I am no longer on the floor, it is nice that rand has revived.
And it is good that the people are moving, and this has already been the case three times, 'a woman says.
The first time was perhaps a little worse.
"Perhaps there were complaints," he is wondering.
But what he said is normal for the summer capitals is what happens on the ground.
"This Weekise is a very good promo for our small town," says Harr, who is on the parade.
Life and the möll have not hit his life's head of debt either.
But for what?
We should all pull together.
Think about how this communication between nations would be better.
After all, the man of music is not black.
This does not happen, although I live near there.
"Good people can save and have no misgivings," he is speaking.
He said that the visitors are visas.
"With the bottles they have, of course, joined a little, but young people are young and a friend - give you to go, but be people and we can do it!"
The inhabitants of this House have travelled away to somewhere by that time, whether to relatives or to those who know.
"But overall, life is having a positive impact on the festival - people like this man," he talks about Tiina with children.
His family, und festival, also does not bother, although last year it was even further away from the street.
Last summer there was a second shelf, then we heard more.
We live outside the city itself that, in fact, it is going to be very well off the coast of the Acka river. "He is speaking.
Pearson cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revitalise business
The British education company Pearson said on Friday that he would cut 3 000 more jobs and reduce his intermediate dividends by 72%, thereby launching another restructuring programme to address the risk of business hardship.
The jobs to be created, which, according to John Fallon, are likely to be concentrated at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be added to the 4 000 posts lost in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced his intention in May to cut costs by a further GBP 300 million (USD 394 million) under the third cost reduction programme to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company that agreed last month to sell its participation in the Penguin Random House to its partner company, Bertelsmann, said that their expectation of a year has not changed since the 1% increase in sales income was announced in the first half of the year to GBP 2.05 billion.

Attack in Kabul: Suicide attack killed NATO soldier
The suicide bombers attacked military convoys in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and several others injured.
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in an incident on the Qarabagh line.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people died in the mosque attack on Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed close to the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said that the explosion on Thursday night took place when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with 'explosives made by man-made persons'.
According to the statement, everything has been injured in a stable state and is being treated in the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to the correspondence, the Taliban and group, known as the so-called Islamic country (Thailand), are an ever-increasing force for the forces in Qarabaghi in Baghdad NATO, are a serious source of concern.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital city.
At the end of July, the car bomb in Kabul was killed mainly by at least 30 people on the Shi'ite line.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in central cities, which has resulted in the most deaths of the military attack on the country since the US-led forces failed the Taliban in 2001.
This violence underlines the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States, Donald Trump, is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country's army and the police.
According to respondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a public confidence crisis against the government, its policies and, in particular, the President, Ashraf Ghan.
Economic partnership agreement annulled the decision to postpone the dubbing regulation
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (United States Environmental Protection Agency) annulled the decision to delay the adoption of the Obama regulation, which obliges states to limit their emissions from the summer, one day after 15 countries were brought to court by the Agency due to this move.
The EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday with the "procedures for determining the ozone content in 2015," by saying that it shows the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe that we need to engage and listen to our national partners," said Scott Pruitt Pruitt, the head of the EPA.
The June EPA had announced its intention to postpone the ozone content levels in the framework of the SSGI system to measure pollution in different parts of the country in order to establish where its level of compliance with the highest air quality standard should be reduced by a further year in 2018.
15 mainly democratic states, together with the Colombian community, put an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trumpi's Government has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, which, according to him, is part of a more comprehensive plan for growth.
However, these efforts have provoked counter-reaction among the democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that the introduction of a ozone-containing air can 'reduce the working capacity of lung wages and increase the risk of respiratory diseases', such as asthma.
German cigarettes can come with a pipe.
German cigarettes and cattle can come from a pipe, as heavy rainfall threaten the European Union's second largest wheat producer, Binoberg writes.
This year, it may be the case that a few weeks of rainfall before harvesting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry only serves to eat animals.
"The quality of the content is far worse than soil and worse than in 2015, Agravis Raiffeen's analysis said Mr Jahard Merla.
This year, up to 40% of German protein can go to animal feed, which is food than usual, in the Agrav forecast.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have experienced any beauty this year.
First of all, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by heat waves in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rainfall, which has continued in August.
Many eyes are on Northern Germany, where rain hinders harvesting.
So far, only five per cent have been repeated.
Most of the crops in the region have not yet been harvested, the local producer of fish announced in Cerac.
'That is quite difficult days' said Frank Deckert Rendsburg, the senior trader of Ceratis.
Consistency in everything, in other words the cumbersome catering for the internal design of Finns
In Kaunis, nature plays its part in the internights of mestic homes, because through large windows, the equated views of Saimaa fishermen reach many (life) rooms.
Every step in the eyes of our northern neighbours is the attempt to create both tough and perfect (energy-saving) homes.
Timber use of Finns deserves to be used as construction and repair material, furniture and beauty.
Virtual techniques and smart solutions can be found in mesh houses, both in the builder and in the (home).
There is a clear point that the combination of black, white and grey properties, if they are complemented by wood labels and food plants, can be very desperate.
Good ideas will be available for a week to come, as the Fair will run until 13 August.
Suppliers and spices suggest that this kitchen is often copied.
The line drawn down today against the Ööl was downwards to the Weekise Festival Baltica, and Martin Garrido did all he could to remember as the last speaker.
The people were really turning at the time of the speech by Mr Garrido - a song, a song, a fat, a dance of self-interest.
When Garrido ended, the common masterpiece of the town was disbanded.
We are bringing you to the gallery, where there are all the images that our photographer tried for three days in Weekler.
You are certainly a few of them too, you are looking for yourself!
Mainy Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mainy Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face up to the most attractive polemysis of the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were on a separate tobacco at the ESPN office in LOS Angeles until Garcia, the victorious World BoşCouncil lightweight champion, walked the second side of the corridor to welcome Lomachenkot, the World BoTFzationi sulgynipion.
Following the unanimous decision by Garcia, the victory of the former four-day world champions, Adrien Broner, will be on Saturday in Showws, both fighters will be at the top of the table.
Garcia gave her better hand and said: 'How does you go, the cheque goes?
I wish you every success. "
Lomachenko will defend his belts against Miguel Marrika on Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
When a few photographs were available, the Mayor of Lomachenko, Eg Climate, stated that a possible confrontation between militants would be 'perfect moderation'.
"I am a former chemist," I recall Garcia.
"I called for Broner [63.5 kg], but I am not so large.
I am small about 63.5 kg.
I want to move down to lightweight.
And he needs to move up the light [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The players have asked for this.
So let us offer them this intervention. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world of Poxony needs this fight."
The question raised by the climate was whether it should be cost-effective, and is part of his strategy of allowing Lomachenkol to hold a debate to the end of this year at 61.2 kg in a class to make it possible for next summer to meet with Garcier (37-0, 30 novans), who also have an interest in combating Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbelli's match with their favourite title of Forutis, which will take place on 23 September.
"Looking at this fight could be worthwhile because fans have called for it to be opposed," said Garcia later, saying that he was open to fighting any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are the main players.
No other name can gain so much attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said that he considered Lomachenkot to be a 'powerful champion' and that he could go to his daughter on Saturday.
Lomachenko, however, was timid in praising Garcia, saying that he thought that the three champions of divisjon from Riverts saw 'very slow'; I am sorry, Mainy... you wanted it to be nodistant '.
According to Garcia, the aim was to show strength and then to shop.
They both confirmed that they felt how the tension between them is increasing in order to cope with their prosperity.
"This is a fight that awaits realisation.
None of the other confrontations raise so much attention and gender.
I am more than prepared to work on this, 'said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: 'I have been waiting for the best fighters, and Mainy has done just that.
This will be a good fight. "
What world pressure is being moved to Estonia?
Soil extended and issued a record of over 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals mostly travelling to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, when it was decided to issue a fixed-term residence permit for 6702 foreign nationals, this figure was 4928.
The agencies cannot tell us how many immigrants will finally remain in Estonia permanently, but this analysis will be drawn up in the Ministry of the Interior.
When, ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians went to Estonia a year, this figure will reach 2 000 in recent years.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased exponentially during the Ukrainian crisis - 1087 people received fixed-term residence permits in 2014 - 675 a year earlier.
In Estonia, the statistical agency provides the largest number of Ukrainian citizens growing, with 850 Ukrainian citizens getting soil in Estonia more than they left.
"The Ukrainian community has been great in Estonia all the time and, due to the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are being sought from a country where the community and many others are already ahead of the family," said Christin Rammus, a spokesman at the Ministry of the Interior.
The number of Ukrainians authorised for fixed-term residence was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, even though, in ten years, the most fixed residence permits have been issued.
If Ukrainians come to work here for the sake of family migration, Russian citizens will be able to do so.
"Given this historic Russian community, they are also most likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia," said the migration theatre Helina Meing, the Internal Defence Academy.
'When you look at where the Russian citizens who have received a residence permit from Estonia have moved to live, after Harjuland, he added and pointed out that around 40% of them had married with a European Union citizen '.
Soil was authorised for fixed-term residence of 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit has decreased.
"Compensation is because, instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been requested for Estonia to be permanently established," the press representative of the Ministry of the Interior, Rammus, said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia's residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
The new residence permit for the permanent establishment of Estonia can be applied by foreign nationals living here for at least three years from last year.
Its aim is to encourage the transition of adapted people.
However, a long-term residence permit requires five years, for example.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased.
For example, soil was granted such a residence permit for 146 Ukrainians, who have been working here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can change their jobs and the Estonian state no longer takes the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit was popular - the holders of a bad passport (1029), the Russians (487), the individuals (54) and the teenagers (36) would be applying for a residence permit.
A total of 1968 people received residence permits to reside in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese, for example.
This first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has become a country with one of the most active Estonia's residence applications.
When, in 2007, three residence permits were issued to teenagers, there were 200 soil.
From Nigeria, lessons are being learned to universities here.
Higher education institutions in Estonia are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turkish, for example.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to student games.
For them, too, the rule applies that where the community is ahead, there will be more simple others, "added Rammus.
For ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, just as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If around 6 000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit every year, this is around 0.46% of the total population.
Even if we look at the citizens of the European Union, migration will remain around a percentage, "the Meuse commented that the figures were actually small.
Overall, 14 822 people were exposed to soil in Estonia, 13 792 out of it, according to the statistical agency.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
Most of them are citizens of Estonia, but there are more of them among those who are leaving.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was in a mine with 2 000 people.
Children migrate, in particular, between Finland and Estonia.
Moudam princess slun with sats, chickens and blunt
In the north-west of ideas, however, there is a history for Maria Tampere, an old paint and defendants: 'I can dream somewhere for hours, somewhere in the museum, and I can admire old theft and degrees.
If you study and learn something about it every day.
That is a delight!
A world that has long been Coudam's stray may seem like a few living aliens, but the designer does not think so.
You yourself decide how much your life is!
As a friend, I have a whole saun full of the sharks I have created, couple brokers.
Because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not go into a red boy every day, he also wants to wear the most beautiful brokers, and that is what he is suffering!
You can live your own life special to your life!
A mobile artist does not recognise the divide between staggering events and a bad day.
It was precisely this reasoning that prompted a plan to shift the high-calibre into the land area of Estonia, between forests and fields, to the people who often do not get the habit.
Mong a collectus was presented, for example, on the comparison, Jair and Koka's motto, where with 45 modelles King's defiles, the whole street was carried out.
In Tallinn, you are often hanged in a shop, they are nodding with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - there is a columvo, you rise up, you want to thank you for your involvement.
A large proportion of the audience had to be equally curious, but they are now Moudam fans.
If you are above people's expectations, they are dismayed!
And I like the feeling that I am with my motive as if I were in summer.
Pernus had a red carpet of 50 metres, a whole street full of these brokers, it seemed they did not come to an end!
Nor does Mrs Maria accept the motive that creation must be presented with a superficial supermotive, she is happy to bring ordinary women to the wrong end.
I often invite my own customers to lake - they have always been happy to come.
After all, it is so lax to see experience, you got a wonderful chat on the bottom line!
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own role, I am always behind the shelf to give the last meat to things as a hopeless comphecy.
My nervous would not allow a calm eye from the Chamber.
Mrs Maria ong is the author of this kind, who wants not only to play a representative role but to be present in everything involved.
I have my own sister at the core, most of the collections myself.
I like the whole process in which you played with details, you will find out.
I am never far from my nature and I am not afraid of the work.
It is not the only thing to do, but also the style, logistics, organisation, organisation - everyone has to take away one staunch woman's day.
These hours of work are still huge for fanatics.
I cannot say when my working day ends, for me this is simply a day full of joy!
I have still been very lucky - it is like a never-ending joke: I am doing something beautiful, a man gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
It has been said many times that my brothers have a land - they make themselves feel printed.
The generous treasure that Mrs Maria talent made to hear yesterday has been left to date for the Mong Coudam signals.
Martin Myrseu U18 boys: The albinary turf of the Estonians was now turned against us
The damage, the fairy tale, came to an end.
The first thing to do was to see that we were not able to sit on our table.
And if there is such a big difference in the table, there is nothing to do ', Estonia commented 61: 75 falling to Britain our only corps in NBB, Martin Myrsep.
The opponents took 28 faces from the south and suffered so many more attacks as a result.
Nor were we prepared for their aggressive defence or attack, it created.
Many attacks by the English ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build protection.
In defence, however, they managed to keep their hands everywhere; we were unable to combine.
This team created its feet.
The homework of the opponents was better done.
According to the Mysepa, Estonia had to make more tactical mistakes in order to remove the momentum of the opponents.
In the last quarter, we had a zero error, but the opponents have already received several quick records.
The admissibility and intense insistence, which was our weapon on alagroturdy, all of us now turned against us.
Today, we did not have the strength against their aggressive nature.
The centre remained satisfied with its negligence in Kalevis, Matthia Tass.
In general, tourism can say good words about the whole team; to date, there was a single shock.
It is a pity that such aggressive responses had not been met in the past.
He has always been self-confident and played out today, but he seemed to have been tired - he has borne quite a heavy burden.
But he made some of the beautiful moves I have seen before in a trennite, "added the leader.
Terrible numbers: The nearing corps were thrown down by less than 10 points at EM turnia with three quarter...
In U18 age classes, not only do the young men of the House B-divisjon Corvpalliturniir in Tallinn, she started in Dublin the day after yesterday.
And, unfortunately, Estonia's game with Poland was hanging into antirees.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but still after the third quarter, there was a state of play of 9: 49, that is to say, 49, only in the last ten minutes, adopted an opponent from the gas peat, and that period remained at 16: 16.
In the first and second quarter, Estonia had 4, the third point...
In so doing, at the beginning of the four minutes, two pieces of the first two, but another 25 pieces of play, then one of the tricks in, and then 21 more till...
Perhaps, in almost half an hour, one of the 47 slogans was ticked.
In addition, 2 (4) came from the jungle.
The many losses were a reasonable figure of 12 at that time.
At the end of the game, Poland faced 33 and 13% of Estonia (68 / 9).
Estonia has started with two losses on the open day to recognise Portugal's 83: 56 better.
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement stocks
Today, NATO arrived at the 1 permanent mine group for the weekend between Tallinn and the planned port visit, to complement the stocks of vessels and to prepare for the forthcoming exercise.
During the course of the visit, vessels are preparing to land and, at the same time, provide crews with the possibility of a parochial holiday.
Following the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future historical explosives search operations.
"The participation of children in and in local waters of NATO is a good illustration of our integration with the allied forces," said the upper Operation and Planning unit of the naval flotilla in the top-up of the operational and planning station, Arto Reinland.
As of 29 June, NATO will chair 1 permanent anti-personnel group of Latvian navido Laudups, Gvido Laudups, who, at a ceremony in Riga, took over the tasks of a group from the Estonian naval officer, Captenitnant Johan-Elias, Johan-Elias Seljab.
The group's flagship ship has been designated as LVNS Virsatas, a Latvian naval sponsor, which also operates the group's leading position.
This half-year, the Estonian seabed of the naval force is also part of the region.
As one of the four groups of vessels subject to NATO's naval management, NATO is the 1 permanent mine group, which is among the primary quick reaction actors, a task force that can be sent within five days by the Alliance to different locations in the world.
4. Until 13 August, the mutuals of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the Maestro Eri Kid, who was called for by Birgitta Festival, is being buried 13 years ago.
This year, Burma, Festival, says that the artistic leader of the Tallinn Film Festival, is going to be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risk Joost: Cuba will end up in the classrooms of the 'Travieta' and 'Tosca', balletilaanswers from the lumm 'Bolerost' Like 'Karlssonini', and neither will the plan be left with its own production, this time by Joseph Haydni's wonderful orchestra, by the same creative team, who, in 2015, even brought the creation of Pirilata Haydn, even into the works of the Hague.
Mrs Festival has much more than just groups and theatres.
It is greater than any music theatre in its normal form.
It is at a festival whose snow is taking hold and is never completely dispelled.
Because the experience that the lisher receives in this superior and insidious environment makes human beings blunt and concerns human values in a way that cannot be described.
To the risk, you are the art leader of Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Did the maestro Eri Kid not feel a little big?
Of course, because I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klaus, it has been very helpful.
He went through my entire student career and also supported the change at the beginning of his career.
Perhaps thanks to this, it will be easier for me to continue his work.
The Burmese Festival team has coal so much well and, of course, all of this goes to me.
It was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things go.
It was Mrs Kess's great heart that also gave me the strength to go well with her Festival in the Festival of Tallinn in harmony with Birgitta.
And here I am and I can do it!
What could be the audience this year's festival, what are you offering in particular?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, surprisingly, the first ballett written by Mrs Lindgreni comes to the presentation.
That is' Karlsson fly '.
And one criminal nuance about this is that the author of this balleti is the Latvian composer Juris Karlance, who himself expressed a desire to write on this work.
Obviously, she has already been living in a child's breath in Karlsson's carater.
To the risk, how are you all angry about this?
Thanks to my supportive life compatriot certainly.
Such work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I am happy to have it colluded.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions are not so much dependent on other people, as I myself may be, how I am going to oppose every new day.
And such a conscious tone, keeping positive and actually naming ourselves into the mirror this morning has greatly increased my happy%.
Especially this week, when there are the most important tests, I have been particularly keen to practise it and it is working.
Self-promotion accentuates the brain and highlights the tone.
That is not just a word.
I think that people do not yet know anything about their own body that the universe offers them, but everyone himself is slowly finding it out.
Now, this is an important moment.
Does you have a kind of clothes before you take a dirigent?
There is still, clothing must be replaced against more convenient ones.
This is a small moment for ourselves.
But, in general, yes, I do not have the opportunity to flee or make a little stunt before you speak.
In fact, I even like to engage actively with people, even before the dirigene is taken.
But come to Burma all to the Festival, and here it is also not particularly large ooperators and balleti's friend!
See a despair video with the risk to Joogy!
New results of the Swedish age assessment tests for asylum seekers were published
In Sweden, there were asylum seekers who assessed their age with a medical approach, and the latest results of the test show that more than 80% of the constitutions were judged to be older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute for Justice medicine (Routstisinalvert) started with tests later this year.
The tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of age in the context of asylum application, after the Swedish Migration Office (migration) criticised for failing to correctly define the age of a number of allegedly underage refugees.
Up to now, migration has sent 6880 cases to testing and the Institute for medicine has issued 24 81 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) was estimated at 18 years or older, and 25 more cases, the Institute assessed that the test "may be 18 years old or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is' probably younger than 18 '.
Tests will only be used if the age of the person is called into question.
According to Johan GöControl son, who works in the institution of justice, the results are consistent compared to those of the previous months.
"We do not see a great deal of difference from previous months' statistics, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to the newspaper The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were estimated to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have chosen their age.
The Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that in 442 cases, 'there are indications that the person surveyed is 18 or older'.
However, when the newspaper Svensson Dagblav examined the results of his 581 test, it became clear that in 243 cases, people had directly claimed that they would receive 18 this year.
This method of assessing medical age, through which therapeutic röngenis and sleeping tracks MRT are carried out, have been criticised in some quarters, after which they will be allowed to be analysed by toothm doctors and radiologists.
One of the sceptics is the Enkrinologist Claude Marcus, the Karolinska Institute of Technology, whose task is the assessment of people's biological maturity in order to find out whether they were going through audiences sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement method currently being used should be used.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot be clear, we should not pretend that we can, 'he said forestry to the newspaper.
But Johan GöControl son from the institution of judicial medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: 'Generally speaking, the risk of leaving the child inaccurate to adults is low.
Perhaps at around 10% the greatest risk is that a person is just under 18. "

The 20-year-old last-old newspaper Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debate on the London Mil Mil, with 67.37 receiving a good 18 seats.
Orel, MM was a noorim of women's fingers, and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for the medals in the future.
The contest went well and had a good experience.
With the first attempt (64.80), I immediately took the risk of my average result, the second (62.80), and the third (67.37) I was able to keep it almost clear, "said Other after the contest.
I chose my emissions, and I am very pleased that I found it.
Mrs Oreli MM's debate ended with a good 18 seats.
Vihmasadu Orelit did not mix, because he is training through the winter at the LTTE stage.
'I am feared ', he said with little muddle.
The London Olympic Games almost had a full house of people, did Orel drag people around him or were he able to get himself off?
I did, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it will add - that is the case!
If you compete yourself, you can experience it.
After all, it was confirmed that MM's debate would be satisfied and that there are still many good competitions ahead of him: 'I came here with 32nd, the last result, I ended at 18.
This is a very good result.
I am 20 years old and I am a man - that is the only thing that matters.
I am taking a good experience and, some days, I want to compete on behalf of the medals.
Western Virgina Governor announced party change
At the meeting on Thursday night with President Trumper, the democratic Governor of Western Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that he would change the parties.
"Whether it or not, the democrats spoke from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having creeped up a lot and wondered... today I am telling you, the Western Pole, that I can no longer help you as a democratic treasure."
There were some positive conversations at the meeting.
"So I am going to be Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"As an engineer, I would say to you that it is time to play another game."
The Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the meeting of Western Virginia.
The Trump won 42 points in Western Virginia and Justice did not support the Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forteri, is the only billion dollars in the State, proved to be elected in 2016.
It notes that it belongs to coal mines in five states and to the coal business in its own right.
Its value is around USD 1.59 billion.
At the same time, on Thursday night, the National Committee of Republican (RNC) published an announcement that 'the party exchange of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would prevent the country from improving rather than working for it'.
'One out of just 15 tissues and controls on the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent expression of the parade, which is not able to find a positive and united message 'said RNC's representative Ronna Daniel Mcin his statement to CBS Newsi.
It is no surprise that there are many people there, there are also many injured.
Mrs Urker, who was in charge of her medicine, said yesterday to the Lady that they had to distribute quite a lot of posters.
Fruit and fats are fundamental, lies and begging falls.
Of course, the possessions -, behind and over.
According to the Urmeti, visitors will come to the festival with false footsteps, and so the problems will come.
The media have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic and also one foot of the foot.
We have also made leaflets when a person has made a hand or a finger break.
We are doing fewer nurses here, we are sending more to hospital.
See the video whether the solemn media are also asking for a painkiller to be treated as a bogus.
Coe gave honest apologies to the Russians for Doping
Sebastian Coe, the International front of the Kergean, has, according to his words, praised 'Russia's honest apology on Thursday' for doping, but reiterated that this is not the time to allow sport back to the country.
In the run-up to the World Cup of the gift of the lighter Russian Chancellor, Dmitry Shylachtin, said at the Congress of the IAAF that the ban on the contest imposed on his country was the right one and that he had a clear objective to combat doping.
He asked for an apology 'from all lightweight classes who have been drained away from the contest by golden and silver medals'.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the entry into force of the contest ban, which was introduced in November 2015 after the WADA report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think this was a very honest response today, a very honest presentation," said President Coe, the President of the IAAF.
"The whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that Russia itself acknowledged that they had quite difficult times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Union."
In addition, according to Coe, she was pleased that Russia accepted its own recovery criteria.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but the Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything possible to normalise the situation in the next few months.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the system that has been breached, "he added.
One of the sixteen Russian light workers who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World Cup in London on Friday.
Rune Andersson, leader of the IAAF Group, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet a number of criteria for forecasting.
Following a presentation to the IAEA Council, she told journalists in London that doping controls were still insufficient and that trained engineers were still operating freely.
The revolution in electric cars will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the revolution in electric cars change significantly from the fuel market to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining companies like Glencore can say that they will win from one place and lose out on the other, smaller mining companies will not help.
Today, Glencore coal and oil are serving, but in the age of electric cars, coding, lithium, copper, aluminium and nicotine demand are growing.
This year, the decisions taken by the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway to allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades have increased their contributions to the spread of electric cars.
Sesvo has therefore already knew that they intend to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will bring a cheaper 7.5 electric car onto the market.
Binberg New Energy Finance estimates that over two decades more electric cars will be sold than fuel produced from oil.
"On some metals, this will change everything," the Capital Öicsi raw materials analyst Simona Gambranin Bbeef said.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as coding and lithium, which have increased demand for years.
There are about three times more copies in electric cars than in the ordinary car, Glenner announced.
More answers are needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paris estimates that this will increase domestic demand by around 5% by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, grape and manganese.
Glenner will benefit from the growing trend of electric cars from domestic prices and the fact that it is the world's largest coding manufacturer is predicted by the Jomentrale Group.
This broker estimates that FFriday's-McMoRan and First Quanma Minerma will be the winners of the other electric car race.
The market is responding to a changing trend.
This year, there has been a 70% increase in the London metal stock code.
The increase in soil prices was 37%.
The last has also risen by 14% this year, mainly because of economic growth.
The share of Glenner rose by 20% in London, having exceeded the price increase to the rival, BHP Billiton and Anglo Plus.
On the side of the defendants, there are lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine, which must adapt to a new era.
The main end-use use of petrol and diesel is the batteries supplying the breaders with the flow of cars with the petrol and diesel engine.
Electric cars use glaciers.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand except if it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand," the Bank of America, Merrill Gych, analysed the metal market, Michael Widmer, said.
The price movements of the sun have not yet seen the effects of the unrivalled trend.
Plii has risen by 17% this year, the best metaphoric in London among the main industrial metals.
Investors will see problems with metal in the future.
"I am not sure that this is so bad for lead, because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, the metal broker Triland Metalsi's sales leader.
If the demand for lead falls, it will be slow.
That may be the case in about ten years' time.
At the same time, however, stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depend on the frequent introduction of engines of lead-based batteries, will assess the international lead and research organisation.
Metal metals such as aluminium replace steel, as a lighter car can drive further away from less electricity.
This explains the additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes between 2013 and 2016.
This represents 2.7% of the world's aluminium's output.
This trend is likely to grow, says Widmer.
Aluminium has risen by 13% this year, as growing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers do not.
Ak Sway holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnologies to produce miraculous cars.
ArcelorMittal and Sway Europe are also trying to develop a lighter meltdown from steel to resist a minimum.
"One-strong steel should respond to this development," said Exane BNP Paris's analysis, Sylvain Brunet.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to a plate.
Soil took around half of this to the catalysts of cars with a precious diesel engine, according to Johnson Matmers, the metal refiner.
"Many raw materials with high demand, such as oil and plate, may not have a high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, Natixis the analysis of raw materials.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole are becoming less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
The planned producers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, leader of Uncore, said that more hybrid cars would continue to be sold in 2025.
In the 10-year perspective, the great hope of the planned manufacturers is that the cars based on the hydrogen element, based on Toyota Motors and Hygusi Motosi, are developed, depending on the platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
So far, however, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"The dialogue seems to be clear on the road to electric cars," said Exane BNP from Paris to Brunet.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July because the Stuttgart Court refused diesel in the home town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How financial rules for football affect the transition of Neyra to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the uncontrolled spending of European football clubs do not prevent the record transition of Neymark from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona club of Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body, which dominates the game of Europe and which has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious League of Meisministers' turniel, await Paris in the front of Saint-GerMay.
The financial rules on fair play established by UEFA in 2011 (FFP) mean that PSG must demonstrate at some point that the transition of Neymark was financed without huge losses.
EUR 222 million (USD 262 million) were paid to Barcelona alone for the sale of a browser from his agreement, and the Neymari wage will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are some financial aspects of Neymari's transfer to the French club.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to bail out such money to recruit Neymari and add its stars to a rival, given that the team is funded by the family dominated by the Katar Energy bill.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players, but they must balance it with legal sources of income that will enable them to come out of the football business.
FP was founded on Michel Platini after he was elected as President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs, who are successful in search of large debts, are actually dealing with fraud and risk ruin if banks or owners were to give up their support.
From 2011 onwards, FP will focus on monitoring the losses instead of the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then to make major costs in order to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
In the current three-year evaluation period of FP, which runs until 2018, clubs can bear up to €30 million in losses.
And despite the shameless rejection of the presidential office by Platini in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules," last week said The Emblele Andrea Traverso, UEFA-s FP, who is a watchdog.
Although PSG's attachment for the overpurchase clause of Neymark as one of the full payments, they are able to distribute this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire contract's duration.
Neymar concluded a five-year agreement, which is why the transitional fee can be shown in paragraph 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
For the first wave of sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Manchester Cityga, was the hardest hit.
The PSG was charged with a fine of EUR 60 million (currently EUR 82 million), which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and a club was requested to limit the team of Meisters in the season 2014-2015 to 21 players instead of normal 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs who can try to drive over-regulate financial institutions by pulling up their incomes through companies linked to the owners of the club.
The company of Qatar may sponsor PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is deemed to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that Qatar Tourism Authority PSG's support value was breathing.
It has been said that a certain part of the Mormari PSG service can come from Kainfrastructure through payments from the World Cup Committee in 2022.
However, PSG and Qtar 2022 deny that Neyra could become a member of the World Cup and claim that UEFA's regulatory authorities can easily reveal such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in any attempt to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition to PSG Neyra proactively.
They talked to The Pope on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed because they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG.
The latest reports show that more than €10 million of revenue in the PSG's 2015-2016 season is worth around €542.4 million in turnover.
The latest financial year data has not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, on trade and on the sale of labels.
The club expects an increase of at least 30% in connection with the conclusion of the agreement.
Spain too, being clearly irritated by the departure of one of the largest football stars, tried to prevent Neyra's transition by claiming that the PSG would be in breach of the FP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with a club and a country," President Javier Tebas said to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that the PSG was primarily a member of Katarial.
ArşWenger, a man from Arsenal, whose club belongs to the American sporting magnificent, shares the view that the state finances the club.
"This is the result of ownership rights and has changed fully the whole football landscape in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"When a club belongs to a state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, because the country may have other ways or other interests to ensure that such a large player represents the country. "

The hurricane mentioned as the storm of the century, which on 6 and 7 August caused major damage, particularly to the Baltic States, to Harjuland and to the Bay of Rapkay.
Over 30 m / s was at the heart of these days in Estonia.
My grandson drink from one map to another and his permeability to support them with the means to support them.
Everyone was blind and on track, as was the lesson of the world.
In 2002, the old Mrs Linda Kurova was already flying from the houses, recalling the magazine of the old newspaper, Linda Kurova, in an interview in Estonia's nature.
The husband of Linda saw how the animals he was sitting together collapsed.
But what did you come back with your hands, where are you receiving such a storm?
The sea came under the window, from windows to water, "said Mrs Linda tone, who was living on the streets of Haapsalus Kalda.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and that the cabin of the railway station had flights to 20-30 metres long saw Linda Linda the majority of sharks just next morning.
According to the local saying, the trees behind Paralepa were behind nature, some were completely long, some were boys.
Everyone saw very depressing, the storm went through beautiful old trees as a ragbag and pragmatism like war.
Western Virua was not particularly hard hit by August 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the losses were even large there, and the Viruland Official wrote in 2007.
The maize Park and Padise Park were swept away from the amble, but our entire parks were also severely affected.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured as a matter of up to 35 metres per second, or around 130 kilometres per hour.
In the Tallinn town of Meriexpression on the evening of 6.August, one tears of lead had shouted: 'Mother, mother!
Books are in the air and they are no longer getting under! ', the Viruland Official Journal wrote.
At the time of the storm, the generation's concept of Good was destroyed so much that it was decided to be dismantled at a later stage.
The design of Türi's ski mountains, which was not subsequently restored, was not opposed to August.
The newspaper Red Tét wrote on 12 August 1967 that cleaning up towns and settlements from swept trees and their oxygen is progressing slowly, and the population could get involved in cleaning work.
Cereals also suffered a great deal from the Turin, and the newspaper stated that 'party organisations must be an incentive and direction for both cleaning and fertility'.
You can talk about Orwelles if the average speed of the wind exceeds 32.7 m / s.
A record of the timber wind in Estonia will persist from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul measured as a matter of urgency 48 m / s.
The island of Vaink broke a metre, so it was not able to register exactly the high speed of the wind it measured.
Secret of bathing areas: Night cleaning and poor coastal land
Faster summer spring also means less cleaning in the bathing areas of Tallinn.
'If there is no, people are on the rank and, if not, there are no people ', the rank will be recognised.
The Stroom beaches of Northern Tallinn are preoccupied.
They are offered a separate tractor on the back of the lax of creative competition, which lags behind the poster's tricks.
In fact, the last seven centimetres of sailing from the depths of the sea and the risk that people are left behind: Bottles, cigarettes and so on.
People still come to rank, whether water is soya or not.
If it is beautiful, then people are on the rank and, if not, there are no people, 'the management of the Haaberati company, Mr Usov, the head of the catering work, says.
There are 6.30 p.m. and there is a bitter cleaning work on the ground, because at eight o'clock the plates must be in order for the people to be in order.
The deadline is already 4: 00.
Apart from Stroom, he is still keeping his eye on the Pirita, the Harvel Lake, Kakumäe and the Pikakari rank.
The quantity of landfills has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more so.
People are now already able to assess what is being done for them, 'Usov, who has repeated the migrants for 15 years.
Before it was that, when something new was put up, it was already the next day.
Now it is already being kept to what beaches.
Price of clean beaches
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the seafood of marine rubbish, that is, the repetition of adru.
For example, on the surface of Pirita, this must be transported 400 000 tonnes from the coastal season.
'It is an incredible amount 'notes Usov.
The second large category is municipal waste, that is to say everything that people are leaving behind.
There are eight large waste cantons on the one-kilometre scale Stroom coast, which need to be dismantled three times a week.
So much is happening with rubbish.
However, the cold summer weather has meant that the waste is a fifth less than it was.
The third category consists of neglected things.
In most cases, they are children's TV.
At that time, the Usov sand has kicked off a decade of mutuum.
They will be waiting for owners to drag on the route of timber.
'normally they come out more, but that is normal harvesting ', and it is already well known that it will soon find them again in the sand.
Children come to rank and take toys to re-install them in the sand.
Prüm is being torn up
The administrative services representative, Erika Scholler, admitted that the screening work of the tractor was disrupted by local communities.
Noise, which runs from night hours to early storage, is disrupting the population of neighbouring countries.
On the day, however, this work is impossible.
One month, rand will have to go through twice.
"If we do not do this, we will be fined for the part of the city, Scholler will point out.
However, the aim is, like Pirita, Pikkar and Kok, to get Stroom rand down to the quality of the international flag.
"In Estonia, compared to Europe, there is much more work in place to ensure that the beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We have more adru and heaven and more difficult to live in sand.
However, we have less rubbish on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Listening to the talk of rubbish on the ground, Martin, who is living near Stroom, is moving around the interviews of journalists and cleaning staff, highlighting the current difficulties.
Tomorrow, there is a picture of the gallery everywhere.
The problem is that of birds and net slaves who have pulled the rubbish cows into a boat, "Martin says.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour so far, Martin hopes that the urban Government will do something about the rubbish bars and, for example, will put the cats on them to prevent at least birds from spreading there.
However, overall, Martin is pleased with the development of Stroom beaches.
We can see that the city is taking care of this.
It has become more appealing with children's fields, enlightened and newly asphoned roads.
Once it was the case that only one way of travelling on the ground was possible, 'Martin notes.
Aardeyte bread in Stroomis: Coins, only coins
The 40-year-old Dimitri, who drives the metal metal off the coastline, has had to be exploited for a measurement period.
He does not believe that anything can be found today or in the future.
Marine God is not generous enough to do so.
"I have been working on this year and I have not found anything worthwhile so far," says Dmitry.
There are some euro coins, barrels and also dangerous pounds in Dmitry's treasure, which will later be thrown into the dustbin.
There are usually coins.
'Culture, fingers and so on usually do not exist ', it is a treasure village.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at the same level as weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have softened speculation on the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain a loophole, as households' hard incomes have put interest rates on the waiting.
Policy makers in the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) voted 6: 2% to keep to 0.25%, and fewer Members are calling for an increase this month because slow growth has weakened support for growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 from 1.7% to 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households' incomes would persist, as inflation is expected to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank also signalled that the increase in the rates would be necessary to curb inflation due to Brexy over the next few years, and that the financial markets could need to be more than expected to increase their lending costs.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package into the economy triggered by Brexs.
The Bank will end its fixed-term financing scheme in February, which offers banks cheap funding, although it said that it now has GBP 15 billion to be expected under this scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the Bank says: 'Gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption'.
As regards the rates, it was reiterated that 'some effort on monetary policy is needed to reduce inflation' and 'somewhat higher' than the markets are expected.
Mr rs is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any goodwill is gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and for next year are 1.9% and 1.7% comparable to May's forecasts.
The forecast for 1.8% growth in 2018 remained.
After that boom, the dollar and the euro fell.
Women have fallen by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures, which have raised growing expectations of the rise in energy GDP in the second quarter of the previous three months by 0.2% to 0.3%.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will recover a little of momentum.
The Bank's most recent inflation report gave little reason to soaring inflation and pitiful wage increases to households, saying that the situation will be slightly worse before the improvement is made.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent the loss of income in the next few years, but a marked recovery is expected at the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak pound also encourages the economy to grow demand for British production, partly benefiting from lower costs for consumers.
The decision comes one year after the rates were taken at 0.25% last August after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
The bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to fully breathe life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last decision, there was a growing demand for growth, as inflation had increased pressure on hard-pressed households; in July, three policymakers called for an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell from 2.6% last month to 2.9% compared to 2.9% in June, although it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2% target was due to a completely weak pound.
Mr Montlake, the head of Coreco's mortgage brokers, said: 'In view of the recent decline in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive once again, as creditors want to get out of work and hope to complete the year in a positive way.
Mr rs seems to be particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end, as refinancing, often without service and with a low rate, has become increasingly popular. "
NHS signs 10 000 HIV drugs that have led to conflict
Patients will have access from September to 'transformative' treatment for HIV prevention after the battle held by the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the medicine.
The NHS announced that public health is now estimated to make available to 10 000 people in the initial three-year clinical trial (PrEP) - a tablet that is manned before the mid-term and which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection for people with high risk by around 86%.
The NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the Court of appeal supported last year's ruling that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
The Managing Director of the NHS England, Simon Stepsm, welcomed this launch unveiled on Thursday as' new, large-scale intervention ', while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as' pivotal moments'.
Mental health clinics in London, Bright ton, Manchester, Liverpoolis and Sheffield are among the first to register people; in October, there will be more clinics before the programme is introduced everywhere in England by April 2018.
The collision-prophylactic (PrEP) is a tree of HIV drugs to be taken before the mid-term review in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people with the risk of infection.
The PrEP's take-up before the weekend means that there are a sufficient number of medicinal products that prevent HIV from being infected.
Such medicinal products can be taken every day or no later than two hours before the break.
Equal candidates include lesbian or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment.
Routes identify suitable people who agree to participate in clinical trials, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-related partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate in a local sexual health clinical trial participating in the programme.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed the contract to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended for and how it is consumed and implemented in a large cloud.
SteSea said: 'This new, wide-ranging intervention should complement and intensify a wide-ranging and increasingly successful fight against HIV proliferation.
This is another milestone in more than three decades' struggle against one of humanity's greatest health problems. "
Deborah gold, CEO of NAT, said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
The PrEP, if it is properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk sheer, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risks in England will have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, Executive Director of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: 'Now it is a priority to ensure that a clinical attempt at a rapid transition across the country is made and that none of the HIV risk groups is left aside.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been received, we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, Minister for Public Health, said: 'The start of the PrEP clinical test is very welcome and very late after months of delay and counting government feet.
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to HIV prevention and to the end of the spread of its life-changing infection.
This clinical attempt takes us a step closer to full understanding of the benefits of the PrEP.
It is now important that a clinical attempt is deployed across the country as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV and take us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
The difference between the prices of next day's electricity between the Estonian and Latvian and Lithuanian prices decreased to EUR 1.94, compared to EUR 7.71 this June, announced Elering.
The main reason for the price gap is the wealth of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average stock exchange price for electricity was set at EUR 34.33 / hour last month and the price rose by 12% compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megaxic.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the electricity exchanges' Nord 'system price was at the same time EUR 26.37 per megaky-hour.
Prices rose by 12 and 7% respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved from 75% last month to Estonia and 16% from Estonia to Finland to Finland.
The remaining nine% of the hours between two countries did not take place on the next day.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved 99% of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73% of the hours used the full transmission capacity.
According to transactions on the last trading day in July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the price of the electricity exchanges in August could be around 34 and EUR 37 per megakle in September.
The carbon price affecting electricity production increased last month and transactions took place at 5.04-5.47 per tonne.
Life of higher education - semi-order and smart designers have turned this small Earls into a house of the Court's house
Joanne Lecio, a former banker who is a passionate building refurbished his great Knightsbridge home in 2014 against the Earls Court.
It is in the first order of Queen Anne Terşi, and the fact that Joanne has not packed his cots and sold the flame forward is an honour for a new design.
"Before that, I lived on a much larger soil with a former life co-member, Knightsbridge," said Joanne.
"I did something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown by the Earls Court's flax and had the same high lakes.
I experienced it and made an offer on the same day. "
Since its first visit, this 93-metre corps have gone through a full innovation tree.
At the beginning, it was one of the sleeping rooms and a complex one-stop shop - to get a sleeping ashes through the kitchen, and Joanne wanted to add savings and quasi-order in order to take advantage of the high levels of proposals.
"I wanted high-profile, big windows, a lot of light.
These were my demands, 'he said.
He asked Erfan Azad Notting from the architectural and designer radio Duck & D to take advantage of 3.8 m of the ears and to create a home that is not just an object of development, but a place where Joanne can live.
Lia was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create half-order, where one could stand.
Erfan had to take a creative approach to the matter.
"The design is quite complicated," he explains.
"We needed to reorganise the premises so that they are located on each other without having to bow.
It was not just about building a platform, but about steel construction so that we can get the right balance between overshooting and lower space. "
This emphasis enabled Erfano to create two full-ears in space with a lot of dramatic elements.
From the Retrouvius window to the breadth of mass housing under the sun, the answer to the old era is open.
The golden furniture, silver details and retrospect Serge Mouille lighting highlight space style.
The use of herbs plays a role in adding communication, space and lighting.
The mirrors have been added to both sides of the short corridor so that it looks longer.
In Kong, the second windows with the mirror will give the impression.
At its introduction, a reflection on maintenance will be provided to all walks of Joanne's feed and glass requirements.
The possibility of closing the portion of vegetables will be added to housing, if not used, by creating a more imaginative space.
All-round kitchen is nothing new.
However, this kitchen is a unique fact that it is a type of uprisings of garden.
"It was a little bit of a design effort," Erfan will explain the spawn MDF.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it very simply merges if it is to be pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage, Joanne now has 16 additional metres, an additional sleeping room and a better building plan.
After all, what you sell - or what gives value to property - is the flotilla flotilla, 'the word is Erfan'.
"The anchor is running out of date and makes calculations on the basis of the surface area."
Here they have been able to increase cannabis, using high-quality materials that add luxury to space.
"The materials are the ones you are missing and thus help to create an emotional link with your homes," says Erfan.
'You do not love the electricity cable within the seams.
It is important but does not raise heart languages. "
This shows that good design and an increased area of area help make something astonishing about the rather normal order.
In fact, they may even give rise to a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
The main figure, Mrs Jensen, is the Kicago cloud village in Chicago, who is competing with her colleague for her professionalism.
There is no read of money that is earned, but which is forgotten by all ethics.
A woman and three children only see a man in a stomach and late night.
In the first half of the film, I come from the idea that it is a business version of the 'KaardiHouse' - even Kevin Spacing and Gerard Butleri's speech - it is similar.
However, what the film goes on, the less cocktail element remains, and the moralising intention of the film-makers is increasingly beginning to appear.
Life-changing experience will become a key player in cancer.
Now a choice must be made between work and family life.
The deputising pot makes the father think about the great buildings in the footsteps in Chicago about matters of real importance, such as religion, welfare, love..., without even having to do with the disaster of the twin cables.
After the third village where the son opens his eyes, the feeling is that the film makers are certainly on the basis of the objective of getting audiences down is certainly not enough, because even the most obsessive spectator is unable to keep the tears back by seeing the suffering of a doctor's cancer.
If the son falls into the home and his situation seems to be almost hopeless, the father will finally understand the morality of his work and will work for the old man who is looking for a good act.
Now, in a sense, I am lumping myself - if a film has a technology, I will reward my spectacle after a film's coffee, if I may be wrong, one can be commended for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that a residual coffee will be lost - when a husband calls a hospital to a doctor and a man drives over a corridor.
The Poeg has, after all, been strangingly healthy, and although his father has just lost his job, it will prove to be positive, because it is now time to deal with the family.
I can be well known - I can already predict the end of the American drama quite well!
In truth, the film is well structured, all the necessary elements are there.
There will be a Council, there can be a smile, the actor will be a good and moral beauty: Money is not the most important thing in life.
That surprises the film well.
The new staff overhead of Trumpi intends to limit President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly will really do this.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new staff member of the White House intends to limit the flow of information reaching President Trumpin, including news, in the hope that it will keep the upper balance in water.
Here, there is a report from Josh Dawseyi:
"When the new staff member of the White House, John F. Kelly, came together on his first day of work with high officials, he highlighted the key problem with President Donald Trumpi Valges Maas, for which he intends to resolve the disinformation he intends to get into the hands of the President.
Mr Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information. "
Mr Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried to do so and have failed to monitor his media consumption.
President Trumpi's relationship with television goes back decades and, even now that he is in White Main, his TV watching habits have not gone away.
"When the candidate, Trump, was angry about unfair media coverage, showed him that he was also fairly reflected in the reports that he was affected," said Sam Nunberg, a former campaigner, Sam Nunberg, in February.
Politico Palmer wrote at that time that "according to six former campaigners, Trumpi Twitter is the key to managing habits by ensuring that her personal media consumption also contains a stable song of praise."
A good thing.
However, the idea that Trumpi Twitter's habits have ever been 'controlled' is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know would have been even more heartening without these interventions.
We will probably never know about the royalties that were not broadcast by the Trump.
If he was able to save him a few times from his hijacking, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trumpi from systematically causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that, in Valges Maks, who are competing with each other, people are trying to promote their own interests without exception by transferring material to the Olympic Games that supports their global views, but is not always credible.
Political tico, which reflects the whole story's culmination, wrote in May the advisers' tendency to feed the President with strategically questionable information.
One example described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"The current and former Trumpi are saying that the Trump can respond to a negative press, in particular, to the harmful effects of information leaflets, with an obsessive idea of identifying their source of origin.
This was also the case at the end of February, when someone happily gave a copy of the Internet provocation to the President, Charles C. The website of GotNews.telecom, which is part of Johnson, accused of having a staff chief Deputy, Katie Walshi, of being a white house 'source of multiple information'.
It does not matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked or that he has not offered any specific evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them.
He has read the article and started to complain about Wales. "
Goldmacher added that at that time, the top of the staff staff at Reince Priebus and the Head of the White House's office, Rob Porter, have tried to establish a system for managing and documentation documents reaching Trumpin. "
How did it succeed?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebent, but Trump is still an impulse and his helpless is still competing for influence.
These changing factors make the Kelly mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming from abroad will not be allowed to make a bitter speech.
There are many foreigners in the central city of Tallinn.
Those with whom the leaflet came to mind acknowledged that they played an old town without the permission of the urban government.
The first was to find three street musicians close to the Viru gates, who had taken on with them just as much.
It was clear to see that the musicians with rhythms and broken rivals were the cocktails to whom one dušš would be spending a marry.
Despite the violence, the only woman in the company played a chorus of acordionry with rhythm, while one man, along with three pales in Hong Kong and called the furthens closer.
The third man, alongside them, was sitting on one side of their feet and smoking a warmest self-prepared farm.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, who has played with Acordioni, has said that he would be angling the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the exhibition was to collect ticket charges on the same day of night for a ship travelling to Finland.
On the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for extremism, Noemi and Bob shattered their heads.
Firstly, we did not know.
Secondly, we will never be in one town for more than a day or a few, and mostly for a month, we will be given permits or something like this.
There is no point paying for this, 'Mr Bob explained.
When we returned to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women are at musicians and are driving them to go.
The exhibition, in absentia and cocktails, made good luck with the Viru Centre's cross.
There were also three Polish young men on the Viru street, one of whom played a fifth, another knife, and the third had even transported electronic glass.
"We are here to offer people entertainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living," the trio from the pipe to Mivosh explained.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be permission from the urban Government to speak.
"Of course we do not have it," he said in joke.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there is no problem whatsoever.
Of course, when the police come, we go elsewhere, but you have to try to do it, 'she added.
The Estonian bank purchased EUR 149 million of bonds under the public asset buying programme of the Central Bank in the euro area in July, with a bank bond portfolio increasing to €4.36 billion.
The Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, has made it clear in the past that the asset buying plan of the central banks of the Eurosystem includes three different purchase programmes: Bonds covered by the financial sector (SSGI), early bonds (ABS) and public bonds (PSPP).
The Central Bank will buy bonds on the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
The impact of purchases reduces the productivity of low-risk assets and encourages investors to take greater risks.
As a general rule, every central bank purchases its own national government bonds under the public bond shopping programme, other bonds are not purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds, the Estonian bank makes so-called substitution purchases within the amount allocated to them.
The central banks also shop in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited.
The Estonian bank generally buys the bonds of the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds.
The Estonian bank will purchase bonds under the asset buying programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Eleround bonds were also acquired, but in June 2016 the Estonian bank will no longer purchase bonds.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, both Elering and Estonia are buying energy bonds from the Finnish Central Bank from June onwards.
Migrants ignore their degrees and return to 'millions of business-based'
Some of the most prosperous domestic owners of the West Midlands have once again entered into a fierce confrontation with firm, tough, hard-pressed, who have ignored the clanded bureaucracies to win back from their cotton-free fields.
Migrants have improved their 20 trailers on the streets of Sohatulli, a prosperous' millions of businesses' line '.
They have returned with the army of horses, children and trucks, after they only came out there in May, without letting themselves be confused with the degree of bureaucracy that was complaining about to prevent their invasion by the Council.
The group found itself weak when it came to protection limits, turning its vehicles through unblocked parts that were left to football.
The clergy people are passion for Sohatulli councillors by saying that the Council is' useless in dealing with the problem '.
One anonymous person said: 'They moved there on Monday night after they were excluded from Bentley Heathon, where they stoned the furnitors.
The councillors must be ashamed to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
Migrants were there in May, they had to go there and they are now back.
They came back yesterday evening, probably more so today. "
He added: 'Birmingham councillors know how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect their parks.
I live on the street, and I am not happy that I must continue to pay the mandate to pay the total tax if the Council cannot even prevent this from happening. "
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said: 'That is ridiculous; we have only seen the latter left the migrants, and we have already seen a new offensive.
This time the number has increased, and even the horse has been seen in the grassland. "
The representative of the Sohatulli Council said: 'We are aware that there is an unacceptable camp shell in the country near the street route, and we are working with the Sohatulli police; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
The gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any kind of antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police, calling for a figure 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the Court when we present the case to them. "
The Weekise Festival will also visit the Minister for Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is pleased that it has been possible to bring real world top names to Estonia.
The question of why it is so important for the Estonians at the Weekise Festival that this should be asked by all those who enjoy the full front of the festival for three days.
However, he says that the real players in his area have come into being.
'When we look at this level of artists that has been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music gesture are being sent home - often not in our grasp ', the culture of culture speaks.
However, which artists on the festival speak most about Saart himself?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person and, for the old people of some kind, one of the most experienced doctors, Armin van Billiren, who took up yesterday evening.
After all, according to his posterary, all of us have complicated their own feet at some point. "
However, he still points out a number of names, such as Chainşi, Deadmau5, Knifets.
Of course, our own Estonian players too: Starting with NOTIP, and they can be read in a whole series.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very large, "he says.

Car manufacturers will be upgraded by up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of criticism
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it would offer a software coverage for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the Chairman of BMW, the company believes that 'smarter options exist than driving restrictions', referring to European cities, including the town of BMW, Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million plastic vehicles would be upgraded to reduce diesel engines in Europe.
No company described these operations as a retrograde call.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of the equipment installed to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles will increase for the automotive industry, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of calling on powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs referring to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, who remained silent about the use of so-called "fraudulent devices," which made it possible to adapt the model of exhaust gases to regulations when testing a car, but which were withdrawn under normal driving conditions.
Several leaders of Volkswagen have been charged in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic investigation.
Last month, a former president of the Audi engine Development unit was arrested in Germany.
The former President, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi, Germany, was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, when the authorities accused of installing the discharge system in order to circumvent the requirements for European emissions of gas, thereby extending the investigation previously focused on the United States.
The involvement of the author in the investigation may be a great blow to Volkswagen's manufacturer of the transmission luxury cars, which disproportionately attracts the profits of a large proportion of Volkswagen.
Schools in Estonia are acquiring EU flags of EUR 20 000.
The Ministry of Education intends to purchase European Union flags to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
In total, 105x158 centimetres of the European Union's flag is 570 education institutions.
Lips are intended to be used in indoor spaces; they must also be carried out in high-quality printed technology with a record assurance, and the ERR news portal is being brokered.
On the flag label, the text reads: 'The confirmation of Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union of Estonia.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 per Ministry of Education, or one flag costs EUR 35.
Murder of the journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
Nodoce workers usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the State of the Blue permit, which is soaring by organised crime, corrupt officials and relentless drug wars.
But today, under the guise of a personal tragedy, they have gathered to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change their routine.
Two older writers will discuss which they feel safer: Either to bring children to a office that was targeted at a grant attack in 2009 or to leave them home.
Security experts have written three words to the will of the space at the forefront: 'Enemies', 'neutral', 'allies'.
They are asking the reporters to offer their names to every water, they do not need any evidence of technology, they are enough to listen and to their internal feeling.
In the presence of government or cartels, drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being on board, a whole list of bogus people who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There are no breath of violence, and the more dead bodies across the country accumulate, the majority of them are journalists from the Committee on the Protection of journalists, according to information from the Committee on the Protection of Telecoms journalists, since the resignation of President Enrique Pena BONto, in December 2012, of at least 25; 589 journalists, after the attacks and threats to national protection, are still killed in at least seven countries.
The latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
"The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence makes a deep sense, even though his presence can be perceived throughout the fatigue of the MORiodoce building, a large picture of the average lies in the Valdezia with the letter of 'justice' and 'justice' and the two 30ninee reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear the T-shirt, which has been portrayed with his snaked private pricks or the amaoil bart he owns.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death, and the Reporters will discuss common traumas, their nightmare, their dreams, their correction.
Although a separate public prosecution service was set up in 2010 to deal with cases of journalists, only two cases have been brought before the Committee on the Protection of journalists.
Like most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, which amount to thousands, journalists' killers rarely come to justice.
The effects of Riodoce continue to reflect the violence in the Yalo, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without murderers' data and justice, the meeting on security, Mrs Ibarra, said, will not be of much use.
'It is very nice to waste his time at this meeting 'he says.
"As long as the reason is not known, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left the National Capital of Culiacan from the Riodoce office on 15 May morning.
He has only succeeded in travelling a few quarters before two men stopped the roles of the Red Toyota Coaverla: He was forced to withdraw from the car and was fired 12 times, probably because of the language of the newspaper, which means' twelve rivers' in translation.
An armed man went to the car in Valdez and made an accident near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two adults.
The flood is spreading freely in Culiacan.
However, on the Valdez issue, there is basically only silence.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition to the United States of America in January, the Blue authorisation has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival chlords are fighting for the implementation of the power vacuum.
It does not matter that, every day, a person or even several people are being shot down on the streets of a blue permit or that the dead are soaring from the double-dream sweets of drug festivals, which are larger than many homes living.
Let us forget for a moment that the time for peace indicates how valuable ports and the maritime state with drug routes to the United States are led by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, the co-founder and President of Riodoce, IsMay Bojorquez (60), is feeling the enormous sense of innocence that he was unable to defend his friend.
He believes that the killing process was encouraged by two mistakes.
The first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Guzman's son and a barrel of cartel on a war-rig shelf shelf.
This piece of correspondence could also be alluded to by the gangsters who are suspected of being fitted up, all copies of the publication bought off as soon as they ended up in historical batteries.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security after the crackdown took place in another piece of newspapers reflecting the same story.
Valdez was legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to be permanently present.
In 2003, he worked as a veterpiece report at Noroise when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling up to USD 50.
Bojorquez said that 'it was impossible to deal with the press without the problems of drugs'.
The newspaper took a long time to feel with its courageous and honest reports, and sales and advertising increased.
The Portuguese liked to express their vigorous research without the fear of censorship and reading readers in a newspaper that they were able to read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the launch of Riodoce, the newspapers won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for their Latin American reports.
In the same year, Valdez's Committee on the Protection of journalists (AKK) won the International Press Freedom Prize for its courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
'I want to live on, 'he said by accepting the AKK Prize.
Last October, he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking was a way of life in Yaloa.
"Your head will face up to the challenge that the journalist's office will have to play in the second place.
I do not want me to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not talk about what is happening. "
The group of Riodoce longs for Valdez, a joke who was like a joke, a friend who kindly shared embryos and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported her routine.
He always gave his oil barrel.
He went from the office to El poleyabo bar and was always sitting on the same table.
Now they are asking whether his routine love was fatal to him.
His death has also questioned them about how best to do his job and stay alive.
"They do not like the rigidity of their women, their children, their legitimate business, their secret landing plates used to transport drugs."
"These things should not be touched," said Bojorquez.
Even in the best times, the result will be strong self-censorship and self-determination.
Trust in your instincts.
When it comes to suspiciously, the hotel is thrown away.
According to the editor of Riodoce, Andres Villarrez, the problem is that 'the fragrances can be deceived... and so it was the case with Jieleri'.
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in the Yalo, just as they do not apply in the Tamaulipasis, Veracruz, Guerreiro or in other states that are home to the toxic combination of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The spectrum is constantly changing.
In the space where Riodoce workers met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted; a few days before that, it was revealed that only a button sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two policemen came to the house under the guise of a tree of 40 degrees.
They were appointed by the government by the Office of Riodoce, which is located in the centre-class neighbourhood of Culiacan, on Thursday's building.
Some of the reporters wondered half-joking whether these police officers were among the 50% of the police, whose head of the head has himself dragged unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have moved to mountain areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
The publication this week by Riodoce dealt with three main ideals.
One of them was the murder of former poxist Julio Chanar Chavez venna in Yalo.
In addition, they had a revealing story of spending government funds on the home town of the Governor.
And one of the most expensive restaurants outside the office of the public Prosecutor, Culiacan, was kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how this happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows about as being a fervent place both for drug traffickers and for public authorities.
The theatre learned from public documents that a restaurant was registered as a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Party for the Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the last century.
Recently, several IRP Governor has been accused of widespread coverage of cases of corruption.
In Villarli, the reporter asked to write previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, who is wearing the name El Chapo, escaped a military record.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have been looking to Valdez's cocktail to get information on kidnapping from the best sources.
"In the past, we would have already known what happened," said a 46-year-old Villarli, whose clever body construction has earned him a shouting name, El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels have broken with our sources."
The office of Valdez has become a safe place for bridges and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, and the editorial workers have become something they could never expect in the name of the press.
The Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few eyes and went to the local public Prosecutor's cabinet next morning for another demonstration of a journalist.
Mr Salvador Ame disappeared in the Western State of Michoacan three days after the killing of Valdez.
It has been burnt down to death and, according to officials, it is based on DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal all over the country and underline the word 'SOS press' as an organised protest.
On this day, the President, Bojorquez, is in Washington, trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after the death of Valdez in meetings with the Governor of the Blue authorisation, Ramirez's authorities accused journalists of beating and killing them because of telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be diverted from the government's activities elsewhere, while he was concerned that he had been affected by his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were 'restricted' by organised crime, by co-guilty state officials and by an indifferent society.
In his latest book 'the drug press', he wrote that researchers are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by politicians and security forces, who are at the mercy of organised crime.
Last year, the media monitoring group Articulo 19 gave more than half of the attacks on the police and public officials.
"In Mexico, you will keep quiet," said Ramirez.
The delicate effects are obviously bloody.
No one will forget the death of the blogger, Maria Elizabeth Macias, in the northern border state of Tamaulipak six years ago.
His body was found together with a letter that was probably written by the cartel LOS Zetas: 'I am here for my reports'.
In addition to the head of his sweat, the computer glass and the desert were leaked.
Some of the publications have decided to close their doors, for example, in Chihuahua, the northern border state of El Norte, following the killing of their correspondent, Dagslava Billih, in March.
Others will pass on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their president in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly about the front line 'What do you want of us?'.
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.
This is a nervous decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile and they still need to be on the streets in order to avoid risks.
And sometimes they are driven, as was probably the case with the photographic Ruben Espinosa, who, together with four women, was murdered at one of the corps in Mexico in 2015, three months after Veracruz was hijacked.
Those who remain at a standstill and continue to work must be tangled around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that a reflection of the drug business frightens her.
"Mexico is on the road to hell and that is why I am going to be reporter," he said.
At one of the most recent Friday midnight, when the latest number had already passed its breath, Riodoce editorial in front of the office and looted the beer of how suddenly all phones were to be calibrated.
19 people were killed in fire-fighting between rival gangs and security forces in the Randurorra town of Mazatlani, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to escort, as did a number of messages from cartels found in the region.
On the back of the same hard line, reporters ordered the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
A change was needed in the front of next day.
The safety risks were overstretched in the area of energy security.
Bojorquez's pathetic police to see if they are vigilant.
When they feared, they did not at least show this.
The workers of Riodoce, under the mass tree of a descended founder of the newspaper, which has his average finger on the whole of the Yalodemy, were carried out by the Riodoce workers in his footsteps.
'How can one think of closing down at all, 'said Bojorquez,' when on the same day that Javier Solana was killed, the trainee asked me to be able to report back to the streets? '
Dinosa used protection colours to prevent enemies
At first sight, it seems like a form, albeit quite frightening.
Scientists have now made public the first findings regarding the incredible intrusion of the numbers discovered by a Canadian minster, which has so well preserved that the experts have described it as "Mona Lisat," a of a's surgery.
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that a leather covered by his soya was the colour of a red box Brown and his past had been somewhat 'complicated'.
The current Biology report published in the magazine described the present present present status as' the best preserved soomaly test ever 'and' one of the best northern parts of the world '.
In the case of coal, it is a new type of nodosahexus that was living in the middle of the cries era, 110-112 million years ago.
Its unbelievably good survival was raped by a theatre who describes it as' truly significant '.
This herbal feed covered by soya has best preserved the type of phosphosphorus that has ever been found, according to National Geonews.
On 21 March 2011, it was found in Shawn's funk when he extracted a Suncor Millenium mine in Fort McMurray near Northern Albertas in Canada.
He has suffered something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into it.
The identified phosphorus was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology museum.
The next six years were designed to withdraw the animal from 2 500 pounds (1100 kilometres).
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to bring the public to the fore.
'Ieb Brown, a scientist Royal Tyrrell Museum, said he would almost believe that he is sleeping, 'said the leading author, Caleb Brown, said, in a museum of the Royal Royal Tyrrell, where being mistired.
"This will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved garden components, Mona Lisana."
When he studied skin, he found that this animal feed, although covered by soya and reminiscent of a hard tank, was likely to pose a significant threat to the food needs of meat.
This multitude of sows used red and white defence colours to hide themselves from predators and applied sheltering techniques, which are called 'responsible' and are also used by many today's animals.
This enabled experts, as they say, to enter the north-east better and to avoid enemies, because they were likely to be struck by the major pressures on the north.
This presence of the 110 million old-year-old family of nocosaic surgery for the first time reached news in May and is now being visited by the Royal Tyrrelli Paleontology museum.
Researchers have now studied and given it the name to Boeing as a Marmitletl museum, mark Mitchell, a famous team that spent more than 7000 hours making it difficult to reveal.
Thanks to the amazing maintenance of the father, Dr Mitchell and the International Researchers' team were able to record the shape and size of sows.
They found a 'no' approach - a defensive method in animal origin, which means that the proclamation of being was a metre as a lower.
Although the overshadow is widespread, the bread comes as a surprise, because Boeing is much greater than the animals today living under a 'no' shadow.
This suggests that the North Pole was sufficiently actively hunted by other animal feed surprises, that the evolution preferred to be overshadowed instead of being opposed to the survival tactic.
However, the majority of animals used today to escape from catering - such as fears, pigs or doctors - are much smaller and more vulnerable as a crop, which suggests that nodosaurse had to make a real effort to survive.
"A robust grubbing-up of the colours covered by huge and large numbers of sows shows how dangerous the predatory animals could be," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds of Soomers also revealed that the spin of the north was a red cat.
Scientists will continue to carry out an investigation to obtain rainfall about its life, including the stolen content of this salt style, in order to find out what the animal is going to do for its last spring.
They believe that the north-east fell into the dead rivers, thereby entering the sea, where it came to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Albertas was as warm as it was at the moment in South Kivu, and rivers and oceans were likely to spread much further to the internal land than they are today.
"This nodosaurse is truly significant because he has been fully covered with a soomic skin, but he has remained three-dimensional, while preserving the original form," said Brown.
"As a result, today, the animal looks almost the same as in the era of cries.
In order to reconstruct it, there is not much imagination to be used - it is enough simply to tip our eyes and it seems that he seems to be sleeping. "
The time of the crisis was when enormous two foot-and-mouth musculprits - heterogeneous shops - were burnt into the land.
Although all of them, King Tyrannosaurus rex, many millions of years later than Boeing, it could have been stunned by a gigantic dinnant pressure from some of his formidable predecessors.
These include Acrocanotheus, 38 foot (11.5 metres) long and six tonnes of monster.
The scientists whose recent findings have been published in the current Biology magazine believe that Boreallta was stunned after death in the sea and this mutation.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn's operation discovered when he extracted Fort McMurray near the Millenium mining in Northern Albertas, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved soomaly in the world, including skin and soya, and it is a complete concentration up to a bottomless.
These assumptions were on average 18 foot (five metres) long and were at up to GBP 3 000 (1300 kg).
Two 20 customs-long Pandora came out of it.
Scientists believe that this man of flora and fauna covered by soya was searing through the current Western Canada until the flooded river was sailed into its offshore sea.
However, the seabed of bottom-up marine buried helped to maintain its Finns in an excellent way.
The polar bears of this particular father coal have been so well preserved that the headlines of mysterious soya plates are still covered by skin residues.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geosanitary Journal: 'Such a retention is as rare as a lottery.
The more I see it, the more incredible it seems.
The residuals of burned skin continue to cover the creation of mysterious soya plates located in the yellow.
The better front line lies with him and the five early ones have been dragged up.
I will be able to read the soyages at his farm. "
How did one act answer the question of 'Who thanks?'?
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferreira received complete shock.
Just one day after New York's travel, it was a father of St. Loukas who, through Airbus, was rented on a doorstep, on Facebook on the phone.
He came to the post of his former school compatriot.
It says: 'The police killed 18-year-old young people and they are still on the streets'.
He was confused why no one else had posted this information on his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Pidega @ TheePshaah's user's postal services were repeatedly distributed on her timetable.
In real time, Mr Brok, an unarmed 18-year-old black young man, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson Missouris, was transferred from the region of St. Louise.
He gave a picture of the life of Brown's body, which was on the streets, remaining there for four hours.
'That is crazy, 'Mr Ferreira thought out additions.
But death was not new for him or for the community.
He put his phone off, but saw a rear-up later this evening, which announced this time that people had gathered in Canfield Drive.
Jagat photographs of police and shellfish people and a man who claimed himself to be the father of Brown and kept the label 'the Ferguson police killed my unarmed son'.
He watched a real-time stream in which a police officer stood before a group of protesters with a beating dog.
In the second video, another police officer, he said, 'I kill you all... animals'.
The Ferrell is reminded of how he struck himself from the point of view: 'That is unusual'.
'This is not a murder of this kind that we are used to and which we could call typical '.
I felt frightened at that point.
I was angry and I was crying. "
He booked a return flight and travelled home the next day.
Having swept at 23 o'clock, he went to his father for his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would be travelling next morning to a two-wheel Fergusoni.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson next three years will be the central theme of a new documentary entitled 'Whose street?' ('Whose street?'), which will be presented in cinemas on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and defeat, strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who took the streets to demand answers.
When, with a daughter - who had a flower broker and a fine chat it - they once again talked to Ferguson, they talked about a subject that they had repeatedly been talking about before this morning - black experience and living conditions.
'Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights? 'It will remind itself to ask itself.
"We are currently travelling to Ferguson because the police killed 18-year-old boys and that is not right."
"I could not take him on board," said Ferreira later.
"What is happening now is the culmination of what happened in the past.
It must know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He has to learn about the organisation and organisation of a activist and, at the same time, the different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we need to do to be free and free.
Even if I manage to grow him in such a way that he does not coexist personally with brutal racism, he does not differentiate from another black girl.
I feel I would do her a disservice if I were to protect him from this world. "
The first halt they made when they came to Ferguson was South Florissanti - from the police station to the ground - which had become a kind of camp plate, where activists were waiting for news about the police officer, Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not charged.
There, Mrs Ferreira and her daughter joined forces with a local businessman who produced lunch.
They brought together food bags and helped to share them with protesters.
A new type of activist slowly started to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activist changed completely after 9 August," said, when he was a student at the Missouri-St. University of Louy, he was President of the Alliance of Researchers and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience of organisation.
That is simply laissez-faire. "
A week later, a film co-author, Sabah Folayanana, met during a March demonstration.
Mr Folayan said that he and the film operator, Mr Alvarado-Farrar, simply wanted to document what is going on.
A question came to mind from Ferrelli: 'Are you trying to document what is going on or find a story that can be exploited?'
This scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to profit from its vigilance and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: 'We had heard that the voice of people born in Ferguson was not listened to and growing, and we wanted to do so differently'.
Folayan had already taken its hands with Damon Davon, an artist in the region who was known for a activist in relation to sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and six other local communities, who were watched for years after the 'Whose street?' Team, following the shooting of Brown.
"In this documentary, nobody speaks for us and we are talking about ourselves," said Davis.
"It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that is how I am portrayed."
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell - the intention was to show that the movement is not about 'the head of the organ, but about bringing the community together', as Mr Folayan said - he made his film the most open player.
As a result, 'Whose street?' Surprisingly personal aspects of the lives of Ferrell, such as caning and marriage with his wife, are documented.
"I felt as if I had always done so," said Ferreira, smiling over the first time he saw a complete copy of the city.
"However, I realised that this work and the human dignity of black people must be accompanied by a certain degree of vulnerability."
Moreover, the Ferrelli story emphasises and puts the role of a black homosexual woman at the centre of the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators who thought about the killing of a black teenager Trayvon Martin in the social media in 2012, following the killing of a black teenager, are homosexuals.
"In a leading role, black homosexual women have kept the movement generally high," said Ferreira, "and this is precisely because we must constantly fight on a number of fronts.
Roma homosexual women have to bear all this burden. "
Folayan agreed to state that 'Honourable women do indeed keep their lives alive and many of them are black homosexual women'.
At the same time, he claims that 'this is not a kind of equalisation of opportunities' - Ferrell was not chosen as the centre of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who took the right energy in the evening," he said.
"However, this is not a coincidence that he was directly placed on the front line, because a black homosexual woman is much at stake in living in such addicts.
His energy can be perceived through the screen. "
At the same time, news cameras Ferguson have long disappeared, but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile.
The conditional penalty imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for road liberalisation will continue for 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in a region he calls home simply as a 'huge threat of freedom'.
Nevertheless, it still attaches importance to the mantra it has been eating since the time when it went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing but our chains to lose. "
7 pictures of how to overcome Weekise du pokbot
Some of the warmer meals find aid after a scarce pipe, even though they are suffering from it.
Or on the basis of the saying 'Bunt bodyt, pyramid'.
However, this is just an unavoidable postponement and a proper blessing for health.
What can you do to make yourself felt better this morning and to get through the boy as painfully as possible after today and tomorrow's Weekise trall - or whatever else - as painfully as possible?
Joo Water
Under the coffee, after a lot of cargoes in the morning... or even, if possible, instead of alcohol.
As a body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption, it has to be withdrawn in some way.
Along with water, minerals are also being thrown out of the body and seine is a good hair of mineral water.
As the soil is often irritated after the sludge, it is particularly good that it is free of soil or easy to find itself.
Let us walk.
Certainly, it would not be worth turning to the grandmother with a bogus tag - that might prove to be a fatal wrong decision.
But an easy footsteps will help the body to recall once again what it is like to be alive.
Sleeping in Telg and sleeping is a more demanding way of getting healthy.
Give us energy back to the body slowly and cautiously.
If you are already going to be overdrinking yesterday, it is certainly not worth trying to charge a heavy fat fat.
To begin with, for example, a refreshment containing fruit crops that are quietly rearing their body.
If the health of the South is already suffering, one could try the wet, for example.
And a little later on, it was clear.
The coffee was removed.
This diutenum exempts her from the last water in the body.
As has already been said, water and volume have your friends.
Contribute to painkillers.
If you take a painkiller last night to prevent pokbot, you have to deal not only with alcohol, but also with a perfume or ibuprophet, and thus lose strength.
So the rivals pay even more and, in the future, boys will be worse off.
In addition, the pain will not remain entirely in the coffers anyway for a long time.
If you take a painkiller this morning, you will do it with a empty thread - it irritates your already torn.
Or if you do not have a partner, you cannot get through ourselves well.
It affects around the same way as walking, but by walking it, it will not be more expensive.
However, too active a pace and a staggering half - a physical effort should be moderate at a time of pokbot.
The road is a joke.
Talk to friends of the time about their fellow sufferers, easy futures and a woman-friendly approach to the suffering of himself and others ().
The Nazis and the woman may not be pulling off the pot, but they certainly have the effect that they have come to terms with more leniency.
Once the shop goes over anyway!
Northwestern professor and staff at Oxford University are being sought as suspects in murder
According to the police, the professors of the University of Northwestern and the staff of Oxford University are being sought nationally, who have become suspects of having to find the body of the male people killed by death from one of Chicago's luxury basins, after death.
According to judicial documents in the county of Cook, on Monday, unauthorised arrests were issued for 42-year-old Wyndham Lathemi and 56-year-old Andrew Warreni, accused of being arrested because of their alleged involvement in Trenton H. Cornell-Duranéu.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranéu died after repeated smoking.
According to the warning that the Chicago police station issued to the community, the body was discovered on 27 July.
Police officers received telephone calls and found a victim at the arrival of the Grand Plaza Corterhouse, whose body had several storming programmes.
According to officials, the Cornell-Duranéu event was recognised to death and investigators consider hunting to be murder, while the police are actively seeking two suspects.
Lacia has been working as co-professors of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Mr K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University of Public Relations, said in a statement sent as an e-mail that Lacia has now been temporarily removed from the workplace and has been banned from entering urban areas of the University of Northwestern.
"This is now a criminal matter to be investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwestern University cooperates with researchers," said Cubbage.
Warrested is a senior assistant in the finance department of Oxford University.
The representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: 'We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible'.
In addition, the statement stated that the Warreni colleagues were shocked and that they wanted to be extradited.
Anthony Guglielmi, President of Chicago's communication department, urges the authorities to be brought to justice on grounds of suspicion.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but we are increasingly busy in defining the exact location," said Guglielm.
According to Guglielm, suspects can be sought by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said that the police received a telephone call from the grey house of the Grand Plaza Corterhouse, who had just received a crucifix that something has happened at corps No 1008.
According to the police, this was a magic view.
Guglielm said that it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said that the security cameras confirmed the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building.
"We believe that Professor Lathaka and the victim had a relationship," added Guglielm.
The Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to the people: 'The police are currently working on finding the cruology of events and the background of the victim, and are examining various motives, including the possibility that this was a family dispute'.
Idufirms that help your business avoid receiving the next Ubper
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers at his start-up company in e-commerce, but the polls were unprofitable.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some workers did not trust this process.
'The system was simply not consistent and objective, 'said Errett, who is leading an e-commerce company Madison Reed, which selcos, with 75 employees, in San Francisco.
So he called for assistance from outside.
Start-ups dealing with new types of human resources are starting to help businesses find out what their workers feel.
By developing and licensing software that aims to measure the involvement of workers, they will enable companies to conduct direct surveys, to target specific teams and demographic groups, to offer workers anonymity and a hot line of complaints and, in some cases, to allow manufacturers to move from C-level management and to go directly to the Bureau.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbps for monitoring health, but where is Fitbps for your company?" Asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO Reding, Glint City company, whose software analytical tool is used by companies to measure the inclusion of workers?
According to Erretti, for three years when he has used Glinti, he has received a much better picture of what his workers think and feel.
In addition to interviews on intervention and specific teams, this company's heat card provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support, enabling them to identify the causes.
Companies have started to realise that they need to stay informed about their working culture so as not to change to the next Ubhur, which has been embed with scandals since the former worker published a bloggling, describing the harming environment, where those who dared to speak were punished.
There is a lucrative business opportunity for start-ups such as Glint.
The global area of governance, regulation and compatibility can be worth more than USD 1187 billion by 2020, according to the financial statistics website Let 2020.
This year, in the face of the dubious reputation of Uberian, the head-in-Office of Colorado observed an increase in interest and activity.
The VIS has almost 600 customers, including Airbus, Microsoft and Tesla.
The Uber recently registered himself as a customer.
Like Glingi, the NHS allows 100 companies to send adjusted impulses, collect real-time confidential answers and look at the problem areas of heat cards.
It also offers an anonymous message that enables workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the executive manager, complaints go directly to the Bureau.
"Public opinion has been delivered by regulatory authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Code.
I Qinlan said that if a company were found to mistreat its employees or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumers' boycott, the departure of workers and court cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Satellite, restaurants with more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of activity, has used the CSS for more than a year to ensure worker's awareness of rules and procedures and to provide a simple way of communicating with the company headquarters.
When a worker wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find a company headquarters or an email address, submit a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
This was often a discouraging and uncomfortable process, Mr Vitrano, the general adviser, said that there was no good way of monitoring workers' complaints.
However, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices, which did not previously reach leaders who acted in other contexts in other cities or states, can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360 degree experience of workers," said Vitrano, who is leading the Ruby Satellite risk Management Group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers."
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour, values and worker involvement much more seriously in 2002, following the failure of the auditor, Arthur Andersson, because of ethical irregularities in the Enron scandal.
However, only when 'the social media became mature' did companies realise that they cannot prevent their black washing from openly hiding online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and UMcent offer their software as a service, with companies receiving periodic fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors, who have supported both start-ups.
CERcenti financed USD 10 million in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and the then Capital, thereby increasing the capital collected to USD 47 million.
The Glinti invested USD 10 million in November in the Bessemer Venice partners, increasing total company funding to USD 60 million.
This investment will not come as a surprise, given the interconnectivity between businesses, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that today's workers are waiting for more than before.
In more competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely on the table.
The workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy about the company, they feel they are listened to and that the work they are doing is more satisfactory, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of the Department for General profit and the experience of workers, LinkedInis, who uses both the CERcent and the Glinti.
Investors earn their income when companies belonging to their portfolio do well; companies are doing well when workers are committed and involved.
If analytical tools from the third party allow for an increase in the commitment and involvement of workers, it is no wonder that they will receive support.
Data on the involvement of workers is important, according to experts in professional culture.
However, these data will be useless if the company's supervisors do not do anything with them.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can raise expectations of change.
And if the changes do not take place quickly or at all, this may cause disappointment and a reduction in workers' involvement.
"When you ask for 4 000 proposals, you must be ready for 4 000 conversations," said President Kotter International of the Consultative and Business Administration, RustleRaath, who has seen how companies are making a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things do not end up, the workers will think: 'Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you do not care, why should I care? "
According to Errett, the Netherlands, which now organises six studies among workers, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glinti.
And after receiving feedback from workers who were disappointed with the speed and quality of communication of decisions, she was able to restructure a number of teams in the company and provide communication training to address the problems.
However, it will collect new data on workers and it is hoped that, in the long term, this will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers to an industry known for its high labour flows.
"If you are not committed to transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
'and if you lose people, you will lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose businesses. "
The euro area remains the Baltic Sea: Incomes grow rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic Sea, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bolberg is writing a report from the European Central Bank with reference to the report.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
There is a low debt burden for success, and fast-track institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic States, along with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where the population of the reactor's per capita GDP is well approaching the EU average," announced the Central Bank.
Although the aim is for the total economic output per capita to be equal to a richer Western Europe, in 2015, the total output of the Baltic economies accounted for only 2 / 3 of the average 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the local people are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, this was considered by little less than half of those surveyed about the economies of their countries.
NCAA decision to cancel trends twice a day will change Bruinsi's long days
There are almost 23 o'clock, when the throphost, UCLA, comes to talk at the end of a new habit in a team city.
Some of them have put their backs on the back door, revealing the efforts of their training camp for the first day in a single day.
For a large part of the team, they offer minutes of strength from midday to day.
After a three-hour trend, the players involved in the course of their courses are going to learn to learn from the end of their lives before returning next morning to 6.30 a.m. for meetings in Woodman's football escalamity.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," said the Bruinsi Manor, Jim Mora, a little earlier than Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA decision to cancel trends twice a day to reduce the burden of players has in fact changed their days longer - at least until the end-of-the-day extractions to one side on Friday.
For this reason, the first three training courses of UCLA were timed to start at 19.15 in order to fit into the already close schedule of players.
The transition from two strikes per day means more days than one trend - the start of the Bruinsi training camp was raised almost a week before last season, and for the first time, during the six days of the Mora Westwgold season, a training takes place during the summer courses.
They will have 18 trends up to 20 August before the official preparation starts for the opening game against Texas A & M in September.
According to Mora, he is in favour of changing the NCAA rules, although it adds another item to the close schedule of players.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they are breaking themselves through this challenge; they are struggling, they are nice young people.
I believe that when the clock comes and we have more time, it is really a few. "
Once the camp is finished, UCLA's training will be closed, which is not at all an easy task, given the clear view of the parking plate close to their fields and the side-by-step Luskini centre, a high-class hotel, which has already passed through a network of protection around the gates.
From this weekend's exchange, hotels Bruinsi players are occupying, but Mora acknowledged that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco.
"We are implementing security measures," said Mora.
"This is a real concern and it is not at all exaggerated to think that people can rent a filter and filter there.
If you have a record of a training, you can make quite a good deal.
But we are using a security team there and on 8 parking plates.
We will do our best to use the available.
I will try not to be very concerned about this.
We have a plan in place. "
In writing. - (PT) The electoral Union of Satenare-Ivanova, the election union of the Central Party born from Satenare-Ivanova, Christiina Orange from the Reform Party and the ECB, forced to leave to the hands of our Tallinn and the parties, created by the merging of the forces of Maria Kaljre, Tega Tallinn, the electoral union of creative businessmen - seems to be at least as much as the participation of the local elections this year on the initiative of the parties.
However, buses will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether they are all sufficiently disappointed by the voters.
Who will remain in Sahel?
How small the support centre of Edri Satenare has fallen, can be predicted of events organised as the honour of his electoral union.
One member of the Assembly of State, some former and present middle-party and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And can the reason why, in Tallinn, some of the true supporters and friends of Satenare being sidelined by Satenare, be it seen that the 'Sastaare list' of companies, led by corruption and suspected of corruption, is becoming a reality?
A central computer game in which, in all respects, the music fever from the city administration to the Russian-speaking pop of the parent of the town of Lasnamäe and, in all respects, the original computer game, in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid the votes of 16 and 17-year-old voters who have been on his way to his feet - is the Central Party trying for the first time to allow election boxes?
We look forward to the views of the other parties on the young election campaign.
If Canal 2 or TV3 viewers are to be opposed instead of entertainment from early August, there will be two options: To accept that, in future, only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 channels will be available to some ten TV operators every month.
There are probably also those who, at the beginning, openly welcome free TV experience, but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and advertising.
High-door music, sounding people and rubbish left on the streets are almost every major music outlet's unpleasant side-effects.
However, if you do not want to be part of the meal themselves, it will be worthwhile going home instead of pain - and leaving the sleeping seat for the lungle to the general public at the festival.
Washington changes the rules on the Green Card
Media publications are quoted by President Donald Trumpi, who said that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year, stricter rules on temporary employment visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republican people and are supported by the President.
The draft legislation will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money because it changes the way in which US citizens are issuing green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will provide an advantage for candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, according to the media reports in the United States.
Young people are moving back to the city, pensioners, to the land.
Jevseyev Anaoli will continue with the tradition of the famous seams along the Maana River.
He works 140 km from home to Maana additional nurses at Kuvai as a motor driver.
It is a tough job: Two months of working 12 hours without rest days and then only ten days at home and again again at home.
For three years in the Archbishop, Anatol has seen gold only once.
'That is the order of the day: When you go there, you are going to have a thorough check so that you do not lead, and when you go it out you do not take it ', you are talking about Anaka.
In the village of Haida, Mare Piho is speaking to a local seto Jaga, who has talked a lot about his family's memories in Siberia.
The archaic culture still preserved by Siberian seines will also have an impact on home-seams, because it is simply so shocking that it is the most comprehensive view of Piho Mare.
His first research trip to Siberia will be 30 years since this year.
During this period, he has been there 14 times and has lived there for one year.
How much did Siberia migrate at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I would argue that 8 000.
I took this into account in the words of Siberian seto men, who have himself thought about it.
It is precisely difficult to say, because at the time, up to 30 people could come into one group, but the passport was only given to a man.
The passport was only given one, but it was children, sisters, etc.
Look at how great this territory was here.
It was many times greater than historical Setomaise.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
The icks came here as farmers, but their lives changed, because here they found themselves in areas that were not only related to agriculture but also to the river (palm parking), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Petseris, many seals later went to work on a classified town, Krasnotock-45 (where Soviet power was built - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the pigs at the time represent the majority of the population in this region?
Yes, they lived coherently.
In addition, a long tradition maintained a marriage and a great deal of child clarity.
Seven-eight children in families were common.
How much did Siberian seines differ and differ from that of the mother country?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a great deal of popular ideas.
They did so themselves (ideas of the people), but they always made a distinction between what had been brought about and what had been done here.
Climate change was heavily influenced by the traditional rigidity of seals, because it is sown here.
The proposed changes were made.
For example, Setomaal meat was warm, but it was simply frozen here.
Where are the villages of Siberian seines and what life is there? / graphics: Alari Paluends
The relationship with mothers was spiritually strong, which was considered to be very important.
It seems to me that now the Setuland is going to be returning there, they are going to be affected.
The girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho is thinking of the people of the Estonian pig delegation who came to the daily day of the Haida village Seto Kingdom at the beginning of July and lived four days in homes - J. P.
What is still here is shocking.
"It is very easy to come and go ahead, because the city has an excellent location: On the railways and at the crossroads of the roads," says from Tapt to Reigo Tampere.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sport and culture and we have a niche in every corner.
Tapa is a tip-fleet city!
There are small islands at the bottom of the river through the present river of White, where the alpaled boss tend to be kept.
'That Reigo does not see this beautiful place from the train window '.
Anyone who does not fear cold water can flood into the river, because the river is full of resources.
I have been there to swallow, you can do it!
The river's water supply can be kept long and can simply be done by romantic - the flow of the river can look at and think about life and beyond.
I have also been on my feet there with my own bars.
Ooperisolist Tampere, apart from everything else, has been on the river between three bridges to get used: 'That is a place around the city, no one can come to an end if their stories are uttered'.
"A wonderful view of the Tapt is opening up from a football mountain, but there are also health professionals who can drink, drink the winter wound and play, for example, a discgolf - the golf route has been done, the chains can be borrowed from the sports environment," is chaired by Reigo.
The old professionals will, of course, go there with their thread, but I have not yet been able to play there.
Obviously, my colleague, Mr Oettinger, must be invited to visit Tapt, because he has experienced a discgolfimagier and he has a chain.
Perhaps he lends me.
Reigo and Männikull were inseparable from the current years of self-operation.
At least during the summer hours.
Many tears, fraudsters and you can live in my sports have remained on this mountain.
Not to mention the broken-down batteries and bars.
"The whole city is now full of construction works, all this is changing to feeling," praises Reigo.
However, the old and tired boy building is a very attractive place where discoveries are played.
I am pleased that in 2012, the leader of R.A.A.A.M, noticed t Meos, adopted my idea and had to make a full summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's communication season was just over with Aleeyi Karenin, on 11 August, the 'Elluwake-up' railway station is going around the age of 1980.
"Until 11-13 August, the city of Tapa will have a day in which open hosts and ritual cultural events will take place, including the popular treasure," Reigo, who is proposing to visit the town just over 9 years, will speak.
A museum has already been on its way to a separate three-chamber from 1 May 1994.
'The house is small, but there is a lot of misponds and there is a huge amount of information ', praises the Rhine in a place full of the history of the town of Tapa, most of which focuses on the rail and the war.
Reigo muts that if you go through all the recommended sites in Tapal, you are going to be empty for a long time, but fortunately you are full of a small town's coffee.
"We have such good eating places and sometimes when you sit in cafés you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad, he describes."
Well-educated and young soldiers who have come to Tapale spend a lot of time in tissues, and there is a rubbing-up feeling that you are in Estonia and your home town, but there is a global commute together.
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to the stories from the French or the Americans.
The wars, yes, we are going a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tendering in Greece
TV bTV quoted a Foreign Ministry who announced that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tendering in Greece.
In the morning of 1 August, the police arrested a group of people illegally ordered on the Peninsula of Sithonia, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation is currently taking place.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said bTV to the television channel that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing severe fines on all those who are sometimes stranded in a place that is not intended for it.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the Court may impose a fine.
The wolf teaches are breaking the sheep.
Farmers on the shelf have to give their carpet 'lethal material' to the junta from one year to the next - the wolves who have apparently taught the dry have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, the wolves in the Hiiu county have broken sheep on three occasions, 23 out of sheep and eight have been injured, writing the Hiiu page.
Soil was only three years earlier.
There are also data from the Environment Agency in syndrome that soil basins were not born and the information from the Prince Council that two whitewashing areas have been fixed this year on the island.
At the Ööl, the junta, Emdal, broke out of 15 sheep in Kabul and injured 18 survivors.
At the early morning of Wednesday, the wolves in the county of the village of Rehemia broke one lamb and seriously injured you, who had to be killed by an emergency killer.
The rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a round of coordination on the Law on the Environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and a draft amending Law on plant Protection Products.
The amendment to the law will give up the creation of a separate set of data for both GM crops and business operators, using the plant health register in the future.
In addition, GM crop management will be changed the obligation to have prior agreement with the person involved in apiculture.
Although there is currently no cultivation of GM crops in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM crops and non-GM crops.
At least as long as it is not up to the decision to declare the Estonian GMO ', the Chairman of the plant health department, Sigmar, said,
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures that have been developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens incurred by both the private and public sectors."
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of data on GM arable locations and operators in the VS, introduces requirements for the management of GM crops and the launch of economic activities.
In relation to the specific beekeeping sector, the current obligation for GM farmer to inform beekeepers about the cultivation of GM crops by means of an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeepers before growing.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties will have the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the draft information system and, if they so wish, to give their opinion to the Department of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes affect, in particular, people working in the field of plant farming, beekeepers and the Agriculture Agency.
Only one GM crop - mon 810 - is allowed to grow in the European Union, including Estonia.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
The reason for this is that Estonia does not have a macocktail, a European early media, on which mon 810 is resistant.
Also, this maize line has been cultivated to the southern regions, and this is not appropriate to our climate conditions in May.
In order to be secure, in 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies to detect potential GM organisms for the detection of pollution from various surate, maize and soya and varieties grown in Estonia.
The analysis of the samples carried out showed that seeds were not present abroad and that the study concluded that the seeds of increased rainfall, maize and soya and varieties in Estonia were not included in genetically modified organisms.
The previous one may conclude, in turn, that in Estonia, GM crops are not deliberately cultivated, and it was also confirmed that no random contamination took place.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United colba Nemanja Maticu in the form of 'genetic genus'
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United States has recruited a 'genetic genus' in the form of Nemanja Maticu, after being a medium player against Samotoria on Wednesday evening.
At GBP 40 million a player bought over from Chelsea started in the last seasonal game in Dublin prior to UEFA Super Cupi's real line against Madrid on Tuesday 2-1 in front of the original crisis, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go to the bombers.
However, having remained outside the seasonal Asian landscape of Blues, Matica urgently needed match-fixing and received only 45 minutes, according to Mourinho, it has to be improved before the Premier League's season began.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, genious thinking - he has the mood of football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to get the form as soon as possible."
Like the body, other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romeva lu Lukashenko and Mourinho began to put their own men in place at the beginning of the season in silence.
The Independent disclosure this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three more football clubs, but he confirmed that the club had already done a 'excellent job' by concluding agreements with three of its four priority selection.
"I am grateful to the club for having been able to realise three out of four," he added.
"I am even happier if they can deliver four, but they have worked hard for me."
Another gender poet got a foot to the GSM Embassy on 1 August and this time in Muus.
Mrs Martinson, an observer living in a fragile way, received the first baby in Sham equipped with the embassy, and this washer is already flying around, has left the washing place and has joined the great collection of fodder in the Mullutu-Great Lakes.
This is because, after all, there are no fertility fields, the voice of the islands is written.
This Tuesday, a relatively late moment for whistleblowing the deaf, the embassy received another tree and on the island of Muu.
According to Martinson, the installation of embassies is, in fact, an international project carried out by Aands Leito and Ivar Ojans.
A magic shop was supplied with the name of Mat GSM, Shaves Turkey.
"His actions are all on the Internet: How he went to winter in Spain, coming back a long time at the German-Polish border and then coming to Saareland, Martinson spoke.
British inventor to install a microchip into his body to access a handful of houses and cars
A British inventor became the first person in a country to be installed with a microchip, so that he can simply open his seat, get into office and even get a car off the ground.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam to install a minor chip between his pöken and his name card, and is now offering this service through his own company, BioTeq, to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier by technology.
He has joined forces with the Queen Consultor-anestesiologist, Dr Geoff Watson, in the county of Winchesteris Hansi, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
Technology is similar to that of a microchip for cables and coaches, and it takes only 30 seconds for procedures.
The Northam company will also change the snow between houses and cars to comply with the chip by asking for GBP 300 per snow.
This father of a child in marriage has now stayed the technology at home and in his car, BMW Z4, which comes into operation when he has his hand on the wheel.
A white house tip cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents published in the magazine, the decision of the White House to fly a naval helicopter to a southern horror for an American production event last month cost taxpayers as much as USD 24 000.
The Green and White colour Sikorsky VH-3D, called the President's Park office, was the central indication of the event presenting the American construction programmes in White on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House reported industrial products from all 50 states on their way around.
A helicopter built in Connecticut with a banner from a reputation, a fire-fighting car from Wisconblue and a pallet made in Misinhion.
According to the documents of Mrs Helicopter, who has been responsible for the operation of Helicopter, Mrs Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the white house called for the presence of a helicopter in a military cabinet, known as the FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter was swept for the 'unusual' event on the southern side.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually high-profile event," said HMX-1 commander a day before the event in an e-mail, the Chief Executive officer of the navy in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would come to the southern horror at 7: 15: 00 on the morning of 17 July and will remain there until the same evening between 18 and 21 were cleaned.
It was added to the fact that, if the departure from the White House were to be present, a second brick is needed for a return flight due to the restrictions on working time.
The original airline team was at the helicopter during the event and the security team of the escader remained close to the aircraft for all the time it was on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the documents given to the magazine whether or not the second brick took place at last.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked whether it was in breach of Hatch's law and we were told that it did not violate," wrote commander.
'It seems that you do not have a choice, 'responded to the Deputy Deputy victim.
The White House announced the 'made in America' event as an official event, and the Hatch law would not have covered it.
But even official events have political underscores.
At the event, the President supported the health reform efforts at the time in the Senate and praised efforts to keep government regulations under threat.
The use of an aircraft known as Mrs One or the Air Task Force for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely as photographic is unusual.
The cell came to the attention in February when, at his first campaign event, a President's plane at the water background, Far Melbourne, was hanged down, and he is complaining about the way in which his predecessor's aircraft were used.
The White House is very pleased with the 'made in America' issue, where products were represented from all 50 states produced by American workers in American materials, "said the acting spokesman of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 teams often carry out tests around Washington and on the southern horror to get used to putting a single cent-metre back on the White House of the President of the United States.
When the Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, 58 samples of HMX-1 White House were organised in the care of the HMX.
According to the official, the 'American-made' Air Force was considered to be the norm for flights at the time of the month.
On that day, the helicopters of Eskar flying for 'non-President support missions'.
According to the White House, none of the other exponents of this event burden taxpayers' money.
According to Sikorsky's representative, the company was not involved in organising the helicopter on the southern horror.
HMX-1 will not maintain the budgetary documents and the precise costs of the President's flights and the event will be difficult to find out.
However, according to the prices of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, VH-3D has a compensation rate of USD 24 380 per hour.
In Eskar's documents, the distance of the flight from its main base point of departure, Quantico, was indicated from Virginio airport to both directions.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below its amount.
"Calculating taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimated compensation rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to a study by rand in 2015, the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation rates for staff costs, but they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The former press officer of the White House, Sean Sâer, defended the use of helicopter at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," said Stuner.
"And I know that the State of Sikorsky and Connecticuti are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are presumably hundreds, if not even thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment on which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
So, of course, it is right to highlight this. "
It is not clear whether the Trump was exposed to a helicopter or not as part of the southern horror event, but he did not want a fire-fighting car.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky addressed representatives by turning the media excuses on the products of a company into a joke in his own aircraft fleet.
'I know Sikorská very well, 'the President said,' I have three of their products'.
Gri Šadeiko - Let's peace and joy through tears
Mil Daece hit the last area of Šadeikot in 2011, 800 m of drinking walking, and at the stage it was taken away with the carpet.
Just before that, he had received a zero degree of uniquitness in China.
The Helsinki system in 2012 broke off from cheap injuries, but it received 60 13 points 23 from the debate held in London.
However, my dismay continued.
Following the opening day 2013, Moscow MMMMMP received a fine-stick injury from Estonia, which was on schedule.
Two years later, he received 15 seats in Beijing's Mil and carried out the Olympic anorm, but that was more to say, to the athletes.
The most difficult cadalipu was through the village of Šadeiko, when it did not receive a letter of results from the Amsterdam EESC at the outset.
I would just like to put one proper multicontest together once.
Once ', sprayed Šadeiko.
Worse still lies ahead: A month later, his Olympic contest in Rios was already covered by the first barrier due to the drainage.
The time had to be withdrawn - did the 7 competitions have to continue?
Is it still worth two days of effort?
Neiu thought for a long time, but found peace.
I was able to think twice about it.
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience, but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time for a healthy cure and a head to think.
"I knew I would not yet put my fingers on the picture," he is talking about his self-cleansing.
I was able to pick up a clean page and go on with a new momentum.
According to Mrs Anne mountain, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of negligence, but she realised that, above all, the sportsman himself had to get clear.
After all, he was so burnt down by everyone.
It was difficult to tolerate.
'Gri said, however, that he will not give up and he wants to prove what he is worth 'says mountain.
Now there is some sort of peace going on.
He will do so to his satisfaction.
The contest came back in May, when Šadeiko set 6280 points in Estonia on several occasions at the Goods contest.
At the high-level contest, he improved his personal peak bull with almost meters (13.89) and drink a record downright-to-date barrier to drinking.
At that time, there was a lot of competition that it was not at all a capacity scale, but a first contest hunger was deleted.
He has been guided for years by the memory that Šadeiko is a black student.
He is ready to be an athlete; he is a good training.
If something does happen or is wrong, he says it immediately.
He feels his own body and he trusts his sensibility.
That is what we have to do.
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we will follow it.
The new approach has also been found in Šadeiko.
'I am not the one who makes the trend to the maximum ', he says and he says that the most important thing is to get the feeling right, because it also provides a good result.
Baby meal of young children is happy to eat
Good emotions have also been offered to Mrs Šadeikok a friend.
Both his former training compatriot, Maris mountain, and his sister Grete, recently became parents and had the support of new weather citizens.
'It has been quite interesting ', word Šadeiko.
One alcohol with drinking is tantamount to 'training'.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fans that he believes - wine can be trained better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist of Yale University.
His message is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and ideas, but rather about the 'very active' process of flavouring 'wine.
By sounding the glass, by complicating wine, enjoying it and perceiving the aftertaste, we are putting our habit into work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheperdi, cattle sleeping does not actually contain a taste, but a taste arises from the way in which wine stimulates the brain.
He will make a comparison of how the brain sees' colour '.
'The taste is not wine, the taste creates the taste of wine 'says Sheperd.
Things that affect yet another taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of heart that man produces.
Aliperd, of course, admits that wine is not full of Jews.
'There must be more in action ', he says.
If you take too much, the system has been overtaken.
Excessive drinking of wine can be damaged instead of benefiting the brain: According to the 2004 study, people who drink more than three glass with wine, a loss of memory, a loss of balance and reduced mental capacity risk.
10% of staff in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay from colleagues
Data from the Staff search firm Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than colleagues.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of Afghan women in politics
On Wednesday, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
The head of the UN Assistance Mission, Nicholas Haysom, said that hundreds of women would stand for local Soviet elections, three women would stand as Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to overstate the importance of the role of women," he said in the statement made on Wednesday.
The elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban, for their part, have threatened the electoral process, which coincides with a transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is transferred calmly from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to the Haysom, women's strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan is increasing.
According to the independent Afghan electoral Commission, 1.2 million women are registered in 3.6 million.
The joy of sharing makes every case more acute, both large and small.
There is always too little time in common, but the trenn is a good opportunity to combine meetings, game, proximity and burden.
And what convenient solution - wherever you run in the summer, live hangings are always with you, and you will be impatiently reminded of your fine voice: 'Let us now move to a trend!'
Without insulation, it is very good to have a normal gold game or to slip along the coast.
One piece is the foundation for keeping its feet and winds in shape - who would then like to take the form of an exaggerated sand from the waves during the summer?
It is nice to use children instead of chicken!
Firstly, it is secure and convenient, and the difficulty is gradually increasing at the same pace as the trained.
Villages with quite large children can also be made available.
The child is training a balance, reading the corps and giving up the opportunity to speak high and be important.
Larger children can at the same time make their own heating.
The scale of the movement is in place with regard to land scarcity and you are pulling up.
I am going to keep the fingers right, the mini-jungle, properly.
The child can read the flames and feel like a training engineer.
The planet is a huge, but hopelessly bolder habit for the child.
But it is easy to relax.
Game-plank: Take a long plangarchy from which to tear through.
In fact, it is more difficult than usual, but much more amusing, to do if, in the meantime, a friend can hand his hand.
To add the burden, a plance, a small turnout can be kept, and there will be a sounding tree in that place.
In addition, the baby can be planted for the puppet, but this exercise offers a break to all children.
At the same time as the tap is sand, the tricks, ash and chlorinated meat are getting the burden as the infection.
A child leaves his feet in such a way that his body is distributed equally and over.
Security can be kept on its hands.
Live up to the foot and get straight up.
Plun can fly, burn, strike a balance and be difficult.
The life of a small engineer is an extermination if he gets a small deal in every fire.
The additional burden will be to drag the feet in advance.
Check that the door will remain in a neutral position.
Children themselves have a lot of ferry buses to do in a boat and with a plate.
A stone with a pulling and a wet.
Follow the safety of the child, the location of the land, and the back of the child in a neutral position.
The favourite of all children and a great breath!
At the same time, the entire physical trenn is truly effective for the mother.
The means of sport were Ott (10), Säde (8), congratulations (4).
Travelling from the Philippines to the heart of mophets
Booked bags are a summer class that has become a self-active product in recent years, one of the right skies has to hang at their hands and which the merchants, despite its modest origin, have been able to use more hourced price labels.
A cocktailed cot is probably one of the things that has existed once in a single life and which has not aroused much emotion.
It simply does exist, and if there is nothing at all.
Now, however, beer bags are on the verge of a real victory, and moefficient designers have switched their musical designs from simple beer to red bags by the summer months instead.
It is not only a coastline, it is just as popular today as it is in the street, and bolder women are even walking into office.
At this point, however, it is worth making it clear before the day whether a summer such as this one is sitting or whether it is worthwhile to postpone the wet and laptops to a little more official.
However, the wealth of talent has made women's real summer love of beer bags.
The first thing to do, for example, when reading foreign fashion logistics, is to note that moeghurts will be the first thing to do when they travel for holidays to the local market and will buy a few beer bags to which the whole holiday time is then on the verge and which go along with the beaches, the market and also, as a friend, the Nazis, in the breadings of the town.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more wolf from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
At the same time, it is worth noting that there is such a high demand among readers that women (and men) are apparently involved in each other's fishing area in order to become a happy owner of some homes in the real world.
In some ways, this madness is also understandable, because it is rare to have these arrangements when, in the motto of yesterday, it is possible to buy a few euros in a habit to ourselves.
It is true that a few hundred traders have also found a simple way of making money here, and in this way, the more expensive luxury brands are also selling cocktails for a few hours and a thousand euros.
Obviously, in order for richer customers not to feel easy to die, who are trying around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy a beer of over EUR 1 000 from Dolce & Gabba.
However, for the interpretation of Chanel beer, a figure of EUR 6 000 can be proposed.
However, unlike most of the motives, the beer dogs do not come at all from some of the great Cape Verde, but their story began far from the point of view.
Indeed, the beer bags allegedly come far from the Philippines, from where they have been dragged.
The bundling of chickens there is, in particular, an export business and very often does not see them going on very often.
Admittedly, the 14-century warfare technology comes from the 14th century and is quite a series of normal corps.
However, since the beer does not need to be red as hard as the flame, they will be able to absorb muscles and other materials that will make the copies more personalised and, by extension, more active.
For example, recently, there are particularly trendy bags with red-coloured paints or skimants.
However, in particular, beer bags may send an actress Jane Birkini, the largest red beer of whom had not been seen before.
In fact, he matised the beer to all kinds of clothing complex, and he did not even consider it to have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
However, today, the popularity of the applicants does not play a smaller role, nor does it have a smaller role to play, that caring for them is a jungle and, unlike any other ski, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but also by water and martyr.
As in the case of trendy robbing, in addition to classical straits, the brands have come up with all possible interpretations.
For example, if you like, you can acquire a bundled clothes or a tiny piece of rubbish from the beer.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that classical beer cocktails never go from mouse to beer flu.
But what is the classic beer, then?
For centuries, such a red cocktail, which resembles its style, has been classified as classical and is short, as well as beer, sanctuary.

Three days ago, a missing man was found on the ground
On Wednesday night, Aare left its home in an unknown direction.
Aarega had the last contact on the phone yesterday, Friday evening, and the positioning of a phone gave the man the seat of the Western island, the village of Musens, where he was sought with a helicopter at midnight and a cocktail, was stolen.
He then got her phone empty and therefore the seat of the man was no longer possible.
The police continued their searches this morning.

GMB concerns about investments at McVitie's Glasgow plant
The trade union expects the leaders of McVitie to confirm long-term production plans at the Glasgow factory.
GMB Scotland said that the company has remained silent on the future of its investment.
More than 500 people work in Hobnobsi and rich know-how and other products.
The owner of McVitie said in Pladis that they have invested more than GBP 5 million in objects over the last few years.
Workers and trade union presidents there 'are the first to hear' when something changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter sent to the head of the company, GMB of Scotland called on McVitie to 'dispel concerns about the lack of funding to modernise production lines'.
GMB senior organisator Drew Duffy said: 'The fact that we cannot get clarity from the head of the subject on the business needs of Customs and the investment plan for the future makes our members deeply concerned.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around the Glasgow region, as an essential pillar for ensuring proper employment in a region with high unemployment and social exclusion.
Therefore, in view of the jobs, wages and welfare of the east of Glasgow, Brexti, the rise in living costs and the chronic reduction in production, a thriving productivity company McVitie is urgently needed. "
The planned representative said: 'The head of Customs received a letter from GMB Scotten only yesterday and the company will respond directly to him because we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between workers and representatives of the GMB in Customs, which discussed a number of issues openly.
At that time, we discussed with the workers that, like all the other companies that operate in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are going to review our activities from now on - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: 'In recent years we have invested more than GBP 5 million in customs equipment, most of which has gone into production routes and improvements.
We fully understand Customs as an object of production and, if any change were to be made to the subject, the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear it. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about its approach to Neyra?
You can regret this interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up in its efforts to attract Neymar to his back-up of GBP 189 million, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record conquitance?
This eloquent approach has opened the summer's transition window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of overpurchase set by the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester, for GBP 89 million in the previous season.
Once the transition has been completed, Neyra will, as a result, become the most expensive player in the world and, at the same time, the most remunerated professional athletes in the world, who will be employed by over GBP 500 000 per week after taxes from the PSG.
Barcelona is, of course, angry by both the approach and the break-up of Neyra, although the close source of Catalansi's management confirms that the club has always done the best for football since its arrival in Santov in 2013.
But did the President of the PSG warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in the conclusion of the Blair-Matuga agreement in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who think about some of the best players and recruitment of the PSG.
'I am not worried because they know that, when they concern some of our players, we are going to meet them and contact their players' said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But when they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players, they have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have gone beyond this limit, as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the PSG central player Marco Verratti.
The PSG made it clear that they will not be allowed to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could be a setback as a result of this interest by eliminating one of its expensive assets in the form of Neymark.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexitit.
"Brexit is threatened with a serious blow between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," warned Varadkar at his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
"I cannot imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: Building bridges, not borders," he emphasised.
He said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, because it cannot, he would be part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained by the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: 'Certainly we could have this kind of deal with Britain'.
The alternative to this would be to return to customs items that would declare historic divisions and political failure.
'Strengthening trade, prosperity and peace 'said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexitit 'our generation's challenge' and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of the everyday life of Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met with leaders of the main Irish parties in Belfast.
Through her first half-long triathlon, Avja: Ironman is able to go through everyone.
Today, around a thousand triggers from more than thirty countries were held in the winter capital, Otever the Baltic States' largest triathons, when the one-and-a-half-long Ironman competition came into being.
70.3 miles of a batch consisted of 1.9 km of flooding, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, the first triggle of his life also ended up with Avele.
"I thought that it would be difficult and, in the end, it was a difficult one."
Despite the complexity of the report, Avele has shown that, in fact, the trick is well-suited to almost everyone.
'not a button kills, but a speed kills', he said, suggesting that, at a rate of prosperity, almost everyone would reach the fingers.
With the exception of Ott Sep, 'everything is fine, but unfortunately he cannot flood'.
Avele had already done a lot to a trenn since February.
From 4 to 5 hours a week to 10 hours a week.
In time 05: 34: 12 he achieved 2700th place in general calculation.
Although Avcian lost both Raio Piony (time 04: 59: 53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05: 06: 37), she won other so-called 'prominent class' tents.
Last year, Tanel Padar lost Avani in seven minutes (time: 54: 54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time: 05: 23), Kalev Krnew and Raivo E. Tampere (times as follows: 06: 31: 53 and 06: 45: 18).
The overall winner of Otepää's male account was chronic German, Johannes Moldan, with 3: 58: 27; 27, Estonians with the best time of 04: 14: 09.
Women were won by Danes Helle Frederiksen with 04: 24: 01, but also by Maria Jänese, who lost almost half an hour to Frederiksen and received 04: 58: 58.
Fifteen minutes and 14 seconds went through a flood distance of 1.9 km.
He came out of her 410 position.
