four members of the K@@ ly@@ ro@@ vo Group have been detained in Estonia and Spain .
according to postal law , a leader of the so @-@ called &quot; governmental &quot; Group of &quot; Medi@@ ro , &quot; based in the Estonian wealth , S@@ ja@@ b Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , evidence of the criminal world known as S@@ dra K@@ Cape smo@@ v@@ ski is honoured by the police in Spain .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch &apos;s detention in Spain was arrested during a court arrest .
yesterday , the court also took three suspects arrested in Estonia .
the so @-@ called members of the the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde &apos; criminal community are , due to suspicion , between 27 and 57 years of life , who commit mostly crimes against the drug .
the alleged head of a criminal community was seized in Kar@@ sel@@ thia , Spain .
in Estonia , three men were executed as suspects , one of whom is according to data obtained , and two are Members of the criminal Community .
the fact that the collected data points out that in the criminal community the tasks and role assigned were clearly divided .
the purpose of criminal activities was to commit drug crime and hence to make criminal proceeds costs , &quot; commented on the head of the criminal procedure , Head of State Prosecutor Va@@ notification Ver@@ te .
&apos;@@ We do not rule out that this circle of suspected criminals will grow &apos; , adding a public Prosecutor .
these are people who have ever been hit by the law enforcement authorities &apos; interest and some among them have been punished for crimes against drugs .
those people highlighted that cooperation with their Spanish counterparts has been crucial throughout the process of examining it .
&quot; international cooperation is common to us and the weekly operation shows the success of cooperation . &quot;
injured in Le@@ is , head of central police services , said that imprisonment included similar periods of one and a half years of preliminary study .
&apos;@@ For the first half of the week the long @-@ term viability of the operation and at the same time we in Estonia and Spain with@@ drew suspected of committing crimes &apos; , he said .
in Lithuania , primary police officials benefited from detention in Spain .
for years now we have a good liaison with each other and an understanding with the Spanish police and on the Civil Guard .
these arrests are yet another message for criminals that we come into top of the European Tor@@ t . &quot; said Le@@ is .
the information gathered so far clearly shows that , when under arrest , men from suspicion can continue to commit new crimes and thus ask for their arrest to be arrested by the Prosecutor and approved by the Court .
a man arrested in Spain expects his re@@ donation to Estonia .
property , automo@@ bi@@ les and cash are con@@ ten@@ sed to ensure confiscation .
the ICTY proceedings are conducted by the Office for organised crime by central police and led by the prosecution authorities .
in 2005 , the city &apos;s Tribunal of Tallinn was convicted of blackmail , and punished for five years imprisonment .
in the mid @-@ last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ smoking was held the second most important part in the Criminal World of Estonia after Ti@@ aran@@ ko@@ v at the time .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch from Cape Verde put forward the Estonian Development Fund in early 1990s when he started the pres@@ ti@@ gious process in Tallinn .
Ad@@ mittedly he taxed tax@@ i drivers and women who operate on various ho@@ tels and ordered 24 months with a monthly dis@@ charges for businesses .
&apos;@@ The fight against organised crime &apos; is &quot; effective &apos; , international joint operations , criminal assets confis@@ cations and legal decisions that came into force .
for example , the latest judgments , eight accused persons who seized € 80 000 from the criminal transaction case of the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ ik criminal organisation , or the ruling ruling case against nine people that Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v , created a criminal organisation in 2006 aimed at illegal trafficking of contra@@ band gun@@ s and trafficking of human beings activities in countries and southern Estonia .
its highly confis@@ cated criminal revenue is close to EUR 71 500 .
in these matters , it has ensured that the police difference information and prosecutors strongly with external colleagues every day , and where appropriate , action will be carried out in any country in the European Union .
civil rights Group war@@ ns against Mis@@ pride travel
the Association for the Ad@@ van@@ vana of the People &apos;s Mu@@ kel@@ y People ( NA@@ Nicaragua ) has warned the governments of Muslims travelling to Meh@@ rin for discrimin@@ ating in national politics and racist attacks .
its statement states , &apos; The NA@@ Islands travelling shop for state @-@ specific aid was issued for it ( DS ) until 28 August 2017 , calls upon all tuna Americans to be particularly attentive and highly cautious in the context of the bal@@ lots of racial events that have been carried out recently by the state and highlight here &apos; .
NA@@ DS says that the group ordered both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it more difficult to raise cases of discrimination , as well as the tourist destination targets of different state law and discrimination .
citizens &apos; rights are violated .
they are got away because of their colour of a telling dri@@ ft , beaten or killed for &quot; said R@@ o Cha@@ pel , President of NA@@ selle Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i .
&apos;@@ We never had so compla@@ c@@ ants &apos; .
this is the first warning issued by an organisation concerning the state of the USA .
reference was made to such events as racist insul@@ ts front school students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and stoning of the 28 year old ju@@ mb@@ Eastern Sy@@ n@@ pe@@ y species of T@@ en@@ nes@@ sel .
S@@ and@@ ers died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , when they got stranded in petrol through the state , and the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police kept him in custody without having been accused of a crime .
moreover , the report compiled recently by the chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i shows that H@@ CV drivers &apos; cars are set to be stopped in the state by 75 % more likely than white agents .
&apos;@@ A comment is meant so that people are aware and warn their families , friends and collabor@@ ators against what can happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is , say Cha@@ pel . &apos;
&apos;@@ People need to be ready , whether it is moving away from taking your money too or informing neighbours that they are going through their country &apos; .
the latest details of the F@@ B@@ I programme for communicating hate crimes included 100 hate offences committed at Stra@@ it in 2015 which places states at 16@@ 16 sites in state contact on similar acts .
travel is also threats to the new Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law that makes it difficult for the company courts to lo@@ dge solutions to try to find a living or employment .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( American civil society expanding Union Europol nez AC@@ L@@ U ) had previously issued travel licences for T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona after those states adopted immigration laws which ordered local authorities to arrest people for violations regarding immigration , as , according to AC@@ L@@ U , it increases racial profiling .
usually , they issue warnings from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about other countries , but in the recent past stakeholders have started using the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .

in addition , the daily enforcement of hygiene requirements , for the waste of meat or dis@@ infec@@ tants , is important and it is important that it was@@ tes all fruit and vegetables before being consumed in food .

vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis V is part of the National immun@@ isation Scheme in Estonia and free of charge for children .

the propri@@ etary spokes@@ man &apos;s inf@@ er@@ position technique could be reduced in the rush , decreased subjects would have had to have been affected more by the extraordinary landscape allowed by the title .
currently , the two books , Dr Kli@@ m@@ ti and his pain@@ ted parent of Da@@ am gold , at B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri &apos;s time , should have beaten the story , and vy and more widely fledged history from the H@@ G@@ loyal Jewish families and German occupation , along with its aftermath in Austria .

the concentration of cultural charac@@ ters was felt like a gram of cultural heritage in some of Europe &apos;s rich@@ est cities , on the one I can watch it , reading a declaration of a great , profound created name .

in the 19th century , the document of Jews in Vienna had explo@@ ded over recent decades as the largest Jewish society became in Western Europe .
almost one in every ten residents of Vienna had a July Free Day .

the fact that , for a few sports mar@@ ried , the master &apos;s li@@ tre page with the mo@@ del@@ ta was suspected , the sugar can@@ na@@ at was not discoura@@ ged .

although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is left to the extent that Jewish profes@@ sors responded to his S@@ ca@@ de@@ mine , there is no actual Jews for his ex@@ ca@@ es@@ tion@@ ist .
at any rate , the role of Gal@@ beria in Austria , referred to in the Baltic , by 19@@ 39 , had been considerably reversed - to offer the be@@ ac@@ on work services from the rich Jewish art colle@@ ctions in Vienna .

the Danish gold portal rose last while on all its times , rolling stock stood at three times , and has its fresh peak , the fifth of Estonia &apos;s time .
the young hope of the future lies in the Canadian adult partnerships of 100 m , 200 m or 400 m in bal@@ tu@@ lating and in 10 m@@ m@@ m@@ 400 m@@ m cu@@ res and bun@@ k@@ ering .

he has arrived at a further 100 m communication exchange involving his people when he had started flow@@ ing s@@ lide .

President T@@ ru@@ t par@@ ade goes on holiday ; critics insu@@ red teet@@ h
the holiday season is in our hands - we are also looking at the Left &apos;s President Donald &apos;s Cu@@ tak@@ er .
yet , as T@@ ru@@ mp has been one of the President who took out the most holidays so far , the critics are ali@@ zing too@@ th@@ trees .
according to US VIS and CN@@ N , the President intends to have 17 days &apos; leave in the separate Keny@@ an club at B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , which is located in New Jer@@ se@@ y .
although President @-@ in @-@ Office holidays began yesterday , there has been a couple of weeks on leisure issues against T@@ ru@@ mp@@ s .
they are eating ahead of T@@ stu@@ vel to the wall over @-@ load .
clearly , the President &apos;s Sir has been wise to sit for a weekend in the F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey &apos;s cotton .
by the way , the T@@ ru@@ per has now not cle@@ arest to pu@@ mp the president within the basis of his 19@@ 6 working days .
George W@@ . Bush , for example , was able to hold 67 days on holiday in time , with Barack Obama on half the T@@ ru@@ ker , for 21 days .
yet the Can@@ aries tend to sw@@ am@@ p up their s@@ le@@ eve .
the hours looked at following the presidential election were meant , when the T@@ ru@@ bun@@ t pi@@ tes were supposed to save 60 minutes , that it would not miss one while his bri@@ e@@ der agreed that much needed to be done .
he also expressed his outra@@ ge about Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
on Twitter , the current president wrote , &apos; while Obama has some holidays , plays gol@@ f , is at the brak@@ es and j@@ ung@@ le concer@@ ts , journalists in poor is on the wake of the day . &apos;
W@@ ho@@ ever spent 17 @-@ day ro@@ of@@ p visits giving mail shopping sites a full break . &apos;
it is officially called &apos; work migrants &apos; , through which S@@ ho@@ ary does not have the time to read or become other likes .
in addition , at a time of working leave , there was no other reason .
specifically , a European organic pension scheme will change in the western sending of a White House and that is why all staff had to leave the crop .
the West Bank also ho@@ sts the O@@ val@@ ka@@ k offices and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not believe that anyone else would like to be in the Western gallery , in August , if there were 38 degrees , and there is no con@@ te@@ lation &apos; , the Board &apos;s spokes@@ man L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , declared that the President would continue to work during his leave .
those waste 17 days away from President T@@ ru@@ phone are su@@ ken a video description .
contrast the blocking of men@@ tors in Facebook don &apos;t stand for state positions while you do not hold back the voters &apos; criticism .
the father of our country knew a lot about falling media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved Mr Washington , but the newspapers did not take long to get him fed in , for everything from internal politics to his policy no@@ tions .
of course the criticisms upset him .
but he did not have forced her critics to remain silent .
because in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &apos; Freedom of expression may be taken away from us and more readily and si@@ len@@ ced , sheep could guide us to slaugh@@ ter@@ dro@@ ps &apos; .
that brings me to Ar@@ ck@@ land bed Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who is having to work harder to put more to Washington .
the properties are blocked and cancelled by at least 450 people who on their official Facebook page expressed their views .
and at the beginning of the week the United States Union for Freedom of Citizens ( American Civil Guard Union ) had brought Greece to court for its part .
the vocational officer &apos;s official action s@@ le@@ ep and web commen@@ taries ta@@ cked a victim who wanted &apos; from the response in style ?
it is Facebook , &apos; many people have said so .
well , that counts .
and think that matters particularly much when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
this is an ama@@ zing March @-@ winning van@@ Gilad in this country of the Du@@ ch@@ istic Re@@ publi@@ can .
his count is somehow a stronger sum of entry for its 50 Grand Prime Action units .
Ho@@ gan is not a reac@@ tive sight .
it has put it firmly and remains very firmly clear on its own .
moreover , it has used her as the key tool for communicating to its voters quite el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently with Facebook as it presents a ru@@ ul@@ l like at the very first time , following a requests for che@@ mo@@ breaking newspaper .
therefore , the ko@@ wing pat@@ tern is the joint public forum run by taxpayer &apos;s B@@ bail @-@ hard @-@ fare staff , to the detriment of the people going to Syria and ultimately dangerous .
the authority of the Ho@@ gan press representative , Ame@@ lia Ch@@ asse The Washington Ex@@ po , defended the behaviour of its Grand Con@@ sor@@ ting officer by claiming that it was nothing less than &apos; mode@@ reintroduction &apos; .
yet it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet websites , digital set@@ ters and people of il@@ legi@@ ble telep@@ hon@@ ers or hate .
he talked to several quite people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and that is what they are really the people in Yemen who communicate to their elected leaders : the execu@@ tor , the holder of the firm and Kouch@@ ner , and not Internet checks .
they everybody said they had input of regard , thought @-@ out and not being ro@@ p@@ Rio .
in her postal services &apos; office quoted the Bi@@ ble in giving emphasis to the Catholic Church of Ho@@ gan .
Mar@@ y@@ lan &apos;s lawyer of Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not inc@@ ur hatred but rather hate crimes .
&quot; I told you poli@@ tely that I was disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; he wrote the postal news story on sentence in his foremost country .
it is also unfortunate that I do not like the idea that while much people comment on the same theme , some will immediately call it an un@@ commits collective effort , rather than acknowledging that they are a great ar@@ ray of citizens &apos; concerns &apos; .
what the Governor &apos;s administra@@ tor civil servan@@ t then called the &apos; targeted jun@@ k attack &apos; was probably invited by others to &apos; more &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era allows an easy way to reconcile messages by merely blocking critical questions or dele@@ ting negative comments .
this is more stringent than an out@@ f for sending employees so that they gather newspaper Klaus of critical leadership , bur@@ ying them or imprison@@ ing those prote@@ sters and forcing them to silence .
action , today we are seeing this , simple digital .
Mr Ho@@ gan is not the first national official criticised for making Facebook and the other social media become too@@ th@@ less .
President Ti@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has taken Twitter travelling to court over his use of Twitter , who has been blocked from Twitter .
one of the first celeb@@ rations took place in the matter last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ an .
the US civil servan@@ t James C. In physi@@ ria , the Governor of the Board of V@@ supervisors of Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i , Institu@@ tional Board , declared him a breach of civil law after blocking the pro@@ po@@ ser on Facebook page .
Mr qui@@ ck@@ ys also visited Mr Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in@@ it ( who spoke ) , on Facebook and Twitter .
that should not be so difficult .
at Washington , online li@@ abilities had the same effect as they had on expensive postal bills as on the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number and anon@@ ymous writing pa@@ using boards so@@ wed his practice .
even then , Washington had had to s@@ kir@@ h up anon@@ ymous controls .
the people wrote letters out to newspapers paper , from pseu@@ do @-@ Th@@ er@@ on@@ ica , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , imprison@@ ing Strasbourg &apos;s decisions .
according to historical documents collected in the meanwhile necessary as part of the project for gathering ema@@ ils in Washington he bu@@ ried the c@@ abinet at a petition which stood up for his views on friendly , commercial and shipping agreements with Great Britain .
but he did not make them go any further .
freedom of expression , differences of opinion and debates are built on the foundations of our country .

they tend to keep most of the catches to the family ; the remainder are sold on the local markets .
only 10 000 parts of Indonesia charge their seats ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities between noble pa@@ thi@@ ans and new migrants who have arrived multiple by opening new routes at the Ran@@ via airport have intensified .

&quot; journalists in Ras@@ mel from the most Middle East &apos;s provinces and Middle Bo@@ ke@@ an report are contributing new threats , with announced comments , breaking down the visa or black@@ listing he launched . &quot;
the lack of a worrying view of the media means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia relates to a large extent to Papua our@@ a@@ neighbour countries .

&apos;@@ We do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite gre@@ eting and intimidation , families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i fire managed last a symbolic reception , systematic and returned to one of the victims &quot; bodies of police staff and military action in the country in question .

these four smart phone top @-@ quality models will reach business all over the summer of the year .
the preferred i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach railway ta@@ yers by mid @-@ September .
however , the ma@@ gi@@ ants which cannot see the new Apple model , and which could be done , are spreading .
if i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not figure the significant differences between i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , Apple will be expected to fully fine the previous ones when the 10th anniversary of Apple would be First .
there have been four col@@ ours of black , White , rosé , tro@@ d elements and cro@@ re@@ h .
one of the elements of the new design will probably be to have a check covering all the telephone front@@ line , with the loss of head@@ lines and fingerprints and the introduction of a pen@@ tery .
Mr J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve , Director of Apple &apos;s design , requires that a new i@@ P@@ hone model look like the one reached in the glass .
that said , there has been talk of an i@@ P@@ hone version .
outside the tight straight , the un@@ man@@ age@@ able charging system and the more often @-@ friendly camer@@ a , in particular , a faster A@@ 11 process is expected .
it is surely one of the most promising smart phones in the year .
the ex @-@ ante order of the new model G@@ ala@@ x@@ y Plan@@ 8 will begin on 23 August .
although I see many rum@@ ours , what is the new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y Bé@@ 8 .
Ad@@ mittedly , even more business is meant by business , and S pen allows us even bigger fun@@ ction@@ alities .
the phone should have two camer@@ as , one of which is a la@@ x@@ ho@@ ea and another fu@@ n s@@ wine objec@@ ting to the narrow view .
no one knows what two yards are capable of having but in any case Sam@@ sun@@ g &apos;s first test , which is by and far a factor of e@@ P@@ hone 8 , is difficult to navig@@ ate .

on a new model of S@@ ony , there has been speculation that its screen is at least hot .

the fact is that a winter capital which k@@ ic@@ ks off , he says , is custom@@ ary for the people who have voted on the street .

K@@ abu@@ l , an suicide attack - Vic@@ tor@@ ing has killed a NATO soldi@@ er
according to officials , military munitions ( F@@ NL ) were attacked by an oper@@ a bomb located in K@@ abu@@ l , a land in Afghanistan , killing one NATO soldi@@ er and several of you .
it has been said in NATO statement that five soldiers and interpreters have been injured .
unknown local reports indicate three civilians / international dies of a cell on the Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ h of the city , confirm their death as well .
this bom@@ bing is the first of the acts of violence which have hit Afghanistan this month - over 30 people were killed in the Her@@ ati mos@@ que attacks on Tuesday .
on Monday , two people were killed in suicide bom@@ bed in K@@ abu@@ l near the Iraqi emb@@ assy .
NATO &apos;s statement said that an explosion of Thursday evening took place when a army of Afghan class pat@@ ro@@ ls was attempted &apos; by an unex@@ plo@@ dal body made by a person .
according to the Statement , all are injured in the stable state and treated in the case of Bag@@ ra@@ m , an air flying in the US military hospital .

according to UN figures , in the first half of 2017 , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan , some 20 % of them in the capital city .
at the end of July , there were at least 30 arriving at a stro@@ ke right up of the cars bomb was killed in K@@ abu@@ l .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
across 45 May a major bomb attack in the city of his city killed more than 150 people , which has led most of the deaths in that country since the US kidna@@ pped its forces in 2001 .
this violence emphasises the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp will consider whether to increase the number of US troops which help the state , facilitating its military and police .
according to our correspon@@ dent spokes@@ persons , his suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also brought a crisis of public confidence against the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf .

EPAs announced the decision to continue on the 2015 counting exercise , during their late adoption on Wednesday , indicating that it expresses the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .

fifteen of the predominantly democratic states , together with C@@ olum@@ bia , presented an enqu@@ iry procedure on Tuesday , declaring that the decision was illegal .

M@@ ür@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , debate potential confrontation
V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ ae@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should feature in a clas@@ s@@ room to deal with the most attractive po@@ em in the very near future for the first time on Thursday , met in a Kan@@ y@@ ard EB@@ 7 kg and reported de@@ pu@@ ric@@ al category .
they were in Se@@ ph@@ on@@ or@@ ish rooms of the ES@@ P@@ N in L@@ L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ les until Gar@@ cia from the world of Bo@@ nez Coun@@ c@@ Indonesia , a ligh@@ mandatory coalition s de @-@ tech corridor , also served to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , global Bo@@ iv assies forum Forum que .
following the consensus in 1987 , two comb@@ at@@ ants across the old four @-@ day world champion Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ erial have joined the College .
Gar@@ cia hand@@ ed its better hand and said : &apos; how will the summer , the che@@ ror ?
let me take luck . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko will defend his bel@@ ds against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ ga on Saturday evening at 19 C@@ C@@ C@@ ES@@ P@@ N .
when there was a ta@@ g for photo@@ graph@@ s , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko &apos;s gar@@ ne@@ j@@ er E@@ g Kli@@ mas stated that there would be a &apos; perfect moder@@ ation &apos; .
&apos;@@ I have been coun@@ c@@ er @-@ hear@@ tened by the former &apos; MDGs brought to mind Gar@@ cia .
&apos;@@ I asked for B@@ ron@@ er &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; but I am not there .
I am small about 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move below the ligh@@ tho@@ use .
and it is required to take up hal@@ f@@ way a ligh@@ ter &apos;s weight &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
it is what the F@@ än@@ ders have wanted .
let us therefore give them this kind of intervention . &apos;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; we need this fight in the world . &quot;
in the climate , the question raised was whether it should be held up compensa@@ ting on this : it is part of his strategy for allowing the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to clean up a debate later this year by the 6@@ 1.2 kg game , in order to make allow a meeting with Gar@@ ci@@ tis ( 37 to 0 , 30 no@@ visas ) , which is also interested in dealing with Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ l &apos;s match match after the launch of their ligh@@ ter mass @-@ set by 23 September .
&quot; looking ahead to this fight tel@@ er@@ ly because f@@ ans have called for that dispute , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , later on , that she was open to fighting , either - but on any channel offering the best financial packages .
&quot; we are core carers .
the second name cannot come out so much of it .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that she stood up on the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t as an &apos; war@@ f@@ ist &apos; and could go to the sto@@ ke of his Saturday .
however , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was modest in pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia in saying that he found that his report to be &apos; very slow , sorry , M@@ y@@ y ... few te@@ remo@@ ters from Ri@@ ver@@ ds &apos; .
Gar@@ cia said that the aim was to show weight and then bo@@ w to w@@ el .
both confirmed they felt how the pressures would intensify to facilitate their eventual challenge from one side .
&quot; this is the fight that looks forward to completion .
no other confrontation indicates so much attention and no con@@ dom .
more than in the effort to do it , it said &apos; Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best mili@@ tants and M@@ ae@@ y is precisely that .
this comes with a good deal of war@@ fare . &quot;
which world threats are being shifted from Estonia ?
the soil extended and issued a record residence permits of over 13 000 people from third countries who have progressively travelled to Estonia for employment , study or family .
the number of Ita@@ lians , for example , more than 4@@ 9@@ 28 wat@@ ches was decided on the deadline upon the issuance of 9@@ 02 11 residence permits for soils .
the professionals will not be able to say how many migrants will finally ran@@ k in Estonia , but this analysis will also just be made in the Ministry of the Interior .
when almost 500 Ukrainians sat at Italy a year four decades ago , that figure will arrive close to 2 000 in recent years .
during the Ukrainian crisis , the number of applications for temporary permits increased dramatically which needed 10 8@@ 87 people to rely on the fixed duration in 2014 , 6@@ 75 earlier in the year .
the statistics office produces the highest growth rate for Ukrainian nationals in Estonia , with 850 of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia suffering from the high street somewhere more than in hand .
&quot; the Ukrainian Community has always been important in Estonia and , due to the difficult circumstances in the country , it is considered natural to look for work and learning purposes from a country including that of community , among many families , their spokes@@ man , Kris@@ tin Ram@@ alla@@ ra , on the Ministry of the Interior .
So@@ il and host had benefited from high @-@ distance residence permits for Ukrainians , even though over the sake of 10 years , the most open @-@ ended residence permits were ever exceeded for the last two decades .
if Ukrainians get along mainly , then Russian citizens will be so taken of family migration .
&quot; given their historic Russian community , they also probably have the greatest family ties with those living in Russia , &quot; said Hel@@ ina handling , for example during an internal protection facility .
&quot; looking at what Russian nationals that have lived on a territory in Estonia and whom Har@@ wel@@ land has been acquired , Har@@ et@@ lands is now confined to East Vir@@ g@@ land : she measured and pointed out that nearly 40 % of these have been mar@@ ried with a European Union citizen .
soil received 1,@@ 6@@ 96 Russian citizens into fixed @-@ term residence permits ; it is also record across the spectrum .
at the same time , the freedom to extend residence by consuming Russians was reduced altogether .
&quot; compensation is due not to the applications for the new residence permit but to the temporary establishment of Estonia , but rather a permanent residence permit , &quot; clarified by stakeholders at the Ministry of the Interior , the inaugu@@ ral spokes@@ person , who said that the interest of Russian nationals in Estonian residency has remained rather stable for years to come .
a new residence permit for Mali which is lasting , can apply for at least three years for foreigners in the country .
it aims to encourage the appeal of people who adapt .
however , long @-@ term resident residence permit will require five years , for example .
now , this new residence permit is expected to lead to a decline in the extension of old residence permits .
for example , soil was given such a residence permit to 146 of Ukrainians who have been here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians can now change their work and Estonia will no longer reduce its finger at if the wage criterion is satisfied .
this residence permit was popular - all for the Indi@@ ans as candidates of 10@@ 29 left the same li@@ g@@ ying , as well as air fa@@ res ( 4@@ 87 ) , protective individuals ( 54 ) and nic@@ ot@@ ine content ( 36 ) .
in total , 19@@ 68 people were able to live in with the chance to reside in Estonia , including 23 counterparts , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and also just as many Chinese voters .
this year &apos;s first semester already notes the total number of such applications in 12@@ 69 .
in ten years , surpris@@ ingly , Nigeria has become one of the most active candidates with the Estonian residence permit .
while three permits were granted for Maltese people in 2007 , soil was 200 .
Nigeria comes to learn the lessons of universities in this place .
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among big players , such as Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
India , Bangladesh and Nigeria have made a surge in numbers , largely thanks to learning games .
the rule that where a community does appear stands goes up there all the more easily to anyone else , adding a resigna@@ tion to it .
over the 10 years , two people in Latvia have also linked up , for example , from North Korea , just as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come to Cuba , 2@@ 31 from South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four from U@@ ru@@ guay .
if a year , approximately 6 000 third country nationals receive a residence permit , then that is about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even though , on top of EU citizens , migration remains on an exceptional large part of seeing : &quot; Sch@@ ic@@ he@@ mp commented that there is actually a small number .
altogether , according to statistics institutes , 14 8@@ 22 people emig@@ rated to Estonia , 13 7@@ 92 people affected .
migration means that for a second year immigration went apart from the emigration .
most of the out@@ breaks and ex@@ patri@@ ations are Estonian citizens , but there are more of whom they are from dis@@ lo@@ vals .
that is why the Estonian citizens &quot; migratory secret soil was in conflict with the 2 000 people .
older citizens are specifically travelling between Finland and Estonia .

I think that we have missed the start of patience , the talk of indig@@ nation .
the first thing came to pass was that we were unable to get our feet in the game .
and , when such a gap enters into the table , there is nothing going to be done &apos; , Estonian U@@ 18 cor@@ bal@@ li@@ po@@ s 61 said : 75 zero in British , our only tro@@ b teacher diplo@@ mas also - St@@ mos Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo subscri@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ sel - lost to Britain .
opponents took rather 28 p@@ ongs from the south @-@ g@@ lance and got so much more attacks as a result of this .
we were also not prepared either to protect them effectively and not attack them , but it created it .
many attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds , we could not build the protection .
but they have to be stopped wherever it were , that we could not combine it .
it created territories in the square .
the anti @-@ against economy work was better done .
Ar@@ th@@ r@@ f@@ pa estimates that Estonia has had to make more tac@@ tical mistakes so that the fire against it is pic@@ ked .
the latter was one quarter of all - we had error , but opponents themselves were already able to collect several quick sentences .
For@@ ship and firm aggression , which was our weapon on a itself , all brought to us in against the background .
we did not have the strength of our tomorrow against their aggressive th@@ read .

because the experience of this constitu@@ ent in that excessively my@@ ste@@ rious and sal@@ va@@ ging environment puts human dignity more appealing , and involves human beings in a way that cannot be described .

of course , but , since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has contributed a great deal of help .
he went through a whole course of my student career and also supported my deficit at the beginning of his career .
perhaps this is what makes it easier for me to carry on my work .
so much of her good has been drawn to the team on Burma in K@@ ho@@ la and , of course , the team of F@@ esti@@ val will be bu@@ ried on my side .
it was excellent to join a team that knows exactly how things are going to be .
it was thanks to E@@ ri K@@ ians to res@@ on@@ ance which inspired me to go ahead with Mr F@@ esti@@ val in Ha@@ ida@@ r M@@ ini@@ oma@@ sel .
and here I am , can , will I , model .
what example could a public bur@@ n @-@ up would you propose at today &apos;s festi@@ val ?
we have links between immigrants from England , Latvia , Lithuania and surprising devices above and in advertising , among others , the first bal@@ le@@ i magaz@@ ine accredi@@ ted to the cheese of Astrid L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i .

to the risk , what do you do you all explore ?
because of my support life , my life @-@ friendly fellow is definitely un@@ accessible .
such work requires an an@@ ima@@ ge system and much love , which I have got , thank@@ fully , it is .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tion is not one of great levels of dependency on my personal emo@@ tion , then what about me is how I might be against each new day .
and so , awareness in keeping this , maintaining the anthem and actually na@@ ming yourself into the mir@@ ror of the morning demonstrated me as a positive percentage .
this week , especially now that it is the most important tests , I have already been very busy at doing this and it does work .
lau@@ dable acts increase the brain and an escalation of tone .
this is simply not a word .
I believe that people still do not know half what the univer@@ se offers them , but that would somehow be ready one by that going towards the other .
now , there is an important moment .
is there an al@@ tera@@ r before Mon@@ ri@@ gen@@ d pul@@ ls are taken ?
the substance is still , and it has to be changed against c@@ aste .
this is only a little moment for ourselves .

in fact even before going into che@@ mis@@ gen@@ di@@ um , I can talk actively with the people .

new results of the Swedish testing tests on au@@ x &apos;s age
in Sweden , a instru@@ ction to take an unfortunate approach in general was proposed : the latest results show that more than 80 % of the draft buildings were valued over 18 years and that in no means all believe that the results are rea@@ dable .
the Swedish national Institute for Legal medicine ( R@@ asy@@ ts@@ admissible in@@ al@@ cur@@ t ) started off with tests later this year .
the tests were set up to perio@@ dic@@ alise the period of application for the rent subsequently after criticism of the Swedish Agency for Migration ( migration cur@@ t ) for failing to correctly determine the age of an allegedly multiple juven@@ ile refugees .
to date , Jordan has been carrying out 14 8@@ 80 cases in testing , and the Tribunal has issued its results totalling 24@@ 81 tests between mid March 2017 and 31 July 2009 .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) , the trial institution continued to rate 18 years or older , with 25 further cases assess that the &apos; 18 @-@ year @-@ old or lower age &apos; testing was performed .
4@@ 32 cases concluded that &apos; most likely young than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if people &apos;s age is questioned .
John stepping bor@@ ner , who operates in the institution of judicial medicine , said that the results were consistent with those of previous months .
&quot; we now see a large gap compared to the statistics in the past months ; the numbers are quite consistent , &quot; said EU food to newspaper The G8 .
it does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been making possession of their age , where large sums were assessed earlier than 18 .
in May the EIT issued the results of the 581 test by Atalanta saying , in 42 cases , they referred to the person to be indicated to be 18 different years old .
but when the press Ber@@ tun@@ t investigated his 70@@ th test , it became clear that , in 2@@ 43 cases , man had said directly that it would be 18 this year .
this method of assessing the physical age , whereby H@@ ex@@ x den@@ tists @-@ too@@ th X di@@ gen@@ i@@ ids and bur@@ ns MR@@ T are then open to screening in some circles through too@@ th@@ p@@ aste doctors and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts .
one of the sceptics is the one of the endo@@ k@@ rin@@ olo@@ gist of the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute , whose tasks include assessing people &apos;s biological maturity , namely whether they were going through their audience more often or later .
&apos; my thoughts have been right about this and I do not think the way we have now been measured should be incorporated .
restricting biodiversity in such a way is unrealistic .
if we cannot say , then , we should not pretend we find &apos; he said to the newspaper , Mr D@@ oc@@ ro .
however , the exact features of the tests protected by Joh@@ an Kinga kti@@ son &apos;s Institu@@ tional reactor : &apos; overall , it can be said that the risk of gro@@ oming the child is sc@@ ences of in@@ accurate access to adul@@ ter@@ isation .
maybe at around 10 % , the greatest risk will be when you are just under 18 . &quot;

Co@@ e praised Russians for their fair apolo@@ gy about the spiral of doping .
Com@@ menting ed strongly against doping , the international r@@ within S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , re@@ confirmed , according to what he said , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apologise four day , but repeated that now is not the time to return to its sport .
the Russian k@@ ron@@ na@@ g Se@@ ce@@ h@@ tin of outrageous World C@@ up requested assurances that the ban on competitions which be introduced by Russia is right , and had a duty to fight doping , in the wake of the World C@@ up hundreds of Iv@@ ori@@ an events .
he apolog@@ ised for &apos; all co@@ us@@ ers freed up in competitions with a collapse in gold and sil@@ ver med@@ als &apos; .
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for keeping in force the ban on competitions introduced in November 2015 following the endorsement of the World Anti @-@ terrorism Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) Report , evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think there was a very honest answer today , a very honest presentation , saying to the press , Ma@@ in@@ st@@ y Juncker , the President of IA@@ AF .
&apos;@@ The entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation themselves themselves recognised that they had had had had quite difficult times and that they would do their utmost to reform the Association &apos; .
the Co@@ e also declared he was delighted on Ukraine &apos;s acceptance of the criteria for rein@@ stating itself .
&quot; I hope there was a very constructive Day and progress on the ground today , but Congress supports a very proposal that it is not the time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do all we can to norm@@ alise the situation in the next few months .
we always abide by principle that we wish to separate K@@ ath@@ ols from the system which was laid down , &quot; added her .

the electric car revolution is an important shift in the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
but little is that the electric car revolution makes changes in everything on the supply market until infrastructure , it is also the case for new losers and winners on the me@@ tal markets .
while extra@@ gi@@ ants such as G@@ len@@ ICAN@@ Rail are able to say that if they successfully win from one place and lose by the other , this would not help smaller mining firms .
G@@ len@@ core coal and oil currently serve , yet in the age of electricity cars , the du@@ mp , conne@@ tunnel , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ ot@@ ine demand will increase .
this year , representatives of the governments of the United Kingdom , France and Norway have stepped up their contributions for the spread of electric cars which will allow a ban on sales of new cars using fossil fuels over the coming decades .
Sk@@ es@@ vo has therefore already knew that he is going to do away with an internal combustion engine and T@@ es@@ la will bring up the market a cheaper second of 3 power vehicles .
B@@ tron@@ berg &apos;s new Energy Finance Finance Authority estimates that motor vehicles ( used by oil @-@ produced fuels ) will be sold in further two decades .
&quot; in some respects , it amends everything , &quot; said Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ in B@@ stoc@@ ber@@ gis , the raw materials analysis of Capital rias .
we have already seen great effects of the co@@ c@@ ine pos@@ ter of metals , which demand has been increasing for years .
electricity buildings have pieces in parts of the bun@@ dle less than in the conventional car , and publication at G@@ len@@ all@@ core .
30 % increase subscri@@ ptions by the phone stations , whereby the S@@ ver@@ a@@ val B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates a collection increase of about 5 % by 2025 .
increasing demand for electric cars means additional li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hi@@ den and por@@ c@@ tin demand .
G@@ len@@ bottom will gain electricity dependency on rising cop@@ hel sales and business as one of the world &apos;s largest co@@ bal@@ lers book , chair J@@ eff@@ anian Group .

the market responds to a changing trend .
this year , 70 percent of London &apos;s metals stock market line has exceeded this year .
price increases in the global market were 37 percent .
the answer tonight has also been 14 % , primarily as a result of economic growth .
in London the G@@ len@@ core shares rose by 20 % in order to exceeded the price h@@ ike to the ri@@ val Rio T@@ rest Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ oni and Ang@@ lo Juh@@ ani .
on the shoulders of the we@@ aring parties , lead business such as Rec@@ y@@ insu@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine are established as good as ne@@ oming , and have to adjust in the new era .
the main end of the P@@ li@@ at am is the pro@@ pel@@ ling of t@@ our cars with the petrol engine and diesel engines .
electrical cars use tte@@ re@@ mor@@ ta@@ electric gas@@ tro@@ ph@@ ric@@ s .
&quot; this is serious risk to lead claims unless it finds other goals to overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael W@@ id@@ mer , govern@@ or Director for actor F@@ ut@@ ter 112 .
the impact of the split milk quota was not yet seen in the form of this call .
P@@ li@@ c has reached 17 % this year , in London , with the greatest methane that was being produced among the major industrial metals .
investors will see problems with metals in the long run .
&quot; I am not sure that this is such a bad thing because cheap oil keeps traditional cars competition , &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the contract head who sold metal@@ lic roun@@ di@@ p@@ ine Tri@@ land Me@@ talia .
if lead is lost , this will be slow .
perhaps this will happen in about ten years &apos; time .
until now , however , stricter emissions standards mean a multipli@@ er demand for hybrid des@@ ks , which depend increasingly on advanced lead corridors in &apos; facilities , will assess international lead and reach an investigation body .
Al@@ to@@ metals such as alu@@ mini@@ um make replacement for steel , as a ligh@@ ter car can travel more with less power .
this explains a supplementary increase of 1.6 million tonnes until 2013 to 2016 which is referred to as outstanding minimum tariffs .
it accounts for 2.7 % of the world &apos;s gross domestic product .
that trend is likely to escal@@ ate , saying W@@ id@@ mer .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um has de@@ commissioned 13 % this year , as growing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market shortage .
the steel manufacturers do not go ahead .
he is also cooperating with General Motors , whereby he intends to use nanotechnology to produce e@@ uphe@@ aval@@ s for wonderful cars .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal , a@@ ided by S@@ rada Europe , is also seeking to develop a ration@@ alisation of a s@@ and@@ pe@@ y with a view to opposing a lower minimum .
&apos;@@ Bu@@ il@@ ding steel should be the answer to this evolution &apos; said Im@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris &apos;s analysis , Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
we can see some progress in Europe .
you can also end the oil era , but you should ex@@ termination it on a pla@@ len .
So@@ lu has taken about half of that precious metal@@ lic road diesel vehicle into hy@@ per@@ ic cars and reported Mr Mat@@ Poverty as a mer@@ cy mak@@ er .
&quot; many of the raw materials now requiring great demand , such as oil and the pla@@ te , will be attracted in future , &quot; presented recently by Ra@@ ti@@ x@@ an raw materials analysis Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h .
this does not mean that raw materials become less important overall , but their relevance will change within 15 years .
Pla@@ at@@ in@@ c manufacturers believe that continued demand for ag@@ on@@ ory subsidies is available .
Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , head of Un@@ core electricity , said that more hybrid cars are increasingly being sold in 2025 .
the great expectation of Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ at@@ at@@ at@@ at@@ in@@ ers on ten years shows that To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ creativity i Mo@@ ses have been developed on hydrogen @-@ based cars that rely on hydrogen floor in order to produce electricity .
however , existing technology has not lawfully proved itself yet to be commercial .
&quot; the Di@@ ale seems to be a clear losers on the way to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P in Paris from the Basque of Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers were found to have very serious set@@ backs in July , as the S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art Court prohibited diesel vine in the stipulated town in Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how rail freight finance rules influenced the move of Ney@@ ra to Paris
the rules intended to prevent the ram@@ pan@@ t spending of football clubs in the European Union are not preventing Ney@@ ra from entering the record number one destination road from Spain &apos;s football club in the French club Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ fundamental .
any consequences for UEFA , the governing body , which govern@@ ors Europe , and with the power to ban teams from taking part in the market in the pres@@ ti@@ gious League of Me@@ is@@ ts , not requiring the Paris start of Saint @-@ Ger@@ May .
the financial rules from the UEFA agreement in 2011 of fair play ( F@@ F@@ P ) mean that the PS@@ G must demonstrate in some ways that the migration of Ney@@ ra was not financed without huge damage .
by spending EUR 2@@ 22 million ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) on Barcelona , cli@@ mb @-@ gra@@ ce formula choice was the equivalent of Apple sales , and Ney@@ ra &apos;s wages are expected to reach tens of millions of dollars per year .
there are a few aspects to moving ath@@ le@@ et to the French club .
Janusz G will undoubtedly be able to re@@ surface this money to recru@@ ire Or@@ rin and have a signal degree of clo@@ ak for spending those funds in Mali &apos;s energy shortage .
clubs are allowed to spend all GH@@ G talent , but they need to balance this with legal sources of revenue that will allow them to come out of their borders under football .
Mr F@@ F@@ Í@@ P laid the basis for Mr Michel Pla@@ tini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
it did not get š checks and risk buying up , the former French player believed that clubs that will fall into serious debt while banks or owners should withdraw support .
since 2011 , the F@@ F@@ P is concentrating instead on monitoring their losses instead of gambling .
this change means that the cultural model which Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch used first of all in 2003 in C@@ hell , to buy a club with potential , and then to spend heavily to put the team better and emerge from the global trade mark , is harder to implement .
during the three @-@ year assessment period leading up to 2018 , F@@ F@@ F@@ P can suffered loss of up to EUR 30 million .
W@@ hile it was dismissed and dis@@ credi@@ ted by the presidential Office in 2015 , his successor Bernd C@@ ef@@ er@@ in is still committed to blocking over @-@ spending .
F@@ F@@ F@@ P will certainly not dead and we will inevitably have to continue to reinforce the rules again , &apos; Mo@@ st week said The Media , Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is UEFA &apos;s Chairman F@@ P .
although the provision of PS@@ G to Brazil was one full payment for the excessive buy @-@ up clause , they are enabled to distribute the amount for the purposes of accounting purposes to parts included in the whole agreement .
Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , so the transfer fee can be made available as a sum of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
in 2014 , on the first wave of To@@ tal sanctions , in conjunction with Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga ( Abu D@@ ha@@ bi ) , PS@@ G and E@@ mb@@ assy suffered the most severe penalties .
the personal penalty for 60 million - USD 82 billion - was fined on the PS@@ G at this time , later reduced to € 20@@ m , and the club called for the kno@@ ck @-@ down of units of the League of Me@@ is@@ tactics for 2011 @-@ 2015 to be restricted to 21 players instead of a normal 25 player .
UEFA is looking for clubs which can try to over@@ ride regulatory bodies by ex@@ posing its business pic@@ tures to managers .
while a &quot; tive &quot; company may spon@@ sorship the PS@@ G but credible online my@@ ri@@ ad value is identified as pat@@ ron@@ ous they would not allow UEFA to take this into account as formal incomes .
this is the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar Sz@@ chi &apos;s welfare Authority as well as certification for the PS@@ G was an ex@@ cus@@ tion value .
it has been said that a certain section from the Su@@ d@@ hist G20 service might come from Cor@@ t via the provisions of the participants to the Th@@ ree reference Board of World C@@ up in 20@@ 22 .
but 440 and Q@@ her 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ ra could become a global champi@@ on@@ ship and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulators could easily mis@@ match such a manoeuvre .
penalties previously imposed by the PS@@ G will mean that UEFA is even more vigilant on any attempts to by@@ pass the rules .
citizens familiar with the situation made it clear on Thursday that UEFA has not discussed the transition in a pro @-@ active manner with postal Lei@@ p@@ ent .
they were talking to The press on the condition that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed as they are not permitted to discuss the situation at a PS@@ G level .
latest reports show that in the € 54@@ 2.4 million of the coff@@ ee @-@ 2016 t@@ our , had over € 10 million in fixed profits in the SP@@ G service of 2015 @-@ 2016 .
the last financial year &apos;s figures have not yet been published .
it welcomes the successful arrival of Ney@@ ra in terms of spon@@ sorship operations , freight trading and s@@ nus .
moreover , the club appears to see a 1 % increase in turnover of at least 30 % as a result of the contract .
Spain , to take too late the one of the biggest champi@@ on@@ air@@ gra@@ des , sought to prevent it from spreading , arguing that the PS@@ G is a signatory to F@@ F@@ P .
&apos;@@ H@@ ot@@ bu@@ b , it is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; between club and state , &apos; said Chairman Klaus T@@ eb@@ as in the Spanish newspaper , AS , referring to the primary wh@@ im of the PS@@ G to the Ka@@ tari@@ as .
Ar@@ sen@@ al hill j@@ er Ar@@ inste@@ philos@@ op@@ ger , whose club belongs to the American sports ring@@ e municipal@@ ity , shares the view of La Eurocontrol that the state has been investing in a club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights when rever@@ sing property speeches and this has changed fully the whole football landscape in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; whenever the club belongs to a state , it is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play because the state might have other ways or other interests in order to represent such a large player in the country . &quot;

Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is invited to be announced that interest rates remain at the prior levels , because the in@@ tangible economy and rela@@ xation of inflation have cus@@ hi@@ on speculation as regards the increasing trend .
the Bank of England warned that growth will remain a dec@@ ree , as household incomes have brought interest rates to high .
the assets policy managers of the Bank &apos;s monetary policy panel ( MP@@ C ) have voted 6 : 2 with 0.@@ 25 % in favour and fewer members ju@@ mping this month , which is why slow growth has weakened support for growth .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank rose its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that pressure to household incomes would remain , since in autumn inflation would still shortly reach 3 % .
however , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in the rate for expenditure on credit in the first few years from Bre@@ x@@ it@@ ist inflation was necessary and that the expected increase in loan prices could be necessary in financial markets .
the Members of Parliament also voted for the partial withdrawal of this ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package , which must be launched as a result of Bre@@ x@@ one year ago .
it is just the default of its fixed @-@ term cash scheme in February , which offers banks cheap money , although it was said that it is now expected to have GBP 15 billion more in this scheme , namely GBP 115 billion higher .
in protocols to a decision of a rate , the Bank says : &quot; the average forecast of MP@@ C will remain the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , as the difficult situation of the actual household incomes will continue to affect consumption .
on the level , the amendment of inflation took place again , due to the need for &apos; c@@ rying up some of the &quot; fiscal policy &quot; which amounts to a somewhat higher &quot; amount than has been sought by markets .
the start of next year &apos;s first ½ August is predicted to have rise in the third quarter of 2017 and the second au@@ x@@ ili@@ ation in 2020 .
however , it highlighted the state of play that brea@@ thing would be gradual and limited .
the bank has reduced growth forecasts to 1.9 % and 1.7 % next year by comparison with the forecasts in May .
the forecast remains at 1.8 % in 2018 .
the post @-@ Lisbon flood dro@@ ps its w@@ aging course against the dollar and the euro .
women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.@@ 31 and 0.@@ 4 % to EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to undertake changes to the decision is triggered by the recent disappointing growth rates , which have raised the growing hopes of the 2.1 GDP rising , from 0.2 % to 0.@@ 3 % over the second quarter .
it says that growth is projected to stay at 0.@@ 3 % over the third quarter , although we start to take this incentive up a little by the end of the year .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report has given a few encouraging instances , saying that we had better before that improvement , of rising inflation and of pi@@ tiful pay valu@@ ing households .
there was a added sign that the monetary policy cannot prevent an explo@@ sive fall in income inside the next few years , but there is a clear fiscal return for the end of three years .
for the good GBP 1 , the recovery calls into the economy are also pushing for growing demand for British produce , which therefore partially goes to the lower costs of consumers .
this will be a year after the expenditure ratio was lifted by 0.@@ 25 % in August last year following the shocking EU referendum which triggered a sudden slu@@ mp in the p@@ ound .
it will probably take four years to ever get the price and the economy into their hoo@@ ts .
before the Bank &apos;s final ruling , inflation was felt growing demand , since inflation had increased pressure on households who were ro@@ cked ; in July , as three policy makers called for a faster rate of 0.5 % .
inflation was down 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the Bank stated it plan , and renewed growth in the coming months .
the bank said that there was a completely weak return of GBP 2 per cent for higher than a 2 @-@ mile target .
Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , Governor of Co@@ rec@@ o mortgage pa@@ ci@@ Sir , said : &apos; in the face of the recent downturn in trade rates , it seems that mortgage markets will become increasingly competitive again , since lending shows a high level of attra@@ ction and hopes of ending the year in a positive way .
the ERC will be particularly advantageous for those who are finding the transactions currently in place , because re@@ financing , often with no service or low fees , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS unve@@ ils it to 10 000 people who have been the cause of a flawed HIV condition
patients who have since September a access to trans@@ forma@@ tive treatment with HIV people following a bat@@ tle@@ fire in the Supreme Court with regard to whether the N@@ HS should fund the pharmaceuticals .
N@@ HS England announced that , during the initial three @-@ year clinical arrangement of public health , an estimated 10 000 people will be made available to pre @-@ contractual need@@ la@@ c@@ ad@@ c ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t called before sw@@ am@@ ped and proposed a volume of 86 % reduction in high risk .
the N@@ HS accepted the funding of a clinical attempt , following the support of the appeal court for the judgment last year , that the Supreme Court &apos;s ruling that N@@ HS is able to pay for Pr@@ EP , despite the agency &apos;s claims that it ought to be financed by local governments .
Mr Simon Ste@@ eve , Executive Director of N@@ HS Eng@@ land , welcomed the presentation which was made public on Thursday as &quot; 2nd extensive intervention &quot; while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it &quot; radical moment . &quot;
sex health clin@@ ics have been introduced in London , the B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ l and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d among the first to register the people - forth to a top of clin@@ ics , which will be combined by April 2018 with Ireland .
the syn@@ thesis in Pr@@ EP is a child pack of HIV drugs that occurs before the changing order in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
clinical trials show that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people with the risk of infection .
Pr@@ EP take the lead before taking the turn will mean that a human body has sufficient medicines to prevent HIV infections .
these substances are allowed to take place every day , or no later than two , before changing the rules .
young people of les@@ bian or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are HIV @-@ infected and do not receive treatment are among the candidates removed .
especially for people who are temp@@ ted to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those who , if they do not , receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment for those engaged in HIV as well as also suitable people .
people resident in England and appointed a family doctor in the club will also have the chance to register their willingness to take part in the local sex health clin@@ ics that participate in the programme .
this programme will cost GBP 10 million and N@@ HS England signed the contract to receive drugs this week after international procurement .
the clinical attempt aims to evaluate the true potential of Pr@@ EP , for more specialised clinical evidence on who is for th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic treatment and how it is industri@@ ally well invested in and enforced .
Ste@@ airs said , &apos; render the fight against the spread of drugs comprehensive and more successful .
this is yet another milestone in the fight for more than three decades to tackle one of the highest health challenges for mankind . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , Executive Director of NA@@ T , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV &apos; .
Pr@@ EP , when correctly targeted to those with which it is needed and subjected to risk levels , offers an opportunity for change of the HIV epidemic in England .
since September , He@@ at@@ ty @-@ HIV risks in England , through this clinical @-@ buil@@ d@@ g@@ ni@@ c clinical trial , have had access to powerful new tools of individual control , irrespective of partner negotiations ; hence enhancing many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &apos;
shops B@@ un@@ ch Man@@ aging Director of the Quartet Funds ade , ian Green , said , &quot; now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is dri@@ ed around the country and that no anti @-@ HIV risk group is left behind .
we are on the way to backing over 10 000 people who run the risk of HIV being infected with a clinical trial in Pr@@ EP .
the Secretary of Public Health , Mrs Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , said that &apos; The beginning of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is a welcome and very late after months of delay and eliminated government clients .
evidence indicates the enormous changes that can lead to these treatments in preventive work for HIV and to the disappe@@ aring infection .
this clinical attempt sa@@ ves us a step closer , therefore , to full understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is paramount that this clinical trial is stopped as quickly as possible in order to protect people who have contacts on HIV and to make us even a step further to halting HIV transmission within society . &quot;
electricity prices went up by 12 % in Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania .
the difference between the payment size between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania to EUR 1.@@ 94 , as compared with EUR 7.@@ 71 in June this year , was reported by Ele@@ ring .
the main reason for the difference is that of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
the average electricity savings received in Estonia last month were EUR 34.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ dy hour and 50 % by the price came up to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five percentage points to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 compared to a it@@ iner@@ ant hour .
there was a price of € 34.@@ 17 in Finland and the Netherlands would be around € 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ kia the price .
prices rose by 12 % and 7 % respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , the electricity was mobile to 75 % in the previous month to Estonia and 16 % of the hours from Estonia to Finland .
there were no subsequent transactions by 9 % of the last two distinct days .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity was made available at 99 % of Estonia &apos;s average from Latvia and 73 % had the full transmission capacity .
specifically , the EU@@ da@@ q OM@@ X market has traded in July , the sales market in August can form the extra bills for the storage of approximately EUR 34 and € 37 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ va@@ ge hour .
last month the carbon price affecting the price of electricity generation came up , withdrawal at EUR 5.@@ 04 @-@ 5.@@ 47 per tonne .

this indicates that a good design and an expanded area of land benefit from something aston@@ ishing from a rather normal cor@@ di@@ al process .

the truth is that film is well constructed ; every element that is needed .
the c@@ ool , the accompanying plas@@ ters all know : &apos; beef is not the most important for life &apos; .
this film combines it well .
the new man@@ power H@@ eb@@ b intends to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others are trying and failing .
perhaps John F@@ . Kelly will be able to do this in real terms .
that said , it would be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new post of staff from the White house is planning to limit President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in &apos;s data flow , including news , in the hope that it will hold over @-@ balance .
so there would be a pla@@ gue report from Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ via :
&quot; when John F@@ . Kelly met with high officials when he meet the white house on his first day of office , he raised a key problem , President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ ges Ma@@ in , which he intends to solve with m appears to be bad information sharing in the hands of President Obama .
Mr Kelly told officials that you need to look at the communication via him , be you on paper or under meetings , because the President would take better decisions if he is well informed . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems to be utterly logical , but others have tried to do that too and have failed to tame T@@ ru@@ mp@@ et by re@@ tra@@ cting its media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ I &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades , and even since he is in White Ma@@ in , his TV viewing habits are nowhere .
&quot; for when a candidate &apos;s T@@ ru@@ mp was upset for the integrity of media , she had the impression that his display , which affected him , was also very frank on his li@@ ps , after having first campaig@@ ner S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg said Poli@@ ti@@ tz in February .
politician riding Lar@@ mer wrote at the time that , according to a six @-@ year campaig@@ ner , T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter is to play a role in controlling ter @-@ habits if it makes sure of its own consumption of media , in a stable way , includes the pra@@ is@@ al .
good , the point .
but the concept that T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter &apos;s habits have ever &apos; been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
maybe those campaig@@ ners know something what rest of us do not know that the cancelled So@@ il T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i re@@ hear@@ ten@@ ts would have been more heated unless they had their interventions .
we will obviously never find out about the wa@@ ut@@ tling that the T@@ ru@@ ken did not post .
if his hel@@ ple@@ ss was able to save sta@@ bles a few times how many of them wanted them to have their tro@@ p@@ backs worth doing .
nobody , however , has been able to prevent the L@@ ho@@ mp@@ ire from constantly leading to controversy .
some of the issues are that , in the White Ma@@ at , which includes competing players , people are trying to pursue their own interests with complete action , broadcast to the T@@ ru@@ charter material that supports their views in the world .
the entire n@@ om@@ ni@@ ture of the design policy , in May , was written by advis@@ ers themselves regarding their sensi@@ ti@@ vities to farm President opinion la@@ con@@ n with potentially questionable information .
one example , which is illustrated by the report , Mr Gold@@ ma@@ cher , is as follows :
&quot; the current , former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i sub@@ jec@@ tains , say that T@@ ru@@ ker can respond to negative media , particularly harmful impact inf@@ mid , rob@@ bing their source .
this was what happened in late February when someone interpre@@ ts with satisfaction the copy of a pu@@ p@@ pet to the President of speech with Charles C. In the We@@ b Radio Joh@@ n@@ son web page , G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com , which accused O@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i of being the chief officer , of being a white home called many for@@ en@@ si@@ rent information equipment .
it goes without saying that Joh@@ n@@ son is permanently blocking Twitter or that he did not give any specific evidence or have fi@@ led and withdrawn false accusations in the past too .
the T@@ ru@@ mp read the article and began to ask the subordin@@ ate Wal@@ sh@@ ess . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that , at that time , rewards a personnel chief who had sta@@ yed in Re@@ ince Fo@@ eb@@ us and head of legitimate White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , an attempt has been made to set up a system for managing and docu@@ menting designs that get through T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
what did that succeed ?
Mr Kelly is attempting to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove the second leader stronger than he had made , however T@@ ru@@ ire is still a momentum and his aid is still effective .

the Central Bank will buy bonds in the market to encourage investors who have bought bonds to invest their money else .
purchases are being played by lower @-@ risk assets , and they will motivate investors to take risks more .
moreover , under the Public Pri@@ vate bond Service , every central bank v@@ ets its government debt and the debts of other countries will not be purchased .
as Estonia &apos;s government has not issued its bonds , Estonia is making a &apos; replacement &apos; purchase within the scale it has allocated to them .
the central banks are also making exchange purchases in countries in which the bid for bond with the purchase scheme is limited .
Denmark &apos;s bank basically bu@@ ys the bonds of the European institutions such as the European Financial Stability Fund and a bank bonds by the European Investment Bank , while National Authority , approved by H@@ ans@@ son .
the Estonian bank purchasing bond from the assets O@@ suspect was in place since March 2015 .
meanwhile , Ele@@ mp@@ book bonds were also acquired , but by June 2016 the Estonian bank was no longer purchased in Ele@@ t@@ ching bonds .
to quote the energy bonds in the euro area in Finland between June and June are purchasing the Brussels Central Bank for all the banks in the euro area .
bottlenecks disregard degrees and return to a &quot; millions of business walls &quot;
some of the West Mid@@ lands &apos;s wealthy owners have re@@ sided into sea with determined migration , which has ignored the sp@@ ir@@ alling profes@@ sors of the councils to win back their walls .
the cars have used their 20 tra@@ ilers to the c@@ end of a wealthy &apos; millions of business set &apos; distance crus@@ hed near the streets of So@@ hat@@ ul@@ li .
they have returned together with the army of hor@@ ses , children and lorries , after they were still shot out of it in May , without throwing themselves on by ham@@ mer their cra@@ f@@ s , bel@@ ted to block their intervention by the Council .
the group found itself weak , accounting for a labour part that was left empty for the shel@@ l of its vehicles .
tackle hit people are disappe@@ aring to So@@ meat Spain council , saying that the council is &apos; useless in addressing the problem &apos; .
a anon@@ ymous bir@@ d said : &apos; they sent home on Monday evening after being expelled from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ a , who humi@@ lia@@ ted the fur@@ ni@@ ths they were reading , was delivered .
the Council must embarras@@ sed for not doing so because they are involved .
there were migrants there in May ; they were there and they were arrested and now they were back now .
they came more yesterday evening , more likely than yesterday . &quot;
she added , &apos; Burma min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with these things through several long barriers with property to protect her par@@ ks .

a local resident who also wanted to breach anon@@ ymous also said : &apos; it is lu@@ dic@@ rous ; we have just seen the last cuts to these flows open and there is already a new offensive .
this time an increase is overwhelming and even one large in the gras@@ s state myself has been set in ru@@ m . &quot;

it is very helpful to collect evidence if as many local residents as possible get certain of any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour on the police waiting im@@ plying the number 101 .
this helps to give a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them . &quot;

Galileo launches up to 850 000 diesel vehicles after the criticism for car manufacturers in the car industry
fellow Members , the presentation by consumers of the Au@@ di made B@@ M@@ W the point that software applications offer more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the B@@ M@@ W Chairman said that he &apos; believes there are smarter a@@ venues than to be limited &apos; , indicating to European cities , including the B@@ M@@ W house , Munich , which has considered a ban or a restriction on diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes equivalent vehicles were upgra@@ ded to reduce emissions of diesel engines in Europe .
no company described these abuses as Re@@ ple@@ as .
European car manufacturers have given vigorous promotion to diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States for complying with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide , which is shifted off diesel engines , is considered a carcino@@ gen that could lead to as@@ th@@ ma .
it will also increase the cost of equipment installed for neutr@@ alising emissions from diesel vehicles for the directive and create greater competition for car oil .
while German car manufacturers are in serious investigation , Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of di@@ tering interested car manufacturers or ignoring the signs of a problem .
companies will attempt to avoid them repetition of the misleading Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen who narro@@ wed under &apos; pe@@ ts &apos; that tried to adapt emission ga@@ g mir@@ rors to regulations when car car tests were tested , but came back in normal driving conditions .
several of the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen conduct has been charged to some V@@ HS &apos;s govern@@ ors in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
former Head of unit of the Ber@@ di engine Development unit did last month .
former President Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o , is an Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and a trial could be brought to the US .
the Au@@ di car was brought to a criminal investigation in Germany earlier this year when the authorities were accused by the media of instal@@ ling the Audit System to circum@@ vent the requirements for the European emission reduction rate , thus extending the investigation which had been focused on the United States in advance .
involving the author in research may be an enormous blow to Mr tz@@ Thessaloniki by a manufacturer of luxury cars , disproportionately generating the profits of a large portion of Vol@@ ks@@ w@@ agen@@ t .
Internet Schools are expected to have 20 000 euro of EU flags .

flags are on display in in@@ door rooms , by bringing them to bear on @-@ board tru@@ ck , as well as by magaz@@ ine in high quality print press ta@@ g or by quot@@ ing this information via the ER@@ R .
an early ir will set out the text : &apos; Kin@@ gi@@ tus to Estonian schools for profes@@ sing the first President of the Council of Estonia .

murder of journalist underlines growing risks in Mexico
N@@ weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce ho@@ use workers often collect on Wednesday in order to review plans for the most recent chaos in the State of Blue permit , which is so@@ wed by organised crime , corrupt officials , and ce@@ ased drug war .
yet today , they gathered amid my personal tragedy , to discuss their own safety .
these admit it is important for them to change its ru@@ ins .
two home authors will discuss which seems safer : either to put children in a office that was the target of the gran@@ ch@@ vote in 2009 or to leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the desire of someone at the head of the space : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask the repor@@ ters to provide twice so many words in each girl as you do not need proof , you must have impres@@ sions and in@@ ner feelings .
smoking by government or car@@ tels is suspected to be drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists alike from the visited So@@ sh who crimin@@ alise the destruction that exists in Mexico .
violence is not a delicate blow and the more people made redundant across the country , most of which are journalists aged Roure according to the work of the Committee on the Protection of journalists , started with harassment of President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena alis in at least 25 . 5@@ 89 journalists at least since the attacks and threats have been arrested in the seven states in December 2012 .
the latest loss of life involves the edit@@ or and source of inspiration of the pu@@ p@@ pet , who were well established by Mr Laur@@ o@@ do@@ ce , and Mr Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest error is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote one of his many messages dealing with drug abuse .
his absence accurately felt , even though his presence may ac@@ tion@@ alise everywhere in the theat@@ re of Cathy Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s building gi@@ fts kill a la@@ den picture of the hi@@ red Val@@ de@@ z@@ est , together with the formula of &apos; justice &apos; and two of her 30@@ n@@ dimensional repor@@ ters , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , with T s@@ hi@@ ts or clu@@ m@@ sy face @-@ like cel@@ os@@ tas@@ ins .
the meeting takes place less than two months after her death and the protests are discussed jointly by master victims , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , the de@@ Faroe om@@ ic@@ us , the recti@@ van@@ ia .
in 2010 , although the national prosecution Office was set up to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been brought to justice by the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime @-@ related murders , with a figure of thousands , they sel@@ dom reach justice .
the state of preferences continues to reflect violence in Y@@ our own country , even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now substantially more dangerous .
without the presentation of the identity and fairness of murde@@ rers , the meeting on security has nothing to do with Mr I@@ bar@@ ra .
&apos;@@ It &apos;s very nice for manoeuvre to waste their time here at a meeting &apos; .
&quot; as long as this is not known the reason , Members will not have all confidence . &quot;
Val@@ dez left the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce to the capital of the State in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an on 15 May .
he managed to travel only a couple or two remin@@ ders before two men suspending the red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ ku@@ la and pushed the car to re@@ surface , so she was presu@@ med to be shot 12 times on journ@@ ally , meaning &apos; twelve @-@ day rivers &apos; .
a comm@@ ands man was travelling down in the Val@@ dez car and he did organise a cras@@ h in the be@@ side there .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she was leave the woman , and two adult children .
hearing ran@@ ges freely spreading in Cu@@ li@@ on@@ ania .
but on Val@@ dez , fundamentally , there is s@@ kin@@ ned de@@ pic@@ tion .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man in the past year and the extradition of the United States during January , Y@@ V@@ O@@ A was one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country as ri@@ val@@ lers fight for filling the power vacuum .
it makes no mistake that on the streets of your aller@@ orientation , some people or , even , several ha@@ ils every day or that dead are sli@@ pping from cy@@ n@@ ically ble@@ red rub@@ b@@ ish of bi@@ b@@ os@@ s supplied by qu@@ asi @-@ li@@ on@@ ones , higher than many homes .
let us forget that the moment of peace indicates how merely a car@@ tel stands for an il@@ legitimate port territory and of drugs routes travelling to the United States .
for all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of proper work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce is suffering great distress from the co @-@ foun@@ der and President Michel Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , who had failed to safeguard her friend .
he believes that the slaughter was mis@@ guided by two errors .
first of these started by publishing an interview with the Gu@@ z@@ man sons on the Ar@@ ch@@ General of the Kar@@ tel@@ op@@ hal@@ co following war .
these pieces of correspon@@ dence may have been in@@ duc@@ ed , as many as the islands claiming worse lum were , by all fi@@ as@@ als of the publications as soon as they came into front of da@@ iries .
another error was that Val@@ dec@@ zi , moreover , has not been forced to leave the country for his own security , after the ro@@ ckets took place in another newspaper recorded with the same respect .
Val@@ dez was leg@@ alised in both Mexico and abroad and his killings can be seen as a turning point for violent attacks by journalists in Mexico .
she had still been alive for so long that her friends and colleagues had expected him to exist permanently .
as veterinary repor@@ ters , he voted in a newspaper in No@@ ro@@ cket in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to create M@@ edge Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , sold 50 @-@ dollars of shares .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said : &apos; It was impossible to deal with the press without facing the drugs problem &apos; in your Blue al@@ o@@ a .
the newspaper la@@ gs away from their felt content of courageous or honest circu@@ its and sales and advertising .
scre@@ ens had the pleasure of issuing vigorous research without fear of censorship and le@@ ctures in the printing , which they could read stories that no one else da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after the launch of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspaper won a pres@@ ti@@ gious award of Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ oti for his exhibition in Latin America .
the Committee for the Protection of Opel &apos;s journalists ( AK@@ K ) won an international journalist &apos;s intention in the same year to follow Mexic@@ an drug crea@@ ture all about where it leads to .
he declared quite openly that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said : &apos; whereas she adopted the AK@@ K Prize .
last October , she brought to the TV channel Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to television in an interview saying that drug trafficking is the way to life delivered in Y@@ O@@ my .
&apos;@@ S@@ p@@ inging voices onto the task of hosting a journalist service like Syria is the second chance to play sh@@ ou@@ ld@@ n &apos;s hands &apos; .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not say what is going on . &quot;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ lo@@ gue w@@ ins someone who has a j@@ uni@@ or of Val@@ dec@@ eri , a fun@@ ny who swe@@ pt like a little like the mad@@ one and fed many amounts of education and advice , to a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave its support to her stu@@ pid .
it always we@@ aring its sa@@ ga .
he went across the office into El Piecy@@ y@@ ab@@ o &apos;s bar and always sat on the same des@@ k .
now they ask whether his rou@@ tine love became ex@@ cus@@ able to his .
his death has also cast them in doubt about how best to conduct their work and keep alive .
&quot; they do not like them being ro@@ cked with their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing cards using drugs to transport . &quot;
&apos;@@ This now should not be the case , &apos; says Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
in even the best possible times , it does take the form of strong self @-@ censorship and sel@@ fish@@ ness .

the pig@@ meat is continuously changing .
in a space in which the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers gathered together for security training , mobile phone numbers were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days earlier after that , it was revealed that only the pu@@ p@@ pi@@ le belt sold to governments was used to trace journalists and activists in Mexico .
in front of the House , two poli@@ ce@@ men wanted to Bloom up her wood , pushing for a rela@@ xation of 40 cra@@ cks .
the government assigned them to the Office of Re@@ elected Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co@@ ar@@ work in a four @-@ order building at the centre of the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos; class established by the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
respondents in some of them had previously been more than re@@ jo@@ ke as to whether these police officers were members of the 50 % of the police ministers cut off by the Governor itself .
several years after the report has travelled to mountainous rural areas where controls are de facto in excess of drug gan@@ gs .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edition of this week addressed three main details .
one of them was the murde@@ rer of ex @-@ po@@ philos@@ op@@ uniform Ju@@ li@@ o Hau@@ ar Cha@@ vez bro@@ na in H@@ era@@ Kla@@ r .
they also recorded a blatant case of spending government funds on the town of the head@@ bel@@ o@@ qu@@ er .
people had been shot by a group which was spo@@ iled into one of those most expensive restaur@@ ants between the ill and Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
there was no formal announcement of who was abduc@@ ted or which happened , so caution came when it came to write what everyone knows in the Lisbon restaur@@ ant point in the city , as well as in those of the public authorities .
Re@@ por@@ ter was given public documents stating that the restaur@@ ant has registered a policy as one of the more dominated Institutions special to the Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which prevailed all political proportions almost over the past century .
in recent times several IR@@ P suspended charges for widespread reporting of court cases against corruption .

Val@@ dez repeatedly stated that Mexic@@ an journalists had been &apos; blocked for organised crime , &apos; co @-@ responsible &apos; public administrations and indifferent society .
in her last book entitled &apos; Child freedom &apos; he wrote that pan@@ lists are not only killing drug gan@@ gs but they are also subjected to orders by politicians and security forces that have shot up organised crime .

they found objec@@ tivity : protection policy across animals , which meant that the training beyond status was paramount as a lower replacement .

that suggests that O@@ ur @-@ Environment exposure senti@@ ment unions were sufficiently sti@@ r@@ red by other lay@@ off@@ s . that this ev@@ olu@@ tionary practice was preferred to be a cur@@ ley instead of confrontation .

how did a activist find the answer to the question of &apos; whose thanks &apos; ?
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll became an exact shock .
only one day after Mr Ty@@ beria &apos;s trip to New York , he was driven by GBP 2.5 by a tourist for an explosion in the broken do@@ zen so@@ s on his flight Facebook .
he exceeded his former school teacher &apos;s mail .
it said , &apos; The police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old youth , mis@@ represented an expert who is still on the streets &apos; .
she was confused to why nobody else had involved transferring information from his provided a break and made him stop at Facebook and set the way to Twitter .
. the old subscri@@ ptions were repeatedly delivered back throughout his time line .
Mr St@@ . In@@ pa@@ p@@ unified Sa@@ tes from the Cata@@ lan region sent a real @-@ time freeze to Michael Brown , the death , a young man who had been killed by a white police officer in Fer@@ gus@@ on Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is , an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old traditional army .
he put a picture of the memory of the Guinea life of the poor which was born in the streets , leaving him four hours .
&apos;@@ Conver@@ sely , &apos; Mrs Ferreira ju@@ mped up the h@@ aste .
but 1 death was neither new for him nor for his community .
she pushed his phone up , but later this evening he looked back . he said that people were asse@@ mbling in Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
the Mes@@ tos were &apos;état from the police and the frigh@@ tening people and a man who claimed himself to be a father of Brown and who gave a bitter copy of &apos; Nig@@ erian police killed my un@@ armed son ! &apos;
she has viewed the real stream of valid police officers and the officers face a family of protest .
another police officer , he said : &apos; I kill all ... animals &apos; was s@@ lee@@ ping and pota@@ to : &apos; I kill you all &apos; .
Fer@@ rell is reminding of how it was caught for thought : &apos; it is unusual &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is not a murder of the sort with which we are used and which we could describe as typical &apos; .
that is a time when I felt terri@@ fied .
I was temp@@ ted and we was cit@@ r@@ red &apos; .
she book a back flight and put a return home later on the following day .
having sta@@ mped up 23 : she went back to his six @-@ year da@@ u@@ ghter and decided to travel to commercial Fer@@ gus@@ on next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ gus@@ ga is the key item with a new docu@@ mentary written &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; .
this is a story of survival and protest , affec@@ tion and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in this community , who came to pass on in a thanking way for answers .
when Vi@@ EPSCO , with a bo@@ ge@@ y@@ ro@@ gate pu@@ r@@ m - caught up in a b@@ read@@ alist s@@ kir@@ ts - dro@@ iled in the Fer@@ gus@@ on to the Fer@@ ral l , they once again discussed a topic about which had had had come all the time before this morning before it - problems with mus@@ ical experience and living conditions .
&apos;@@ Is@@ n preferences if I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights &apos; , will it stay in my mind flo@@ ck@@ ery ?
&quot; we continue to fight Fer@@ gus@@ oni today because then it was the police who killed 18 year @-@ old boys and that is not right . &quot;
&apos;@@ I could not take it on , &apos; said So@@ ll later .
&quot; what is happening today is another cul@@ mination that was done in the past .
it needs to well know that and see it grow , and it has to grow among it .
this must learn about the poli@@ ce@@ man and organisation , and at the same time also know the various la@@ yers of experience and living conditions suffered by Muslim producers , and what we need to do in order to get rid and free ourselves .
even though I manage to promote her by not pati@@ ently eating a courageous kind of racism in person , he or she does not distinguish some other direct girls .
I feel I would be doing him a dis@@ service if I would defend him from this world . &quot;
the first stop that they did in the vic@@ inity of Fer@@ gus@@ on was on the side of South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ ti - the Supreme Police Service in the lan@@ king place , which had obtained a sort of camp pos@@ ter providing activists with news of dy@@ son , the police officer , not finally charged the charge .
in that there , Mr Ferreira and his da@@ u@@ ghter joined local business owners in preparing lunch tables .
they put together the food a@@ ils and helped they share them to protest .
Fer@@ rell started slowly to take form a new type of activist .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; his / he said with the pointing out that when he was a student at a Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ tis University he was a head of the lowest student student Association and concentrated on food equity and health inequalities in experienced local educational societies .
&quot; I did not have any enter@@ tainment experience .
it was just blo@@ ss@@ ness . &quot;
at the subsequent days of the Coun@@ ty Mon@@ hi@@ on , in Dru@@ ll &apos;s demonstrations of Ferreira met the city &apos;s co @-@ director Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ y@@ pe .
Mr Fo@@ lay@@ an said he and the film operator , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , wanted to document what is happening .
to the Lo@@ ise of Fer@@ rell , the question came : &apos; were you trying to papers and find a case that can be ha@@ un@@ ks ? &apos;
such scepticism was caused by countless incidents where there are people - often white lawyers - in community , trying to benefit from its resolve and per@@ sever@@ ance .
Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview said , &apos; We had heard that the votes of people born and increasing in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard and that we wanted to do that differently &apos; .
Fo@@ lay@@ an had already mas@@ ked her hand with a fellow friend , D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ ati , an artificial in the region , who was known as activists for prisoners arrested on death row .
his inclusion lend itself to the largest Fer@@ rel@@ li project , adding another six schools to watching the team W@@ ho@@ se street .
&quot; nobody here in this docu@@ mentary speaks for us or with us , but he lis@@ tens to us for our own text . &quot; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; it was important to me for these people to be portra@@ yed , so that is me . &quot;
although the objective was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rell - it was wanted to indicate that &apos; the movement is not a &apos; point on tru@@ mp but a community in bringing together &apos; , as outlined previously by Fo@@ lay@@ an - he made the most open section .
as a result , &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ets ? &apos; is Pas@@ cu@@ rious enough about personal aspects , as a result , of the life of Fer@@ rel@@ li , such as the s@@ tun@@ ning and mar@@ ried with her wife .
&apos;@@ I felt ded to be intellectual ; &apos; Stockholm said , bur@@ hing at the first time in which she saw the lab@@ ori@@ an satellite works .
&quot; but I realised that some vulnerability would have to be provided if this work were to be done and mus@@ ici@@ ans .
moreover , the Go@@ ari affair highlights and puts centre again the role of the black L@@ GB@@ T woman in large Black Sea Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
the three Danube signatories who proposed the hom@@ ophobia following the killing of T@@ ex@@ doing , Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , was described in 2012 in the social media following the assassination of the da@@ u@@ ty teen@@ age , are # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter .
&quot; senior sexual women have kept movement overall , &quot; said Ferreira , this is precisely because we must fight on numerous fronts .
Roma women must bear the burden of all . &quot;
Fo@@ lay@@ an has agreed , stating that &quot; progress is indeed served by the Muslim women and many of them black homosexu@@ als . &quot;
he says , however , that &apos; it is not a kind of equ@@ alisation that counts &apos; - Fer@@ rell has not been chosen as the ke@@ y@@ some of the film &apos;s identity .
&quot; he was the person he was gather tremendous energy from . &quot;
&quot; they are not a coincidence that they were directly pin@@ ned at the r@@ hy@@ th@@ read because it is at an important s@@ pr@@ inc@@ line when you come to living like such mark@@ ings .
his energy is going to be felt a scre@@ ens . &quot;
however , early summer Fer@@ gus@@ on has left the news camer@@ as , but racial links between communities and police remain fragile .
a conditional sentence for blocking road road to Fer@@ ber during the indig@@ esti@@ mation has taken sick .
he describes the social policy environment in the region he calls home in simply an enormous freedom threat .
nonetheless , it still considers the man@@ tra which it has da@@ m@@ ned the memory since it took to the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ oni a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our liberty .
it is our responsibility to win .
we must love and support each other .
we need nothing but our chains . &quot;

the C@@ oo@@ k Coun@@ ty official documents reported on Monday that , in order to arrest fraud@@ sters totalling 42 to year old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ Shar@@ if@@ i and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i were accused of execution for their alleged atta@@ chment to First stage murder of T@@ ren@@ ton H.

according to a warning made available by the Mun@@ ici@@ pality of Ch@@ ic@@ ago to the community , the tolerated death row on 27 July .
the police officers had telephone bombs at the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house , who was brought to the victims of multiple tor@@ tery plans .
according to the public investigation , Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ tou was the subject dead , and the researchers consider abduc@@ tion as a murder , while the police are actively trying to seek two suspi@@ ci@@ ons .

firms which - if it is the next D@@ eb@@ it - would avoid costing your business
As@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt aimed to measure workers &apos; satisfaction in his time for e @-@ commerce ( EC@@ TA ) start @-@ ups , but the polls were un@@ helpful .
the responses were often vague , useless or even worse , misleading .
and even if he not made one &apos;s promises to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some employers did not trust this process .
this system was simply inconsistent as and objective : Er@@ re@@ tt , who govern@@ s the Ba@@ ison Re@@ ed company from Trans@@ lator 68 , who sold e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees .
that is why he would call on the outside to help .
first @-@ hand start @-@ ups with new types of human resources are right now in sight , helping businesses to sell out what their workers feel .
in developing and licen@@ sing at best , software dedicated to measuring worker involvement will enable companies to make cu@@ bic surveys , target certain groups and demographic groups , offer anon@@ ymous employees and complaint hot@@ lines and , in some cases , allow artists to travel completely from bottom @-@ up at the level C and come directly to the Bureau .
&apos;@@ We now have tools like strategic or F@@ it@@ square , which help to trace health but in often 15 of your company &apos; , who requested Mr Bar@@ net@@ t , the co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O , Mrs Reding City at the start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ sts use them to measure professional inclusion .
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , he has gained much better picture of what he thinks and knows about in the three years he has spent the G@@ lin@@ ti .
in addition to the in@@ vention efforts and report to specific teams , this presents the scheme of company heating which provides an overview of where departments share the biggest complaints and which leaders have the lowest possible support , thus enabling them to identify the causes .
companies have started to understand that they must make up for their cultural culture and do not become international , in order , to change their home newly ob@@ structive scandals since former workers issued blo@@ g posts describing an ab@@ rupt environment where those who da@@ red to speak were subjected to .
for start @-@ up firms like G@@ lin@@ t , knowing what expectation is to have an overview is a win @-@ win business .

that offers also an anon@@ ymous put @-@ all across when people are talking about having in@@ appropriately pursued behaviour .
and when it is taken into account , complaints go directly to the Bureau &apos;s management .
&quot; public opinion has an@@ ima@@ ted regulators , &quot; committed profiling and the executive director of Solvency cen@@ ti , Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that if one found that a firm does poorly treat itself or act une@@ th@@ ical , the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycot@@ ts , dis@@ qualification and prosecution , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by Refugees , restaur@@ ant clothing , which has more than 25 000 people in 500 places of action , has used ops over one year , to ensure employees &apos; awareness of the rules and procedures , and to give easy public relations with company headquarters .
when a worker wanted to notify the problem previously , he had to make a phone telephone number or an email address at the corporate headquarters , he had to provide a formal complaint and hope that this would be taken seriously .
this process was often inf@@ amous and in@@ convenient , said James Vit@@ ran@@ o , Coun@@ sell@@ or , who mentioned the absence of a good way of supervising workers &apos; complaints .
however , subject to deployment by ETS , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices that did not have opened up to management by a company cope more quickly in other sub@@ divisions or States .
&quot; I can get away from the holistic 3@@ 60 degree of employee experience , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , which chairs Ru@@ by Yemen the risk management group .
&quot; and we &apos;@@ ll protect our shareholders from legal disputes with their workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan mentioned that businesses embarked on ethical conduct , values and workers &apos; involvement becoming a much more serious reflection in 2002 , after an audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Andersson collapsed because of ethical violations of the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when social media became mature did businesses understand they could not stop their f@@ all@@ ying at web @-@ day public h@@ aste avoidance .
sooner it uses tech for ethical behaviour , it was people who lived up to hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Monte@@ cket offer their software as a service , to allow companies perio@@ dic payment for the consumption of their products .
this is a business model and a possibility that has accepted hedge fund investors who have contributed to both start ups .
in February Networks , companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and the University of Customs , financed a USD 10 million worth of capital these , thus adding 4@@ 7 million to the value of capital collected .
the G@@ lin@@ ti invested USD 10 million in November from the B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , increasing its total funding to USD 60 million .
such investments come as no surprise if , given the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ tedness between companies , cultures and venture capital .
an increasing number of studies indicates that present @-@ day workers are waiting for more jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley high wages and interesting projects are merely about the ban@@ ners .
the workers want to feel that they accept and are valued , and that they are p@@ ouring their time for a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to see them listening , and if the jobs they do are satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en said who is a woman of general benefits and staff experience Vice President L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ Assad , in both pact cen@@ sor and G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors are making profits if their j@@ ob@@ seekers do well , and companies are well done when the workers are committed and involved .
if the analysis tools of the third part allow work to be increased in terms of workers &apos; commitment and inclusion , we will not believe that they will be supported .
data about workers &apos; involvement is important , according to experts on working culture .
but those figures will be diver@@ ted if the company &apos;s supervisors do not turn out to them .
it is a matter of really asking the company for input from its staff that there are expectations that change will be forthcoming .
furthermore , if the changes are not acted quickly or in general quickly , this may create disappointment and decrease civil participation for workers .
&quot; if you ask 4 000 proposals , you need to be ready for 4 000 hearings , the President of the consul@@ tant International Corpor@@ ation , K@@ ot@@ ter , Paris , commented , Mr Ra@@ ath , who has seen companies make a mistake when they are reporting too much data .
&quot; because if things do not stop , the workers are wondering : did you actually listen to me ?
do you like ?
and if you do not care , why do I care ? . &quot;
according to an Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Mad@@ ison Rhine - which now ar@@ ins six surveys among workers - has been able to re @-@ implement measures day after it is reported via G@@ ER .
finally , after receiving feedback from compromised workers on the pace of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , he had the facility to re@@ organise several team teams in the company and to provide communication training to deal with problems .
Ar@@ by Roure , however , new data on workers will be collected and , in the long term , it is expected to entail longer @-@ term commitment of workers within industry known for its huge turnover of labour .
&quot; if you cannot be committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &apos; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&quot; if you lose people , you will lose businesses .
and if you lose customers , you losses run out of business &quot;
euro area ben@@ ching glass : high income growing fast
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic economy , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching their income in the rich countries of Western Europe , B@@ beef is signing the report from the European Central Bank , with reference to the report .
total economic output per person has exceeded expectations in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania since 1999 according to the Central Bank .
the level of debt from the good is low , the institutions that are accelerating the process , and business @-@ market @-@ friendly policy .
&quot; in one of Slovakia , the Baltic States are amongst the limited States of the euro area where , taken forward by state @-@ of @-@ GDP per capita , the Central Bank has largely swit@@ ched to the EU average . &quot;
while the objective is for overall output per capita equivalent to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 the aggre@@ gate output of the Baltic economies per capita amounted to just 2 / 3 @-@ 15 countries that included the European Union before the 2007 enlargements .
low wages have led the bal@@ ls to look for a better pay abroad .
although the European Central Bank is seeing Baltic in the positive light of the developments , and also economic growth this year , local citizens are not enthusiastic enough .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of inhabitants in Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies had a very good or rather a good record at most .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , this did take a slightly lower rate of than half the respondents are calling their own economies .

Four@@ teen times a decision to put off cost @-@ side trends there have actually been a larger amount of vacuum , at least until the end of the day - to reach one side , which is to ease the burden of players &apos; influence on cars .
for this reason , the low lifes@@ a@@ sion from U@@ C@@ L@@ A was prompted first to start at 19.@@ 15 in order to match the players of a ranking of times .

&apos;@@ The@@ y and bar@@ king through this challenge , they are struggling , they are nice young people . &apos;
I believe that , when the Saturday comes and we have more time , it really comes a little bit . &quot;
once the camp is over , U@@ C@@ L@@ A actions will be closed down , though by no means an easy task in view of a clear vision of par@@ king me@@ tal and by@@ passing the A@@ us@@ kin@@ i Centre going close to its fields , a higher @-@ class ho@@ p that has already got to s@@ pass p@@ it security across the lo@@ cks network with football pat@@ ch .

&apos;@@ keep to the law of the security measures &apos; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real cause for concern , which is not under @-@ excessive illusion that people should somehow come down to their tre@@ asures and their t@@ our from abroad .
if you have a store of the train , you can do a good deal about it .
but we will then use a security team at that and there , on this point , in the 8@@ th par@@ king .

Washington amends rules on the green map
media publications quote President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who says there is a plan for a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan provides for a 50 000 @-@ year reduction in the number of legal immigrants , more stringent rules on temporary employment visas and restrictions on respect for family @-@ orien@@ tated visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the re@@ public@@ ans , or have the President supported them .
it goes to the two Athens cha@@ mbers to the Congress .
the law restric@@ ts poverty , increases salaries and makes billions of dollars more of taxpayers &apos; money , as it changes how US citizens issue green cards .
the law will reduce commodity migration and replace current programmes .
the new application process will also &quot; advantage the candidates who speak English and have financial resources for supporting themselves and for the skills which benefit our economies , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp , United States media publications .
they are displaced to the area by young people , the rural population , pensioners .

how much did Turkey nevertheless mig@@ rate on at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century in order to get to earth here ?

rules on GMO cultivation should be clear @-@ cut .
the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or sent a draft law ( GMOs ) and A revision law to the plant protection product law on distingu@@ ishing spouses from the police environment .
the revised GMO legislation will do away with the establishment of a separate collection of data , for both genetically modified ( GM ) crops and operators , whether to be used in the plant health register in the future .
furthermore , it en@@ gen@@ ders the obligation to have prior agreement on a designated radio wine producer , an ap@@ big beekeeping entity .
while at present the cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia should not be culti@@ vated , we regard it as essential to have clear rules on the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as there is no decision to designate Estonia &apos;s GM @-@ free model &quot; says S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , President of plant Health Department at the D@@ HS .
&quot; we must take into account , however , that in addition , we must keep elaborate and proportionate the actions that have been developed .
this draft law repe@@ als the requirements on the labelling and treatment of GM crops , land and business operators in the EU and for the management of GM farming culture , and for the establishment of economic activities .
specifically on beekeeping , the indications confirmed underway for GM farmers for re@@ public@@ ising GM crops are replaced by the obligation to achieve a good deal with beekeeping before opening up cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to Minis@@ tries to coordinate .
all interested parties have the possibility to consult it in the draft information system and if they wish to present their own opinion to the G@@ recon@@ che@@ du@@ er .
the planned amendments affect specifically those in the plant farming sector , beekeeping and the agricultural authority .
in the European Union - including in Estonia - only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10@@ - can be cultivation .
yet none of Estonian farmers have committed themselves to growing GM crops .
the reason for this is that not a Rom@@ any person be present in Estonia , the European media provide an imper@@ vious vegetable to which mon 8@@ 10 destination is concerned .
the rejection of this ma@@ gic line has also been spread to the southern regions , and is not appropriate in May to our climate conditions .
last marketing , in order to obtain food security , studies on possible dig@@ es@@ tion of sili@@ ca waste in the local gar@@ ba@@ ge , maize and so@@ pes have been commissioned in 2015 and 2016 by the Ministry of Coun@@ ty Nature .
the analysis of the sam@@ ples made showed that seeds provided in foreign countries were not included , and that , as a result of the study , the seeds of rape , vegetables and soya b@@ ars ( cultivation ) increased in Estonia were found not included in GMOs .
that being the case , it can be concluded that in Estonia GM crops are not deliberately increased and that there was no delay .

directors of white house w@@ EN@@ ed thousands of taxpayers &apos; fair buy
according to military documents made public by the magaz@@ ine , the decision by the White Chamber to aero@@ plane air a naval helicop@@ ter last month for an American sell event led to almost $ 24 000 for the southern UK .
green and white col@@ ours S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , ren@@ owned as Marine One during President &apos;s state of office , were the front figure for setting out European construction programmes in White Ma@@ in on 17 July .

the helicop@@ ter built in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ tis squ@@ it@@ ched for non@@ sensi@@ cal cord , a fire mas@@ k struck from the Qu@@ a@@ ard and a me@@ tal asse@@ de in the Mis@@ cel@@ lu@@ a .

&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an un@@ usually big case , &apos; Inves@@ ted in H@@ X @-@ 1 kom@@ and@@ ö@@ r said , &apos; To@@ ge@@ &apos; in ema@@ ils before the event prior to presenting your upper , senior officer of the field of air services , who is the naval force .
the message stated that the helicop@@ ter would ri@@ p off until a break@@ fast between 18 and 21 from 17 July to 3 o &apos;@@ clock for the Southern Council and around 15 by 5 p.@@ m .
the fact had been added that if after the departure of a White Maj@@ or pur@@ ports , they still needed second ge@@ compliment because of restrictions on working time .
this was the first aero@@ plane cras@@ h during the event , and the es@@ c@@ ad@@ ad@@ army inter@@ cep@@ ted the aircraft across the sea throughout the con@@ vo@@ cable time .
it was impossible to read in our documents on the magaz@@ ine whether or not how second room was eventually needed .
H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s Law prohibits German workers from using government assets for political ends .

&apos;@@ You appear to be absent &apos; the lead officers crow@@ ding .
the White House declared it to be an &apos; university &apos; event in America , and they might not have been covered by the H@@ at@@ ch Law .
yet even official events have political sub@@ ton@@ es .
the President backed the efforts of health reform during the event during the Senate and praised attempts to keep the government regulations in being under threat .
use activities under the name of Mrs destination or Air lic , known as &apos; Iran One &apos; , for political benefit , is no more new phenomenon .
the rights of it must be used by the Presidents to travel them .
however , the demand to use this purely photo@@ graphic pro@@ gram is unusual .

these teams ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) often case with flight tests around Washington and southern hor@@ ror to get the announcement of the United States President White House passed by a c@@ enti@@ metres .

the Directorate told us the flight flight for the &apos; American &apos; flight cre@@ ws &apos; was counted as the statu@@ e for his monthly prof@@ ite@@ ering flights .
at that day , was accompanied by 11 more hours &apos; personal independent support efforts for the &apos; president .
no other li@@ mb@@ h@@ ant of this event , according to the White House , has s@@ cor@@ ned the taxpayers &apos; w@@ alle@@ ts .
according to S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , the company was not involved in carrying out activation of a helicop@@ ter at the mer@@ cy of the southern army .
the budgetary document and precise costs caused by the event will not be retained by President G@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 simply and the pace of its operation will be difficult to quanti@@ fy .
meanwhile , the Ministry of Defence runs a USD 24 380 per hour under the b@@ ath prices for the financial year 2017 .
letters held by Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r noted a flight extension of its core tool from the Kingdom de Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o airport Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ m to 30 minutes during both directions .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicop@@ ter is much below this sum .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; expenditure on estimates for deduc@@ tions is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimated compensa@@ tory rates include staff , care and a series of other in@@ timate costs being taken into account by an annual payment . &quot;
according to the 2015 Ex@@ po survey , the defence Ministry does not include staff costs , but did cover costs related to fuel , care and contracts .
Se@@ an S@@ hari@@ mer , former Deputy press officer of the White House , defended the use of helicop@@ ter at that time .
&quot; the focus is on showing the things made in America this week . it said S@@ Has@@ na .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ t pretend to be very proud that they contribute to our national security , and that there are about hundreds , rather than even thousands , whose work depends on it .
and I all believe that , as most of the Americans have done , we are proud of this helicop@@ ter and so @-@ called &apos; Mal@@ gged &apos; military equipment , which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly on .
so , of course it is right to lay that on the agenda . &apos;

according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s role in politics
the head of United Nations mission for Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society - including women - play a part in these matters .
Har@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , UN aid mission leader , said that hundreds of women nomin@@ ate to local Soviet elections , three women stand as vice @-@ president , and more than 30 % from newly registered voters are women .
&quot; it is a non @-@ negoti@@ able way to gau@@ ge the role of women , &quot; said his words in this declaration in Wednesday .
the elections can represent the public in fact and only be credible if women fully participate and also participate in all phases of the electoral process .
the local council elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
this has threatened , for its part , the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with the transitional period if any role of the international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s election will mark the first time that power is granted cal@@ mly from one democratically elected government to the next .
Europeans , according to M@@ ys@@ om , participate strongly in democracy in Afghanistan .
the Afghan In@@ dependent Ele@@ ction Commission reported that compared to 3.@@ 6 million registered voters , 2.2 million women were registered .

it is an ideal thing to have children , instead of chic@@ ken !
firstly , it is secure and convenient , with the ra@@ pid@@ ity of the burden growing at the same rate as is provisions of trained staff .
visitors can also make villages with quite a large number of children .
children have a balance ; they are also addi@@ cted and they feel deprived of the possibility to rise high and feel important .
bigger children can do their villages at the same time .

sometimes the Philippines &apos; big deal at the heart of mo@@ pe@@ ds in the world
B@@ ouch@@ ers have been lu@@ mped off are the summer class that has a similarly grey product itself in recent years , whatever it starts up on the y@@ el@@ low , and which by being able to display price signs on the front of the @-@ line at all , despite that modest birth alone .
the home , accumulated by the number of co@@ ws , is probably one such thing which has existed some time in a life which has not been aro@@ used with much emo@@ tion .
that is simply there and there is nothing tested if it is , either .
now @-@ shel@@ ters , though , are about to make the real race , and mo@@ c@@ drivers have changed their head@@ mil@@ ls onto white co@@ ws by day the@@ reafter .
this is not only a coast@@ line , but is just like a moment of sa@@ va@@ ge debate as an street , and stronger women are ever realising this to office .
however , it is worth making it clear beforehand that strike such a summer or have it worthwhile postponing a me@@ j@@ er@@ ania or s@@ lap@@ ping in lo@@ cks however .
however , the f@@ all@@ area of tolerance has made women &apos;s credi@@ ted gro@@ oming in real summer .
for example , reading foreign fashion char@@ ters , the first thing remains that sc@@ oo@@ ters injec@@ tion tra@@ cks on local markets as the first thing they will have when you travel holiday , and they buy some tra@@ ilers , which then includes always hours of leave and additional on the coast , the market , and also the friend in clearing the ground in the city .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are so wonder@@ less to buy head@@ lines on the market and sell or give them to loyal read@@ ers .
it is worth noting that the demand for read@@ ers to attract women ( and men ! ) in the world is obviously involved in each other &apos;s area of the pi@@ le , in order to get some homes to enjoy the positive ownership .
in some ways , this mad@@ ness is also understandable when outs@@ our@@ ced a few qu@@ eu@@ es before the offence which rises into the m@@ ou@@ ths .
true , the shops of the cas@@ h@@ rooms have also found easy money here , and thus let bran@@ ded luxury games also can@@ vas@@ sing f@@ ans know more r@@ all@@ ot@@ ta@@ il volume bills for some dozens and a do@@ zen or a thousand euros .
obviously , in order that richer customers do not have to feel easy to die , they are pro@@ pel@@ ling over audits using some cheap homes .
for example , it will be possible to buy a 7@@ 0,000 com@@ po@@ l payment co@@ ke in D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a .
however , the Chan@@ gel Trans@@ lation is open to € 6,@@ 000 .
despite most mo@@ tive buildings , however , wal@@ kers would be without a few large mos@@ ques - just starting up more easily .
it is that be@@ er bags are allegedly coming from a much greater den@@ sity from the Philippines from which they are aval@@ pled .
the bun@@ dle of rus@@ hed bags within it is particularly exporting business and there is a lot of poor local awareness about what the nu@@ bs are .
Ad@@ mittedly , the illusi@@ on@@ ry has been handed down since the 14@@ th century and is quite plu@@ mber .
however , since its bre@@ vi@@ er has to be red less than cor@@ di@@ fied , they become mus@@ cles and other materials for more communic@@ able cop@@ ies - meaning also more operational .
for example , recently , d@@ run@@ ded pa@@ vements or lea@@ ther s@@ con@@ ts are particularly Mis@@ ti@@ vated by contrast with d@@ well@@ ings .
however , signatories are able to send a copy of the actual documents , especially Mrs J@@ ane Bir@@ Harkin , who was not foreseeable to have been cop@@ ko@@ ti@@ f@@ match @-@ shir@@ ts of those who were the biggest bun@@ dled sur@@ f@@ lies .

as usual in motor@@ ists , @-@ rich br@@ ands from a classic h@@ all have come forward with all the interpretations about this .
for example , if they so wish you can get a fur@@ ni@@ vated ri@@ gs from ju@@ els or a little through speed bags .

G@@ M@@ B &apos;s concern is about investments at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e University G@@ las@@ go@@ w
the company is expected to Envoy their senior managers as the company &apos;s creat@@ or of the Commission &apos;s Mat@@ V@@ iti@@ e @-@ s for long @-@ term production plans in the enterprise &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
under G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has si@@ f@@ ted with the object of the Nabucco analysis to the future of investment .
more than 500 people work in somewhere produces H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich for mature services and other products .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s owner Ro@@ dis Pla@@ di said they were investing over GBP 5 million in the last few years .
there were there employees and trade unions who have been paid run@@ ners &apos; : one who lis@@ tens &apos; when something al@@ tered in plant activities .
a letter sent to the body of the company in its mail addressed G@@ M@@ B Scotland , Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e , requesting that &quot; no concern is made of whether the funding must be used to modernise its production lines . &quot;
B@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y stated , &apos; The fact that we cannot get knowledge from the chief President of the site as regards the customs point &apos;s business needs and plans for future investment gives our Members very deep concern .
here , families have worked several generations , and the workforce is made up a lot of people on the local community , around the G@@ las@@ go@@ w , and we have a vital pillar as a suitable means of guaranteeing decent employment in a region where incomes are high and social housing .
therefore , in the summit with the eastern jobs , wages and welfare of G@@ las@@ go@@ w and Bri@@ x@@ ti , in the context of the expon@@ ential fall in living costs and production , not only requires a vibran@@ t production company in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e . &quot;
Pla@@ dis@@ e said , &apos; The official became Jean , at that point , just yesterday from the Scot@@ t of G@@ M@@ B , and this company responded directly to it in our appreciation of active communication with representatives of workers and trade union forces .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting among employees working in Rab@@ it and G@@ M@@ B , which openly brought several issues to an open debate .
that said , we discussed with employees that like all the other companies , which are in an atmosphere that is highly competitive and precarious in the economy , at due course , we are studying our activities in a current fashion , and that applies to all of our companies and to all our sites and enterprises , to their competitiveness .
she added , &apos; In recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million on the cod site - most of that is in production lines and technique improvements .
we fully understand the legacy of Customs , when there have been any changes on the occasion , that and that is the group abin@@ ets are the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago about joining Ney@@ ra ?
la size can regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main does not sign up to ambition to attract Ney@@ mar in their ranks by offering a remedy of GBP 18@@ 9 million in its min@@ de@@ formation , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record ron@@ age ?
this bold approach has opened summer up into a transitional window and a club of L@@ ig@@ COM 1 is ready to wrec@@ k more than one double his game now that date the world record was installed in the last resort by returning Paul Po@@ g@@ ba to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ jus 89 million euro .
as a result , trans@@ poses from Ney@@ ra the world &apos;s ke@@ y@@ head and also the highest paid professional spor@@ ts@@ man in the world beginning to receive over GBP 500 000 a week after fees from PS@@ G .
Barcelona is also telling it because of the approaches and the revo@@ cation of Ney@@ ra , although the source of the Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ i leadership reaffirms that the club has always provided the best for football as of its arrival in 1987 .
but did custo@@ ching the PS@@ G President warned the football world about this possibility three years ago ?
after Manch@@ ester City showed your interest in concluding the Blair Ma@@ tu@@ als Agreements , N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f warned strongly of all clubs thinking about recru@@ iting some of the best players of the PS@@ G in 2014 .
&apos;@@ I am not concerned because they know that , when they make sure they deal with some of our players , we will accept them and contact with them , &apos; said Al @-@ Cairo .
we honour all the clubs .
but if they try to get an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seemed to have covered the line , since the Spanish club saw last this summer an interest in GPS central player , Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
PS@@ G made clear that it would prevent any status and that Barcelona could get out of badly value because , in the form of Ney@@ ra , of one of its valuable assets .

&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders . &quot; he stressed .
John would be adversely minded for Britain to act as part of the European Union , and this will be impossible , if I could say he could be part of the European common market .
it will preserve the current liberal trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
the other possibility of making Britain more smoothly left would be establishing a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom v@@ s. Ta@@ o@@ ise@@ ach explained him .
noting that ever there was such an agreement with Turkey , Pr@@ ad@@ ware said : &apos; we can certainly have this with Britain . &apos;
the alternative to this would be a return to customs points , which would constitute a historic division and a political failure .
&apos;@@ It is Im@@ proving trade , prosperity and peace &apos; that you , the Irish Prime Minister , said .
