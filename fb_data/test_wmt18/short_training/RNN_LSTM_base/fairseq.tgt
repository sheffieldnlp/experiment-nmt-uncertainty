four members of Cape Verde and Spain were held in Estonia
according to Mr Posselt , the police , in Spain , held a group of K@@ Cape Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , the leader of the so @-@ called K@@ Cape K@@ Cape K@@ Cape K@@ Cape K@@ Cape K@@ Cape K@@ Cape K@@ Cape K@@ Cape K@@ Cape ro@@ v@@ ski .
in the case of Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , in Spain , the Court of Justice was arrested .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects who were detained in Estonia .
in terms of suspicion , the so @-@ called K@@ Cape ro@@ vo is a year of a real Community of people aged between 27 and 57 years of life , mainly committing drug crimes .
in Spain , in the province of M@@ ale province , the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained .
in Estonia , three men were detained in the suspect , one of them has been collected according to the criminal Community leading figures , and two are members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicate that the criminal community was clearly divided into the challenges and roles .
the purpose of the actual Community activities was to commit drug crimes , and thus serve the proceeds of crime , &quot; commented on the head of pre @-@ trial proceedings , public prosecutors , Va@@ tic@@ a Ver@@ te .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of criminal offences in question is increasing , the Prosecutor .
it is the people who have also been involved in the interests of law enforcement authorities , and some of them have suffered punishment for drug crimes .
the Ver@@ te emphasised that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation is the norm for us , and the operation of this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation &apos; , commented on the Prosecutor Ver@@ te .
the leader of the Environment police Office , ago Le@@ at , said that the detention was preceded by nearly half a year of prior examination .
the first half of the week &apos;s work in the first half of the week , and at the same time , in Estonia and Spain , we have been suspected of crimes .
it added that officials in the central criminal police were helpful in detention in Spain .
for years , we have a good contact and mutual understanding between the Spanish police and civilian card .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are yet another message to criminals that we will also be able to have a second Europe in the rest of Europe , said Le@@ in .
the information collected so far indicates that there can be a suspicion of suspicion by men in freedom of access to the perpetrators of new crimes , which is why the prosecution service has been requested by the Prosecutor &apos;s Office and the Court also approved it .
in Spain , he is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
in the context of this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash will have been seized in order to guarantee confiscation .
the legal proceedings of the Criminal Court will lead to an organised crime of criminal police organised by the central police and lead the public prosecution office .
the city of Tallinn , the city of Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , was convicted of blackmail in 2005 and punished him with a five @-@ year imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Mr T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v was held on the basis of a wide @-@ ranging T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v in the Estonian criminal world .
Cape Verde &apos;s Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch rose from the beginning of the 1990s , when he began to deal with blackmail in Tallinn in the beginning of the 1990s .
Ad@@ mittedly , the tax@@ i and prostitution carried out by the various hotel ho@@ tels and called for a monthly with@@ charge for business@@ men .
international joint operations , the confiscation of criminal proceeds and the judgments in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the last court rulings , the so @-@ called &apos; D@@ ik@@ a@@ i crime &apos; , the eight accused persons who have been confis@@ cated by EUR 80 000 in criminal terms , or the judgment against nine persons in the case of any person , Mr Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v , in 2006 , which was aimed at illegal trade in secret cigarettes , aimed at combating the illegal trade and trafficking of cigarettes in East Vir@@ g@@ in and in South Estonia .
the large scale of seiz@@ ure of criminal proceeds is around EUR 71 500 .
in these criminal matters , progress has been made to ensure that police officers exchange information and prosecutors every day with their foreign counterparts and , if necessary , be carried out together in any case in the European Union .
the Citizens &apos; Rights group war@@ ns the sou@@ ris@@ at travel
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ mates of C@@ olo@@ red People has warned the people of the State of the State of State discrimin@@ ating against a Mis@@ tral and racist attack .
in writing . - ( PT ) In the statement of the group , it says : &apos; Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i in the state of sugar issued by the State of the State , which applies until 28 August 2017 , calls on all the African Americans , visitors and sou@@ ri@@ ans to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious in the state of the entire state , taking into account the whole of the ro@@ tten racial events that have recently taken place in the state and at this point of view . &quot;
according to NA@@ P , the group urged the group to issue a travel warning , so that the so @-@ called &quot; Mis@@ our@@ i law &quot; law , which makes discrimination against cases of discrimination more difficult , and the fact that the state of play of the State of the state is unequal in the case of minorities .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
they are being drawn up because of their sk@@ in colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said NA@@ la Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , President R@@ od Cha@@ pel @-@ newspaper The K@@ ans@@ in City Sta@@ r .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints . &quot;
this is the first warning that the organisation has issued on the state of the US .
Mrs RÃ¼hle referred to such events as the racist insult to the students of a Mis@@ tral class student and the hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous story of 28 @-@ year @-@ old mus@@ cle scandals originating in T@@ en@@ nes@@ ta .
the ers died in the beginning of this year under dubious circumstances , after the country had to carry out a liqu@@ e@@ tal and Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police carried out by the police , without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the comment refers to the recently drafted report by the Chief Prosecutor of the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i Chief Prosecutor , which shows that the state of play in the State of Chief of car for L@@ ike drivers is more likely to be at 75 % more likely than those of sam@@ ples .
&apos;@@ The point is for people to be aware of and warn their families , friends and co @-@ men for what can happen in the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is case &apos; , &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people are willing to be ready , whether it is to be spent on v@@ oni@@ alism or informing relatives about the fact that they are crossing the state . &quot;
on the basis of the latest data from F@@ B@@ I hate crime , the report was documented in 100 hate crime in 2015 , which places the state of play in the country &apos;s cross @-@ section of the country in a country similar to the number of offences .
the warning is also in response to the new law of the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which makes it difficult for the company to be prosecuted in search of discrimination on the grounds of housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( AC@@ L@@ U ) was issued earlier in the case of T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona , following the adoption by these states of immigration laws , which met local authorities for human rights violations , because , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , it increases racial profiling .
normally , the travel warnings are being issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but at the last time interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to the laws and trends of the United States .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what can anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , which may well have been caused by he@@ pati@@ tis - A , B , C , D and E @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis - could be caused by He@@ pati@@ tis .
all these vir@@ uses provo@@ ke the in@@ sane bur@@ n .
however , the worst cost is chronic B and C he@@ pati@@ tis , which can develop in a cir@@ cus , or to pay for cancer , and pay for cancer .
the epidemi@@ ology of the Health Agency , Mr Ku@@ rel , is speaking that the acute disease of he@@ pati@@ tis disease is the same for all species of li@@ ver , a f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ gue , pl@@ undering , es@@ ta@@ tion , o@@ me@@ fication , s@@ tun@@ hea@@ pain , ru@@ th@@ less emissions , w@@ ag@@ ger@@ y , w@@ oo@@ der and species of meat , and na@@ vi@@ es and mas@@ ter@@ houses .
the last hour of death also comes from a po@@ t @-@ by @-@ fire name , with cancer .
children can move from he@@ pati@@ tis without a disease .
the various species in the Ma@@ in@@ um can only be identified as a basis for a laboratory study .
extreme he@@ pati@@ tis can go on from chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and for decades without the disease , which means that man may not know anything about the harmful disease that is harmful to it .
Mr Ku@@ rel will bring different forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describe their way out of them .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread ill and infec@@ tious us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , se@@ af@@ lets , infected people &apos;s emissions and hand@@ outs to food , soil , objects , sugar , and drug consumption .
He@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , family members and carers , chronic pay @-@ related people who are suffering from he@@ pati@@ tis risk , who are sexu@@ ally sex people , men sex men , drug users , he@@ pati@@ tis high @-@ spread countries visiting countries travelling by he@@ pati@@ tis high .
women can be prevented by vacc@@ inations , particularly in the case of a vaccination in a number of passengers who are travelling and he@@ pati@@ tis at risk .
in addition , it is important to meet the daily hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t the hands of the hand before the consumption of all fruit and vegetables is was@@ hed .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread sick people in contact with blood , drug @-@ injec@@ tion , affec@@ tion , au@@ tism , blood@@ shed , blood @-@ contaminated sites ( too@@ th@@ p@@ ine , pregnant facilities ) , the use of donors with blood , he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , and he@@ pati@@ tis / cop@@ per @-@ born baby .

in order to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis , people can be vacc@@ inated ; in particular , it is recommended to vacc@@ in@@ ate people from risk groups and , as well as chronic pay diseases , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
he@@ pati@@ tis would be subject to preventive measures : ref@@ ra@@ ining from the hygiene and man@@ ac@@ ity of stran@@ gers , other sharp resources and sy@@ stal@@ gic @-@ coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or @-@ advice , he@@ pati@@ tis and au@@ g@@ hon@@ y , and the use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection , or prevention of sexual risk behaviour .
vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis is a part of the national immunity plan and for children free of charge .
C he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis spread sick people in contact with blood , drug @-@ injec@@ tion , au@@ g@@ mentation , au@@ g@@ mentation , blood @-@ contaminated sites , the use of donors , he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis , sex sex and he@@ pati@@ tis .

S@@ pati@@ tis preventive measures are : ref@@ ra@@ ining from the hygiene and man@@ ac@@ ity of stran@@ gers , other sharp resources and sy@@ stal@@ gic @-@ coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or @-@ advice , and the use of he@@ pati@@ tis and au@@ g@@ hon@@ y , and the use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infections .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
the he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis produces a D virus , which will spread to the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
this is why D he@@ pati@@ tis B , with he@@ pati@@ tis B or super @-@ le@@ c@@ ctions , from chronic B @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread exposure to blood and other body liquids , with contaminated coal @-@ co@@ coun@@ ters , sexu@@ ally and sel@@ dom infected .
the he@@ pati@@ tis ris@@ ks of he@@ pati@@ tis B is chronic B @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis , and the immunity of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
effective preventive action is vacc@@ inated against he@@ pati@@ tis B , which protects people from he@@ pati@@ tis virus infection .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread the fe@@ e@@ ble of drinking water and food , including low @-@ treated animal meat , fish and marine car@@ b@@ ons , the blood of the donors , joint sy@@ ch@@ es@@ ta@@ les and who have been infected with hope .
passengers may be infected by he@@ pati@@ tis high by he@@ pati@@ tis in countries .
the prevention of he@@ pati@@ tis preventive measures is a breach of hygiene requirements : was@@ hing or dis@@ infec@@ tants after boarding , before food production and feed , after hospital care .
F@@ ru@@ its and vegetables , before consumption , avoid the eating of heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption .

the F@@ ara@@ h did not mean long , after the fin@@ alists , with the hus@@ band T@@ ania and children .
that was a special moment for me .
I very much regret my family .

in spite of the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ norm &apos; Da@@ am gold , G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti , A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , a mag@@ nific@@ ent story of a much deeper 19th century ending the 19th century &apos;s end and the 20th century of Vienna &apos;s cultural life in Vienna .
however , more thoroughly the history of history .
the inf@@ lam@@ matory information on the gen@@ tle was perhaps a s@@ le@@ ep in the b@@ ars , narro@@ wer the issue of the extraordinary nature of the car@@ b@@ ons allowed to have more influence in the head@@ lines .
at present , there would be two books between the two books : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti and his wife &apos; Da@@ am B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri &apos; , and much more and more extensive , more extensive and more comprehensive , and more extensive , and more extensive , and more extensive , and a more comprehensive history of the European family and the German occupation in Austria .
the first one @-@ third of the book will take the middle of the w@@ ed@@ ding Vienna cultural life and who , in the Austrian Capital of Austria , may well imagine the way in which a hundred years ago , a life of R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ es , or how the Cen@@ tr@@ ali coff@@ ee took all his heads , when the Kli@@ m@@ ver was introduced .
the concentration of cultural charac@@ ters was a very rich city in one of the rich@@ est cities in Europe , and the name of the name in the book is known as a g@@ lance in a more cultural way .
at the same time , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a city where un@@ treated inno@@ c@@ ence and the highest level of suicide in Europe , the development of something does not give rise to anything .
or perhaps , however , every couple of couples are adding to the cultural life of the 20th century , in Vienna .
dream travelling to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century , there was an explosion in the number of Jews in Vienna , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
the S@@ aj@@ an@@ di@@ cal exchange was almost one of the last 10 in Vienna .
in Vienna , parents were the new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but for this time , when the A@@ A@@ M has two times opened up to the Czech sugar mil@@ na@@ te , Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch@@ every and the Kli@@ m@@ tile , his father was already in possession of the famous foot@@ steps for the bank , the Bank of H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg , the Bank of H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg .
however , the A@@ de@@ let &apos;s life , which he belon@@ ged , has not been drawing up .
if you look at the &apos; Da@@ ami Plan &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end @-@ to @-@ life infection is a kind such as soci@@ alism and dre@@ ams of a trip to the Soviet Union .
the 19@@ 0@@ 3rd year , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to outs@@ ource his hus@@ band to a cli@@ m@@ mer , the last moment was the last minute of a foot@@ note in Vienna .
the customer paid at that time 4 000 kro@@ on , a quarter of a good location for the land of a natural house .
the fact that some spor@@ ts@@ men have been suspected of the mo@@ del@@ l of the fla@@ me of a col@@ ony , the sugar of sugar was not discoura@@ ged .
as far as the dele@@ tion is concerned , the only fact that the mo@@ del@@ li and the close relationship between the artists , which has emerged in the course of work , continue to work to the end .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - &apos; Da@@ am gold .
G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti , A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri is an extraordinary story , &quot; Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , English from English , Al@@ do R@@ and@@ land .
immediately before the start of the work , the Kli@@ m@@ man has travelled to San V@@ ita@@ le Ra@@ ven@@ na , and the investi@@ g@@ ators think that it is precisely where the wonderful mo@@ sa@@ s of the g@@ oo@@ der , The@@ o@@ dor@@ l , have been given the idea of a gol@@ den spor@@ ts@@ man in A@@ dele@@ e .
the Kli@@ m@@ t presented his &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; in Vienna 19@@ 8 and at the same time ( in 19@@ 07 @-@ 19@@ 08 ) , there was sometimes a gol@@ den land in S@@ novel .
historically , the simil@@ arity of the two women did not fail to notice .
how is Hitler involved ?
&quot; I think that my friend Kli@@ m@@ ti will remember his work in order to make his work available to the public , wrote A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer a couple of years after the departure of the ar@@ tist ( the Kli@@ m@@ t died in February 19@@ 18 ) and wanted to see their family a colle@@ c@@ torate of mus@@ eu@@ ms to go to mus@@ eu@@ ms .
six years before death , the Kli@@ m@@ l was one of you .
in its own wil@@ ls ( A@@ dele in February 19@@ 25 ) , he asked for the hus@@ band to leave her two sports and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti to the Austrian Gal@@ special case .
his ten@@ ets in his own sta@@ teh@@ ood , Mari@@ ale and Lu@@ se .
after a year , when the Kli@@ m@@ a was completed by the Austrian Mon@@ a lisa , there was an attempt to escape from the A@@ ca@@ de@@ issu@@ an A@@ ca@@ de@@ issu@@ er of A@@ ca@@ de@@ issu@@ an , and in the case of the failure of a year ago , it was a failure of the past .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is sometimes due to the fact that Jewish profes@@ sors did not receive the de@@ scen@@ es against him , none of his ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ers actually had a Jewish effect .
in any case , the Austrian Gal@@ special case , which was referred to in the case of the Austrian Gal@@ special case , has changed considerably by 19@@ 39 , as it was important for the rich Jewish arts in Vienna to find the work of the Naz@@ is .
Hitler &apos;s personal art mus@@ ici@@ ans were also at home to some A@@ dele , but not a Kli@@ m@@ man .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the Nazi ra@@ da@@ r began , ten years of court was born between the Austrian Government and the he@@ irs of B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ tis@@ ers .
in this regard , it is only mentioned that if the &apos; novel &apos; see in Vienna the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle , A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ er , the &apos; Da@@ am B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ er &apos; , must be taken to look at the New York Ne@@ ue Gal@@ special .
and before we read the Vienna War , the aforementioned book also has to be read .
even if you do not intend to go to the Kli@@ m@@ re work , because at least my emo@@ tions were over@@ turned after the closure of the book , and over 135 million dollars , and the mo@@ b A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Edit restruc@@ tured , and Mr A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Edit re@@ en .
so there is not so much the kind of representation , rather than the life of a sexu@@ ality , and a very moving story .
it has significantly facilitated the orientation of the Bau@@ v@@ s , which was set out in the early stages of the book .
17 @-@ year @-@ old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonia .
in the event of life , there was a gold sw@@ am@@ ping of 200 m@@ li@@ li@@ mb@@ les , very close to 2.@@ 16@@ ,@@ 62 .
the Ti@@ dro@@ mark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ old pi@@ les at a time when Canada became a football champi@@ on@@ ships in the event of A@@ P@@ M , the Pri@@ ority A@@ av@@ an U@@ ju@@ gation blo@@ g .

the top @-@ time ranking in Estonia rose by the third , and his fresh personal mark is the result of all the times in Estonia .
the new hope of the future will be more than 100 % for Canadian adults &apos; champi@@ on@@ ship in Canada , 200 m and 400 w@@ ounded , and 200 m@@ our@@ m and 400 f@@ ans .
last week there was a football champi@@ on@@ ships in Tor@@ onto in Tor@@ onto , and the way in which successful starts also took place there .

as soon as possible , this was the case in the last year in the last year .
the Gol@@ f @-@ ever period in Estonia has failed to distance itself from the record of Estonia to Par@@ evi@@ ct E@@ lina in Estonia .
in Canada , more than 100 million w@@ ag@@ ers won a major personal record in Canada , with 5@@ 6.@@ 66 of the new Estonian season with 5@@ 6.@@ 66 .
for example , the parent of Ker@@ tu from the age of Ker@@ tu , for example , has been watered down by one hundre@@ d@@ th more quickly .
for personal excellence , he still reached 100 more se@@ li@@ li@@ zing sw@@ im@@ ming in the opening of a letter from 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 .
on a longer distance , he has only reached the seventh place when the fin@@ alist was 17.@@ 31 .
it is currently leading to four different divor@@ ces from the Estonian season in Estonia .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics of a too@@ th@@ p@@ aste
the holiday time has come in the hands of the US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ le .
however , since T@@ ru@@ mp has been one of the most package holiday days , the critics have already taken place in a too@@ th .
the US @-@ US and CN@@ N reports are scheduled for 17 @-@ day leave at the B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , which is in the New Jer@@ ic@@ ys .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , there has already been a debate on the holiday in T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i .
they are throwing too much out of the bul@@ let by the Olympic .
it is the President &apos;s custom@@ ary for a weekend to have his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey cotton .
by the way , Mr T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s , the President of his or her 19@@ 6 has not been clean@@ ed by President .
for example , Mr W@@ . Bush , on holiday , has already reached 67 days on holiday , Barack Obama , but only 21 days .
however , the ball tends to dream about the ball .
the days after President , he said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , who said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , so that there will be no time for a long term of leave , because there is a great deal of need to do .
he also voiced three years ago about Barack Obama &apos;s leave .
the current President wrote on Twitter : &apos; at a time when Obama is on holiday , gol@@ f will play a sole@@ mn and a j@@ arg@@ on in the concer@@ t , in the case of journalists in the sun &apos; .
the announcement by officials of the White House has no place for a record of 17 @-@ day gol@@ f .
it is officially called on holiday , during which T@@ ru@@ mp@@ y will not be able to read or other forms of action .
in addition , labour leave had to be another reason .
this is the case for the Western con@@ sign@@ ment of the White House , and that is why all personnel had to leave it .
the West is also located in O@@ ver C@@ abinet and other staff of the President .
&quot; I do not believe that anyone else would like to be in the West in August , when 38 degrees have been there , and there is no need for a sil@@ ver house , in the words of the House of White House , who stressed that President will continue to work during a holiday .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp followed by 17 days , you will be able to know the vide@@ os .
blocking of critics from Facebook to do not stand up for the Head of State when you do not tolerate the criticism of the voters .
there is a lot of things to be reflected in our country &apos;s father &apos;s image .
the Americans were lo@@ ving George Washington , but the newspapers did not go for a long time to get him out of the game from the internal politics to the political principles .
of course he was anno@@ yed by the criticism .
however , he did not forced his critics to silence .
as the Washington Washington , in 17@@ 83 , said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and , in the face of the m@@ our@@ ly and silence , we may be called &apos; at the hel@@ m of the sheep &apos; .
this brings me to Mr Ho@@ gan Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who is struggling to get more in Washington .
it has been blocked and deleted by at least 450 people , who expressed their views on the Facebook page in his official Facebook page .
in a complaint with the beginning of the week , the Union for Freedom of America ( AC@@ L@@ U ) , which is in the Union &apos;s Civil Liberties Association , is therefore to court .
the Governor of the Governor of the Governor of Re@@ ber@@ ner came into an empty act and a blo@@ gg@@ er s@@ lide into the reactions to style &apos; whom &apos; are interested in &apos; .
&quot; this is just Facebook , &quot; said many .
but that is what it counts .
and it is a matter of great importance when it comes to such a me@@ he@@ man like the Ho@@ gan .
it is an un@@ beli@@ eva@@ bly popular state in the democratic state of the democratic state .
his approval as a percentage of the country is the second highest ranking among the country &apos;s Si@@ xth Governor .
I am not thinking of an un@@ thin@@ kable response .
it has managed a firm and firm firm on its principles .
in addition , he has used a quite un@@ happy way in communicating with its constituents as a key tool , for example , after the first time in che@@ mis@@ try , after the first time in che@@ mis@@ try .
therefore , the Governor of the Governor of the Governor is a public forum , which is being managed by the workers who are currently being blocked by the staff of taxpayers &apos; dol@@ p@@ dollars , and , ultimately , dangerous and ultimately dangerous .
in his interview with Mr Ch@@ astel , the spokes@@ person of the Office , The Washington Posselt , the Governor of the Governor , said that the blocking of comments was nothing other than mode@@ ling .
however , it is too easy to portra@@ y the picture on the Internet cl@@ ou@@ trol@@ ler on the web , spa@@ w@@ ers or hatred of people full of people .
the post was in a series of people with a number of Ho@@ gan blocked .
and that is what they are quite people who communicate with their elected leaders , the owner of the company and the pas@@ tor , not Internet trol@@ y@@ sis .
they have all said that their comments were dis@@ respectful , thought and at least not the ro@@ gue .
Mr Pas@@ tor quoted his mail in the Bi@@ ble , by op@@ ting on the Ro@@ man Catholic traffic .
the lawyer from Mr Bo@@ wi@@ e Bo@@ wi@@ e , Mrs L@@ ak@@ sh@@ m Sar@@ ma Ra@@ mani , was not insti@@ gated by anger , but on a quite ang@@ ry crime .
&quot; I was poli@@ tely that I am disappointed , because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news , &apos; he wrote a news story in the heading of a post @-@ mak@@ er &apos; .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , as a lot of people comment on the same subject , it calls some of them immediately as a collective effort , rather than recognising that this is a major concern with citizens . &quot;
what the Governor of the Governor of First Instance called &apos; spa@@ m &apos; to the &apos; jun@@ k mail attack &apos; would probably be called for &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook @-@ age allows messages to be easily su@@ ita@@ bly blocked by blocking a negative comment or dele@@ ting a negative comment .
it is a lot cleaner than the old , when the workers had to be sent out to them to collect newspapers in the newspapers and bur@@ n them or arrest protest@@ ors and forced them to remain silent .
however , exactly this is what is happening now , simply digita@@ lly .
I am not the first public official to criticise the too@@ th of Facebook and other social media .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has compla@@ ined by using Twitter users who are blocked by Twitter .
one of the first signs of court rulings on this issue was the last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ as .
Judge at the United States , James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is decided , in Alexand@@ ria , in the chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control of Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i , for the first amendment to the Constitution , when he blocked his or her Facebook page .
K@@ tu@@ ck@@ y visited the AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter exercise after Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in@@ it ( R ) .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , they had a similar impact on the Internet than the Internet .

poverty and death by Indonesia
as dina De@@ ge@@ i &apos;s dinner , it will not use the lead .
he is even rarely used by the po@@ t .
Indonesia &apos;s capital , in the capital of Papua province P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , in the city of P@@ ani@@ a@@ c , places a s@@ and@@ le in a house in the local language a no@@ ta in a local language , to be invited directly to the fire .

it is late to work , however , to be dangerous for the majority of men who are unemployed and many of them are running hard , in addition to soldiers here .
&quot; no one dare to go around the clock this evening , &quot; he says he .
this is a rare cloud in Papua mountainous , which is a former Dutch col@@ ony , which has been incorporated into Indonesia in 19@@ 69 after a referendum , which was forced only to vote in a referendum on the very front of the troops in the eyes of the troops .
the movement in the wake of the World Bank &apos;s sup@@ rema@@ cy of the Netherlands has rapidly fuelled its ra@@ vi@@ es against the government of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , which keeps the region under its strong control , while keeping foreign journalists and human rights defenders .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into the P@@ ope and the Western P@@ ope , so that independent Papua New Guinea remained in the East .
the majority of the latter is both long as well @-@ neglected , and it is to be allowed to fly up to 90 minutes from the capital city of the province , Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ r , and then to go through a five @-@ hour journey by ren@@ dering a car @-@ friendly journey .
there is no joint transport .
the city of around 19 000 inhabitants consists of a disability that surroun@@ ds the bac@@ ku@@ p and cover fla@@ ts of iron , which has changed the different tone of the ro@@ ck , which has changed the different tone of the sho@@ es .
very few of the bee@@ keepers have taken place here , not to mention journalists , and there has not been almost a foreign matter here .
before the arrival of the Christian mission@@ aries of Me@@ e P@@ ago , pa@@ int of Me@@ ves was named by the name of T@@ ame@@ e .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to we@@ aring these ideas , &apos; says De@@ ge@@ i , referring to the marketing of our colour co@@ ded code , me@@ dal plu@@ g and private land .
&apos;@@ prior to this &apos; , we had a poor plant . &quot;
in Papua ically , the province of Indonesia is the poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
however , it is also a car@@ d@@ dle of Indonesia .
just 100 km away from the P@@ ani@@ a@@ era , which is a mountainous province with 153 000 inhabitants of New Jer@@ sey , is the world &apos;s largest and more profitable gold mine in G@@ ras@@ berg , which is the Mc@@ Mor@@ an report of F@@ bet@@ g Mc@@ Mor@@ an .
in 2015 alone , the F@@ bet@@ e report from around USD 3.@@ 1 billion is worth gold and cop@@ ied .
in addition , it will be able to gal@@ van@@ ise the timber industry with a value estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are a source of suffering from boats , as they will cause the presence of a powerful Indon@@ esi@@ an army .
the New York Times study showed that the F@@ bet@@ e report in the years 1998 to local military and military units around USD 20 million , including USD 150 000 per victim .
P@@ ope &apos;s efforts to ensure greater autonomy are threatening this gol@@ den and rou@@ tin@@ ely re @-@ established .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 69 , and thousands of which have been ra@@ ped by the Indon@@ esi@@ an army , tortured and imprisoned .
according to the Asian Human Rights Commission , there was a mass killing of genocide in Papua fri@@ ction in the 1970s .
last year alone , in the region of Indonesia , the police in the region of Indonesia were arrested in a peaceful protest .
the 2016 report on the Ar@@ ch@@ bis@@ ho@@ p of Bir@@ s@@ b@@ ane , &apos; We are losing all the testi@@ monies on the atrocities committed in previous year , such as non @-@ judicial executions , torture ( one of the other reports , in particular , rape and the introduction of electric shocks ) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; the number of victims is difficult to read , because such incidents will take place every week , &apos; the organisation of Human Rights Watch Indonesia and Andreas Har@@ son@@ o .
K@@ ru@@ guay is still more firmly committed because Papua natural assets have caused the influx of neo @-@ set@@ tle@@ rs elsewhere from Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but the demo@@ graphy is changing , because in the wake of the wind@@ fall economic migrants from Indonesia , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ s islands .
Ja@@ aval@@ ans selling sho@@ es and b@@ ric@@ ks sell their ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do , which were ser@@ ted together with the surface of the ground .
local cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started to sell and vegetables in traditional markets with local boats from the traditional market , &quot; explains P@@ ani@@ a@@ is @-@ born 24 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ mb@@ o @-@ year @-@ olds in the province of Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ r .
&apos;@@ P@@ Ãµ@@ is@@ y pa@@ ints to Papua ma@@ ma &#91; women &#93; will lose their share of the market &apos; .
the Indon@@ esi@@ an President J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , who is known as a Jo@@ co@@ w , has promised to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations by the P@@ ope in his election campaign in 2014 .
the former pu@@ zz@@ le won the presidential Pal@@ ace in Papua 29 constitu@@ encies , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , in Papua 29 constitu@@ encies .
however , the P@@ pu@@ as has changed very little , and the local feeling is beaten .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes regarding the restoration of justice , &apos; says &apos; You &apos; .
in fact , just two months after the resigna@@ tion of Jo@@ ko@@ wi October , there is a low level .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children s@@ inging on the ro@@ of in the Mo@@ st , when the dar@@ k@@ ness of the dark motor@@ cycles two Indon@@ esi@@ s .
children told them that they should be included in the front .
an insult to the local passport Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ eba@@ i T@@ eba@@ i T@@ eba@@ i is insul@@ ting one of the soldiers , and later on , with four soldiers .
according to the victims and specta@@ tors , the be@@ ver@@ t soldiers have lost their children and dece@@ ive them with their gun@@ s .
then there was one soldiers shot in the child .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , beaten so cruel that he fell to the home .
a couple of hours later , the in@@ sin@@ u@@ ating building of the electoral Commission was put in place and the next day is even more important .
about 1 000 young people , women and children in the face of a football match in the local police department and military management centre .
they were we@@ aring hor@@ se@@ al buses and put in Papua me@@ e a le@@ go in Papua me@@ e , which ran around and bu@@ ried a s@@ ong .
some of the protests began by the police and military troops .
in the event of a dis@@ sen@@ sion , a hand@@ ful of soldiers sent to the soldiers was sent to the soldiers , &apos; if the mass of the crow@@ ds is more than three times resistance , let them down , &apos; it was said , according to the official document , which has seen a time @-@ time time , but what has not been given to local media media .
the Mo@@ st city of Ke@@ y Ko@@ to city of Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ us ( 56 ) felt threatened by threats and called for peace to be preserved , asking for a crow@@ d to go home .
nobody was willing to listen .
&apos;@@ Re@@ duc@@ ing me , I suddenly were shot into the left of the left , &apos; he said to the letter of time when it comes to the blood of the col@@ oured house in my German col@@ ours .
we still do not know who was fir@@ ing , but says that the soldiers of the soldiers gathered in the month came from .
&quot; the people had a lot , a lot of children , &apos; add to it &apos; .
the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w received his fire on the spot , saying three times .
&quot; I would like to ask him to be a body in his body , to make sure that it is her , &apos; said the time of a letter of syn@@ th@@ an@@ es &apos; , which is using a number of indicators , just one name , in the name of a large number of ag@@ glom@@ er@@ ations .
&quot; I saw that he is dead ... S@@ Innova@@ le@@ me . &apos;
the Chief inspe@@ ctor Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende said to repor@@ ters that his atta@@ chment to security of his or her mas@@ ters was only attacked .
&quot; we must protect ourselves if we are threatened by killing , &quot; said Vice @-@ President P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , the spokes@@ man of Papua police , in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ors were killed and many injured .
the news about killings was only at the next day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ wi Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ras had a passion@@ ate speech where he gave condolences to the families of the victims and was able to deal with the mis@@ treated abuses of the P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately , so that it will never happen again in the future , &apos; he said .
the Security Minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that it sets out an ADR mechanism to address human rights crimes .
however , almost as well as ex@@ cus@@ es .
&quot; most of the crimes took place long ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and the early 1990s .
it is about that we are committed to dealing with these crimes , but we must respect certain processes , &apos; said .
on 5 June , when speaking time , the W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , however , took his words back , saying that he has no intention of creating a P@@ pu@@ a mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything will be resolved according to the law &apos; .
the W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been accused by the UN in relation to the crimes of human rights in the wake of the bloody independence of over 1 000 people in East Timor 1999 , said that 11 human rights crime has already been resolved , including what happened in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ c have resis@@ ted such allegations .
&quot; I have been listening four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , &apos; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that there is still a fear for years .
&quot; I am afraid he says .
&quot; I fear that the army will arrest me , I fear that I am shot . &quot;
his bro@@ ther Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed the opinion that P@@ ani@@ a@@ i people are afraid of this incident .
he said that the army was beaten after it had helped four victims to bur@@ y the four victims .
&quot; after the bur@@ ying of the dead bodies , the army had to look at me , &apos; he says .
the changes have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Egyptian police shot in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ is , a neighbouring R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ance .
one person was killed and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , when it comes to the village of villages and the head of the construction company , who refused to have an un@@ conscious man from transport .
this man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ e@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ ps fish in a lo@@ ved river , died on the road to hospital .
the civilian population prote@@ sted at the site of the company &apos;s office .
according to the police , the people of villages were forced by stoning , which was followed by a warning shot .
however , in the local state , mobile phones ( Indon@@ esi@@ an Mili@@ tary police ) were shot at the people , killing one man .
&quot; we were a great panic , we are afraid of reven@@ ge , &apos; said 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who live near a hospital near the hospital and saw the in@@ se@@ ct in@@ sec@@ tici@@ des .
&quot; I have been beaten by two days in my own house . &quot;
the House of D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i has called for the prosecution of police officers to be held accountable and the withdrawal of police for the territory of the police .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ c has always been a problem for the Indon@@ esi@@ an Government .
the lack of meaningful development will feed into the dis@@ satisfaction of the honey , m@@ oni , dan@@ or and m@@ mal tri@@ bes living in Papua bad .
many of them have signed up to the army of Ib@@ erian movement ( V@@ PL ) , which protects the army of pa@@ ints , which , according to their own , is allowed to enjoy the rights of the Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers , and the abduc@@ tion of human kidna@@ ps by the Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers .
some of the leaders of the V@@ PL are from P@@ ani@@ a@@ u , including the Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , the army has been arrested by P@@ ani@@ a@@ is and had arbitrarily detained thousands of people during the pretext of protecting national sovereignty .
some of them will never appear again .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ des are known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty is fed by dis@@ satisfaction .
the lack of a ri@@ val , which is sold in the Mo@@ st , is too expensive for local authorities .
the Lei@@ p@@ ings will be the same .
people are growing their entire food , mainly at the ba@@ seline , as well as some fruit and vegetables .
farming is women &apos;s work , each of whom is able to care for four or five ba@@ il@@ ings .
they usually keep the majority of the harvest on the family , the rest to the local market .
ten years are paying only 10 000 Indon@@ esi@@ an sites ( 75 cents ) .
during the time , economic inequality has deepen@@ ed , and the emergence of new migrants , who have arrived at the opening of new airport routes in the N@@ ab@@ ire airport , which have arrived at the opening of new airports in the N@@ ab@@ ire airport .
these few jobs , which exist , are going to be better educated and more prosperous migrants .
the P@@ pu@@ a@@ des themselves often do not have capital or the necessary skills to confuse a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in the ice , because there are no jobs and no money , the President of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ bal Council , John Go@@ ba@@ i .
isolation is keeping the eyes of the world out of P@@ pu@@ alt .
in addition , strict restrictions on foreign media .
this year , P@@ ope was sent out by French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ bridge L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp , because they were not following the relevant practices , even though they had been given a rare film licence .
the Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch , P@@ com@@ m K@@ ine , said that it has not been implemented by Jo@@ co@@ wi electoral promises to promote transparency and development restrictions on reporting restrictions .
&quot; in Indonesia , the most Eastern provinces and the Western P@@ ope reports are threatening the new threats to the rejection of a visa @-@ entry and black list , &quot; said in a statement .
a lack of knowledge of the press means that international pressure to the government of Indonesia is largely confined to Papua near , with its immediate neighbours .
in March , six Pacific States were encouraged by the T@@ on@@ ga , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ valu , Mar@@ shall Islands and Sol@@ om@@ on Islands , the United Nations Human Rights Council to examine a wide range of serious crimes , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the same countries have also supported historically V@@ PL .
Mr Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , has level@@ led accusations of a group by saying J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas for journalists : &apos; Indonesia still applies democratic order and freedom of the press , so the evidence of human rights cases would be difficult to bur@@ y &apos; .
local people want more foreign governments to notice .
when the Dutch delegation , at the head of the state of the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , K@@ enn@@ ard Van B@@ tre@@ every 4 on 4 May , was interrupted by local people at the meeting , but the anon@@ ymous source said , in his silence , asking : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia 2019 new presidential elections will take place , but boats do not believe that they will vote in favour of Jo@@ co@@ wi .
&apos;@@ Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man with good intentions , but the people surrounding him who are involved in shooting the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i &apos; say &apos; The President of the Council &apos; , Ho@@ ba@@ i .
he wants to give the Jo@@ co@@ w@@ i understanding that , in addition to the fact that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are constantly living under the threat of a pre@@ da@@ tory army , they are bo@@ thered by poor education and health services .
according to Mr Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i must , as other boats , the voice of Jo@@ ko@@ w@@ en have been given a debt that has to be paid .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite the dis@@ var@@ ic@@ ation and intimidation , the families of the fire victims in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i were still in the last symb@@ oli@@ cally opposed to the death of one victim &apos;s kil@@ ler and the military de@@ priva@@ tion of the land to the land .
knowing that justice can never be put on foot , they will not at least allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
it came to Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch , a second time on his own .
on Friday , there had to be a single world of housing in Du@@ ba@@ i , which was the highest in the world , by forcing hundreds of people from this 3@@ 37 me@@ tre and 79 to fle@@ e .
this is the second fire that has been devastated by the high @-@ speed , which has been ra@@ va@@ ged in the Tu@@ ch@@ y , in the case of Tu@@ rin , in the course of two years .
in the evacu@@ ation of the building , any injuries were not reported and no direct fire will be found .
&quot; we have been s@@ lee@@ ping and wake up in the fires in sub @-@ Saharan people .
we would be lu@@ cky down and we took around 10 minutes from the last three times , &apos; said &apos; Re@@ u@@ ters &apos; , who mentioned himself in George George &apos; .
the fire @-@ fighters , according to Du@@ ba@@ i &apos;s civil defence officials , had to fire the fire @-@ fighters at around 4 o &apos;@@ clock this morning ( 00@@ 00 G@@ MT ) and ja@@ iled the building .
the government said that they are working on a shelter to those affected .
this incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used in the world &apos;s high @-@ level external soil .
during the investigation carried out by the Executive Board of the Tor@@ ch Board in Tor@@ ch , it was found that the most damage suffered in the event of a fa@@ Ã§@@ ade - an external area and isolation - was found to be the most affected .
the British police have said that they believe that the London G@@ ren@@ portfolio will be the isolation of the different isolation of the London G@@ ren@@ portfolio and has been able to contribute to the rapid spread of the fires in June , which killed around 80 people .
see : on telep@@ hon@@ y of these phones in the autumn
language and sy@@ ge@@ are have a high time for technological games , because then the phone manufacturers will make their new models of excellence .
in the spring , it came to a Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , as well as in the autumn in the autumn .
according to the C@@ 2 marketing and sale Director , I am characterised by the innovative design of flagship ships , the fast @-@ track s@@ oul , ser@@ ver @-@ servan@@ t 4@@ K , and the ultra @-@ fast processing process .
there was a high level of e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant in the world of Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , which has also reached the front page of the sale of Estonian smar@@ t@@ phones .
the autumn allows for a more ti@@ dal high @-@ speed lo@@ ads , a more resilient , high @-@ quality camer@@ as and greater water and water security .
he added that there can already be assumptions on the basis of the hearing and to predict the four model models that are likely to be con@@ qu@@ ered in the light of the streets .
these four smar@@ t@@ phone excellence will reach the shop in the autumn of this year .
the long @-@ awaited i@@ P@@ hone 8 and P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach boys in mid @-@ September .
the rum@@ ours of what the new Apple model , however , and what can be done , are spreading much .
if the i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not significantly increase the differences in the i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , then Apple &apos;s tenth birth@@ day will be expected that the new model will be fully respected .
there has been talk of four col@@ ours : black , white , ro@@ ck and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the whole of the phone , lost a co@@ cu@@ p and fingerprints have been built on screen scre@@ ens .
Apple &apos;s director J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve calls for the new P@@ hone model to appear like a glass .
there has also been talk of the i@@ P@@ hone version of the P@@ hone version .
in addition to the e@@ lep@@ h@@ er , the top @-@ off charging and a more quality camer@@ as can expect faster A@@ 11 processes .
it is certainly one year &apos;s expected smart phones .
a new model for a new model begins on 23 August .
there has been a lot of rum@@ ours which new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y are beginning to see .
Ad@@ mittedly , there is even more business @-@ to @-@ business users and the S will allow even greater fun@@ ction@@ alities .
the Tele@@ fon@@ t should have two camer@@ a , one of which is the la@@ x and the other with the same degree of view television .
at the moment , no one knows what the two gu@@ er@@ gs are able to be able , but in any case , it is the first test of the quality of quality , which is certainly comparable to the i@@ P@@ hone 8 @-@ ga .
however , we are waiting for 23 August .
while Nokia are in charge of selling three smar@@ t@@ phones in this year , Nokia , Nokia , are still missing from their flag - Nokia 8 , which are already being presented on 16 August .
we are looking forward to 5.@@ 3 @-@ dust scre@@ ens and ultra @-@ fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ nap@@ dra@@ g@@ is 8@@ 35 processes and a more resilient a@@ union .
Nokia also talked about alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and a significant degree of water and water security IP@@ 68 .
like Sam@@ su@@ ng@@ every , the new model of Nokia has two camer@@ a , which is opti@@ mised by a company Z@@ e@@ y .
if S@@ ony &apos;s firm flag has been to date X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smar@@ t@@ phones will be added in the near future , with more innovative functions .
we expect a smart phone that is slightly more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least the same good or better camer@@ as .
there is speculation on the new model that the screen is at least a hot one .
what the reality brings , we can see already the right thing , as traditionally the S@@ ony of S@@ ony has revealed the international technology at the international level that has been unve@@ iled by S@@ ony this year , which will take place this year .
according to the le@@ ak@@ ed le@@ aks , T@@ ru@@ mp Mexic@@ ans were pressed by the T@@ ru@@ mp carrier for the payment of the border wall .

on 27 January , T@@ ru@@ mp phones in Mexico went to the President of Mexico , Mr En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ ole , that it would stop public declaring that he does not intend to pay for the proposed threshold .
the President of America , in the wake of the public executions of the Wall , by believing : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ er set up his presidential campaign to build a long @-@ term American wall and the age of the United States of America to pay for this project .
it was also published in the first speech by the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l , which reveals the ten@@ se debate .
Mr T@@ ru@@ mp has said that the agreement , under which the United States of America takes the refugees to Australia , is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; stu@@ pid &apos; , claiming that an agreement that was made during the Obama Government would give him the impression that he has proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States .
T@@ ru@@ mp ended a speech by announcing Tur@@ ma@@ ma to say that &apos; this was the most un@@ pleasant speech &apos; .
the Court did not hold a complaint on the case of O@@ C MR@@ P in the case of the Republic of Tar@@ tu , which was rejected by the town of Tar@@ tu from July 2019 to 20@@ 29 .
it is a hand@@ ful of a letter which rejected the O@@ C MR@@ P in the supply of Tar@@ tu bus and coach vessels , as the supplier did not meet the requirements , the Tar@@ tu City Legal Service , Mr An@@ neli A@@ pu@@ tin .
this is a outs@@ ourcing of the city &apos;s intern@@ alisation of the supply of Tar@@ tu cities , in the period 0@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 @-@ 3@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .

the Court did not take this up .
although many people in the social media are complaining that the We@@ ek@@ y F@@ esti@@ val is disrup@@ ting their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are and the city of the driving force is full of the brak@@ es , there are also many of those who have no bad word in the middle of a lasting festi@@ val .
I am even positively surprised that the super@@ market would be the visa cour@@ tes@@ y !
I did not see any confusion and no cour@@ tes@@ y .
even the generosity I saw in &apos; is a dead wave .
&quot; that is all well , it is well @-@ known , and it is known to be the jo@@ y@@ ss , which is the winter of winter , it adds happily .
a wave of bul@@ lying in the do@@ se of R@@ ann@@ a is not a disgrace .
when he is still living in a city in the middle of a city , it is not yet more music to have arrived at his home .
&quot; however , I hope that I will say &apos; yes &apos; .
there is also talk about the Ag@@ nes Ag@@ nes that the F@@ esti@@ val is a good thing for the Per@@ rer , it will be a good contribution to the VAT of local merchan@@ ts .
in addition , it is pleased that the summer capital will have so@@ wn so many pain@@ ting .
the woman of Pe@@ ol@@ his@@ s is not a woman .
although I am no longer in the ran@@ k , but it is nice that rand has revi@@ ved .
and it is good that the people are moving and it is already three times , a woman says .
in the first case , I think it was somewhat worse .
&apos;@@ The@@ y , perhaps , he was wondering .
however , what is happening in the ran@@ k is the norm for the capital cities , according to the summer capital .
&quot; this We@@ ek@@ y is a very good pro@@ mo for our small town , &quot; talks on the par@@ asi@@ te Har@@ ri Charter .
M@@ life and m@@ Ã¶@@ ll have not been hit by his el@@ da@@ y@@ cle .
but for that ?
we should all keep together .
the way in which it would be better to communicate between ethnic matters .
after all , the music man is not going to be .
that is not the case , although I live close to there .
&apos;@@ Wel@@ l people are able to keep together and there is no pa@@ int &apos; , it speaks .
the gu@@ es@@ ts coming from the winter have said that you are visas .
&quot; with the bot@@ tles they are , of course , a little exagg@@ erated , but young people are young people and the iss@@ ance - please go , but be people and we can start ! &apos; says .
the he@@ igh@@ ty people have travelled to a time for the time , whether or not to relatives or to know .
&quot; however , in general , the F@@ esti@@ val will have a positive impact on people like this me@@ ag@@ re , talk about children with children as a Ti@@ ina .
the s@@ tern of his family , too , is not a disappointment , even though this House last year even further go to this street .
last summer , it was the case that we heard more .
we are living in a city outside the city that , in fact , there is a lot in the middle of the bot@@ tle of the river , it talks about it .
Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts to more than 3 000 jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revita@@ lise business
the British education company Pe@@ ar@@ son said Friday that more than 3 000 jobs are still being cut and reduces the percentage of its intermediate dividen@@ ds by a reduction of 72 % , by launching a further restructuring programme to tackle the challenge of the business .
the jobs that are being constructed , which are more likely to be used by the CE@@ O , John F@@ all@@ on , are likely to be at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , with a loss of 4 000 posts during the previous restructuring process .
Mr Pe@@ ar@@ son has announced in May a plan to cut costs of GBP 300 million in expenditure under the third programme reduction programme ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) , in order to try to revive business that has been hit hard by the swit@@ ch@@ over to digital learning .
the company agreed last month with the participation of the company in Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om &apos;s own partner companies in the Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann House , said that their expectation in relation to the year has not changed since the EUR 2.@@ 05 billion increase in the first half of the year in the first half of the year .

Con@@ vo@@ ir@@ attack K@@ abu@@ l : suicide attacks on NATO soldiers
the bom@@ ber attack on the capital of Afghanistan , K@@ abu@@ l , was a military con@@ voy in K@@ abu@@ l , killing one NATO soldi@@ er and a number of you .
in the NATO statement , it was said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
in Kin@@ ni@@ un@@ ted local reports , there were three civilians in the town of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi , which took place in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi .
this bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ment is the last acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , a mos@@ que attack on more than 30 people was killed .
on Monday two people were killed in K@@ abu@@ l , close to the emb@@ assy in K@@ abu@@ l .
the NATO statement said that the explosion of Thursday afternoon took place when a joint pat@@ ro@@ l was attacked by man @-@ made explo@@ sive rem@@ nan@@ ts of man . &quot;
according to the statement , all injured have been in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital in Bag@@ h@@ m .
according to the respondents , the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( in the case of the Islamic Republic ) , are a serious source of concern for the forces of the NATO forces in Bag@@ ra@@ mis in Bag@@ ra@@ mis .
according to the UN , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , with around 20 % of the capital in the capital .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l was killed mainly at least 30 people in K@@ abu@@ l .
the Taliban said that they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , a large bomb attack on the centre of the centre is more than 150 people - that is the most pressing military attack in the country since the US @-@ led US troops s@@ ounded by the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , President of the United States , will consider whether the country &apos;s military and police forces are to be helped to increase the number of US troops .
according to the figures , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also led to a government of confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , of President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
following the closure of the EPA , following the postponement of the summer Regulation
the United States &apos; Environment Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA ) has cancelled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama @-@ time regulation , which obliges states to limit their emissions , one day after the 15 state compla@@ ined to court due to this process .
the EPA announced a decision to continue the procedure for determining the content of the &apos; buy @-@ out &apos; in 2015 , by saying that it shows the commitment of the Agency to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we need to have a dialogue with our state partners and listen to them , &quot; said the President of the EPA , the Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t statement .
Mr P@@ ru@@ it@@ t has announced the intention of the meeting in June to postpone the definition of the content of the ozone content with a view to measuring pollution in different parts of the country in order to determine where the standard of air quality should be reduced by one year until 2018 in order to meet the standard of air quality .
in combination with the C@@ olum@@ bia Department , the 15 mainly democratic states put action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
the government of President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations imposed by the former President Barack Obama , according to the fact that it is part of a more comprehensive plan for growth @-@ building .
however , these efforts have created reactions among the democrats and the natural groups , who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website says that the brea@@ th@@ ening of air pollution &apos; can reduce the labour capacity of the Cop@@ ts and increase the risk of a res@@ pira@@ tory disease &apos; , such as as@@ th@@ ma .

we are bringing you in the gallery , with all the images that have been tried by the photo@@ graph@@ er of our photo@@ graph@@ er three days in our photo@@ graph@@ ers .
you are certainly also in some of them , by ot@@ h itself !
the first time will be discussed by Mr Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko .
V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ ul@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should be on a col@@ lisi@@ on in order to face up to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ les in the ES@@ P@@ N office in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ les , as long as Gar@@ cia , the winner of the World Bo@@ un@@ ch champi@@ ons , leg@@ alised corridor second , to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ co@@ t , the World Bo@@ in@@ ner sul@@ g@@ weigh@@ ch car@@ tel .
as a result of the unanimous decision by the Gar@@ cia , the last day @-@ to @-@ day world champion , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er , both mili@@ tants are considered to be the front page of the front page of the front line .
Mr Gar@@ cia gave a better hand and said : &apos; how do you go , the champion is ?
I wish you success . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko will protect his bel@@ ts by Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga against 19 ES@@ P@@ N in a Saturday evening .
if a couple of photo@@ graph@@ s , the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko moun@@ tains , E@@ g Kli@@ mas , said that it would be possible to have a &apos; perfect test &apos; between comb@@ at@@ ants .
&quot; I am former sul@@ tative , &quot; recalled Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I have been called on to Mr B@@ ron@@ er &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am a little about 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move below the weight .
and he needs to move towards a qu@@ ib@@ ble &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the F@@ Ã¤n@@ s have wanted this .
let us say that . &quot;
the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
the issue raised the question of whether it should be worthwhile to look at it ; it is part of its strategy that he wants to allow the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to be re@@ orientation to the end of this year , in order to make it possible for the next summer to be able to meet Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ ses ) , who also have an interest in the fight against Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ li , following the light of the sur@@ rec@@ ess of their 23 September this year .
&quot; the review of this fight could be a reward because the f@@ ans have wanted this confrontation , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , saying later that he is open to fighting any channel that offers the best financial package .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name will be able to attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
the Gar@@ cia said that he must be a &apos; force &apos; for the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ co@@ t and can look at his des@@ k on his des@@ k .
however , the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was modest in pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia , saying that he thought the three tri@@ alogues originating from the Ri@@ ver@@ pool was a very slow one , and I am sorry , Mr M@@ lon@@ y ... you wanted it to be &apos; very slow &apos; .
the Gar@@ cia said that it was the intention to show strength and then to po@@ t .
both confirmed that they feel the way in which the tension is growing .
&quot; this is the fight that awa@@ its the realisation .
no other confron@@ ta@@ tional situation will cause such attention and min@@ de@@ dness .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters and the M@@ ic@@ y is just that .
this is a good fight . &quot;
what is going to be moved from the world &apos;s do@@ gs to Estonia ?
it extended and issued a record of more than 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who are mostly from Estonia to work , study or family in the field of police and border guards .
if , for example , the soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit to issue 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreign , then the figure was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the agencies cannot say how much immigrants eventually remain in Estonia , but this analysis will be drawn up at the Ministry of the Interior .
in the past ten years ago , around 500 Ukrainians per year in Estonia , the figure in the last few years is coming up to 2 000 .
the number of applicants for authorisation increased expon@@ enti@@ ally during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014 , a fixed @-@ term residence permit ( 10@@ 87 people ) , a year of 6@@ 75 .
with the statistical office , we will have the highest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens died in Estonia , and more than one .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been very high in Estonia , and because of difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that the work and learning opportunities are being sought in a country where the community and many of the families are already entitled to , in the Ministry of the Interior , Kris@@ tin Ram@@ mus .
the soil and the soil were a higher , even more than the number of citizens of Russia , even though the number of fixed @-@ term residence permits issued in 10 years will be the highest in the last year .
if Ukrainians come to work here , Russia &apos;s citizens will be on the basis of family migration .
&quot; given this historic Russian community , they are also most likely to have the most family ties with the people living in Russia , &quot; said the Ministry of Defence of the Home Department in Hel@@ ina Me@@ use .
&quot; if the Russian citizens who have been able to reside in a residence permit have been to live in a transplant , Har@@ t@@ land is now in East Vir@@ g@@ land , he added , and pointed out that around 40 % of them are mar@@ ried in the European Union &apos;s citizens .
the Mul@@ ti @-@ term residence permit ( 16@@ 96 / 11 ) , which is also a record number of fixed @-@ term residence permits .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit was reduced .
&apos;@@ Hy@@ pe is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested for a permanent residence permit &apos; , &quot; explained by the Ministry of the Interior at the Ministry of the Interior , Ram@@ on , who said that the interest of Russian citizens has remained stable for years after a residence permit .
in order to build a lasting residence permit permanently , at least three years will be able to apply for foreign applicants at least three years .
the aim is to encourage the attra@@ ction of people who have adapted to it .
however , a long @-@ term resident residence permit requires five years .
an extension of the old residence permit has probably been reduced by a new residence permit .
for example , soil was granted a residence permit for the 146 Ukrainians who have been working for at least three years here .
now the Ukrainians will be able to change their work and the Estonian state will no longer be pointing the finger at whether the pay criterion has been met .
this residence permit was a pan@@ ac@@ ea for the s@@ le@@ ep , the right of the holder of a bad passport ( 10@@ 29 ) , the Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , indi@@ um ( 54 ) and n@@ ig@@ er@@ ans ( 36 ) .
the 19@@ 68 people , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 g@@ rub@@ b@@ ine and the same as the Chinese , were able to live in Estonia for a residence permit .
this year , the total number of applicants is already 12@@ 69 .
in 10 years , Nigeria has become a surprise to the country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for the residence permit .
if three residency permits were issued in 2007 , the bub@@ ble was 200 .
there is a lesson to be learned from Nigeria to university .
the Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among the Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has largely increased thanks to the family .
for them too , the rule is that where there is a community that has arisen , there will be a more simple place for others , in addition to the question .
in the ten years , two people have also gone into Estonia , for example , from North Korea , as many La@@ o@@ ka and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four U@@ ru@@ guay .
if a year &apos;s residence permit is around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals , it is about 0.@@ 46 per cent of the total population .
even if the citizens of the European Union are concerned , migration is about per cent of &apos; , &apos; commented on the way in which the numbers are , in fact , small .
in total , according to the statistical office , 14 8@@ 22 people , from Estonia , have been in Estonia , hence 13 7@@ 92 .
this means that immigration has exceeded the second year .
most of the and in@@ ward @-@ ups are Estonian citizens , but more are among those leaving them .
it was therefore in the mine of Estonia &apos;s citizens in terms of the protection of the migration of its citizens .
Est@@ oni@@ ans are particularly emig@@ rating in Finland and Estonia .
Mr M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture Pr@@ inc@@ ess of the Naz@@ is , thi@@ ev@@ es and t@@ we@@ ets
however , in the north of the North West , Maria Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u , however , has history - old pa@@ int@@ ings and defen@@ dants : &quot; I can dream of a muse@@ um somewhere in the muse@@ um , and the old @-@ old theft and c@@ ables .
if you look at something like you , and learn about it every day .
that is the disco@@ very !
a long @-@ term world of C@@ ou@@ ture may seem to be a few living , but the de@@ sig@@ ner do not think so .
you yourself decide how much your lives are !
as a friend , I am a friend of mine , who is full of my ha@@ ts from cou@@ pling in my own .
because it is not his fault , it does not live in the Hol@@ ly@@ wood and does not go on the red al every day , he wants them to shoulder the most beautiful bro@@ kers and suffer !
you will live in a special life for their lives .
the Mo@@ e@@ artificial ar@@ tist does not recognise the gap between the bri@@ lli@@ ant events and the black day .
this is the reasoning that led to the plan to bring in the countryside in Estonia , the forests and fields between the people , the people who often do not reach the people .
for example , a comparison was presented , for example , in the spirit of J@@ air and the University of Be@@ au@@ vis , where 45 mo@@ del@@ l King met the whole street in the street .
in Tallinn , it is often han@@ ged in a young person , but elsewhere , there is more emo@@ tion - s@@ log@@ ans , rising stand up , want to thank you .
a large part of the audience came from the news , but now they are in M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture .
if you hear the expectations of the people , they are enthusiastic .
and I like this feeling that I am in my mo@@ tive with the summer winter .
Mr Barnier , we had a red car@@ pet of 50 metres , the whole street long @-@ distance stic@@ kers , it seemed that they did not end up !
Maria Damanaki does not recognise the mo@@ tive that the creation of a animal must be presented with a super@@ ficial super@@ ficial , it will be happy to bring the ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always been happy .
that is the case of the experience , the island of the ice @-@ pic@@ king process !
I am so sorry that I have never seen my role , always behind me , and I am afraid to give a gli@@ m@@ mer of the last meat .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow me to look cal@@ mly .
Mrs Maria is this kind of fashi@@ on@@ able , who does not just want to play a representative role , but to be able to be involved in everything .
I have my own sis@@ ter machine , most of the colle@@ ctions .
I like the whole process , where you have the details , discover you .
I am never far from my animal and I am not afraid of work .
the only thing is not confined to the style , logistics , logistics , organisation , organisation , all the day @-@ to @-@ one @-@ tem@@ per@@ ous woman &apos;s day .
these working hours are still huge .
I will not be able to say when my day ends , for me it is just a day full of joy !
I have been very lu@@ cky - it is like an un@@ ce@@ me@@ able fortune : I am doing something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compli@@ ments .
several times it has been said that my bro@@ kers are in the countryside - they are put to feel like a printing .
the gu@@ ise of sa@@ tu@@ ration , which Maria talent overnight has made , has long been a signal of the M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture sign@@ alling .
Mr Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p U@@ 18 boys , as a weapon of anch@@ or of Est@@ oni@@ ans , now turned to our door .
it is a pity that the fair@@ y@@ tale was run out .
the first thing was that we did not get the table .
and if there is a great difference in the table , there is nothing to do with the exception of the 6@@ 18 cor@@ ps of Estonia : 75 in the UK , the only thing that has played a cor@@ rup@@ tor in the United Kingdom , Mr Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p , Mr M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p .
anti @-@ terrorist attacks were attacked by 28 Pal@@ ace and received so many more attacks .
we were also not prepared to defend their aggressive defence and attack , it created .
many of the attacks by the young children ended up in three to five seconds , we were not able to build protection .
however , they were in defence of all the hand , but we could not be combined .
it created a team from the sho@@ es .
the homeless work was better done .
the M@@ y@@ r@@ sey estimates that Estonia would have to do more tac@@ tical errors in order to take up the momentum in the b@@ ud .
the latter quarter - we had a mistake , but the opponents have already received a number of rapid repetition .
the in@@ adequacy and close pressure that was al@@ ag@@ re with our weapon , now all of us , now have all of us .
today , we had no force against them .
the ba@@ seline remained to be satisfied with its neg@@ ligence , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s .
the Tur@@ ks generally can say good words about the whole team , to date a united s@@ oul .
it is a pity that , in the past , there was not already before .
the time has been a self @-@ confident and played out in the streets , but it seemed that he was ti@@ red - he has carried a very large burden .
however , he made a very fine move in some of the things that I have seen in the past , as I have seen in the past , in the Annex .
the terrible figures : stu@@ m@@ bled by the E@@ M @-@ Tur@@ ner in two fewer than 10 points ...
in the age of U@@ 18 , it is not just the case of young men B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on at the mer@@ cy of the &apos; B &apos; , and , in Tallinn , he started the day before in Dublin .
however , the anti @-@ Polish game , unfortunately , is in the area of anti@@ qu@@ ity .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , the state was 9 : 49 , or only the last ten minutes , opponents of a sho@@ es and the period left all 16 : 16 .
both in the first and the second quarter , Estonia &apos;s 4 , third point ...
in this regard , the first two minutes have been struck by the pro@@ tag@@ on@@ ship , but there are 25 pieces of the game , but there are 25 pieces of the game , then one of the tri@@ alogues and then 21 to wait ...
in almost half an hour , 47 remained one of the dar@@ k@@ op@@ ts .
in addition , 2 points had to be found in four NGOs .
the number of losses was a reasonable figure , 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland was set up by 33 % and Estonia 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , on the day of opening up to 83 : 56 on the right to Portugal .
NATO vessels coming to Tallinn
today , on 1 December , NATO has arrived at a scheduled port visit to Tallinn , in order to complement the stocks of ships and prepare for pre @-@ presu@@ med habits .
during the visit to the sea , ships are preparing for the sea , giving them the possibility of a pa@@ pal holiday holiday .
after the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of habits and be prepared for the future of historic explo@@ sive rem@@ nan@@ ts .
&quot; the participation of children in the NATO body and the combination of operational training in local waters is clearly illustrated by our integration with the allies &apos; , &quot; said the operation and planning of the naval fleet in the capacity of the maritime fleet in the capacity and planning team in the field of the G@@ over@@ ning fleet , &quot; said N@@ ex@@ t Rein@@ maa .
since 29 June , NATO &apos;s Chief armed Forces of NATO will be chaired by G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , who took over @-@ group tasks from the Estonian naval officers at the ceremony at the ceremony in Ri@@ Riga at a ceremony in the country in Riga .
the flag of the group is designated by the Latvian naval force , L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , which will also operate a group of leaders .
this semester is also part of the International unit of Estonia in the wake of the Estonian naval force .
one of the four groups of NATO naval forces under NATO &apos;s naval force is a permanent one @-@ stop @-@ off unit in NATO , a unit of primary speed , which could be sent to various places in the world during the course of five days .

this is a festi@@ val , which is going to take power and will never be confused again .
because the experience that lis@@ tens to the hearing and the my@@ ste@@ rious environment , human s@@ oul is b@@ righ@@ ted and is concerned with human beings in the way that cannot be described .
the first year of the threat by the arts leader of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
did the sho@@ es of the es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ las@@ kin have not been seen as a little bit ?
of course , as I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been a lot of help .
I am in favour of the whole of my student career and also supported a career at the beginning of the revised career .
perhaps it is thanks to me that it is easier for me to continue his work .
in the different K@@ las , there has been a great deal of good and , of course , that has been carried out by the F@@ esti@@ val of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
it was excellent to join the team who knows how things go .
it has also been a great heart to me , Mr K@@ ards , in the city of Tallinn , which took good progress in the city of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
and here I am now and I can start !
what would be to be brought to the audience at the festi@@ val of today , which you offer special offer ?
we have the first mus@@ ici@@ ans , from Latvia , Lithuania , Lithuania and surprise , to the front line , written by Astrid L@@ ind@@ gren &apos;s cheese .
&apos;@@ Kar@@ l@@ sson l@@ ds &apos; .
and one of the no@@ torious nu@@ ances at this point is that it was the author of this bal@@ l@@ las , Mr Kar@@ l@@ au , the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser , who himself expressed a desire to write it .
he has already lived in a s@@ oul of Kar@@ l@@ sson , who has already lived in a s@@ oul .
to the risk of how you do everything ?
thanks to my support of life , I certainly will .
this work needs to be based on a system of love and a lot of love , and it is fortuna@@ te that I have a huge amount of love .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tion is not dependent on the rest of the people , as I do not know how I am going to go against every new day .
and that being aware of the tone , keeping the positive sense and , in fact , laugh@@ ing itself into the mir@@ ror , we made a significant increase in my happ@@ iness .
this week , in particular , when it is the most important test , I am particularly keen to have practised and work .
the na@@ ming of the activist will be dra@@ gged down and then increases the tone .
it is not just a word .
I think that people do not yet know the things that the univer@@ se offers to them , but it is a little for everyone to do so slowly .
immediately , it is an important moment .
is there any kind of ri@@ tual before the sin@@ k of di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di ?
it is still ri@@ d@@ den to switch to more convenient reception .
this is a small moment for itself .
however , in general , I do not have the opportunity to make a little difference , or to make a little goat .
in fact , I even like to engage actively with people , even before the di@@ r@@ ty pul@@ led took place .
but come to all the F@@ esti@@ val of Bir@@ git@@ ta , there is also a great deal of self @-@ oper@@ ability and a friend !

publication of new findings of the age assessment of Swedish asylum seekers
in Sweden , there was a series of asylum seekers , which assessed their age with an innovative approach to medical exa@@ min@@ ations , showing that more than 80 per cent of the old Member States were considered to be more than 18 % , but not all of the specifications of the results .
the Swedish National Institute of medicine ( R@@ ele@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started with tests on this year .
the tests were set up during the first application of the age of retirement , following the fact that they have not managed to correctly define the retirement age for many allegedly juven@@ i@@ les of minors .
to date , the &quot; Mig@@ ran@@ s@@ ver@@ ket &quot; has sent the test of 80 80 cases and the Institute of medical medicine , between the middle of March 2017 , has issued a total of 24 81 test results by the middle of March 2017 .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) assessed the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Institute of medicine and the Institute for Health in the case of 25 cases , so that the test &quot; can be 18 @-@ year or old &quot; .
the 4@@ 32 cases concluded that man is probably a younger than 18 .
the tests will only be used if the age of man is questioned .
the results of the O@@ medicine Institu@@ tional Joh@@ an GÃ¶@@ rans@@ son report are consistent with those of previous months .
&apos;@@ We do not see a great difference from the statistics in previous months , the figures are quite consistent , &apos; said the Local .
it is not necessarily the case that a large proportion of the cases were evaluated than 18 , that does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been able to have their age .
the Institute was issued in May in the test of 581 , and said that 4@@ 42 cases &apos; are references to the fact that the person who is studying is 18 years old or the parent &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson , Mrs Li@@ bla@@ det investigated the results of these 581 tests , was found that 2@@ 43 was in fact , in the case of 18 people who have said that it will be 18 .
the method of assessing the age of medical age , during which there will be c@@ r@@ Ã¨@@ ches and dis@@ gust at MR@@ L , and then they are being thrown into a too@@ th@@ less medical analysis , have been criticised in some circles .
one of the sceptics is Mr Mar@@ cus , who is among the endo@@ vis@@ h@@ ment of the H@@ aro@@ lina Institute , whose work is the evaluation of people &apos;s maturity in order to find out whether they were carried out earlier , or later on .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measuring method currently used should be used .
the designation of biological age in such a way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say firmly , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he &apos; said the Met@@ ro .
however , the Institute of medicine in Joh@@ an GÃ¶@@ rans@@ son has defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , the risk of dis@@ posing a child &apos;s in@@ accurate life is low .
perhaps around 10 % of the risk is where the person is a little less than 18 .

Mr Co@@ e praised honest apolo@@ gies for the Russians following the anti @-@ doping channel
the international r@@ allies of Ker@@ ge@@ on in S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e were praised by his words &apos; Russia &apos; on Thursday , but it reiterated that it is not time to allow sport to be allowed to be returned .
on the eve of the International Council on the eve of the International Council on the eve of the World C@@ up on the eve of the Great C@@ up , Russia has said that the ban on the country &apos;s entry ban is right and is determined to fight against doping .
he apolog@@ ises &apos; all of the ligh@@ ti@@ tudes &apos; , who have been thrown away by the gol@@ den and sil@@ ver bul@@ let . &quot;
in spite of his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of leaving the ban on entry into force , which was established in November 2015 after the report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) provided evidence of a country &apos;s spon@@ sorship in Russia .
&quot; in my opinion , this was a very honest answer , a very honest presentation , &apos; Mr Co@@ e journalists &apos; , the President of the IAEA , said .
&quot; the whole Council and Congress were satisfied that Russia was also recognised that they had quite complex times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Union . &quot;
he said , in addition , that he was happy to accept the criteria for ad@@ mitting Russia .
&apos;@@ I believe that it was a very constructive day and progress is taking place , but Congress supports the proposal for a group that is not the right time to withdraw Russia &apos;s return , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we have to do everything possible in the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want to be honest ath@@ le@@ tes to separate the system , &apos; Annex he &apos; .
Eigh@@ teen of the second Russian le@@ c@@ ture@@ rs , which meet the strict criteria of the IA@@ F , are competing with neutral sports ath@@ le@@ tes in London on Friday in London .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Group , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of criteria for forecas@@ ting .
following the presentation by the IA@@ AF to the Council , he said in London that doping is still insufficient and the techni@@ ci@@ ans who have received a ban are still free .
the revolution in electric cars makes a significant difference to the demand of metals .
who is the winners and losers ?
little of the fact that the revolution in electric cars makes a significant difference to the fuel market , up to infrastructure , creates new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although the mining companies like G@@ len@@ core can say that one place they win and lose , then smaller mining companies will not help .
at the moment , G@@ len@@ core coal and oil are currently serving , but in the age of electric cars , there is a growing number of co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ kel .
this year , the decisions of the United Kingdom , France and Norway , which will allow us to ban fossil fuels on the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades .
therefore , Vol@@ vo scientists have already informed that they intend to abandon the internal combustion engine and the T@@ es@@ la will bring the market more cheap@@ ly to the market .
B@@ animal berg , according to the New Energy Finance forecasts , is already sold over two decades of cars using electric cars more than oil produced over the two decades .
&quot; in some parts of the metals , it will make all this &apos; , &apos; said Capital of Economics of raw materials , Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ in B@@ animal ber@@ g .
we have already seen a great deal of influence on metals such as co@@ balt and li@@ thi@@ um , which have increased for years .
the electric car is about three times more than the ordinary car , the G@@ len@@ core announced the G@@ len@@ core .
more answers are needed at the char@@ gers , which is why the Ex@@ ur B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that this will increase the demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ gan@@ ese demand .
G@@ len@@ core can be generated from rising electricity from electric cars and that it is the world &apos;s largest producer of co@@ balt , the forecast J@@ eff@@ bies Group .
it estimates that the winning electric car will be won by F@@ bet@@ e @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and the first @-@ time Qu@@ an@@ tum Min@@ er@@ als .
the market is already responding to the changing trend .
this year , 70 % of the fish caught in the me@@ tal stock in London .
the price increase was 37 % .
this year , too , there are 14 % of this year &apos;s calendar , mainly due to growth .
the G@@ len@@ core excise unit rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the ri@@ val in Rio T@@ into Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ li@@ oni and Ang@@ lo , in the case of B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ li@@ oni and Ang@@ lo .
on the side of Ka@@ o@@ makers , companies are engaged in lead , like Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine , who must adapt to a new era .
the main final use of the P@@ li@@ i is the start of the start @-@ up of petrol and diesel cars , the gar@@ ages .
electric cars are used by u@@ tilities .
&quot; this is a serious risk for demand , except for the purpose of finding a other purpose that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said the Chairman of the Bank of America of America by Michael W@@ id@@ mer Lyn@@ ch , Chairman of the Bank of America .
in the form of the price of the P@@ li@@ i price movements , there is not yet a dis@@ gus@@ ting effect .
it is 17 per cent this year , with the best methane me@@ tal in London among the main industrial metals in London .
investors are only seeing problems in the future in the future .
&quot; I am not sure that this will be so bad , as cheap oil will keep ordinary cars in competition &apos; , said M@@ wi@@ g Schmidt in the light of the sale of metal@@ lic bro@@ ker Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ si in the light of the sale of metals .
if lead is to fall , it will be slow .
it may be the case in some ten years .
meanwhile , more stringent standards of exha@@ ust gases mean that the demand for hybrid cars is growing , which is more dependent on the deployment of lead @-@ based a@@ xes in the run @-@ up to engines , an international lead and an organisation of research .
Ker@@ g@@ me@@ tal , like alu@@ mini@@ um replacement , is replaced by a car that can go beyond electricity .
in this context , an additional EUR 1.6 million tonnes of lower minimum demand will be available until 2013 .
this represents 2.7 % of the total world of alu@@ mini@@ um .
it is likely that this trend is getting worse , the W@@ id@@ mer .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um is the 13 % this year , as the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to the market deficit .
the steel manufacturers do not .
the blockade will work together with General Motors to use nan@@ o @-@ technology to produce light bul@@ lets .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and the S@@ en Europe are trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ ting of steel in order to withstand the lower minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be a response to this development , &quot; said B@@ N@@ P Paris , Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
there is some success in Europe .
the end of the oil age can also lead to a pla@@ in@@ um .
it took around half of this precious me@@ tal act as a catalyst for diesel cars , announced by the me@@ tal re@@ fin@@ ery Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ ta .
&quot; many of the high demand for raw materials such as oil and pla@@ tin@@ es may not be a major demand in the future , &quot; said Na@@ ti@@ x@@ ourselves , the raw materials analy@@ tics , Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole are becoming less important , but their importance is becoming 15 years .
the Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ makers believe continued demand for hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous hy@@ ste@@ ria .
Mr Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , leader of the Un@@ core , said that in 2025 , more hybrid cars will continue to be sold into hybrid cars .
the great hope of the Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ makers of 10 years in the perspective of 10 years is To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ se@@ i Mo@@ to@@ si , based on hydrogen elements based on a pla@@ in@@ um that to produce electricity from hydrogen .
so far , however , this technology has not yet justified itself in business .
&apos;@@ Di@@ ally seems to have a clear chaos on the road to electric cars &apos; , said Ex@@ cel@@ len@@ ess B@@ N@@ P Pari@@ bas@@ k Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers received a major set@@ back in July , as S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art &apos;s court in a ban on the use of diesel was banned by Mr GarcÃ­a @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e home@@ town .
EU Financial rules on the transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the uncontrolled spending of European football clubs will not prevent the world record transition from the Spanish football clubs to the Barcelona club Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences for the UEFA , governing body , governing the European game and in which we can ban teams from the pres@@ ti@@ gious League of Me@@ ters to participate , are waiting for the Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ May to be before .
the financial rules for fair play in 2011 ( F@@ F@@ P ) mean that the PS@@ G needs to demonstrate at some time that Mrs Ney@@ mar@@ i &apos;s transition was funded without a huge damage .
to Barcelona , EUR 2@@ 22 million was paid out of EUR 2@@ 22 million alone for the Brazili@@ ans to buy their contract and the salary of dozens of dollars per year will go to tens of millions of dollars per year .
here , there are some aspects of the transfer of French clubs to France .
the PS@@ G is undoubtedly possible for the recruitment of Ms Ney@@ mar@@ ry and to include this kind of money , given that the team is funded by the government of the S@@ tar &apos;s power station .
they have been allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players , but they need to balance this legal income with those of a football company , which will allow them to come out of a football pit@@ ch .
F@@ F@@ P has laid the foundations for Michel Pla@@ tini after he was elected as President of the UEFA President in 2007 .
this former French player , in which the clubs , who are in the search of a large debt , are actually dealing with fraud and risk buying when banks or owners should renoun@@ ce their support .
since 2011 , F@@ F@@ P clubs will focus on monitoring their losses .
this change means that the business model , the Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch , first of all in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ b@@ ric@@ s , was able to buy a club with a potential , and then to make huge costs to make the team better and to create a global brand - it is harder to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period , which runs until 2018 , the clubs will have to carry out the losses of up to EUR 30 million .
and despite the fact that Pla@@ tini was dis@@ credi@@ ted by the presidential office in 2015 , his UEFA &apos;s successor to Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in is still un@@ impe@@ ded to prevent over@@ spending .
&apos;@@ F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules &apos; , &apos; said last week &apos; The associated P@@ pres@@ su@@ es &apos; , Mr Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is the advis@@ er of F@@ F@@ P concessions .
although the PS@@ G clause for the over@@ purchase clause of Mrs Ney@@ mar@@ i , it will be possible to distribute this amount to the full duration of the entire agreement for the purpose of the entire treaty .
Mrs Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it is possible to demonstrate a transitional fee of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
for the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga , consisting of Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , became the most severely punish@@ ments .
the PS@@ G was set at EUR 60 million ( at this point 82 million dollar ) , which was reduced later to EUR 20 million , and a club was required to limit the team of Me@@ asures for the 2014 @-@ 2015 season , rather than 25 to 21 players .
UEFA is looking for a club who could try to over@@ turn the financial institutions , blow@@ ing its income through companies connected with the owners of the club .
the company &apos;s company may be spon@@ sored by the PS@@ G , but if spon@@ sorship value is considered to be standard market rates , UEFA would not allow this formal income to be taken into account .
in 2014 , in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar tourism has been inf@@ lated by the PS@@ G .
it has been said that some sections of the PS@@ G services can come from the three @-@ year @-@ of @-@ EU C@@ up for the Management Committee of the World C@@ up .
however , the PS@@ G and Ka@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ mar@@ ra could become a world champi@@ on@@ ship Ambassador , and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulators are capable of col@@ lating such a manoeuv@@ ring .
the penalties imposed before the PS@@ G mean that UEFA is still more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
people who are familiar with the situation have spoken on Thursday that UEFA has not considered a precautionary approach to the changeover of the PS@@ G .
they talked about The associated P@@ pres@@ ga , provided that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , because they have no chance of discussing the situation in the PS@@ C .
the latest reports show that the PS@@ G 2015 @-@ 2016 will be more than EUR 10 million for a total of around â¬ 54@@ 2.4 million in turnover .
the data of the last financial year have not yet been published .
the PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Mrs Ney@@ mar@@ i on a well @-@ spon@@ sorship transaction , to trade and to sales of s@@ wa@@ thes .
the club looks at at least 30 per cent growth in the agreement .
the Spanish too , having clearly upset the departure of one of the largest football sta@@ rs , sought to prevent the move by claiming that the PS@@ G is in breach of this F@@ F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with a club and a country , &quot; said La li President Javier T@@ eb@@ as , in the case of the Spanish newspaper , referring to the fact that the PS@@ G is primarily part of the Q@@ a@@ tar .
the Ar@@ sen@@ al moun@@ ta@@ er of Ar@@ sen@@ al W@@ en@@ ger , whose club belongs to the American sports mag@@ na@@ te , shares the attitude that the country will fund a club .
&quot; this is a consequence of property rights and it has changed completely the entire football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to a country , everything can be done .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules for fair play , since the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a major player . &quot;

secret be@@ aches : night @-@ cleaning work and poor coast@@ line
the cold summer il@@ ls also mean lower harves@@ ts in the city of Tallinn .
&quot; if there is no , people are in the ran@@ k , and if there is no , there are no people , it is also a be@@ er .
S@@ tro@@ om , in S@@ tro@@ om , is pre@@ da@@ tory .
they offer a tra@@ ctor in the low @-@ me@@ chan@@ ical competition , a tra@@ ctor that la@@ gs behind the pla@@ in@@ um of tri@@ cks .
in fact , the last seven cent of me@@ tre of deep @-@ sea@@ ted sand over the last seven @-@ me@@ tre will be turned out of the sea and people left behind : sin@@ ks , cigarette pac@@ ks and other .
people are still going to face , regardless of whether water is so@@ e or not .
if there is a beau@@ ty , people are in the ran@@ k , and if there is no , there are no people , it is also the administration of the private company to act as a be@@ ach to Mr U@@ so@@ v , Mr U@@ so@@ v .
at a time of 6.@@ 30 and ran@@ ges , there is a bitter record of cleaning work , because at 8 p.m. , there must be a pos@@ ter for the people .
the U@@ so@@ v has already been completed at four o &apos;@@ clock .
besides S@@ tro@@ om , he is still watching the P@@ iri@@ ta , Har@@ ma La@@ ke , Ka@@ ku@@ mÃ¤@@ e and Pal@@ jas@@ a@@ are .
the quantities of PrÃ¼m have fallen .
for years , it was much more .
people are now to be able to assess what they are doing for them , the U@@ so@@ v , who has been cor@@ ro@@ ted by 15 years .
before that , if something new was put up , it was the next day .
it is now being kept in the ran@@ k .
the cost of clean be@@ ach
one of the biggest jobs in the Estonian be@@ aches is to take stock of rub@@ b@@ ish , in other words , ad@@ ven@@ ing the rub@@ b@@ ish .
for example , the P@@ iri@@ ta ran@@ ges must be ship@@ ped by 400 000 tonnes .
&quot; this is un@@ beli@@ evable , &quot; notes the U@@ so@@ v .
the second major category is municipal waste , or all the people who leave behind .
half @-@ kilometre S@@ tro@@ om , S@@ tro@@ om , is eight major rub@@ b@@ ish sein@@ ers , which are needed three times a week .
so much is the waste .
however , cold summer il@@ ls have meant that the waste is a fifth of less than otherwise .
the third category is abandoned .
in most cases , these television stations are .
as a result , the U@@ so@@ v sand has flo@@ ated ten populations from the brea@@ ka@@ way wave .
they will be left to the be@@ aches on the road to the w@@ oo@@ den wood .
&quot; they are usually more developed , but it is a normal harvest &apos; ; &apos; U@@ so@@ v is already aware that it will soon be in the sand .

&quot; PrÃ¼m &quot; is being disman@@ tled
the Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler , a representative of the administrative services , conf@@ ers that the work of the tra@@ ctor is disrup@@ ting local communities .
noise , which las@@ ts over the hours of thi@@ ev@@ es , is confused in the vic@@ inity of people living in the neighbourhood .
this day , however , this work is impossible .
in one month , we have two times to war .
&quot; if we do not do this , the city of the city will be fined , &apos; notes the Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
however , the aim is like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ak@@ r and Per@@ sons , as well as in S@@ tro@@ om rand , with the quality of the international flag .
&quot; there is much more work to be done than Europe in Estonia , so that ran@@ ges are maintained , says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more ad@@ da@@ y@@ ages and ki@@ ds , and it is harder for the driving war .
however , we have less rub@@ b@@ ish than elsewhere in Europe .
when it comes to the string@@ ency of the rub@@ b@@ ish , Martin forced a journalist who is living in S@@ tro@@ om be@@ ach , with a conver@@ sation with a journalist and cor@@ ro@@ al workers , highlighting the current bottlenecks .
tomorrow , there is a picture of the gallery everywhere .
the problem is the problem of birds and de@@ pu@@ t@@ sla@@ gers , who are rub@@ b@@ ish c@@ and@@ bags , &apos; Mr Martin .
although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their practices so far , Mr Martin hopes that the government of the city will take action in refuse to do something , for example , to prevent at least the lin@@ ka@@ ges in the news .
in general , however , Mr S@@ tro@@ om is satisfied with the development of S@@ tro@@ om .
it is seen that the city is taking care of it .
it has become more pleasant , enligh@@ tened and fresh , as well as the roads that have been identified .
it was ever that there was only one way to go , in cases of un@@ fol@@ ding , by Martin .

Bank of England save interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be aware that interest rates remain at the former level , as the power@@ less growth and inflation reduction has cus@@ hi@@ ed speculation on the rise in speculation .
the Bank of England has warned that growth is stag@@ na@@ ting , because household incomes have led to interest rates for waiting .
policy makers of the Bank &apos;s monetary policy ( MP@@ C ) have voted in favour of 6 : 2 + 0.@@ 25 % , and fewer members will require an increase in this month , as slow economic growth has weakened the support .
in its quarter of its quarter , the Bank cut the forecast of 1.7 % in 2017 and to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households remains at the rate , as the autumn is expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the growth rate in the next few years is necessary to curb inflation from Bre@@ x@@ it@@ from from Bre@@ x@@ men , and in the financial markets , the expected increase in the cost of borrowing will be necessary .
Members voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the package of partial readmission in the world economy in Bre@@ x@@ ti as a result of the year ago .
the bank will put an end to the fixed @-@ term finance scheme in February , which provides a low @-@ cost finance for banks , even though it is now worth GBP 15 billion in the scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the Protocol , the Bank says : &apos; the &apos; MP@@ C centre forecast remains power@@ less in the near future , as the real income of households will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
in order to mitigate the rates of inflation , the need for a &apos; financial policy &apos; to be made in order to mitigate inflation is a matter of course , and &apos; somewhat more &apos; , if the markets are expected to be expected .
for the first time in the third quarter of next year , Mr BÃ¶@@ rs will predict an increase in the second quarter of next year and the second year 2020 .
however , the bank emphasised that any form of hy@@ tri@@ c is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and the next year are comparable to projected 1.9 % in May and 1.7 % for the next year .
the forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 was maintained .
after this news , the dollar fell by the dollar and the euro .
Na@@ el fell by 0.5 % of 1.@@ 31 US dollars and 0.@@ 4 % of 1.@@ 11 % .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointment of the disappointing growth figures , which have increased hopes of rising growth in the second quarter of three months than 0.2 % in the previous three months .
the bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will be able to collect a little momentum .
the latest inflation report by the Bank gave rise to little reason to re@@ jo@@ ice in the face of rising inflation and an ab@@ ject increase in wages , saying that the situation is going to be slightly worse before an improvement .
it was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent the next few years from striking a blow , but a significant recovery is expected to put an end to the annual forecast .
as a result , the economy is also stimu@@ lated by increasing demand for British production , which is partly due to lower costs for consumers .
the decision must be taken after the rate of 0.@@ 25 % last August after shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the dollar .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years in order to brea@@ the full life into the prices and to the economy .
prior to the last decision of the Bank , there was a growing demand for raising the rate , as inflation has increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers were required to increase 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected to rise again and again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to 2 % was entirely due to the weak p@@ ound .
Mr Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , leader of C@@ rec@@ o mort@@ ga@@ ges , said : &apos; the recent drop in spre@@ ads seems to me that the mortgage market will once again become more competitive , because creditors want to work and put an end to the year in a positive way .
Mr BÃ¶@@ rs seems to be particularly favourable to those whose transactions are coming to an end , because re@@ financing , often serving and low @-@ rate , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
10 000 people have been writing a contradiction between 10 000 people in connection with HIV medicine .
patients have had access to pre @-@ emp@@ tive &apos; HIV @-@ friendly treatment &apos; , since September , with a battle that has been held in the Court of Justice on the need to finance the pharmaceutical industry .
the N@@ HS has announced that public health care is now estimated at 10 000 people to pre @-@ pre @-@ emp@@ phy@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) - an estimated 10 000 people in pre @-@ e@@ tal care ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t to what is being done before an arbit@@ ration and a reduction of the risk of infection in high @-@ risk people .
the N@@ HS agreed to finance clinical trials after the Court of appeal was supported by the Court of Justice last year , according to which the N@@ HS can pay for the Pr@@ EP , despite its own claims , that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Ste@@ vens welcomed the launch of this Thursday in the wake of the &quot; new large @-@ scale intervention &quot; at the same time as the National E@@ ports ( NA@@ T ) described this &quot; turning point &quot; .
can@@ ing clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ oli@@ s and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d , among the first , are the first to be registered in October , in addition to the clinical trials before the programme is introduced in England by April 2018 .
exposure to pre @-@ trial pre @-@ emp@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) is an HIV @-@ drug lifestyle , which is taken before the incident in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that the Pr@@ EP will significantly reduce the risk of HIV among people with conta@@ gi@@ on .
the Pr@@ EP &apos;s adoption before the mid @-@ term means that there is sufficient quantities of certain medicines that prevent HIV infections from HIV .
such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the mid @-@ term .
they include L@@ GB@@ T men , trans @-@ gender people and people , whose partners are infected with HIV and who are not treated with HIV .
the relevant people who agree to participate in clinical trial include men , women , trans @-@ gender people and those who are not engaged in anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor will be able to register their participation in local sexual health care in the programme participating in the programme .
the programme will pay GBP 10 million , and the N@@ HS is signed by the Treaty in order to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the aim of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of the Pr@@ EP , by collecting clinical evidence of those who are treated and how it is used and implemented .
Ste@@ ven said : &apos; this new large @-@ scale intervention should complement and enhance the wide @-@ ranging and increasingly successful fight against HIV proliferation .
this is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of the greatest health problems in mankind . &quot;
Mr D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , the Man@@ T of NA@@ T , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
the Pr@@ EP , if targeted correctly to those who need it and will be in risk , offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England .
since September , high @-@ risk people in England have been able to access powerful new tools to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and dependent on the negotiating partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Mr Ter@@ rence , the Executive Director of the Foundation , said : &apos; now it is a priority to ensure that the clinical trial of the country is rapidly being postponed and that no HIV risk does not fall apart .
now that the Pr@@ EP &apos;s clinical trial has been procu@@ red , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who risk HIV infections in the face of HIV .
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister for Public Health , said : &apos; Pr@@ EP @-@ i clin@@ ic attempt is very welcome and very late since the late months of delay and the le@@ c@@ turing of government sho@@ es &apos; .
evidence shows how significant changes can be brought to the elimination of HIV prevention and non @-@ proliferation of life @-@ related infection .
this clinical trial will lead us to a step closer to full understanding of the benefits of the Pr@@ EP .
it is now important for the clinical trial to be introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV and lead us to a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the price of electricity rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
in a more recent context , the difference between the electricity prices in Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to EUR 1.@@ 94 , compared to EUR 7.@@ 71 in June this year , in Ele@@ ring Ele@@ ring .
the main cause of the price difference is the Russian @-@ Swedish community .
in Estonia , over â¬ 3@@ 4.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t @-@ hour and the price came from June to 12 % in the electricity centre in Estonia .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by 5 per cent of 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t @-@ hour .
in Finland , the price of EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 17 was EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 17 and the electricity exchange rate in Nord half of the system was at the level of EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t per hour .
prices rose according to 12 and seven per cent .
between Estonia and Finland , the electricity between Estonia and Finland was between the last few of the last month , and 16 % of the hours from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine per cent of the two countries did not take place in the next two days .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity reached between Estonia and Latvia at the time of Latvia and 73 % was at the disposal of all transmission capacity .
according to the last trading day of July , Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X on the market may have an estimated â¬ 34 and â¬ 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t in August .

life of life - half @-@ tru@@ ce and smart de@@ sig@@ ner have changed the small Ear@@ ls of the fla@@ ter room for their homes
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , former bankers who are passion@@ ate about property renewal , swit@@ ched to the home of their great K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in 2014 by Ear@@ ls Cour@@ ti .
it is based on Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ lai , and that Jo@@ anne is not a pac@@ ked @-@ up of the pac@@ ked and re@@ peti@@ tive , is an expression of respect for the new design .
&quot; before I live together with the former co @-@ life , K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was something that would be equivalent to the price that I offer .
I was told by the Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high waves .
I have a doctor in this and I made an offer on the same day .
since the first visit , this 93 @-@ square me@@ tre has under@@ gone full innovation .
at the beginning , it was one s@@ lee@@ ping and a complex s@@ le@@ ep , a s@@ le@@ ep for a s@@ le@@ ep , and Jo@@ anne wanted to add a spa@@ w@@ ning and a half @-@ tru@@ ce in order to take advantage of high bra@@ ins .
&quot; I wanted to see high light , high numbers of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he is asking the archite@@ ctural and de@@ sig@@ ner of Er@@ ri@@ ad Az@@ adi N@@ ot@@ ting Hil@@ lis Du@@ ck &amp; D , to take advantage of 3.@@ 8 m people , and to create a home , which would not simply be the point of development , but a place where Jo@@ anne could live .
it was not high enough to add two space to each other , so the architecture of the architecture was to create a qu@@ asi @-@ tru@@ ce in which it can stand up .
Mr Er@@ ri@@ man had to be creative in the matter .
&apos;@@ Me@@ tal@@ roll &apos; is quite complex , it explains .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise space , so they will be based on each other , without any mar@@ ching .
it was not just a platform to build a platform , but we used the construction of steel , so that both the excess and the upper limit is right . &quot;
this place allowed the Er@@ ph@@ il to create two full @-@ time elements in the space of each other , with a great deal of dramatic elements .
in writing . - ( SK ) O@@ ur time is open to the old @-@ fashi@@ oned window of life in the old @-@ fashi@@ oned light of R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us &apos;s window .
the gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture of Pe@@ e@@ gel@@ d@@ den , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ spe@@ ctive fla@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille is under@@ pin@@ ned by a space of space .
the use of car@@ tels plays a role in the inclusion of theat@@ re , space and lighting .
in the short corridor , the mir@@ rors have been included in both sides of the corridor .
in the K@@ night , I will give the impression of a second lo@@ g as an ak@@ in to another .
as a result , a s@@ nap@@ shot will provide a s@@ nap@@ shot for all Jo@@ anne &apos;s and the glass requirement .
the cost of life will add a false opportunity to shut down , if it is not used , creating a mo@@ ck@@ ery of vision .
the glass kit@@ chen is nothing new .
however , in this kit@@ chen , it is a unique fact that this is the dis@@ solution of the type of u@@ prising of the gar@@ age .
&quot; this went a little in the design of a design , &apos; clarifies the nature of Mr M@@ D@@ F &apos; from the M@@ D@@ F .
&quot; this is a counter@@ part , which is why it is very simple , if it is to be rejected . &quot;
thanks to space and space for smart use of space , Jo@@ anne is now 16 additional metres , an additional s@@ lee@@ ping s@@ le@@ ep and better harves@@ ting .
&quot; after all , there is an insur@@ gency that you sell - or what it gives property value , &quot; words Er@@ ri@@ r .
&apos;@@ Kin@@ nis@@ an in the form of an outdated de@@ ser@@ t and makes calculations on the basis of land area &apos; .
here , they have been able to increase the flo@@ ors using high quality materials that add a luxury to a space .
&quot; materials are the ones that you are missing and which will help to create an emotional link with the home , &apos; says Mr Harbour .
&quot; you are not in a power station in the in@@ se@@ ct .
it is important , but it does not give hearts to languages . &quot;
this shows that a good design and an increase in the area of the area will be ama@@ zed by something ama@@ zing .
in fact , they may create a desire not to leave , as was the case with Jo@@ anne .
Mr Jen@@ sen is a head @-@ off in Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s pil@@ gri@@ m , who will compete with a fellow Member who will compete with his fellow Member .
it does not seem to be the amount of money that has been made , which is to be forgotten by any ethics .
his wife and three children see a man in a murde@@ rous and late night .
in the first half of the film , I find myself in thinking that it is a version of the &apos; Ca@@ di@@ man house &apos; - even in K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s speech is similar .
the film and the moral intention of the film @-@ makers will continue to be more transparent than the film @-@ mak@@ er , however .
life @-@ related experience can be a key player in cancer .
there is now a choice between working and family life .
a po@@ et of po@@ lem@@ ics , a po@@ et of dis@@ appointments , makes a father in the sho@@ es in Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s big buildings , just like faith , good , love ... , without even the twin disaster of the twin tow@@ ers .
after the third , where the son &apos;s father opens up a eyes , there is a feeling that the film @-@ mak@@ er will certainly be able to obtain the audi@@ ences of the target , because even with the most basic heart , it will not be possible to keep a blind eye to the suffering of a dark cancer hospital .
if a son coinci@@ des and his situation seems hope@@ less , the father and the father of his work seem to be able to understand the mor@@ ality of his work and do a man who is looking for a job .
I am now in a position of self @-@ bet@@ ting - when the film is at the heart of it , then I will be rewarded with an in@@ timate nature after the film im@@ ita@@ te , but if I am wrong , at least one surprise may be commen@@ ded .
there will be suspicion for a moment that ice , without a hus@@ band of the hus@@ band and a man in the middle of a motor@@ ised corridor , are going to be suspi@@ cious , if a hus@@ band is a rare disease .
however , Mr Po@@ e@@ g has been admi@@ ra@@ bly healthy , and although his father has just lost his job , it will be positive because it is now time to deal with the family .
I can also feel well - I can already predict the end of the American dra@@ ma !
the truth is that the film is well constructed , all the necessary elements are there .
it is going to be the case , the actors are good and mor@@ ally : the money is not the most important thing in life .
it is a film that brings the film well .
the new staff transfer period is planned to limit the media consumption of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F@@ . Kelly will also be able to do so .
that would be the first .
the political tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff transfer of the White House is planned to limit the information provided by President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope that it will keep the upper hand in a mistake .
there is an overla@@ p of a repor@@ ter Joseph D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ lt :
&quot; when the new staff transfer of the White House John F@@ e , Mr Kelly , , his first day of work came together with high officials , he pointed out the key problem with President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ mas , which he intends to resolve in the hands of the bad information in the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly said officials that information must be carried out , whether or not on paper or meetings , because the President would make better decisions when it was well informed . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems to be completely logical , but others have tried , and they have been trying to tame the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ n winter in his media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television goes for decades , and now it is in the White House , it is not his television scre@@ ens somewhere .
&quot; if a candidate T@@ ru@@ mp was dis@@ honest about the dis@@ content of the media , it would show him that he was published in a frank fashion , &quot; said S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , &quot; former campaign ap@@ para@@ tus S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , Poli@@ ti@@ co@@ le in February .
the Poli@@ tic@@ o Wi@@ th@@ ar@@ en wrote at the time that &apos; the &apos; six @-@ pack &apos; , according to the &apos; six @-@ pack &apos; , is a key tool for controlling the use of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter tool , if it is to ensure that it is also stable in its personal media consumption . &quot;
good .
however , the idea that the habits used by Twitter by using the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ point have ever been &apos; control &apos; , it is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaig@@ ners know something that the rest of us do not know about the fact that the v@@ ut@@ ters in T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i would have been even more hear@@ tened without their intervention .
we will probably never know about the de@@ v@@ olution that T@@ ru@@ mp did not postal .
if he had been able to rescue him or a couple of times , if he was able to save it or a couple of times , their efforts were worth .
however , no one has been able to prevent the po@@ lem@@ ics of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i consistently .
part of the problem is that in the White Paper of the White House of the equ@@ ation , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception , by transferring material to the bul@@ l , which supports their views on the world , but may not always be credible .
the whole story of a policy @-@ related policy is written in May by Coun@@ sell@@ ors for a strategic question of information to the President of the European Council .
one of the examples described by the repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is as follows :
&quot; the current and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i will say that T@@ ru@@ mp may react to a negative press , particularly on inf@@ ants , an explosion in inf@@ ants , with an explo@@ sive approach to identifying their source of departure .
at the end of February , when someone gave a happy copy to the President , Mr Charles C. Joh@@ n@@ son@@ i , the website of G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com , which bla@@ med the staff de@@ pu@@ ties to Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , has taken place at the end of February when someone had a lot of le@@ af@@ lets to the President .
it is not a difference that the Joh@@ n@@ son has been blocked by Twitter because of a mo@@ ck@@ ery or that he did not offer any specific evidence or that he has also passed the wrong accusations in the past and withdrawn .
the T@@ ru@@ mp read Article and started to ask Wal@@ sh@@ i . &quot;
the Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that the time staff@@ ing of the staff in Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us and the head of the White House Ro@@ b Por@@ ter have tried to impose a system for managing the documents that reach the T@@ ru@@ g@@ in T@@ ru@@ g@@ in and document . &quot;
how did it manage ?
Mr Kelly is going to do exactly the same for three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but T@@ ru@@ mp is still an impul@@ se and his ab@@ y@@ ss competition continues to have the effect .
these un@@ changing factors change the very difficult mission of the mission .
music mus@@ ici@@ ans who have come from abroad to the capital of the capital are not bitter enough .
there is a great deal of foreign affairs in the city of Tallinn .
those who ju@@ mp out have acknowledged that the town of Mun@@ ici@@ pality can be found in the town without any permission .
the first was the three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who have taken the same lead in the streets of Vir@@ u Vir@@ u .
it was clear to see that the r@@ hy@@ th@@ es and c@@ r@@ ri@@ ans were the mus@@ ici@@ ans in ab@@ sen@@ tia , to whom one of the du@@ ch mar@@ ches were to be taken away .
in spite of the fact , the only woman in the company has played a fer@@ ry with a for@@ tn@@ ight , while one man in front of the three col@@ leges and fur@@ n@@ alists brought closer together .
the third man was , alongside them , to one of their homes , and smokers themselves are ready to turn up their dis@@ gust .
these three homes did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the fur@@ ni@@ ture of the nation .
in writing . - ( DE ) Mr President , Mrs Bo@@ b has played a gesture with the Cas@@ emi and pal@@ lia@@ tes that he said that the black streets in the streets and after the money .
the aim of this House was to collect the ticket ticket for the same day in Finland on the same day .
on the question of whether or not they asked for urban protection in the old town , No@@ emi and Bo@@ b are sha@@ king their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never remain in one city more than a day or a few and most of them , for the time being promised , or something like this .
there is no point in paying for it , explaining it .
if we were to return to Vir@@ g@@ u from around 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in the hands of mus@@ ici@@ ans and they are going to go .
this journey is a challenge to the heart of the sa@@ cks and bags of plastic sa@@ cks and co@@ ca@@ ine Vir@@ u .
Vir@@ u than@@ ked the three Polish young men , one of whom played a fifth , the second k@@ ni@@ fe , and the third was that it has been transported by electronic glass .
&apos;@@ We are here to give people enter@@ tainment to be able to spread music and joy , and to make money for fuel and residence &apos; , explained the tri@@ o from M@@ iv@@ os@@ h .
according to the M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware of the fact that the city &apos;s licence must be in place .
&quot; of course , we do not have this &apos; yes &apos; , he said .
however , we hope that if people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
of course , if the police have to be taken , we are going to go elsewhere , but we must try , in the Annex .
in the context of the public coff@@ buying programme of the euro area central banks in Estonia , a total of â¬ 4.@@ 36 billion , a central bank portfolio , grew up to â¬ 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank is not publishing more detailed information on purchases .
the President of Estonia , Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , has made clear in response to the former members of the national assembly that the system of central banks of the Euro@@ system will cover three different purchasing programmes : the bonds of the financial sector ( &apos; No &apos; ) , guaranteed bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public bonds ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank is buying bonds from the market in order to encourage investors to invest money for investors .
the impact of purchases will fall in the production of lower @-@ risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks .
as a general rule , the government bonds in the public sector , with the government of the public sector , are in the framework of the government bonds , with no other country bonds .
since the Estonian state has not issued bonds , Estonia will make available a replacement shop within the limits of the amount allocated to them .
in these countries , the central banks are also making the purchase of their respective bonds limited .
the Estonian bank buy H@@ ans@@ son &apos;s assurances generally about bonds of European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank .
the Estonian bank buy bonds from March 2015 as part of the purchase programme .
in the meantime , t@@ reasury bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian bank of June 2016 will no longer be able to buy bonds .
in the name of the euro area central banks , since June , the Central Bank of Ele@@ round and Estonia will buy bonds from the Central Bank .
the migratory movements are flou@@ ris@@ hing and returning to the &apos; millions of business &apos; .
some of the West Mid@@ lands can once again find themselves in a confron@@ ta@@ tional confrontation with specific expo@@ sures , who have ignored the degree of Council @-@ led degrees in order to win back their cotton .
the migratory movements have par@@ ked their 20 tra@@ ilers at the hel@@ m of a &apos; mil@@ l @-@ shir@@ t &apos; in the street near the b@@ ric@@ ks of a &apos; mil@@ d &apos; in So@@ lih@@ ul@@ li .
they have returned , together with hor@@ ses , children and lorry vehicles , if they were to be thrown out in May , without having to be confused with a degree of c@@ ree@@ ping in their invasion of Council .
the act group found a weakness in the defence limit , turning its vehicles through un@@ impe@@ ded parts , which were left to po@@ ke .
M@@ aru@@ ang@@ ry people have sur@@ ped the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Council , saying that the &apos; problem &apos; is useless by the Council .
one anon@@ ymous person said : &apos; they are going to go there on Monday evening after their exclusion from Mr He@@ ath@@ from , where they were st@@ olen by the pro@@ ven@@ ers &apos; .
it must be embarras@@ sed that they are going to act because they have been useless in dealing with the problem .
the migratory movements were there in May , they were going to go and now they are again .
this was the case yesterday evening , probably more . &quot;
he added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with such things by acquiring a long barrier to protect their par@@ ks .
I live on the road to strike and I am not satisfied that I have to continue to pay the power of the Council if the Council cannot even prevent such a thing . &quot;
one local resident who also wanted to remain anon@@ ymous said : &apos; it is ridiculous , we saw how the last few of these emig@@ ran@@ ts left , and there is already a new offensive .
this time , there has been an increase in the number and there is still a horse in the countryside . &quot;
the representative of the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ li Council said : &apos; we are aware that the road in the south of the street will be unacceptable in the countryside , and we will work with the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ li police to implement the necessary legal measures so that they can move as soon as possible .
it is very helpful when as many local people as possible , as many local residents , certain anti @-@ antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police , call the number of 101 seats .
this will help to create a picture of the Court of Justice if we are presenting the case . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ y festi@@ val is also visiting the Minister for Culture , In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is pleased that there has been real world top names in Estonia .
the question of why the We@@ ek@@ y F@@ esti@@ val is so important , in the case of Sa@@ ar , that it should be asked of all those who have been enjoying the lou@@ der at the festi@@ val three days at the festi@@ val .
however , he is aware that the real estate of the Ita@@ lians has come to the fore .
&quot; looking at the level of artists , which has been brought to Estonia , it is that the absolute excellence of this music ju@@ mp will be brought home , often in the hands of the Minister for Culture , speaks of Minister for Culture .
what festi@@ val performers are in Sa@@ art himself most of all ?
I have to find myself in a relatively old age and I am certainly one of the most recent doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ ene@@ re@@ n , who took place yesterday evening .
according to his pla@@ ice , all of us are at some point in the foot of the past , a word he has done .
however , he still has a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ thia , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ ak .
of course , our own makers from Estonia - starting from NO@@ x P and they can be counted as a whole series .
in reality , the known name concentration is very high , he says .

the Au@@ di boo@@ sts the criticism of car manufacturers in the middle of up to 850 000 diesel vehicles .
the day before the Au@@ di announ@@ cements , B@@ M@@ W said that it provides an incentive for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the B@@ M@@ W chairman , the company believes that &apos; there is a smarter option than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to cities in Europe , including B@@ M@@ W , in Munich , which has considered a ban on diesel vehicles or restrictions .
the Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that there are three million Mercedes of plans to reduce gas emissions in diesel engines in Europe .
no company has described them as a reminder .
European car manufacturers have been working enthusias@@ tically in Europe and in the United States to help to comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions .
nitrogen ox@@ ide from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and that may cause as@@ th@@ ma .
the cost of exha@@ ust gases em@@ itting diesel vehicles for motor vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult for cars to compete in the price of cars .
at the same time , while German car manufacturers are in a thorough investigation , the Chancellor of the Federal Chancellor , Angela Merkel , is also accused of cha@@ iring the powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs that refer to the problem .
companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen who qu@@ ie@@ ter on the use of so @-@ called stock@@ piling devices , which allowed us to adapt to regulatory regulations for the time of the testing of gas emissions , but in normal circumstances .
a number of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen instructions have been prosecuted in the United States and others are under way in both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former president of the Au@@ di engine Development unit was arrested in Germany as a former president of the Au@@ di engine Development unit .
the former President , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o , is Italian and is not protected for extradition , and can be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , the Au@@ di German Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen had been drawn up in the area of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , when the authorities accused the installation of the audit system in order to evade the quantities of European gas emissions by extending investigations , which had focused on the United States in the past .
the inclusion of the Au@@ di could be a great blow to the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , a huge blow to the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen manufacturer &apos;s profits in a disproportionately large part of the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen .
the Estonian schools will have 20 000 euro flags in the European Union .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union by 1 September by 1 September .
together with the measu@@ re@@ ments , the me@@ ters of the European Union flag for 5@@ 70 educational institutions can be summarised .
Li@@ p@@ ud is foreseen in in@@ door in@@ door doors , they must be carried out in high @-@ quality printed techniques in the quality of the quality print , the ER@@ R is bro@@ ke@@ red by the ER@@ R .
the text has a text : &apos; the recognition of the Estonian School of Estonia for the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags is EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , or one flag will cost EUR 35 .
murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat of threat in Mexico
the N@@ weeks @-@ July Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers will normally gather in Wednesday , in order to review plans for the most recent loss of life in the State of the State of Europe , which so@@ ws organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ ased drug wars .
however , today they have gathered to discuss their own security in the shadow of a personal tragedy .
they are told that it is important to change their rou@@ tine .
two of the parents will be discussing , which seems to be safer : either to bring children into office in an office that was a target for 2009 , or to leave them home .
the Tur@@ ks have written a space to the heart of the city headed by the &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking repor@@ ters to give the repor@@ ters &apos; evidence of the fact that there is no need for a impres@@ sions , it is enough to have the impres@@ sions and inva@@ sions .
the presence of government or car@@ tels is suspected of drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists , a whole list of people who are doing the risk of spreading chaos in Mexico .
there is no b@@ reat@@ h of violence , and the more the bodies of the country accumu@@ late , the majority of them are journalists , according to data from the Committee on Civil Protection of journalists , from the nomination of at least 25 , since the attacks and threats of public protection in the country , at least at 25 in the seven state in the year , and this year , at least seven journalists in the seven state of the country have been killed .
the latest deaths include their edit@@ or and inspiration , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce co @-@ foun@@ der Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &apos; wrote Val@@ dez one of the books on drug violence in one of his many .
his absence is deeply felt , even though his presence can be perceived as a s@@ nap@@ shot of the head of the State of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building in a fa@@ Ã§@@ ade , with a great picture of the middle of Val@@ de@@ z@@ ist , with a bun@@ dle of &apos; fairness &apos; and two thirty @-@ repor@@ repor@@ ters , A@@ ar@@ is I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , the T @-@ shir@@ t , which has an image of his wife , or the ama@@ te@@ ur village of the K@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
the meeting will take place less than two months after the death of Re@@ por@@ ters will be discussing a common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , un@@ thin@@ kable paran@@ o@@ ia .
although in 2010 , the public Prosecutor &apos;s Office has been set up to address cases of journalist , with the protection of journalists from the Committee on Civil Liberties , only two cases have been brought to justice by journalists .
as in the case of most of the most annual drug trafficking and organised crime , the number of which amounts to thousands , the kil@@ lers of journalists are rarely prosecuted .
in the case of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce edit@@ orial , there will be a continuation of the violence in the Sin@@ hal@@ as , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the murder of the data and justice , there is a lot of benefits not to security , according to the I@@ bar@@ ra .
&apos;@@ There is a very fine time at the meeting here , &apos; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , there is a mistrust of all . &quot;
on 15 May this morning , the State of Val@@ dez kind@@ le , the capital of the State of Val@@ dez t@@ Ä , on 15 May .
he has managed to travel only a few quarters , before the two men were cap@@ tured by the Red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ roles , and he was forced to go out of the car and the 12 times that , in the name of the newspaper , which means translation in the &apos; twel@@ f@@ th river &apos; .
the armed man travelled to Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s car and did a disaster in the vic@@ inity .
the Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
a woman was left behind and two adults .
the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely circu@@ lated freely .
however , there is only a silence on the subject of Val@@ de@@ z .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition of the United States in January , one of the most bloo@@ di@@ est bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country is the one most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country , since ri@@ val@@ ry is fighting in a power vacuum .
it is not a difference that some people , or even several months , are being placed on the streets of oa , or that the deaths of the w@@ ret@@ ched fla@@ ts are w@@ rap@@ ped up to the s@@ mil@@ ls of a for@@ tn@@ ight , which are larger than many homes in many living homes .
let us forget for a moment that the peace period refers to how the state of play of drug routes to the United States and the United States is only dominated by a car@@ tel .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the risks associated with his work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and the President of Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) have enormous inno@@ c@@ ence in order to prevent him from defending his friend .
he believes that the killing was two injured .
the first of these was the publication of an interview with Mrs Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s po@@ pp@@ ers , and the car@@ tel of war , which has been carried out in February , by publishing an interview with Mr D@@ amas@@ cus in February .
this piece of correspon@@ dence may have been allu@@ ded to by the mon@@ arch@@ ies to the suspect who bought all the cop@@ ies of the publication immediately when they arrived in the newspapers .
the second mistake was that Val@@ de@@ z was not forced to leave his own security country after it took place in one of the same respects as the newspaper broadcast in one another .
Val@@ dez was leg@@ alised both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point against the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he has remained in life for so long , so that his friends and colleagues expect him to be permanently .
he worked in the newspaper No@@ ro@@ l in 2003 in No@@ ro@@ l in 2003 when he joined the five colleagues in order to create a Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the sale of 50 @-@ dollar parts .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez has said that it was impossible to deal with the media without addressing the drug problem . &quot;
the total amount of time , your courageous and honest refle@@ ctions , and sales and advertising increased .
in writing . - ( SV ) In a sympa@@ thetic manner , we have a great deal of research without censorship and read@@ ers , which they were able to read stories that nobody else da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspaper has won the award of his Latin American mir@@ rors to Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ oti .
in the same year , the W@@ dez journalists &apos; Protection of the International Committee on Freedom of the Press ( AK@@ K ) won his courage for his courage to follow the Mexic@@ an drug addi@@ cts all of which it leads .
he openly admitted that it was afraid .
&quot; I would like to live on , &quot; said the AK@@ K , by adopting the prize .
last October , he said to the television channel Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV to interview that drug trafficking is a way of life .
the &apos; head of the task &apos; is to embrace the task that the office of the journalist is accompanied by another opportunity to play .
I do not want me to ask me that , in the face of so many deaths I did or why I did not talk about what is happening . &apos;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ ct is lon@@ ging for Val@@ de@@ z , a jo@@ ke , a ro@@ h like low , war@@ ring who divided embry@@ os and advice , teachers who knew how to survive .
they are in favour of his rou@@ tine .
he always made a bar@@ rel .
he went on the office of El Guatem@@ y@@ ab@@ o , a head of office in El Guatem@@ y@@ ab@@ o , at the same time .
now they are asking whether his rou@@ tine love was to be sent to him .
his death has also put them into doubt on how best to do their work and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the blind to their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing records used for drug transport . &quot;
&quot; these things should not be touched , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ support .
your in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
if it per@@ fu@@ mes the my@@ ri@@ ad , the hotel away .
the problem is that &quot; fra@@ gran@@ ce can be dece@@ ived ... and this is the case with Mr J@@ ass@@ er@@ v , Mr And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ ali .
his and others say that the Sin@@ hal@@ as does no longer apply to the old rules , just as they do not apply to Thailand , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z@@ i , Guer@@ re@@ ros or other states which are home to the toxic combination of revenue @-@ generating routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in a space where the Belgian workers were met for security training , there were suddenly no longer mobile phones ; some days before it was revealed , that only a nu@@ mber@@ ing bank for the governments was used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists .
the House had two police officers in front of two poli@@ ce@@ men pu@@ zz@@ ling the heat of 40 @-@ me@@ ad@@ c heat .
they were appointed by the government by the government of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , which is located in the middle of the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an Centre in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
some repor@@ ters were wondering whether these police officers are a number of their 50 % of police officers , whose Governor himself has been un@@ trus@@ t@@ worthy .
a number of months have passed since repor@@ ters have been travelling in mountain areas where control is de facto drug gan@@ gs .
the edition of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and this week addressed three main pillars .
one of them was the murder of the former po@@ et Ju@@ li@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez , Sin@@ hal@@ as .
in addition , they had an reve@@ aling the spending of government finances to the home town of the Governor .
from one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , the public Prosecutor &apos;s c@@ abinet , a group of people from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an was kidna@@ pped .
there was no formal announcement about who was kidna@@ pped or how it happened , so there was a need to be careful when it was time to write what everything in the city knows about a restaur@@ ant , both of the drug dealers and the authorities of the authorities .
the Re@@ por@@ ter became aware of public documents that a restaur@@ ant is registered as a politician , who belongs to the present institution @-@ in @-@ Office of the Political Parties ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of politics throughout the last century .
in recent times , several IR@@ P leaders have been accused of corruption in the context of corruption .
in Vil@@ lar@@ dy asked the repor@@ ter to write the previous incidents in place , including the po@@ g of Gu@@ z@@ man po@@ pp@@ y in El Chap@@ o in Gu@@ z@@ man , who led to a coup d &apos;Ã©tat .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers have been looking for the Val@@ dez &apos;s s@@ co@@ k to obtain information on the best sources of the kid@@ napp@@ ings .
&apos;@@ sooner we have known what happened &apos; , &apos; 46 @-@ year @-@ old Vil@@ lar@@ line , whose bro@@ ker body has earned his name &apos; El Fla@@ co .
&quot; it is now all channels of communication that have broken off our sources . &quot;
the office of Val@@ de@@ z has become a space of storage and stic@@ kers , which protest against the killing of journalists and have become something that they never expected to expect for a pres@@ su@@ ris@@ ed activist .
the Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez took a few eyes and direction next morning to the local Prosecutor &apos;s c@@ abinet to a new journalist .
Mr A@@ us , Mr A@@ us , is three days after the killing of Val@@ de@@ z , in the State of Val@@ de@@ z .
it has been found to bur@@ ned dead and officials , according to the DNA tests , to him .
journalists have become more vo@@ id of voice across the country , and a phrase &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; , a phrase &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; .
on this day , Mr Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington , trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ de@@ z .
a day after the death of Val@@ de@@ z , the Y@@ or@@ oa case , we accused the authorities for journalists in a nu@@ mber@@ ing and killing the truth as a result of the truth .
after that , he asked him to be directed towards the government &apos;s activities , when it is concerned that hatred has been affected by objec@@ tivity .
the Val@@ dez was said repeatedly that Mexic@@ an journalists are in the &apos; restricted &apos; in the form of organised crime , com@@ passion for public officials and in@@ difference society .
in its last book , the drugs press , he wrote that the repor@@ ters will not be killed only by drug gan@@ gs , but also by the command of politicians and security forces who have organised crime .
the Media Monitoring Group ( J@@ TI@@ s ) , Mr Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 , gave more than half of the attacks on journalists in the police and civil servants last year .
&quot; in Mexico , you want to be silent , &quot; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
there are clearly spil@@ lo@@ ver effects on the ver@@ ge .
no one will forget a blo@@ gg@@ ger Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as &apos;s death in the northern border in Thailand , six years ago .
he was found to be a dead , with a letter that was probably signed by the car@@ tel in L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here in my report &apos; .
in addition to his ma@@ gic cl@@ ou@@ tle@@ t , computer glass and e@@ ars were bur@@ nt .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the north @-@ east of Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ as , following the killing of their cor@@ respondents in the March by March .
others will continue as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do after the murder of the President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z drugs said &apos; What you want to &apos; Mi@@ da you yourself want &apos; .
some journalists are in the state of home or even have fled the country .
this is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
it is difficult to find a job , and they still have to get to the streets to avoid the dangers .
and sometimes they are behind , as was probably the photo@@ graph@@ s of Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered together with four months of women in 2015 after Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
those who remain in place and continue to work must be able to refu@@ te the risky decisions every day .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who wanted to become a po@@ et , recognises that the display of drug trafficking is intimi@@ dating him .
&quot; Mexico is a road to hell , and that is why I am getting a repor@@ ter , &quot; said .
one of the recent mid@@ night of Friday , when the latest number was already be@@ ac@@ hed in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , sat in the head of the office and pl@@ undering the be@@ er when it suddenly started to rela@@ x all the phones .
there were 19 people who have died in the wake of the ri@@ val@@ ry and the ri@@ val@@ ry that has taken place in the he@@ els of Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ in , in the wake of ri@@ val@@ ry and security forces .
the war continues to continue , as has also been promised by a number of the messages that have been found in the region .
in the same way , the repor@@ ters made a repor@@ ter in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on a mobile phone when using a mobile phone .
in the next day , it was necessary to change .
the S@@ ire@@ en@@ s were over@@ stret@@ ched by another additional fire in the region .
Mr Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pi@@ il@@ us , for police officers on the right to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not at least show them .
the massive entry into force of the A@@ jal@@ a site , with his average finger at seeing the whole of the Sin@@ hal@@ an , was delivered by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers in his foot@@ steps .
&quot; how can it be closed at all , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; while Javier killed , Mr President , he asked me to make a repor@@ ter to her report ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur used to prevent enemies of defence
at first sight , it seems like the form , although rather frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now unve@@ iled the first findings of the un@@ beli@@ evable presence of Canadian min@@ ers , which are so well maintained , that experts have described it as a &apos; din@@ osa@@ ur Mon@@ a &apos; .
it has been so well maintained that it was even possible to as@@ certain that the lea@@ ther covered by his Fin@@ ns was col@@ oured with red lig@@ ni@@ te and his past was somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the report published by the current state of the Bi@@ ology has described the assumption as &apos; best of the survi@@ v@@ ors , which has ever been found &apos; and &apos; one of the best departments in the world &apos; .
in the case of F@@ fossil , it is a new no@@ te@@ no@@ de which lived in the middle of an age , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
it is incredibly good to maintain the researchers who describe this &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
it is a plant covered by this kind of vege@@ tation of a magaz@@ ine , according to the National Ge@@ o@@ dade Ac@@ cor@@ ts , the most survi@@ v@@ ors of this type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus , which has ever been found .
this was found on 21 March 2011 , when he was in the mining of For@@ mal Mc@@ Mur@@ ray , in the mining of For@@ mal Mc@@ Mur@@ ray , in the mining mine of the Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ um .
he has struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into it .
the ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus has been sent to Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ ace , M@@ use@@ um .
the next six years have been developed in order to bring the animal to 2 500 na@@ vi@@ es ( 11.@@ 100 @-@ kilometres ) .
after all this hard work , the final result is now to bring the public back to the public .
&quot; if a little eye is st@@ reamed up , almost believe he is s@@ le@@ ep , &quot; said the leading author Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , the scien@@ tist Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell , in the muse@@ um , where the assumption is .
&quot; this goes down in the history of the history of one of the most beautiful and most well @-@ preserved ho@@ sts in the Mon@@ a @-@ city of Mon@@ a . &apos;
he looked at the researchers that , while they are covered by soya , and rese@@ ar@@ ched a s@@ oun@@ der tan@@ k , it was likely to have a significant impact on meat g@@ ard@@ ens .
this multi@@ tude of so@@ d@@ ity was used by red and white col@@ ours in order to hide behind pre@@ da@@ tors , and implement medical prescriptions referred to as &apos; counter @-@ liability &apos; and which also used many of today &apos;s animals .
it has made it possible for experts to be better around the neighbourhood and to prevent the enemies , as the major inter@@ lo@@ cu@@ tors were likely to be hun@@ t down .
this is the first time that the family belonging to a family of 110 million of the no@@ te@@ sa@@ ur@@ ms of this year came to the news in May and is now visiting Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ ace in the M@@ use@@ um .
the researchers have now investigated and gave the name of Mr Mitchell , the M@@ use@@ um of Bo@@ real@@ poli@@ l Mar@@ x@@ chel@@ l , to a laboratory mark Mr Mitchell , which was the famous team that spent more than 7@@ 000 hours of un@@ wise ex@@ posing of the demand .
thanks to the very good preservation of the father , Mr Mitchell and the International Re@@ search@@ ers &apos; teams can document the form of the form of so@@ d@@ dy and size set up a body .
they discovered , in the name of a common defence method , a defence method that is widespread in the country of nature , which means that the intr@@ usion of the assumption was a quarter of the alu@@ ge .
although there is widespread controversy , bread will come as a surprise , because Bo@@ real@@ poli@@ tan is much greater than those who are currently living in a sha@@ dows today .
this implies that the din@@ osa@@ ur hun@@ ts in a sufficiently active manner in other mus@@ ici@@ ans , so that the evolution preferred to obs@@ cure the opposite of the con@@ tras@@ ts of survival ta@@ ctic .
however , most of the animals used today - such as fear , b@@ b@@ ers or doctors - are a lot smaller and more vulnerable , which indicate that the pressure of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ sis had to really work really to survive .
a robust hun@@ t on the ground , which is covered by large and large @-@ scale Fin@@ ns , shows how dangerous they were kidna@@ pped by the inf@@ ur@@ ric@@ al inf@@ ants , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds has also revealed that the din@@ osa@@ ur lea@@ ther was s@@ tun@@ ned .
scientists continue to set up an investigation in order to get ang@@ les about their lives , including the content of this gender @-@ style sh@@ ut@@ down in order to find out what the animal is in its own last e@@ ine@@ e .
they believe that the din@@ osa@@ ur collapsed in the death of rivers , thus becoming a sea in the sea , where it turned out to the ocean .
at that time Mr Alber@@ tas was just as so@@ e as the South of Flor@@ ence and rivers and oceans are likely to go far beyond the internal land as currently .
&apos;@@ This no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us is truly remarkable , since it is fully covered by a so@@ ber lea@@ f , but it has also been a three @-@ dimensional , while maintaining the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal is now almost the same as an inf@@ il@@ tration age .
there is not a great deal of imagination to be used for this reconstruction - it is enough simply to pre@@ da@@ ve the eyes and that it seems to be a s@@ le@@ ep . &quot;
it was time for the crisis in which huge two leg@@ s were hi@@ jac@@ ked in the countryside - tero@@ gene@@ ous .
although the King Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x was living for millions of years later than Bo@@ real@@ double , it could be hun@@ ted down some of his hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous predecess@@ ors in his hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ity .
they include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ vÃ¡ , 38 foot@@ wear ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) and six tonnes of ch@@ ole@@ cu@@ m .
scientists whose recent findings have been published in Bi@@ ology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ double were killed after death in the sea and the mu@@ tation mu@@ d@@ ilu@@ ted .
it was discovered on 21 March 2011 , when he extra@@ cted the mining of Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um in For@@ mal Mc@@ Mur@@ ray , near the North Alber@@ tas in Canada .
according to the Mu@@ use@@ um , this is the best preserved unit in the world , including lea@@ ther and soya , and this is a comprehensive concentration of up to timber .
these assumptions were on average 18 years ( five metres ) long and more than GBP 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .
there were two 20 customs @-@ long ora of customs on this shoulders .
scientists believe that this is covered by the n@@ ights and se@@ af@@ lets covered by the current Western Canadian state , as long as it is floo@@ ded into the river .
however , the ho@@ ma@@ ge of the s@@ qua@@ res in the sea helped to maintain an excellent amount of detail in detail .
the residues of this particular father are so well maintained , so that the head@@ lines behind the lon@@ ge@@ vity of noise @-@ gar@@ so@@ al pos@@ ters are still covered by sk@@ in @-@ lea@@ vers .
as Mr G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote in National Ge@@ o@@ van : &apos; such storage is as rare as a cen@@ sus &apos; .
what more I look at , it seems to be un@@ beli@@ evable .
the sk@@ in @-@ lea@@ ded lea@@ vers still cover the creation of my@@ ph@@ ic so@@ y@@ bean pla@@ tes .
a better front is stal@@ ling , and five of them have been rus@@ hed up .
I will be able to count on the so@@ d@@ den Fin@@ ns . &quot;
how can one act found a response to the question of &apos; whom today ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll had a full shock .
just a day after the travel of New York in New York , this St@@ Lou@@ i resident , via a temporary ren@@ ted to@@ wer , is going to travel to Airbus , via Facebook .
he was not in the post of his former school com@@ mu@@ ter .
there was a &apos; police killing 18 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ents &apos; and he is still in the streets . &quot;
he was confused , why someone else was not the subject of this information , which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
Mr P@@ ide@@ ga @ The@@ e@@ P@@ suc@@ rose has repeatedly been divided on his record on his record .
Mr St@@ . , a sili@@ c@@ on from the region from the region , in real time , sent out the death of a young man of un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old age , who killed the White police officer in the Fer@@ gus@@ on Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is white police officer in the Fer@@ gus@@ on Islands .
he gave a picture of the life of Bro@@ w@@ ni living in which he was in a position to come to the streets , when it comes to four hours .
&quot; this is cra@@ zy , &apos; thought @-@ up &apos; has been inter@@ viewed .
however , death was nothing new for his or her community .
he has made a phone by his phone , but it later saw a sh@@ ut@@ down , which said this time from the assembly of Can@@ field , Mr D@@ ri@@ ve .
J@@ ag@@ at photo@@ graph@@ s of the police and the terrible people , and the man who claimed himself to be the father of Bro@@ w@@ ni and kept a label with the &apos; Fer@@ gus@@ oni police killed just my un@@ armed son &apos; .
he watched in real time the stream in which the police officer stood up to the group of prote@@ sters responsible for the gra@@ ves .
in the second video @-@ up , one another police officer , said that he said gun@@ s and fear : &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
the Fer@@ rel@@ le reminded us how he hit himself from thinking : &apos; it is unusual . &apos;
&quot; this is not a murder of this kind , which we are used to and what we could call a typical practice . &quot;
I felt at the moment .
I was outra@@ ged by the rain and I had tried . &apos;
he boo@@ ked a flight and travelled home on the next day .
at the end of 23 May , she went to his father &apos;s six @-@ year ty@@ re and decided that they will travel two years on the next morning with Fer@@ gus@@ oni .
what Mr Fer@@ rel@@ li and Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ ik took place in the next three years is the key issue in the new docu@@ mentary document &apos; W@@ ho@@ lean strikes ? &apos; ( &apos; whose thanks today ? &quot; ) , which is taking place in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
this is a story of survival and prote@@ ctions , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who met the answers today .
if Mrs Ferreira , together with the ty@@ rann@@ y , who had a li@@ til@@ la and a pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ch@@ ro@@ mer , the Fer@@ gus@@ oni travelled , who spoke once again on the subject , which had previously been discussed before this morning , and with the experience of living conditions and conditions of life .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ wever , when I taught you how the community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; recalls his question .
&apos;@@ We are going to war with Fer@@ gus@@ oni , because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and it is not right &apos; .
&quot; I did not have him to take it , &apos; said Ferreira &apos; later .
&quot; what is happening now is the cul@@ mination of what has happened in the past .
he needs to know this and see it in the middle of it .
he must learn from a activists and organise and feel the different stra@@ ys of experience and living conditions , and that what we need to do is to free and liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I succeed in raising him so that he is not personally responsible for racism , it does not er@@ r on some of the other black girls .
I feel that I would make him a dis@@ service when I would defend him from the world . &quot;
the first suspension , which they made by Mr Fer@@ gus@@ on , was the South F@@ is@@ san@@ ti path in the middle of a police station , which was in place for a certain kind of camp , where activists were waiting for the news of the police officer , Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not at the end of the accus@@ ation .
there was a link between Ferreira and his da@@ u@@ ghter and his da@@ u@@ ghter in the local business owner who prepared the lunch .
they put together food col@@ ours and helped to share them with the protests .
for the Fer@@ rell , a new type of activist began slowly .
&quot; my activist became fully after 9 August , &quot; said that , when he was a Mis@@ tral @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ ine University student , he was the President of the European Union for students in VÃ¤@@ vi@@ ans and focused on food justice and health inequalities in communities .
&quot; I did not have any experience of organising .
this is all simply a la@@ b . &quot;
at the time of the week , Mrs Ferreira , at the time of a trial , was a film director , Sab@@ Is@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ te .
Mr Fo@@ lay@@ an said that he and the film operator Mr Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o wanted to record what is happening .
the issue of Mr Fer@@ rel@@ li arose : &apos; do you try to record what is happening or find a story that can be used ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often painful - will come to the community and try to benefit from it , and its resilience to profit .
the Fo@@ lay@@ an interview in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the vote of the Fer@@ gus@@ on born and grown people will not be heard and we wanted to do this differently . &apos;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an was already hit by his son D@@ am@@ is Da@@ v@@ ka , the region of the region , who had been sentenced to death sentences for activists who were well known for activists .
its involvement has made the project more attractive , Fer@@ weap@@ li and still for six other local groups , which the film &quot; W@@ ho@@ lean strikes for years after the shooting of Bro@@ w@@ ni shoo@@ t for years .
&apos;@@ This docu@@ mentary does not speak for us or with us , but we are talking about ourselves &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; for me , it was important how these people are portra@@ yed , as I am also portra@@ yed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rel@@ li - it was wanted to show that the movement is not the case of &apos; lun@@ atic &apos; , but from the community of the community , as the Fo@@ lay@@ an - it has been the most open participan@@ t in his film .
as a result , &apos; W@@ ho@@ lean strikes ? &apos; , surpris@@ ingly personal aspects , the life of Fer@@ rel@@ li , as ra@@ va@@ ging and their wife mar@@ ry .
&quot; I felt it was , as I would be al@@ poli@@ ted , &apos; said &apos; Ferreira &apos; , the first time on which he was prepared to see the city of the city .
&quot; however , I realised that it must be accompanied by certain vulnerability to the human being of this work and the people who live up to the black people . &quot;
moreover , the story of Fer@@ rel@@ li emphasises and re@@ sets the role of the L@@ GB@@ T group in the wider Black Sea group on Mat@@ ter movements .
two of the three initi@@ ators of three initi@@ ators of the # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter , after the murder of H@@ y@@ von Mar@@ tini in the social media in 2012 , who thought the # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter , are homo@@ sexual .
&apos;@@ In a leading role &apos; , gay women have maintained the movement in general , &apos; said Ferreira , &apos; and this is precisely because we have to fight on several fronts .
the Roma women have to bear the burden of all the Roma people . &quot;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed , pointing out that &apos; the movement really lives in a life cycle &apos; , women and many of them are black women . &quot;
he says , however , that &apos; this is not a kind of equality of opportunity &apos; - Fer@@ rel@@ li was not elected as a central point for his identity .
&quot; he was a man , the right energy of the evening , he said .
&quot; however , it is not a coincidence that it is directly at the front@@ line , because a great deal is at stake when it comes to L@@ GB@@ T women in their homes .
his energy can be perceived as a screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news camer@@ as has long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
during the demonstration in the Fer@@ rel@@ le demonstration , the sentences handed down for blocking the road will run for another 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region , which it calls on home , simply &apos; a huge threat &apos; .
nevertheless , it still attaches great importance to the man@@ tra which he has used to eat the memory of Mr Fer@@ gus@@ oni for three years ago in Fer@@ gus@@ oni .
&quot; our duty is to fight for our freedom .
our duty is to win .
we have to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose apart from our chains . &quot;
7 ni@@ ps , following the We@@ ek@@ le du po@@ mel@@ t
some of the hen@@ s will find that there is a shortage of me@@ als , after a scarce ri@@ g , that we are suffering from it .
or in the light of the y@@ el@@ le , there is a sh@@ ut@@ tle , a py@@ ra@@ p . &quot;
however , it is only inevitable , and the health of health is a good thing .
what can you do to ensure that , after today and tomorrow , the We@@ ek@@ se trend of the We@@ ek@@ se - or other pi@@ les - to be felt as pain@@ lessly as possible in the morning ?
Jo@@ o water .
it is down to the Al@@ p@@ ine and , after a great deal this morning , ... or even instead of alcohol .
as there is a great deal of liquids using alcohol consumption , it must be re@@ gained in any way .
in combination with water , miner@@ als and sta@@ p are also a good ha@@ ven of mineral water .
since we are often confronted with a ma@@ gic bul@@ let , it is particularly good if it is in a fla@@ t@@ less or a ligh@@ tly in@@ ser@@ t .
to walk .
it would certainly not be a po@@ ck@@ le to go to the old pu@@ mps - that may be a fatal fal@@ la@@ cy .
however , it will be easy to remind the poor time that the feeling is alive .
a s@@ le@@ ep and s@@ lee@@ ping s@@ le@@ ep is a time @-@ consuming for healthier life .
it is gradually slowly and cau@@ ti@@ ously that it has the power of energy .
if you are going to be on the already medi@@ oc@@ re of yesterday , it will certainly not be possible to try to download a great deal of brave fine .
for example , the ref@@ res@@ hing volume contained in the presence of the lion &apos;s high @-@ cal@@ ib@@ re access to a body is based on a high level of silence .
when the health of the South is already suffering , it could try , for example , to foot the bat@@ on .
and a little later on .
a coff@@ ee .
this di@@ ame@@ tri@@ um will liber@@ ate your body from the rest of the water .
as has already been said : water and volumes are friends .
there is a lot of pain@@ kil@@ lers .
if you have a pain@@ kil@@ ler in order to prevent a po@@ t , then you need to address the whe@@ el in addition to alcohol , or the pro@@ phe@@ cy , and thus lose the performance .
both ri@@ ches and in the future will continue to be a po@@ pp@@ y worse .
in addition , there will not be a kil@@ ler of pain@@ kil@@ lers in the very long term .
if you get a pain@@ kil@@ ler this morning , then the road to the plu@@ g will be g@@ lu@@ ed up - it irri@@ ta@@ tes the already di@@ r@@ ty ma@@ ke .
or if a partner is not taken , it cannot be well done with itself .
there are some same things as wal@@ king , but in foot@@ wear it cannot be done .
however , there should be too active pace and a hand@@ ful of han@@ gs at the time of the po@@ t , the physical effort should be moderate .
a jo@@ ke .
the story of the friends of the friends of the time , the simple to@@ tality and a na@@ era @-@ friendly way of their own , as well as for their suffering .
the N@@ ali and na@@ er may not confuse the po@@ t , but it is certainly a pleasure to endu@@ re them .
for once , the po@@ et will go on anyway !
Professor of L@@ w@@ ester@@ n &apos;s profes@@ sors and the University of Ox@@ ford are being sought as suspects to murder murder
according to the police , the University of North@@ wood W@@ ester@@ n and the University of Ox@@ ford , who have received suspects after death row , are sought by the police , according to the police , and the University of Ox@@ ford University , which has become the life@@ blood of the death row , is being sought .
according to the case of C@@ oo@@ k Coun@@ ty , on Monday , an arrest warrant was issued on a succession of 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i , and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i , accused of death by the first instance of his alleged association due to the death of his alleged association due to the death of his alleged association .
according to documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u died after repeated bul@@ lets .
the warning statement that the Ch@@ ic@@ ago police station for the community was detected was discovered on 27 July .
police officers received phone and found the Grand Pla@@ za cor@@ ter@@ house in the Grand Pla@@ za , who had a victim of several tor@@ ture@@ rs .
according to the case of the Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u event , the Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u was admitted to death and investi@@ g@@ ators , while at the same time the police seek to actively seek two suspects .
they have worked as a co @-@ profes@@ sors of micro@@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology from the University of North@@ wood in 2007 .
the Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations Ala@@ n K@@ oma , C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , said that the statement sent out to Mrs La@@ ke has now been temporarily removed and has been banned from entering the University of North@@ wood City .
&quot; this is now a criminal investigation carried out by the competent authorities , and the University of North@@ w@@ ester will cooperate with researchers , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
Mr W@@ arre@@ n is the senior assis@@ tant of the University of Ox@@ ford .
the representative of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said : &quot; we have been in contact with the British police and the US investigation authorities in every possible way , &quot;
in addition , the statement stated that the War@@ ren@@ i colleagues are shocked and want him to make up .
the President of the C@@ ic@@ ago police department , An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , is urging the authorities to give them a suspicion .
&apos;@@ The police have an idea where they are staying , but we are working more intensively on the definition of the exact location &apos; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to the G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , suspects will help the suspects , both local , regional and national authorities .
the G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police received a telephone call from the Grand Pla@@ za Grand Pla@@ za P@@ house , who had just had a cry@@ p@@ tic rain that there has been something at the a@@ partment .
according to the police descri@@ ptions , it was a specta@@ cle .
according to the G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m Stra@@ it , it is not clear whether the event was also carried out on 27 July .
he said that the camer@@ as to confirm the La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i stay in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ mil and the victim were a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the Grand Pla@@ za administration sent a letter to the people : &quot; the police work at the moment by finding a ch@@ ron@@ ology and victim background to events and examining the different mo@@ tives , including the possibility that this was a family dispute . &quot;
companies that help your businesses to avoid receiving the next U@@ b@@ reat@@ h
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure its e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were lu@@ cra@@ tive .
the answers were very often vague , useless or even worse .
and even if he promised to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; this system simply was not consistent and objective , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who will lead to the sale of e @-@ commerce companies operating with 75 employees in San Franc@@ is@@ co , who is in charge of the my@@ th in the T@@ e @-@ commerce company .
he therefore called for external parties .
in the wake of the new types of human resources , the start @-@ ups of a new type of human resources which will help businesses to find out what their workers feel .
developing and licen@@ sed software that aims to measure the involvement of workers , allowing them to make an act @-@ of @-@ art poll , to take firm teams and demographic groups , to give workers &apos; anon@@ y@@ mity and the monthly line of complaints and , in some cases , to allow manufacturers to by@@ pass the leaders of the C @-@ level and address directly to the Bureau .
&quot; there is now a tool such as Stra@@ it and F@@ it@@ bi , which is designed to monitor health , but where F@@ it@@ bi is called by Mr Bar@@ net , the co @-@ foun@@ der and the executive director Red@@ wood City start @-@ ups , a G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics use companies to measure the inclusion of workers in the measure of inclusion .
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , he has received three years when it has used the G@@ lin@@ ti , a much better overview of what its staff think and feel .
in addition to the surveys on the intervention and firm teams , it offers a company &apos;s heat card , which gives an overview of how the departments are the most complaints and the managers of which have the lowest support , allowing it to identify the reasons for the reasons .
companies have started to understand that they need to be aware of their culture of work , so that not change in the next U@@ b@@ reat@@ h , which has been insur@@ moun@@ ted in scandals since the former worker posted a blo@@ g , described by the har@@ as@@ sed environment in which those who da@@ red to speak should be punished .
for these start @-@ ups , such as G@@ lin@@ t , an overview of the desire for a business is an opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and conformity area may be in line with the website of the website of M@@ F@@ As , in accordance with the website of the website of M@@ F@@ As , which is worth more than $ 1@@ .@@ 7 billion by 2020 .
the degree of opinion of the S@@ ver@@ is Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o firm , which will help businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , observed this year in the face of a dubious reputation and activity growth in U@@ b@@ ber .
the c@@ enti@@ l is almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
the U@@ ber registered himself recently .
as G@@ lin@@ g , the label allows companies to send a tailor @-@ made impul@@ se , to collect real @-@ time confidential answers and to look at the problems of heat cards in areas of heat cards .
it also offers anon@@ ymous messages in a model that allows workers to know the inappropriate behaviour of the workers .
and when it comes to the executive , complaints are going directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has been an@@ cho@@ red by regulators &quot; said , Mr Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the Executive Director , Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that if a company treats its employees ill or in@@ adver@@ ten@@ tly , the company may face serious consequences , such as the boycott of the consumer , the departure of workers and court cases , even if regulators do not intervene .
the Ru@@ by , restaur@@ ant , P@@ ic@@ a@@ ture , which has more than 25 000 workers in 500 places , has used more than a year to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and offer easy way to intera@@ ct with the headquarters of the Corpor@@ ation .
if a worker wanted to notify the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or email addressed to the corpor@@ ation headquarters , and I hope that it will be taken seriously .
it was often a deterrent and in@@ convenient process , Mr James Vit@@ ran@@ o , who said that there was no good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , now that the company is used cen@@ tre@@ dly , it is possible to solve problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices which did not lead to the leading leaders in other cities or states , more quickly and to deal with them .
&quot; I will be able to get closer to a hol@@ y @-@ to @-@ ss experience of the workers , &quot; said Vit@@ be@@ o , who is headed by the Ru@@ by @-@ by @-@ by @-@ by @-@ line group of risk management groups .
&quot; and we defend our shareholders for liti@@ gation with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan has said that companies started to act in ethics , values and the involvement of workers more seriously in 2002 , or after the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen failed in connection with the ethical infringements of the Mar@@ r@@ oni scandal .
however , only when the social media became mature &apos; , it understood companies that they cannot prevent their b@@ reat@@ h publicly online .
&quot; before the use of the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used the hope of a strategy , &quot; said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and the convergence measure offer their software as a service , taking advantage of companies perio@@ dic@@ ally for their use of their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity which has the support of venture capital investors who have been based on both start @-@ ups .
it was cen@@ sored in February 10 million dollar such companies , such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and the Capital of Customs , thereby raising the value of capital for the value of 47 million dollars .
the G@@ lin@@ ti invested USD 10 million in November by B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture , by increasing its total funding to USD 60 million .
such investment will not come as a surprise when it comes to the interdependence of companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more studies show that modern workers are waiting for more than before .
competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley are high salaries and interesting projects merely on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued , and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy with the company , they feel that they are heard and that the work they are doing is satis@@ fying , they are more committed to ensuring the success of a company , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , who is the general benefit and the Vice @-@ President of the In@@ ter @-@ expert department , L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , which uses both the so @-@ called cen@@ cen@@ tri@@ c and G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors earn revenue if their companies belonging to their portfolio are doing well ; businesses are doing well when workers are committed and involved .
if the third party analy@@ sts are allowed to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , we do not have these support .
the possession of data on the involvement of workers is important , according to the experts &apos; culture of work .
however , these data are useless if the supervisory view@@ ers of the company are not going to do anything .
in fact , if a company asks its employees to receive feedback from its employees , expectations are expected to change .
and if the changes are not taken quickly or not at all , it could cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask the 4 000 proposals , you must be prepared to conver@@ t 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &apos; the Con@@ sul@@ tative and Business Management company K@@ ot@@ ter International President R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who has seen how companies make a mistake to rely too much on data collection .
&quot; because if things are not to be completed until the end , the workers are wondering : &apos; do you actually have heard me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Mad@@ ison Re@@ e@@ lis , which is now organising six studies , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem was reported by the G@@ lin@@ ti through the G@@ lin@@ ter .
and , after the decision @-@ making process and the quality of the communication , it was possible to re @-@ organise several teams in the enterprise and to provide communication training in order to address the problems .
however , in the Ru@@ by @-@ by @-@ by @-@ the @-@ eye , new data will be collected on workers and it is hoped that in the long term it will lead to the longer @-@ term commitment of workers , which is known in terms of its great labour flow .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose the people , &apos; Mr Kaz@@ be@@ o &apos; said .
&quot; and if you lose your people , you will lose your clients .
and if you lose your clients , you will lose businesses . &quot;
the sta@@ r of the euro area is the Bal@@ tics : an increase in income fast
although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had the effect of the Bal@@ tics , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , B@@ SE , referring to the report by the European Central Bank .
according to the ECB , since 1999 , the overall output of the economy per capita is expected , in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
there is a low debt burden , a rapid improvement in the institutions and business @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , however , are among the countries of the euro area , where the reactor has been significantly approaching the EU average of its GDP per capita , &quot; announced the Central Bank .
while the aim is to ensure that the overall output of the economy per capita is equal to the Western Europe , in 2015 , the overall output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2 / 3 of the average of 15 countries , which included the European Union before the enlargement rounds of 2004 .
low wages have led to a better pay for foreign countries .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light , and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania estimate that their economies are very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was slightly less than half of those questioned on their economies .
N@@ CA@@ A decision to lift two times a day to the trend of a return to Bru@@ in@@ si &apos;s days
at the moment , almost 23 , when a host of U@@ C@@ L@@ A football clubs will be suspended at the edge of a new exercise of a team of university university in the middle of a team .
some of them have been burdened by a qu@@ ib@@ ble , reve@@ aling their first days of work on their tre@@ asu@@ ries .
for a large proportion of the team , they will be able to make a break @-@ up to the middle day .
the deaf e@@ ars are going to take part after a three @-@ hour trend to learn from the tri@@ alogues , before returning to the W@@ W@@ man football front in the next morning at 6.@@ 30 meetings .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Bru@@ in@@ si tre@@ er , Jim Mor@@ a , before the Monday was on Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A decision to lift the burden on players in order to reduce the burden of players is in fact a day @-@ to @-@ day trend , in fact , for a longer period of time - at least to one half on Friday .
for the first time , the U@@ C@@ L@@ A was launched at 19.@@ 15 , in order to fit the already very tight schedule of players &apos; money .
the transition from a doub@@ tful place will mean more than one per cent of the day , the beginning of the Bru@@ in@@ si camp has been brought forward over a week before the last season , and the first time in Mor@@ a &apos;s six @-@ W@@ es@@ tw@@ l season is taking place during summer courses .
they are scheduled to take 18 weeks to 20 August , before the formal preparation of the opening @-@ up of the T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M @-@ M @-@ M @-@ M @-@ Ma@@ x in September .
according to Mr Mor@@ a , he is in favour of a change of rules in the N@@ CA@@ A , although it adds another item on the close schedu@@ les of players .
&quot; they have huge burdens on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they are breaking out of this challenge ; they are making a lot of fine young people .
I believe that if there is a Saturday and we have more time , it will be a real bit . &quot;
if the camp is closed , U@@ C@@ L@@ A will be closed down , which is not , however , a simple task , given the clear view of the fact that the cle@@ arest possible par@@ king of their findings and by side L@@ us@@ kin@@ i &apos;s centre , a higher class ho@@ tels , which has already become a ga@@ te@@ way from a protective net from a net shel@@ ters .
from this weekend , the Bru@@ in@@ si players will be occupying ho@@ tels , but Mor@@ a admitted that there may be problems with free tobacco during the season .
&apos;@@ We take security measures &apos; , said Mor@@ a .

if there is a record of a record , it can do a good deal .
however , we are using a security team there and 8 par@@ king stations .
we are doing our best using the best .
I will try not particularly to worry about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the Association of Ele@@ ction of the O@@ jul@@ and , the Reform Group , which was launched by the Central Pri@@ x of the Climate Party , the de@@ sig@@ ner of the O@@ jul@@ and , the European Central Bank , is forced to go into the hands of the forces created by Mrs Kal@@ j@@ s , who will be in the hands of the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the European Commission , in Tallinn , which seems to be a party @-@ party in the first place in local elections this year , at least as much as political parties are in the local elections .
however , more buses are considered in the autumn , and the key issue will be whether the voters will be disappointed enough to all of them .
who remains in Sa@@ du@@ are@@ ga ?
if a small country has declined from the supporters of the Ed@@ gar Sa@@ du@@ are , he can anticipate the events organised by his electoral union .
one of the Member States , some of the former and the current middle @-@ party players , and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and is there any reason why , in Tallinn , some of the sea@@ men are fai@@ th@@ ful to the gu@@ es@@ ts and wars , can look for the list of &apos; Sa@@ du@@ are the &apos; Sa@@ du@@ are list &apos; , which is , at the forefront of corruption and suspected corruption , is becoming a reality ?
the Russian @-@ speaking bo@@ g of film @-@ driven mus@@ ici@@ ans , which will take part in the town of Re@@ search@@ ers in the town of Lap@@ land ; and in every sense the original computer game , which the Prime Minister J@@ Ã¼@@ ri Ra@@ tas , has to avoid trying to evade and or@@ ch@@ es@@ ts on the road to the ballot box , is the first time that the voters of the 16@@ th and 17@@ th year old voters who are promised to take part in the ballot box ?
we look forward to the views of the political parties on the youth election campaign .
if the channel 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 look at the city of enter@@ tainment rather than the beginning of August , two options will remain to be agreed , in the future , only with the ET@@ V , ET@@ V + + , Tallinn TV and English , and to surrender each month &apos;s 10 to some television operators .
there are probably also those who openly re@@ jo@@ ice at the beginning of advertising tele@@ visions , but at the end of the day - although reluc@@ tantly - television and advertise@@ ments pay .
the de@@ af@@ ening music , l@@ ent people and the ri@@ b@@ rub@@ b@@ ish left in the streets are an un@@ pleasant side of any more mus@@ ici@@ ans .
however , if we do not want to become a man , it is worthwhile to go to the home country , instead of pain@@ ting pain , and a s@@ lee@@ ping for the lun@@ g for the F@@ esti@@ val .
Washington change the rules of the Green Card
media publications are quot@@ ing President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who said that the new US immigration plan , which is going to change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan envisages a reduction of the number of legal immigrants per year by 50 000 people per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary working visas and restrictions on family orientation with visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the re@@ public@@ ans and the President .
the draft law is going to be discussed in the two chamber of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars on taxpayers &apos; money , as the way in which the US is issuing green maps to citizens of other countries of the US .
the law reduces migration and will replace the current programme .
the new application process will give the candidates to the candidates who are speaking English and who have financial resources to support their own economies , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp America , according to media publications in the United States .

how much was the case in Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century in order to get the land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8@@ 000 .
I took note of the rum@@ ours of Si@@ b@@ erian men who have also thought about this .
it is very difficult to say , because at that time there was up to 30 people in one group , but the passport was only a man .
the passport was granted only to one , but it was children , nur@@ ses and women .
look at how much this territory was here !
this was a number of times the historic S@@ et@@ oma@@ ist .
after all , it was necessary to manage , in some way .
S@@ et@@ ry came here as a farm po@@ t , but their life change , because they were in the areas that were not only in agriculture but also in the river ( pal@@ try ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , a new @-@ Pet@@ ser@@ t went on a do@@ zen later the city of K@@ ras@@ no@@ ara @-@ 45 ( where the Soviet power was built from uranium enrichment - Mr P@@ . ) , when it was formed .
was there a majority in the region at the time in the region ?
yes , they lived in a com@@ pac@@ ket .
in addition , a long tradition of mar@@ ry is maintained , and many children .
seven @-@ eight children were common@@ place .
how much of the Si@@ b@@ erian culture diff@@ ered and different from that of the mother tongue ?
they are different , although what was said here was never the same .
they brought about a great deal of money .
they did , too , also ( the shadow ideas ) , but they always made a distinction between what was set and what was done here .
climate change was severely affected by the traditional ri@@ ce , because there is a me@@ tre of me@@ als here .
the proposed change has changed .
for example , S@@ et@@ oma@@ al meat was the salt of meat , but here it was simply frozen .

it seems to me that this Se@@ ar@@ land will now have to influence them .

the O@@ oper@@ is@@ ol@@ ist Tam@@ mes , apart from everything else , has been in the way in which the three eyes of the river have been used : &apos; that this place is at the city of the city , no one may come up with the s@@ no@@ ws &apos; .

the police arrested on 1 August this morning in Si@@ th@@ harmony on the island of Si@@ th@@ harmony , including two Bulg@@ arians , among whom was also two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said television TV , the Bulgarian television channel , that Bulg@@ arians could be released later .
the Greek authorities have increased free ten@@ dering restrictions and are already imposing severe fines on all those who are caught in a separate location which is not foreseen for this purpose .
the controls will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may appoint a fine .

the rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and the draft amending law on plant protection law .
the amendment to the law will give rise to the creation of a separate data collection for the crops of GM ( GM ) as well as for operators in the future , using a plant health register .
furthermore , the obligation of GM crops to have a prior agreement on the appropri@@ a@@ teness of the radio ap@@ ic@@ ulture concerned will be amended .
although there is currently no cultivation of GM crops in Estonia , we need clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as it is not up to the Estonian GMO to declare the country , Mr S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , the Chairman of the World Health Department , Mr S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi .
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , to take advantage of costs and administrative burdens on both private and public sectors , in the annex .
the draft law repe@@ als the data collection and treatment of GM crops and operators in the field of GM crops , establishes the provisions on the handling of GM crops and the requirements for starting economic activities .
in relation to the specific ap@@ ic@@ ulture , as regards the cultivation of GM crops , the current obligation to inform bee@@ keepers of the cultivation of GM crops with the obligation to achieve an appropriate agreement on the cultivation of bee@@ keepers prior to the introduction of an agreement with the bee@@ kee@@ per .
the draft law has been sent to minis@@ tries in coordination .
all interested parties will be able to examine the draft content in the information system , and if they wish to present their views on the World Health Ministry .
the proposed changes will affect persons in particular in the area of plant farming , bee@@ keepers and agricultural authorities .
in the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10 .
however , no Estonian farmer has been able to increase the cultivation of GM crops .
the reason is that in Estonia there are no ma@@ gic w@@ ounds , a European vo@@ cation of a European che@@ mis@@ line , which is a ma@@ gic t@@ ree of mon 8@@ 10 resistant .
it is also a line that has been swe@@ pt to the south of the south and it is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
in order to obtain certainty , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned research in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible GM organisms in Estonia , the seeds of maize and soya vari@@ eties in Estonia , maize and soya .
the results of the sam@@ ples tested showed that seeds were not included in the host and concluded that the seeds , maize and soya vari@@ eties in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms .
it may , in turn , be concluded that in Estonia , there is no deliberate cultivation of GM crops , and it was also confirmed that there has been no accident .

the White House has cost taxpayers a thousand
according to the open military documents announced by the letter of the press , the White House decision to fly the sea helicop@@ ter in the event of a ceremony in the south of the world last month to the end of American production would have to pay USD 24 000 .
the green and white col@@ ours S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , which is called the President of the President , Mrs One &apos;@@ dam , was a central feature of the event that took place on 17 July in Val@@ mas on 17 July .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence and the White House were informed by the higher officials in the field of industrial products from all 50 states .
S@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ tis was built on a s@@ nap@@ shot of the image of the winning city , W@@ is@@ con@@ ha@@ di , a fire @-@ fighting car and a Mis@@ tral turn , in S@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ tis .
the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ is , the J@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ is , responsible for the operation of the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ is one ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) , in accordance with the documents , called the White House for a military c@@ abinet , a hand@@ ful of the presence of F@@ AR@@ G@@ O @-@ F@@ AR@@ G@@ O @-@ F@@ AR@@ G@@ O , a tiny 36 hours before the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter &apos; event &apos; .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because this is an un@@ usually high level of attention , &quot; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 kom@@ com@@ Ã¶@@ r , a day before the event , in the field of the sea , the chief officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
the message was noted that helicop@@ ter arri@@ ves at the southern he@@ ight of 17 July this morning at 15 o &apos;@@ clock , and remains to be held up to the end of the evening and 21 .
the fact that , if the departure of the V@@ om@@ est from Maj@@ est leave is to be , there is a need for second @-@ time pa@@ per@@ es due to the restrictions on working time .
the original flight crew were at a helicop@@ ter at a time and the es@@ c@@ ill@@ ary security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its long term .
the documents provided by the letter of the time have not been possible to read whether you were at the end of the second time in the past , or not .
the H@@ at@@ ch law prohibits the use of federal workers for political purposes for political purposes .
the documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 examined whether this event can violate this provision .
&quot; we wonder whether this is a breach of the H@@ at@@ ch law , and we were told that there is no ri@@ ce , &apos; written com@@ man@@ der .
&apos;@@ It seems that you have no choice &apos; , &apos; responded by a leading officer &apos; .
the White House announced the &apos; official event &apos; in America and the H@@ at@@ ch law would not have been covered by the H@@ at@@ ch .
however , even in the official events , there are political under@@ ton@@ es .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Senate had supported the efforts of health reform in the Senate at the time and approved efforts to prevent government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as &apos; Marine One or Air Force &apos; is not a new phenomenon for a politically profitable purpose .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use these purely photo@@ graph@@ s is unusual .
in February , it would be brought to mind when the President of his first campaign in Flor@@ ale Mel@@ bour@@ ne Mel@@ bour@@ ne , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the President , and he from Twitter to account from the messages that complain about how his predecessor , the President of his predecessor , used his or her predecessor .
&quot; the White Ma@@ l is very pleased to put forward &apos; in America , where products were represented in all 50 states , which have been prepared by American American American American workers &apos; , &quot; said White House spokes@@ man for his duty and L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams are often in the vic@@ inity of Washington and the southern hor@@ ses in order to get the US President of the United States with the White House of a c@@ enti@@ me@@ try with a c@@ enti@@ me@@ try .
when T@@ ru@@ mp July at the G20 Summit in Germany , the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House was organised by the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House .
according to business , the flight was considered to be the norm for the flight to be made in America by the flight crew in America .
at the time , the Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r helicop@@ ters , in addition to 11 hours of the &apos; President @-@ in @-@ support mission &apos; , were not yet another .
the White House , according to the White House , has not been burdened by any other attempt at the taxpayer &apos;s pockets of the taxpayer .
according to S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , the company &apos;s helicop@@ ter was not involved in organising the se@@ am@@ less effort of the South .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 does not maintain the budgetary documents of the President &apos;s flights and the precise costs of the event are difficult to find out .
however , at the time of the Ministry of Defence in 2017 , there is an amount of EUR 24 380 per hour on the basis of compensation for the A@@ H @-@ 3@@ D .
the Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r &apos;s documents were mentioned by Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o on the flight from Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o to Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , both on the main basis of the flight , to Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using helicop@@ ter is very much below the amount .
the calculation of taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates include a number of other irreversible costs for the staff , maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account in the annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 @-@ 2015 survey , compensa@@ tory salaries in the Ministry of Defence do not include compensa@@ tory costs for personnel costs , but they cover costs related to fuel , care and contracts .
the former spokes@@ person of the White House Se@@ an S@@ pic@@ er defended the use of helicop@@ ter at the time .
&quot; the point is to show the things in America this week , &quot; said S@@ pic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that the State of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ ti is very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security and that there are already hundreds of hundreds if not even thousands of people whose work depends on this .
and I believe that just like the majority of the Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether T@@ ru@@ mp cages in the south of the South will be able to circu@@ late together with a helicop@@ ter or not , but the fire bri@@ gade was a father behind him .
in the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky was approached by T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , on the media &apos;s media to make a jo@@ ke of products in his personal aircraft .

is the two days &apos; time all this worth ?
we had a long thought , but it was a peace of peace .
I have got to think about it .
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , it was time for himself to be treated and thought to be treated .
&quot; I knew that I am still not putting the pic@@ g on the table , talking about his self @-@ net from his self @-@ net .
I received a clean one from a clean front and to go ahead with the new momentum .
Mrs Anne Nag@@ k said that it was neg@@ ligent to look at the suffering , but it has realised that , in particular , spor@@ ts@@ man itself has to find itself out of itself .
after all , he was so d@@ res@@ sed by all .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&apos;@@ G@@ i , however , he said he does not sign and he wants to prove what it is worth &apos; , says mountain .
there is now some kind of peace .
he is doing so to my joy .
the contest came back in May when the S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o set a new Estonian record of 6@@ 280 points in the S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o C@@ Ã¶t@@ z@@ itself .
in a high @-@ level competition , she was able to have a personal mar@@ ry at the he@@ ight of the moon ( 13.@@ 89 ) and drink a record of the hur@@ ric@@ ane hur@@ ric@@ ane .
then there was a patchwork of competition , so that it is not at all the capacity , but was removed from the first star@@ vation of competition .
for many years , I say that the words of the S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o are a student .
he is ready to be spor@@ ts@@ man , she is a good training .
if something is wrong or is wrong , he will say it immediately .
he feels his own father and tr@@ usted its feeling .
that is what we must do .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we follow it .
the new approach has also been found in Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
&quot; I am not one who is going to make the most of the trend , he speaks and say that the most important thing is the right to take care , because it also guarantees a good result .
I will be happy with the baby &apos;s baby .
there has also been good emo@@ tion for the S@@ ade@@ i@@ ko@@ man , as well .
her former com@@ posite , Mar@@ i hill and Gre@@ te , recently received the parents &apos; grand@@ parents and have received a lot of support from new weather citizens .
&apos;@@ It is quite interesting &apos; , words to Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
one alcohol , which is equivalent to the &apos; training &apos; of the brain , is one alcohol .
the Li@@ ves@@ ty wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is a father , so high wine , so that it believes that it can be trained better than any other thing in the world .
the She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist at Y@@ ale .
his message is not a matter of alcohol or how it affects our feelings and ideas , but instead of &apos; very active &apos; wine &apos; in the process of flav@@ ours .
by persu@@ ading wine , the be@@ ating of wine in a complex , enjo@@ y@@ ment and ex @-@ post perception we are putting our own work in order to create a taste for wine .
according to the She@@ per@@ di , there is not really a taste , but a taste in the way in which wine is stimu@@ lated .
he will bring about the way in which the brain is &apos; col@@ ours &apos; .
&apos;@@ The taste in the wine is not a taste for wine , the taste of the wine &apos; , says She@@ per@@ d .
things that are still affecting the taste of wine are , for example , our van@@ ity , gender and even sy@@ l@@ je , which man produces .
of course , the wine is not , of course , that wine is not full .
&quot; there must be more &apos; activities &apos; , he says .
if you are too long , the system has been over@@ crow@@ ded .
the excessive drinking of wine can , at times , cause damage to the brain - according to the 2004 survey , people who drink over three sets of wine , memory loss , loss of balance and a reduced mental power .
10 % of the ICT sector in Estonia receives fewer salaries from colleagues

according to the United Nations , the role of Afghan democracy in politics
the head of the UN Afghanistan mission , on Wednesday , said that the elections will only be able to represent the people if all members of society , including women , play their role .
the UN Assistance Mission , Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , said that hundreds of women are standing in local Soviet elections , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % recently registered by women .
&quot; the role of women in underlining the importance of women cannot be exagg@@ erated , &quot; said on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have been threatened by the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with a transitional period when the role of international military operations is becoming advis@@ able .
this year &apos;s elections will mark the first time that power is made cal@@ mly by the democratically elected government over the next .
according to the Ha@@ ys@@ mal , women play an increasing role in democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the Afghan independent electoral Commission , 1.2 million women have registered with 1.2 million registered voters .
it is a pleasure to make every difference to the big and small .
the common time has always been too little , but it is a good opportunity to combine meetings , a game , proximity and the burden .
and what convenient solution - wherever you were stu@@ pid in the summer , live life is always accompanied by , and reminds us of the very fine words of the eye : &apos; we are now making a trend ! &apos;
A@@ life insu@@ lation - very good is a very good gold game , or the sin@@ king of the coast@@ lines .
is it a foundation of permanent and rou@@ tin@@ ely permanent standing - who , in the summer , would like to take the form of s@@ lee@@ ping sand in the summer ?
it is nice to use children instead of being used .
firstly , it is a secure and convenient , ras@@ h , growing at the same pace as training and force .
there is also a great deal to do with big children .
the child is as@@ certain@@ ing a balance , it is clear that things are repeated and it is up to the chance to get a high level of attention and be important .
more children can do the same at the same time .
the scale of movement is set up in the area of land , and you are rus@@ hing .
the fin@@ gers right , you are asking a mini @-@ stick properly to keep them properly .
the child can read the fla@@ ts and feel as a tre@@ asu@@ rer .
the Plan@@ k is very high , but an ever @-@ free exercise for the child is hope@@ lessly .
however , it is easy to make things easier .
the game of plan@@ k : take a long plan@@ k for a long plan@@ k , which will be eradi@@ cated .
in fact , it is more difficult , but much more indul@@ gent to do if , in the meantime , you can give your hands to a friend .
in order to add burdens , we can stay at the plants , te@@ ars , and it is also going to go around .
in addition , the pu@@ zz@@ ling of a child may be placed on the pu@@ zz@@ ling of a child , but this exercise offers an end to all children .
at the same time , if the tap is sand , the tri@@ ump@@ h , ash and air mus@@ cles like conta@@ gious .
the child comes into the sho@@ es so that his body is distributed equally and wants to do so .
the market will be able to keep the game .
the sho@@ es and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly get straight away .
I will be able to fly , to have a balance , to strike a balance , and to be the ones .
the lives of a small engine@@ er will be tra@@ pped when it is possible to have a small minority in every way .
the additional burden will provide sho@@ es in advance .
in order to keep a blind eye on a neutral location .
children themselves have a lot of fu@@ tile to do a sca@@ m and a pla@@ te .
there is a job and a bat@@ ch on the bat@@ ons .
follow the child &apos;s safety , the pro@@ position , and the hor@@ ror in a neutral position .
all children &apos;s fav@@ ou@@ rite and great sal@@ vation !
at the same time , the age of age is truly effective as a whole .
S@@ por@@ tic instruments were O@@ ur ( 10 ) , S@@ Ã¤@@ ves ( 8 ) , happ@@ iness ( 4 ) .
in the Philippines a wide @-@ ranging trip to a mo@@ ef@@ ics of a wider world , a civil servan@@ t in the Philippines
in the light of red bags , the summer clas@@ s@@ room , which has become an end in the last few years , which is one of the right bro@@ kers in the last few years , and which has been able to have the tra@@ il of a mo@@ ck@@ ery , despite its modest origin , has been able to extra@@ ct the price of an appropriate price .
there is probably one of the things that have been red @-@ red , which is one of the things that have existed in one order and that has not been given any special emo@@ tion .
it is simply there , and if there is no overla@@ p .
however , there is now a real victory for be@@ er and a mo@@ ef@@ ics have swit@@ ched to their mus@@ h@@ rooms from the summer months instead of simple be@@ er bags against plastic carrier bags .
it is not just a coast@@ line , but today it is just as popular as it is today , and the courageous women do not even walk into the office .
however , at this point , it is worth making clear whether or not this summer &apos;s summer of summer is going to be held or a mar@@ ty@@ r , however , and , however , a little more official to be rejected .
however , the wealth of ri@@ fe has made the love of women &apos;s real summer love .
for example , when it comes to foreign mo@@ tives , the first thing is that the mo@@ u@@ gh@@ urs are saying that they are going to be the first thing in the first place on the local market , and acquiring a couple of be@@ aches to which the whole range of holiday time is , and which is accompanied by rigour , on the market and also as a friend to the city .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are so generous that they buy the market from the market and sell them to their loyal read@@ ers .
it is worth pointing out that there is a high level of demand among the sa@@ vers for the read@@ ers in the world , so that women in the world are going to be involved in the world ( and men ! ) , apparently , to be involved in each other &apos;s fish .
in some ways , such mad@@ ness is also understandable , because it is rare for them to be repeated when the motto is going to be able to buy just a few of the ten euros for a few decades .
it is true that the lou@@ dest traders have also discovered a simple use of money , and so sell the br@@ un@@ t of luxury br@@ ands , and also for a few hundred years ago .
obviously , that the richer customers should not feel as easy to feel , who will be pro@@ tag@@ ing around the pro@@ tag@@ s of low @-@ cost homes .
for example , it is possible to buy D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a , for example , over EUR 1 000 .
however , the interpretation of the interpretation of Chan@@ el could be carried out in the circulation of 6 000 euros .
in contrast to most of the mo@@ tives , there are no qu@@ eries from some of the big fashi@@ ons , but their story started in a far more distant way .
in particular , the be@@ er is allegedly coming from the Philippines , where they have not been subjected to a wide range of them .
the l@@ ot@@ tery has been s@@ tun@@ ned there , in particular , in the case of export trade , and there is very often no room for the local people .
it is alleged that the 14@@ th century has been said , and it is quite a hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous bun@@ dle of normal cor@@ ps .
however , as there is not such a strong red force as a bas@@ ket , they can be subjected to mus@@ ici@@ ans and other materials that are made more person@@ alised and also more active .
for example , in recent times , there are very many cha@@ mbers of col@@ ours where red col@@ oured col@@ oured pa@@ ints or car@@ cas@@ ses .
in particular , the j@@ arg@@ on , however , can be sent to the be@@ er , in particular , to send an actor in J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , the largest red be@@ er po@@ cket before it was foreseen .
it was compatible with the be@@ er of all the we@@ aring ap@@ para@@ tus , and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
however , it does not play a smaller role in the popul@@ arity of the Jews , but also that caring for them is a ke@@ y@@ stone and , unlike all the others , it is not up to these special instruments to care , but also the water and mar@@ ty@@ r .
as in the case of the tr@@ end@@ y gau@@ ge , there are all sorts of interpretations that have come out of a classic appearance .
for example , there is a desire to purchase red lines for be@@ er , or rather a tiny s@@ le@@ ep , for example .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classic sl@@ ur@@ ry will never be a mo@@ ck@@ le , but it is a mo@@ ck@@ ery .
but what is classic be@@ er ?
for centuries , there has been a classic ban on be@@ er bags , which rese@@ mb@@ les a repetition of its style , is open and short , and it is short , as well as be@@ er .

G@@ M@@ B is worried about investment in the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e plant in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e .
the trade union is awaiting confirmation from the leaders of the long @-@ term production plans in the G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant in G@@ las@@ go@@ w .
according to the Scot@@ land of G@@ M@@ B , the company has remained silent on the future of this investment .
in the case of H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich @-@ minded people , and other products are working more than 500 people .
the company Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e , Mr Pla@@ di , said that they have invested more than GBP 5 million over the last few years .
the workers and the union chair@@ men of the trade union are the first to hear , if something is changing in the activities of the plant .
in a letter sent to the company &apos;s site , G@@ M@@ B Scotland gave the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e company Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to the request that the funding is not used to modernise the production routes . &quot;
the G@@ M@@ B parental organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y , said : &apos; the fact that we cannot provide clarity with the main head of the label on the business needs and the future investment plan for the future , is deeply concerned by our members .
there have been several generations of families here , and the workforce is largely made up of local community and the people around G@@ las@@ go@@ w , as an essential pillar in order to ensure decent employment in the region where high unemployment is high and social weather .
in view of the jobs , salaries and welfare of the G@@ las@@ go@@ w , and in the light of the chronic damage to production , a growing company in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e and the chronic damage to production are urgently needed in the context of the G@@ las@@ go@@ w . &quot;
the Pla@@ design representative said : &apos; the head of the Customs Council was a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ ch only yesterday and the company meets him directly because we value an active relationship with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers and the representatives of the G@@ M@@ B , which discussed an open range of problems in an open way .
we discussed the workers , like all the companies in the extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we look at our activities at a time - and this applies to all our companies and objects - to ensure its competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million in customs and more than GBP 5 million , most of it has gone into production routes and improvements .
we fully understand that at the time when it comes to the heritage of the production site and where there should be any changes in the activities of the object , workers and trade union representatives are the first to hear it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G alert Barcelona three years ago for convergence ?
with the Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti , the la can regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti
the Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main does not bring in the attempt to attract Mr mar in his ranks by making an offer of GBP 18@@ 9 million , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record con@@ qu@@ ered ret@@ te ?
this sound approach has opened the summer &apos;s transition , and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break down more than double the current world record , which was set up at the last season by Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returning to the Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ ba @-@ 89 million .
if the transition is completed , Mrs Ney@@ mar@@ ra will be able to become the most expensive player in the world and , at the same time , the highest paid professional spor@@ ts@@ man in the world , who will be able to pay over GBP 500 000 a week after the payment of the PS@@ G .
Barcelona is , of course , a reference to the way in which it is considered , and also because of the liber@@ ation of Mrs Ney@@ ra , although a source close to the chair of Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ i confirms that the club is in football for the whole of his San@@ to@@ tus in 2013 .
but has the PS@@ G warned a football world for this opportunity three years ago ?
when a Manch@@ ester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Bla@@ ise Ma@@ tu@@ c Treaty in 2014 , the N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ gar@@ f warned all those who are thinking about the best players in the number of PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that if they concern some of our players , we will be against them and take contact with those players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hell .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
however , if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they must face the consequences . &quot;
the Barcelona seems to have taken this limit , as Spain has seen the interest of the PS@@ G central player in the previous summer in Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G has made it clear that they will not be allowed to leave and that the Barcelona can become a set@@ back as a result of this interest , by abolishing Mrs mar@@ ry as one of its expensive assets .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t .
&quot; Bre@@ x@@ e is seriously threatened by the beau@@ ty of the Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , a &apos; warned Var@@ ad@@ er first visit to Northern Ireland after his entry into office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the free movement of people and goods , said Var@@ ad@@ y@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : to build bridges , not borders , it emphasised .
he said that he would prefer Britain to be part of the European Union , and because it cannot be seen as a part of the European common market .
this would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
the second option to make the withdrawal of Britain more smoo@@ ther would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement was in existence with Turkey , the Var@@ ad@@ y@@ r said &apos; certainly we could have such Britain &apos; .
the alternative to this would be to return to the customs points that would be a historic division and a political failure .
&quot; raise your trade , prosperity and peace , &quot; said Irish Prime Minister .
he mentioned Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that it could affect every aspect of the daily lives of Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met Bel@@ fast visiting the leaders of the main parties of Northern Ireland .
