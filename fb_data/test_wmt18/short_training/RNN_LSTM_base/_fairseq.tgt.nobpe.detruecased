Four members of Cape Verde and Spain were held in Estonia
According to Mr Posselt , the police , in Spain , held a group of KCape Gulevich , the leader of the so @-@ called KCape KCape KCape KCape KCape KCape KCape KCape KCape KCape rovski .
In the case of Gulevich , in Spain , the Court of Justice was arrested .
Yesterday , the Court also took three suspects who were detained in Estonia .
In terms of suspicion , the so @-@ called KCape rovo is a year of a real Community of people aged between 27 and 57 years of life , mainly committing drug crimes .
In Spain , in the province of Male province , the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained .
In Estonia , three men were detained in the suspect , one of them has been collected according to the criminal Community leading figures , and two are members of the criminal community .
The data collected indicate that the criminal community was clearly divided into the challenges and roles .
The purpose of the actual Community activities was to commit drug crimes , and thus serve the proceeds of crime , &quot; commented on the head of pre @-@ trial proceedings , public prosecutors , Vatica Verte .
&quot; We do not rule out that the circle of criminal offences in question is increasing , the Prosecutor .
It is the people who have also been involved in the interests of law enforcement authorities , and some of them have suffered punishment for drug crimes .
The Verte emphasised that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; International cooperation is the norm for us , and the operation of this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation &apos; , commented on the Prosecutor Verte .
The leader of the Environment police Office , ago Leat , said that the detention was preceded by nearly half a year of prior examination .
The first half of the week &apos;s work in the first half of the week , and at the same time , in Estonia and Spain , we have been suspected of crimes .
It added that officials in the central criminal police were helpful in detention in Spain .
For years , we have a good contact and mutual understanding between the Spanish police and civilian card .
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we will also be able to have a second Europe in the rest of Europe , said Lein .
The information collected so far indicates that there can be a suspicion of suspicion by men in freedom of access to the perpetrators of new crimes , which is why the prosecution service has been requested by the Prosecutor &apos;s Office and the Court also approved it .
In Spain , he is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
In the context of this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash will have been seized in order to guarantee confiscation .
The legal proceedings of the Criminal Court will lead to an organised crime of criminal police organised by the central police and lead the public prosecution office .
The city of Tallinn , the city of Gulevich , was convicted of blackmail in 2005 and punished him with a five @-@ year imprisonment .
In the middle of the last decade , Mr Tarankov was held on the basis of a wide @-@ ranging Tarankov in the Estonian criminal world .
Cape Verde &apos;s Gulevich rose from the beginning of the 1990s , when he began to deal with blackmail in Tallinn in the beginning of the 1990s .
Admittedly , the taxi and prostitution carried out by the various hotel hotels and called for a monthly withcharge for businessmen .
International joint operations , the confiscation of criminal proceeds and the judgments in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
For example , the last court rulings , the so @-@ called &apos; Dikai crime &apos; , the eight accused persons who have been confiscated by EUR 80 000 in criminal terms , or the judgment against nine persons in the case of any person , Mr Igor Aleynikov , in 2006 , which was aimed at illegal trade in secret cigarettes , aimed at combating the illegal trade and trafficking of cigarettes in East Virgin and in South Estonia .
The large scale of seizure of criminal proceeds is around EUR 71 500 .
In these criminal matters , progress has been made to ensure that police officers exchange information and prosecutors every day with their foreign counterparts and , if necessary , be carried out together in any case in the European Union .
The Citizens &apos; Rights group warns the sourisat travel
The National Association for the Advanmates of Colored People has warned the people of the State of the State of State discriminating against a Mistral and racist attack .
In writing . - ( PT ) In the statement of the group , it says : &apos; Missouri in the state of sugar issued by the State of the State , which applies until 28 August 2017 , calls on all the African Americans , visitors and sourians to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious in the state of the entire state , taking into account the whole of the rotten racial events that have recently taken place in the state and at this point of view . &quot;
According to NAP , the group urged the group to issue a travel warning , so that the so @-@ called &quot; Misouri law &quot; law , which makes discrimination against cases of discrimination more difficult , and the fact that the state of play of the State of the state is unequal in the case of minorities .
&quot; Citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
They are being drawn up because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said NAla Missouri , President Rod Chapel @-@ newspaper The Kansin City Star .
&quot; We have never received so much complaints . &quot;
This is the first warning that the organisation has issued on the state of the US .
Mrs RÃ¼hle referred to such events as the racist insult to the students of a Mistral class student and the horrendous story of 28 @-@ year @-@ old muscle scandals originating in Tennesta .
The ers died in the beginning of this year under dubious circumstances , after the country had to carry out a liquetal and Missouri police carried out by the police , without being accused of a crime .
In addition , the comment refers to the recently drafted report by the Chief Prosecutor of the Missouri Chief Prosecutor , which shows that the state of play in the State of Chief of car for Like drivers is more likely to be at 75 % more likely than those of samples .
&apos;The point is for people to be aware of and warn their families , friends and co @-@ men for what can happen in the Missouris case &apos; , &apos; said Chapel .
&quot; People are willing to be ready , whether it is to be spent on vonialism or informing relatives about the fact that they are crossing the state . &quot;
On the basis of the latest data from FBI hate crime , the report was documented in 100 hate crime in 2015 , which places the state of play in the country &apos;s cross @-@ section of the country in a country similar to the number of offences .
The warning is also in response to the new law of the Missouri , which makes it difficult for the company to be prosecuted in search of discrimination on the grounds of housing or work .
The American Civil Liberties Association ( ACLU ) was issued earlier in the case of Texas and Arizona , following the adoption by these states of immigration laws , which met local authorities for human rights violations , because , according to the ACLU , it increases racial profiling .
Normally , the travel warnings are being issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but at the last time interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to the laws and trends of the United States .
Hepatitis : What can anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
Hepatitis , which may well have been caused by hepatitis - A , B , C , D and E @-@ hepatitis - could be caused by Hepatitis .
All these viruses provoke the insane burn .
However , the worst cost is chronic B and C hepatitis , which can develop in a circus , or to pay for cancer , and pay for cancer .
The epidemiology of the Health Agency , Mr Kurel , is speaking that the acute disease of hepatitis disease is the same for all species of liver , a fever , fatigue , plundering , estation , omefication , stunheapain , ruthless emissions , waggery , wooder and species of meat , and navies and masterhouses .
The last hour of death also comes from a pot @-@ by @-@ fire name , with cancer .
Children can move from hepatitis without a disease .
The various species in the Mainum can only be identified as a basis for a laboratory study .
Extreme hepatitis can go on from chronic hepatitis and for decades without the disease , which means that man may not know anything about the harmful disease that is harmful to it .
Mr Kurel will bring different forms of hepatitis and describe their way out of them .
Hepatitis viruses spread ill and infectious us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , seaflets , infected people &apos;s emissions and handouts to food , soil , objects , sugar , and drug consumption .
Hepatitis hepatitis , family members and carers , chronic pay @-@ related people who are suffering from hepatitis risk , who are sexually sex people , men sex men , drug users , hepatitis high @-@ spread countries visiting countries travelling by hepatitis high .
Women can be prevented by vaccinations , particularly in the case of a vaccination in a number of passengers who are travelling and hepatitis at risk .
In addition , it is important to meet the daily hygiene requirements : To wash or disinfect the hands of the hand before the consumption of all fruit and vegetables is washed .
Hepatitis viruses spread sick people in contact with blood , drug @-@ injection , affection , autism , bloodshed , blood @-@ contaminated sites ( toothpine , pregnant facilities ) , the use of donors with blood , hepatitis hepatitis , and hepatitis / copper @-@ born baby .
Hepatitis hepatitis is exposed to drug users , sex partners , men who live with men , sex men , mother @-@ newborn people , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , and the risk of health , rescue and police , and B hepatitis , are visiting the people who are visiting the hepatitis .
In order to prevent hepatitis , people can be vaccinated ; in particular , it is recommended to vaccinate people from risk groups and , as well as chronic pay diseases , HIV infections , sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes .
Hepatitis would be subject to preventive measures : Refraining from the hygiene and manacity of strangers , other sharp resources and systalgic @-@ councillor @-@ advice , hepatitis and aughony , and the use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection , or prevention of sexual risk behaviour .
Vaccination against hepatitis is a part of the national immunity plan and for children free of charge .
C hepatitis hepatitis spread sick people in contact with blood , drug @-@ injection , augmentation , augmentation , blood @-@ contaminated sites , the use of donors , hepatitis hepatitis , sex sex and hepatitis .
C @-@ hepatitis C @-@ hepatitis will inject drug users , sex partners of people , sex men , sex men , mother @-@ newborn people , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , and other bodies of health , rescue and police , HIV infection and the high incidence of hepatitis C visits to passengers .
Spatitis preventive measures are : Refraining from the hygiene and manacity of strangers , other sharp resources and systalgic @-@ councillor @-@ advice , and the use of hepatitis and aughony , and the use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infections .
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C .
The hepatitis hepatitis produces a D virus , which will spread to the presence of hepatitis B .
This is why D hepatitis B , with hepatitis B or super @-@ lecctions , from chronic B @-@ hepatitis .
Hepatitis viruses spread exposure to blood and other body liquids , with contaminated coal @-@ cocounters , sexually and seldom infected .
The hepatitis risks of hepatitis B is chronic B @-@ hepatitis , and the immunity of hepatitis B .
Effective preventive action is vaccinated against hepatitis B , which protects people from hepatitis virus infection .
Hepatitis viruses spread the feeble of drinking water and food , including low @-@ treated animal meat , fish and marine carbons , the blood of the donors , joint sychestales and who have been infected with hope .
Passengers may be infected by hepatitis high by hepatitis in countries .
The prevention of hepatitis preventive measures is a breach of hygiene requirements : Washing or disinfectants after boarding , before food production and feed , after hospital care .
Fruits and vegetables , before consumption , avoid the eating of heat @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption .
Although the last round of the pilot has been tried by its competitors on four @-@ fold Olympic fighters , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Farah final force took place on the upper hand and won a period of 26.49.51 .
The Farah did not mean long , after the finalists , with the husband Tania and children .
That was a special moment for me .
I very much regret my family .
It was a miracle to be a raft , &quot; said Farah journalists .
Farah intents in London , 5 000 and 10 000 metres of gold , a golden dump in London .
Everything is possible if it is in place .
In spite of the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connorm &apos; Daam gold , Gustav Klimti , Adele Bloch @-@ Baueri , a magnificent story of a much deeper 19th century ending the 19th century &apos;s end and the 20th century of Vienna &apos;s cultural life in Vienna .
However , more thoroughly the history of history .
The inflammatory information on the gentle was perhaps a sleep in the bars , narrower the issue of the extraordinary nature of the carbons allowed to have more influence in the headlines .
At present , there would be two books between the two books : Gustav Klimti and his wife &apos; Daam Bloch @-@ Baueri &apos; , and much more and more extensive , more extensive and more comprehensive , and more extensive , and more extensive , and more extensive , and a more comprehensive history of the European family and the German occupation in Austria .
The first one @-@ third of the book will take the middle of the wedding Vienna cultural life and who , in the Austrian Capital of Austria , may well imagine the way in which a hundred years ago , a life of Ringstrases , or how the Centrali coffee took all his heads , when the Klimver was introduced .
The concentration of cultural characters was a very rich city in one of the richest cities in Europe , and the name of the name in the book is known as a glance in a more cultural way .
At the same time , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where untreated innocence and the highest level of suicide in Europe , the development of something does not give rise to anything .
Or perhaps , however , every couple of couples are adding to the cultural life of the 20th century , in Vienna .
Dream travelling to the Soviet Union
In recent decades of the 19th century , there was an explosion in the number of Jews in Vienna , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
The Sajandical exchange was almost one of the last 10 in Vienna .
In Vienna , parents were the newcomers in Vienna , but for this time , when the AAM has two times opened up to the Czech sugar milnate , Ferdinand Blochevery and the Klimtile , his father was already in possession of the famous footsteps for the bank , the Bank of Habsburg , the Bank of Habsburg .
However , the Adelet &apos;s life , which he belonged , has not been drawing up .
If you look at the &apos; Daami Plan &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end @-@ to @-@ life infection is a kind such as socialism and dreams of a trip to the Soviet Union .
The 1903rd year , when Ferdinand Bloch decided to outsource his husband to a climmer , the last moment was the last minute of a footnote in Vienna .
The customer paid at that time 4 000 kroon , a quarter of a good location for the land of a natural house .
The fact that some sportsmen have been suspected of the modell of the flame of a colony , the sugar of sugar was not discouraged .
As far as the deletion is concerned , the only fact that the modelli and the close relationship between the artists , which has emerged in the course of work , continue to work to the end .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connor - &apos; Daam gold .
Gustav Klimti , Adele Bloch @-@ Baueri is an extraordinary story , &quot; Varrak 2016 , English from English , Aldo Randland .
Immediately before the start of the work , the Klimman has travelled to San Vitale Ravenna , and the investigators think that it is precisely where the wonderful mosas of the gooder , Theodorl , have been given the idea of a golden sportsman in Adelee .
The Klimt presented his &apos; Daami gold &apos; in Vienna 198 and at the same time ( in 1907 @-@ 1908 ) , there was sometimes a golden land in Snovel .
Historically , the similarity of the two women did not fail to notice .
How is Hitler involved ?
&quot; I think that my friend Klimti will remember his work in order to make his work available to the public , wrote Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer a couple of years after the departure of the artist ( the Klimt died in February 1918 ) and wanted to see their family a collectorate of museums to go to museums .
Six years before death , the Kliml was one of you .
In its own wills ( Adele in February 1925 ) , he asked for the husband to leave her two sports and four Gustav Klimti to the Austrian Galspecial case .
His tenets in his own statehood , Mariale and Luse .
After a year , when the Klima was completed by the Austrian Mona lisa , there was an attempt to escape from the Acadeissuan Acadeissuer of Acadeissuan , and in the case of the failure of a year ago , it was a failure of the past .
Although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ Semitism is sometimes due to the fact that Jewish professors did not receive the descenes against him , none of his extricers actually had a Jewish effect .
In any case , the Austrian Galspecial case , which was referred to in the case of the Austrian Galspecial case , has changed considerably by 1939 , as it was important for the rich Jewish arts in Vienna to find the work of the Nazis .
Hitler &apos;s personal art musicians were also at home to some Adele , but not a Klimman .
Sixty years after the Nazi radar began , ten years of court was born between the Austrian Government and the heirs of Bloch @-@ Bautisers .
In this regard , it is only mentioned that if the &apos; novel &apos; see in Vienna the Belvedere Castle , Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer , the &apos; Daam Bloch @-@ Bauer &apos; , must be taken to look at the New York Neue Galspecial .
And before we read the Vienna War , the aforementioned book also has to be read .
Even if you do not intend to go to the Klimre work , because at least my emotions were overturned after the closure of the book , and over 135 million dollars , and the mob Adele Bloch @-@ Edit restructured , and Mr Adele Bloch @-@ Edit reen .
So there is not so much the kind of representation , rather than the life of a sexuality , and a very moving story .
It has significantly facilitated the orientation of the Bauvs , which was set out in the early stages of the book .
17 @-@ year @-@ old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonia .
In the event of life , there was a gold swamping of 200 mlilimbles , very close to 2.16,62 .

The Golf @-@ ever period in Estonia has failed to distance itself from the record of Estonia to Parevict Elina in Estonia .
In Canada , more than 100 million wagers won a major personal record in Canada , with 56.66 of the new Estonian season with 56.66 .
For example , the parent of Kertu from the age of Kertu , for example , has been watered down by one hundredth more quickly .
For personal excellence , he still reached 100 more selilizing swimming in the opening of a letter from 1.03.69 .
On a longer distance , he has only reached the seventh place when the finalist was 17.31 .
It is currently leading to four different divorces from the Estonian season in Estonia .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics of a toothpaste
The holiday time has come in the hands of the US President Donald Trumple .
However , since Trump has been one of the most package holiday days , the critics have already taken place in a tooth .
The US @-@ US and CNN reports are scheduled for 17 @-@ day leave at the Bedminster in Bedminster , which is in the New Jericys .
Although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , there has already been a debate on the holiday in Trumpi .
They are throwing too much out of the bullet by the Olympic .
It is the President &apos;s customary for a weekend to have his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey cotton .
By the way , Mr Trump &apos;s , the President of his or her 196 has not been cleaned by President .
For example , Mr W. Bush , on holiday , has already reached 67 days on holiday , Barack Obama , but only 21 days .
However , the ball tends to dream about the ball .
The days after President , he said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , who said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , so that there will be no time for a long term of leave , because there is a great deal of need to do .
He also voiced three years ago about Barack Obama &apos;s leave .
The current President wrote on Twitter : &apos; At a time when Obama is on holiday , golf will play a solemn and a jargon in the concert , in the case of journalists in the sun &apos; .
The announcement by officials of the White House has no place for a record of 17 @-@ day golf .
It is officially called on holiday , during which Trumpy will not be able to read or other forms of action .
In addition , labour leave had to be another reason .
This is the case for the Western consignment of the White House , and that is why all personnel had to leave it .
The West is also located in Over Cabinet and other staff of the President .
&quot; I do not believe that anyone else would like to be in the West in August , when 38 degrees have been there , and there is no need for a silver house , in the words of the House of White House , who stressed that President will continue to work during a holiday .
Where President Trump followed by 17 days , you will be able to know the videos .
Blocking of critics from Facebook to do not stand up for the Head of State when you do not tolerate the criticism of the voters .
There is a lot of things to be reflected in our country &apos;s father &apos;s image .
The Americans were loving George Washington , but the newspapers did not go for a long time to get him out of the game from the internal politics to the political principles .
Of course he was annoyed by the criticism .
However , he did not forced his critics to silence .
As the Washington Washington , in 1783 , said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and , in the face of the mourly and silence , we may be called &apos; at the helm of the sheep &apos; .
This brings me to Mr Hogan Larry Hogan , who is struggling to get more in Washington .
It has been blocked and deleted by at least 450 people , who expressed their views on the Facebook page in his official Facebook page .
In a complaint with the beginning of the week , the Union for Freedom of America ( ACLU ) , which is in the Union &apos;s Civil Liberties Association , is therefore to court .
The Governor of the Governor of the Governor of Reberner came into an empty act and a blogger slide into the reactions to style &apos; whom &apos; are interested in &apos; .
&quot; This is just Facebook , &quot; said many .
But that is what it counts .
And it is a matter of great importance when it comes to such a meheman like the Hogan .
It is an unbelievably popular state in the democratic state of the democratic state .
His approval as a percentage of the country is the second highest ranking among the country &apos;s Sixth Governor .
I am not thinking of an unthinkable response .
It has managed a firm and firm firm on its principles .
In addition , he has used a quite unhappy way in communicating with its constituents as a key tool , for example , after the first time in chemistry , after the first time in chemistry .
Therefore , the Governor of the Governor of the Governor is a public forum , which is being managed by the workers who are currently being blocked by the staff of taxpayers &apos; dolpdollars , and , ultimately , dangerous and ultimately dangerous .
In his interview with Mr Chastel , the spokesperson of the Office , The Washington Posselt , the Governor of the Governor , said that the blocking of comments was nothing other than modeling .
However , it is too easy to portray the picture on the Internet cloutroller on the web , spawers or hatred of people full of people .
The post was in a series of people with a number of Hogan blocked .
And that is what they are quite people who communicate with their elected leaders , the owner of the company and the pastor , not Internet trolysis .
They have all said that their comments were disrespectful , thought and at least not the rogue .
Mr Pastor quoted his mail in the Bible , by opting on the Roman Catholic traffic .
The lawyer from Mr Bowie Bowie , Mrs Lakshm Sarma Ramani , was not instigated by anger , but on a quite angry crime .
&quot; I was politely that I am disappointed , because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news , &apos; he wrote a news story in the heading of a post @-@ maker &apos; .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , as a lot of people comment on the same subject , it calls some of them immediately as a collective effort , rather than recognising that this is a major concern with citizens . &quot;
What the Governor of the Governor of First Instance called &apos; spam &apos; to the &apos; junk mail attack &apos; would probably be called for &apos; public support &apos; .
The Facebook @-@ age allows messages to be easily suitably blocked by blocking a negative comment or deleting a negative comment .
It is a lot cleaner than the old , when the workers had to be sent out to them to collect newspapers in the newspapers and burn them or arrest protestors and forced them to remain silent .
However , exactly this is what is happening now , simply digitally .
I am not the first public official to criticise the tooth of Facebook and other social media .
President Trumpi has complained by using Twitter users who are blocked by Twitter .
One of the first signs of court rulings on this issue was the last week in Virginias .
Judge at the United States , James C. Cacheris decided , in Alexandria , in the chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control of Loudouni , for the first amendment to the Constitution , when he blocked his or her Facebook page .
Ktucky visited the ACLU Facebook and Twitter exercise after Governor Matt Bevinit ( R ) .
This should not be so difficult .
At the time of Washington , they had a similar impact on the Internet than the Internet .
Between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers and anonymous written writers turned out of his leadership .
And even then Washington had to deal with anonymous controls .
People have written letters from the pseudo @-@ art , like Jutanola , Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , to Washington &apos;s decisions .
In the context of the draft collection of the web @-@ based George Washington magazine , it is matching historical documents under the Cabinet , which criticised his views on the British friendship , trade and shipping agreements with Britain .
However , he has not forced them to remain silent .
Freedom of expression , special opinions and debates are the foundations of our country .
And the right governance means acceptance .

This is a rare cloud in Papua mountainous , which is a former Dutch colony , which has been incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum , which was forced only to vote in a referendum on the very front of the troops in the eyes of the troops .

In addition , it will be able to galvanise the timber industry with a value estimated at USD 78 billion .
However , these riches are a source of suffering from boats , as they will cause the presence of a powerful Indonesian army .
The New York Times study showed that the Fbete report in the years 1998 to local military and military units around USD 20 million , including USD 150 000 per victim .
Pope &apos;s efforts to ensure greater autonomy are threatening this golden and routinely re @-@ established .

Last year alone , in the region of Indonesia , the police in the region of Indonesia were arrested in a peaceful protest .
The 2016 report on the Archbishop of Birsbane , &apos; We are losing all the testimonies on the atrocities committed in previous year , such as non @-@ judicial executions , torture ( one of the other reports , in particular , rape and the introduction of electric shocks ) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; The number of victims is difficult to read , because such incidents will take place every week , &apos; the organisation of Human Rights Watch Indonesia and Andreas Harsono .
Kruguay is still more firmly committed because Papua natural assets have caused the influx of neo @-@ settlers elsewhere from Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but the demography is changing , because in the wake of the windfall economic migrants from Indonesia , Kalimantan , Sumatra and Sulaws islands .

The Indonesian President Joko Widodo , who is known as a Jocow , has promised to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations by the Pope in his election campaign in 2014 .
The former puzzle won the presidential Palace in Papua 29 constituencies , including Paniai , in Papua 29 constituencies .
However , the Ppuas has changed very little , and the local feeling is beaten .
&quot; Our hearts are broken , because in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jokow in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes regarding the restoration of justice , &apos; says &apos; You &apos; .
In fact , just two months after the resignation of Jokowi October , there is a low level .
On 7 December 2014 , 11 children singing on the roof in the Most , when the darkness of the dark motorcycles two Indonesis .
Children told them that they should be included in the front .
An insult to the local passport Yavedt Tebai Tebai Tebai is insulting one of the soldiers , and later on , with four soldiers .
According to the victims and spectators , the bevert soldiers have lost their children and deceive them with their guns .
Then there was one soldiers shot in the child .
One child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yulianus Yeimot , beaten so cruel that he fell to the home .
A couple of hours later , the insinuating building of the electoral Commission was put in place and the next day is even more important .
About 1 000 young people , women and children in the face of a football match in the local police department and military management centre .
They were wearing horseal buses and put in Papua mee a lego in Papua mee , which ran around and buried a song .
Some of the protests began by the police and military troops .
In the event of a dissension , a handful of soldiers sent to the soldiers was sent to the soldiers , &apos; if the mass of the crowds is more than three times resistance , let them down , &apos; it was said , according to the official document , which has seen a time @-@ time time , but what has not been given to local media media .
The Most city of Key Koto city of Yeremias Kayus ( 56 ) felt threatened by threats and called for peace to be preserved , asking for a crowd to go home .
Nobody was willing to listen .
&apos;Reducing me , I suddenly were shot into the left of the left , &apos; he said to the letter of time when it comes to the blood of the coloured house in my German colours .
We still do not know who was firing , but says that the soldiers of the soldiers gathered in the month came from .
&quot; The people had a lot , a lot of children , &apos; add to it &apos; .
The local man Alfius Youw received his fire on the spot , saying three times .
&quot; I would like to ask him to be a body in his body , to make sure that it is her , &apos; said the time of a letter of synthanes &apos; , which is using a number of indicators , just one name , in the name of a large number of agglomerations .
&quot; I saw that he is dead ... SInnovaleme . &apos;
The Chief inspector Yotje Mende said to reporters that his attachment to security of his or her masters was only attacked .
&quot; We must protect ourselves if we are threatened by killing , &quot; said Vice @-@ President Pudjo Sulistiyo , the spokesman of Papua police , in 2015 .
&quot; This is a matter of life and death . &quot;
According to Human Rights Watch , five young protestors were killed and many injured .
The news about killings was only at the next day .
Three weeks later , Jokowi Jayapuras had a passionate speech where he gave condolences to the families of the victims and was able to deal with the mistreated abuses of the Pope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately , so that it will never happen again in the future , &apos; he said .
The Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that it sets out an ADR mechanism to address human rights crimes .
However , almost as well as excuses .
&quot; Most of the crimes took place long ago .
Some of them took place in the 1990s and the early 1990s .
It is about that we are committed to dealing with these crimes , but we must respect certain processes , &apos; said .
On 5 June , when speaking time , the Wiranto , however , took his words back , saying that he has no intention of creating a Ppua mechanism to deal with complaints .
Instead , he said that &apos; everything will be resolved according to the law &apos; .
The Wiranto , who has been accused by the UN in relation to the crimes of human rights in the wake of the bloody independence of over 1 000 people in East Timor 1999 , said that 11 human rights crime has already been resolved , including what happened in Paniai .
The families of the victims of the Paniac have resisted such allegations .
&quot; I have been listening four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , &apos; said Yohanes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
He says that there is still a fear for years .
&quot; I am afraid he says .
&quot; I fear that the army will arrest me , I fear that I am shot . &quot;
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that Paniai people are afraid of this incident .
He said that the army was beaten after it had helped four victims to bury the four victims .
&quot; After the burying of the dead bodies , the army had to look at me , &apos; he says .
The changes have not stopped .
On Tuesday , the Egyptian police shot in Deiyais , a neighbouring Renaissance .
One person was killed and 17 wounded , including children , when it comes to the village of villages and the head of the construction company , who refused to have an unconscious man from transport .
This man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old Reanus Douw , who drops fish in a loved river , died on the road to hospital .
The civilian population protested at the site of the company &apos;s office .
According to the police , the people of villages were forced by stoning , which was followed by a warning shot .
However , in the local state , mobile phones ( Indonesian Military police ) were shot at the people , killing one man .
&quot; We were a great panic , we are afraid of revenge , &apos; said 29 @-@ year Dominggu Badii , who live near a hospital near the hospital and saw the insect insecticides .
&quot; I have been beaten by two days in my own house . &quot;
The House of Deiyai has called for the prosecution of police officers to be held accountable and the withdrawal of police for the territory of the police .
Paniac has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government .
The lack of meaningful development will feed into the dissatisfaction of the honey , moni , danor and mmal tribes living in Papua bad .
Many of them have signed up to the army of Iberian movement ( VPL ) , which protects the army of paints , which , according to their own , is allowed to enjoy the rights of the Indonesian soldiers , and the abduction of human kidnaps by the Indonesian soldiers .
Some of the leaders of the VPL are from Paniau , including the Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
In response to this , the army has been arrested by Paniais and had arbitrarily detained thousands of people during the pretext of protecting national sovereignty .
Some of them will never appear again .
Paniades are known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
Poverty is fed by dissatisfaction .
The lack of a rival , which is sold in the Most , is too expensive for local authorities .
The Leipings will be the same .
People are growing their entire food , mainly at the baseline , as well as some fruit and vegetables .
Farming is women &apos;s work , each of whom is able to care for four or five bailings .
They usually keep the majority of the harvest on the family , the rest to the local market .
Ten years are paying only 10 000 Indonesian sites ( 75 cents ) .
During the time , economic inequality has deepened , and the emergence of new migrants , who have arrived at the opening of new airport routes in the Nabire airport , which have arrived at the opening of new airports in the Nabire airport .
These few jobs , which exist , are going to be better educated and more prosperous migrants .
The Ppuades themselves often do not have capital or the necessary skills to confuse a competitive business .
&quot; Young people are not interested in the ice , because there are no jobs and no money , the President of the Paniai tribal Council , John Gobai .
Isolation is keeping the eyes of the world out of Ppualt .
In addition , strict restrictions on foreign media .
This year , Pope was sent out by French journalists Franck Escudie and Babridge Longchamp , because they were not following the relevant practices , even though they had been given a rare film licence .
The Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch , Pcomm Kine , said that it has not been implemented by Jocowi electoral promises to promote transparency and development restrictions on reporting restrictions .
&quot; In Indonesia , the most Eastern provinces and the Western Pope reports are threatening the new threats to the rejection of a visa @-@ entry and black list , &quot; said in a statement .
A lack of knowledge of the press means that international pressure to the government of Indonesia is largely confined to Papua near , with its immediate neighbours .
In March , six Pacific States were encouraged by the Tonga , Nauru , Belau , Tuvalu , Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands , the United Nations Human Rights Council to examine a wide range of serious crimes , including the shooting of Paniai .
The same countries have also supported historically VPL .
Mr Arrmanatha Nasir , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , has levelled accusations of a group by saying Jakartas for journalists : &apos; Indonesia still applies democratic order and freedom of the press , so the evidence of human rights cases would be difficult to bury &apos; .
Local people want more foreign governments to notice .
When the Dutch delegation , at the head of the state of the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , Kennard Van Btreevery 4 on 4 May , was interrupted by local people at the meeting , but the anonymous source said , in his silence , asking : &apos; We want freedom &apos; .
In Indonesia 2019 new presidential elections will take place , but boats do not believe that they will vote in favour of Jocowi .
&apos;Jokow is a man with good intentions , but the people surrounding him who are involved in shooting the Paniai &apos; say &apos; The President of the Council &apos; , Hobai .
He wants to give the Jocowi understanding that , in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army , they are bothered by poor education and health services .
According to Mr Gobai , the people of Paniai must , as other boats , the voice of Jokowen have been given a debt that has to be paid .
&quot; They do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
Despite the disvarication and intimidation , the families of the fire victims in Paniai were still in the last symbolically opposed to the death of one victim &apos;s killer and the military deprivation of the land to the land .
Knowing that justice can never be put on foot , they will not at least allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; One of our family members was killed , says Yacobus .
&quot; What else can we do ? &quot;
It came to Dubai Torch , a second time on his own .
On Friday , there had to be a single world of housing in Dubai , which was the highest in the world , by forcing hundreds of people from this 337 metre and 79 to flee .
This is the second fire that has been devastated by the high @-@ speed , which has been ravaged in the Tuchy , in the case of Turin , in the course of two years .
In the evacuation of the building , any injuries were not reported and no direct fire will be found .
&quot; We have been sleeping and wake up in the fires in sub @-@ Saharan people .
We would be lucky down and we took around 10 minutes from the last three times , &apos; said &apos; Reuters &apos; , who mentioned himself in George George &apos; .
The fire @-@ fighters , according to Dubai &apos;s civil defence officials , had to fire the fire @-@ fighters at around 4 o &apos;clock this morning ( 0000 GMT ) and jailed the building .
The government said that they are working on a shelter to those affected .
This incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used in the world &apos;s high @-@ level external soil .
During the investigation carried out by the Executive Board of the Torch Board in Torch , it was found that the most damage suffered in the event of a faÃ§ade - an external area and isolation - was found to be the most affected .
The British police have said that they believe that the London Grenportfolio will be the isolation of the different isolation of the London Grenportfolio and has been able to contribute to the rapid spread of the fires in June , which killed around 80 people .
See : On telephony of these phones in the autumn
Language and sygeare have a high time for technological games , because then the phone manufacturers will make their new models of excellence .
In the spring , it came to a Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony XZ Premium , as well as in the autumn in the autumn .
According to the C2 marketing and sale Director , I am characterised by the innovative design of flagship ships , the fast @-@ track soul , server @-@ servant 4K , and the ultra @-@ fast processing process .
There was a high level of elephant in the world of Samsung Galaxy S8 , which has also reached the front page of the sale of Estonian smartphones .
The autumn allows for a more tidal high @-@ speed loads , a more resilient , high @-@ quality cameras and greater water and water security .
He added that there can already be assumptions on the basis of the hearing and to predict the four model models that are likely to be conquered in the light of the streets .
These four smartphone excellence will reach the shop in the autumn of this year .
The long @-@ awaited iPhone 8 and Phone 8 Plus should reach boys in mid @-@ September .
The rumours of what the new Apple model , however , and what can be done , are spreading much .
If the iPhone 7 did not significantly increase the differences in the iPhone 6s , then Apple &apos;s tenth birthday will be expected that the new model will be fully respected .
There has been talk of four colours : Black , white , rock and chromium .
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the whole of the phone , lost a cocup and fingerprints have been built on screen screens .
Apple &apos;s director JonyIve calls for the new Phone model to appear like a glass .
There has also been talk of the iPhone version of the Phone version .
In addition to the elepher , the top @-@ off charging and a more quality cameras can expect faster A11 processes .
It is certainly one year &apos;s expected smart phones .
A new model for a new model begins on 23 August .
There has been a lot of rumours which new Galaxy are beginning to see .
Admittedly , there is even more business @-@ to @-@ business users and the S will allow even greater functionalities .
The Telefont should have two camera , one of which is the lax and the other with the same degree of view television .
At the moment , no one knows what the two guergs are able to be able , but in any case , it is the first test of the quality of quality , which is certainly comparable to the iPhone 8 @-@ ga .
However , we are waiting for 23 August .
While Nokia are in charge of selling three smartphones in this year , Nokia , Nokia , are still missing from their flag - Nokia 8 , which are already being presented on 16 August .
We are looking forward to 5.3 @-@ dust screens and ultra @-@ fast Qualcomm Snapdragis 835 processes and a more resilient aunion .
Nokia also talked about aluminium corps and a significant degree of water and water security IP68 .
Like Samsungevery , the new model of Nokia has two camera , which is optimised by a company Zey .
If Sony &apos;s firm flag has been to date XZ Premium , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future , with more innovative functions .
We expect a smart phone that is slightly more modest than XZ Premium , but at least the same good or better cameras .
There is speculation on the new model that the screen is at least a hot one .
What the reality brings , we can see already the right thing , as traditionally the Sony of Sony has revealed the international technology at the international level that has been unveiled by Sony this year , which will take place this year .
According to the leaked leaks , Trump Mexicans were pressed by the Trump carrier for the payment of the border wall .
The Washington post , the President of the United States , Donald Trumpi , and the call by the Mexican and Australia @-@ Australia state of telephone calls .
On 27 January , Trump phones in Mexico went to the President of Mexico , Mr Enrique Pena Nietole , that it would stop public declaring that he does not intend to pay for the proposed threshold .
The President of America , in the wake of the public executions of the Wall , by believing : &apos; You must not say this to the press &apos; .
The Truer set up his presidential campaign to build a long @-@ term American wall and the age of the United States of America to pay for this project .
It was also published in the first speech by the Australian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turnbull , which reveals the tense debate .
Mr Trump has said that the agreement , under which the United States of America takes the refugees to Australia , is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; nervous &apos; and &apos; stupid &apos; , claiming that an agreement that was made during the Obama Government would give him the impression that he has proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States .
Trump ended a speech by announcing Turmama to say that &apos; this was the most unpleasant speech &apos; .
The Court did not hold a complaint on the case of OC MRP in the case of the Republic of Tartu , which was rejected by the town of Tartu from July 2019 to 2029 .
It is a handful of a letter which rejected the OC MRP in the supply of Tartu bus and coach vessels , as the supplier did not meet the requirements , the Tartu City Legal Service , Mr Anneli Aputin .
This is a outsourcing of the city &apos;s internalisation of the supply of Tartu cities , in the period 01.07.2019 @-@ 30.06.2029 .
MRP in Lib was complaining to the Court of Justice of the State of Tartu .
The Court did not take this up .
Although many people in the social media are complaining that the Weeky Festival is disrupting their nightmare and the city of the driving force is full of the brakes , there are also many of those who have no bad word in the middle of a lasting festival .
I am even positively surprised that the supermarket would be the visa courtesy !
I did not see any confusion and no courtesy .
Even the generosity I saw in &apos; is a dead wave .
&quot; That is all well , it is well @-@ known , and it is known to be the joyss , which is the winter of winter , it adds happily .
A wave of bullying in the dose of Ranna is not a disgrace .
When he is still living in a city in the middle of a city , it is not yet more music to have arrived at his home .
&quot; However , I hope that I will say &apos; yes &apos; .
There is also talk about the Agnes Agnes that the Festival is a good thing for the Perrer , it will be a good contribution to the VAT of local merchants .
In addition , it is pleased that the summer capital will have sown so many painting .
The woman of Peolhiss is not a woman .
Although I am no longer in the rank , but it is nice that rand has revived .
And it is good that the people are moving and it is already three times , a woman says .
In the first case , I think it was somewhat worse .
&apos;They , perhaps , he was wondering .
However , what is happening in the rank is the norm for the capital cities , according to the summer capital .
&quot; This Weeky is a very good promo for our small town , &quot; talks on the parasite Harri Charter .
Mlife and mÃ¶ll have not been hit by his eldaycle .
But for that ?
We should all keep together .
The way in which it would be better to communicate between ethnic matters .
After all , the music man is not going to be .
That is not the case , although I live close to there .
&apos;Well people are able to keep together and there is no paint &apos; , it speaks .
The guests coming from the winter have said that you are visas .
&quot; With the bottles they are , of course , a little exaggerated , but young people are young people and the issance - please go , but be people and we can start ! &apos; Says .
The heighty people have travelled to a time for the time , whether or not to relatives or to know .
&quot; However , in general , the Festival will have a positive impact on people like this meagre , talk about children with children as a Tiina .
The stern of his family , too , is not a disappointment , even though this House last year even further go to this street .
Last summer , it was the case that we heard more .
We are living in a city outside the city that , in fact , there is a lot in the middle of the bottle of the river , it talks about it .

Following the closure of the EPA , following the postponement of the summer Regulation
The United States &apos; Environment Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA ) has cancelled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama @-@ time regulation , which obliges states to limit their emissions , one day after the 15 state complained to court due to this process .
The EPA announced a decision to continue the procedure for determining the content of the &apos; buy @-@ out &apos; in 2015 , by saying that it shows the commitment of the Agency to cooperation with states .
&quot; We believe that we need to have a dialogue with our state partners and listen to them , &quot; said the President of the EPA , the Scott Pruitt statement .
Mr Pruitt has announced the intention of the meeting in June to postpone the definition of the content of the ozone content with a view to measuring pollution in different parts of the country in order to determine where the standard of air quality should be reduced by one year until 2018 in order to meet the standard of air quality .
In combination with the Columbia Department , the 15 mainly democratic states put action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
The government of President Donald Trumpi has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations imposed by the former President Barack Obama , according to the fact that it is part of a more comprehensive plan for growth @-@ building .
However , these efforts have created reactions among the democrats and the natural groups , who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
The EPA website says that the breathening of air pollution &apos; can reduce the labour capacity of the Copts and increase the risk of a respiratory disease &apos; , such as asthma .
German pigs can come to a pile .
Germany and veal can come to a pipe , as the strong rainfall is a threat to the European Union &apos;s second largest producer of wheat , writes BSE .
This year , it may be the case that weeks of satur , before harvesting , could mean that the fruit of the bread industry is only to eat animals .
&quot; The quality of the &quot; content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 &quot; said Agrav Raiffeen &apos;s analysis of Mr Bernhard Chilla .
This year , we can go to 40 per cent of German coverage for animal feed , which is fed from the normal , forecast Agravis .
The German farmers , like their European colleagues , have come together with all the weather this year .
First of all , winter was dry .
Then there was a cold bullying , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
In July , Germany was hit by the head of Germany , which has also continued in August .
Many eyes have been turned into northern Germany , where rain is hampered by harvesting .
So far , only five per cent of the nightmare .
The majority in the region has not yet been harvested , and the local harvest has been reported by the local harvest and Ceravage .

&quot; I have been called on to Mr Broner &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am a little about 63.5 kg .
I want to move below the weight .
And he needs to move towards a quibble &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
The FÃ¤ns have wanted this .
Let us say that . &quot;
The Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; The world needs this fight . &quot;
The issue raised the question of whether it should be worthwhile to look at it ; it is part of its strategy that he wants to allow the Lomachenkol to be reorientation to the end of this year , in order to make it possible for the next summer to be able to meet Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 noses ) , who also have an interest in the fight against Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbelli , following the light of the surrecess of their 23 September this year .
&quot; The review of this fight could be a reward because the fans have wanted this confrontation , &quot; said Garcia , saying later that he is open to fighting any channel that offers the best financial package .
&quot; We are key players .
No other name will be able to attract so much attention .
Whenever they are ready ... &quot;
The Garcia said that he must be a &apos; force &apos; for the Lomachencot and can look at his desk on his desk .
However , the Lomachenko was modest in praising Garcia , saying that he thought the three trialogues originating from the Riverpool was a very slow one , and I am sorry , Mr Mlony ... you wanted it to be &apos; very slow &apos; .
The Garcia said that it was the intention to show strength and then to pot .
Both confirmed that they feel the way in which the tension is growing .
&quot; This is the fight that awaits the realisation .
No other confrontational situation will cause such attention and mindedness .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Garcia .
The Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters and the Micy is just that .
This is a good fight . &quot;
What is going to be moved from the world &apos;s dogs to Estonia ?
It extended and issued a record of more than 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who are mostly from Estonia to work , study or family in the field of police and border guards .
If , for example , the soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit to issue 6702 foreign , then the figure was 4928 .
The agencies cannot say how much immigrants eventually remain in Estonia , but this analysis will be drawn up at the Ministry of the Interior .
In the past ten years ago , around 500 Ukrainians per year in Estonia , the figure in the last few years is coming up to 2 000 .
The number of applicants for authorisation increased exponentially during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014 , a fixed @-@ term residence permit ( 1087 people ) , a year of 675 .
With the statistical office , we will have the highest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens died in Estonia , and more than one .
&quot; The Ukrainian community has been very high in Estonia , and because of difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that the work and learning opportunities are being sought in a country where the community and many of the families are already entitled to , in the Ministry of the Interior , Kristin Rammus .
The soil and the soil were a higher , even more than the number of citizens of Russia , even though the number of fixed @-@ term residence permits issued in 10 years will be the highest in the last year .
If Ukrainians come to work here , Russia &apos;s citizens will be on the basis of family migration .
&quot; Given this historic Russian community , they are also most likely to have the most family ties with the people living in Russia , &quot; said the Ministry of Defence of the Home Department in Helina Meuse .
&quot; If the Russian citizens who have been able to reside in a residence permit have been to live in a transplant , Hartland is now in East Virgland , he added , and pointed out that around 40 % of them are married in the European Union &apos;s citizens .
The Multi @-@ term residence permit ( 1696 / 11 ) , which is also a record number of fixed @-@ term residence permits .
At the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit was reduced .
&apos;Hype is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested for a permanent residence permit &apos; , &quot; explained by the Ministry of the Interior at the Ministry of the Interior , Ramon , who said that the interest of Russian citizens has remained stable for years after a residence permit .
In order to build a lasting residence permit permanently , at least three years will be able to apply for foreign applicants at least three years .
The aim is to encourage the attraction of people who have adapted to it .
However , a long @-@ term resident residence permit requires five years .
An extension of the old residence permit has probably been reduced by a new residence permit .
For example , soil was granted a residence permit for the 146 Ukrainians who have been working for at least three years here .
Now the Ukrainians will be able to change their work and the Estonian state will no longer be pointing the finger at whether the pay criterion has been met .
This residence permit was a panacea for the sleep , the right of the holder of a bad passport ( 1029 ) , the Russians ( 487 ) , indium ( 54 ) and nigerans ( 36 ) .
The 1968 people , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 grubbine and the same as the Chinese , were able to live in Estonia for a residence permit .
This year , the total number of applicants is already 1269 .
In 10 years , Nigeria has become a surprise to the country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for the residence permit .
If three residency permits were issued in 2007 , the bubble was 200 .
There is a lesson to be learned from Nigeria to university .
The Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among the Georgians , the Chinese and the Turks .
The number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has largely increased thanks to the family .
For them too , the rule is that where there is a community that has arisen , there will be a more simple place for others , in addition to the question .
In the ten years , two people have also gone into Estonia , for example , from North Korea , as many Laoka and Madagascar .
Ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four Uruguay .
If a year &apos;s residence permit is around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals , it is about 0.46 per cent of the total population .
Even if the citizens of the European Union are concerned , migration is about per cent of &apos; , &apos; commented on the way in which the numbers are , in fact , small .
In total , according to the statistical office , 14 822 people , from Estonia , have been in Estonia , hence 13 792 .
This means that immigration has exceeded the second year .
Most of the and inward @-@ ups are Estonian citizens , but more are among those leaving them .
It was therefore in the mine of Estonia &apos;s citizens in terms of the protection of the migration of its citizens .
Estonians are particularly emigrating in Finland and Estonia .
Mr Mlong Couture Princess of the Nazis , thieves and tweets
However , in the north of the North West , Maria Tammeoru , however , has history - old paintings and defendants : &quot; I can dream of a museum somewhere in the museum , and the old @-@ old theft and cables .
If you look at something like you , and learn about it every day .
That is the discovery !
A long @-@ term world of Couture may seem to be a few living , but the designer do not think so .
You yourself decide how much your lives are !
As a friend , I am a friend of mine , who is full of my hats from coupling in my own .
Because it is not his fault , it does not live in the Hollywood and does not go on the red al every day , he wants them to shoulder the most beautiful brokers and suffer !
You will live in a special life for their lives .
The Moeartificial artist does not recognise the gap between the brilliant events and the black day .
This is the reasoning that led to the plan to bring in the countryside in Estonia , the forests and fields between the people , the people who often do not reach the people .
For example , a comparison was presented , for example , in the spirit of Jair and the University of Beauvis , where 45 modell King met the whole street in the street .
In Tallinn , it is often hanged in a young person , but elsewhere , there is more emotion - slogans , rising stand up , want to thank you .
A large part of the audience came from the news , but now they are in Mammu Couture .
If you hear the expectations of the people , they are enthusiastic .
And I like this feeling that I am in my motive with the summer winter .
Mr Barnier , we had a red carpet of 50 metres , the whole street long @-@ distance stickers , it seemed that they did not end up !
Maria Damanaki does not recognise the motive that the creation of a animal must be presented with a superficial superficial , it will be happy to bring the ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always been happy .
That is the case of the experience , the island of the ice @-@ picking process !
I am so sorry that I have never seen my role , always behind me , and I am afraid to give a glimmer of the last meat .
My nervous would not allow me to look calmly .
Mrs Maria is this kind of fashionable , who does not just want to play a representative role , but to be able to be involved in everything .
I have my own sister machine , most of the collections .
I like the whole process , where you have the details , discover you .
I am never far from my animal and I am not afraid of work .
The only thing is not confined to the style , logistics , logistics , organisation , organisation , all the day @-@ to @-@ one @-@ temperous woman &apos;s day .
These working hours are still huge .
I will not be able to say when my day ends , for me it is just a day full of joy !
I have been very lucky - it is like an uncemeable fortune : I am doing something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compliments .
Several times it has been said that my brokers are in the countryside - they are put to feel like a printing .
The guise of saturation , which Maria talent overnight has made , has long been a signal of the Mlong Couture signalling .
Mr Martin Myrsep U18 boys , as a weapon of anchor of Estonians , now turned to our door .
It is a pity that the fairytale was run out .
The first thing was that we did not get the table .
And if there is a great difference in the table , there is nothing to do with the exception of the 618 corps of Estonia : 75 in the UK , the only thing that has played a corruptor in the United Kingdom , Mr Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsep , Mr Myrsep .
Anti @-@ terrorist attacks were attacked by 28 Palace and received so many more attacks .
We were also not prepared to defend their aggressive defence and attack , it created .
Many of the attacks by the young children ended up in three to five seconds , we were not able to build protection .
However , they were in defence of all the hand , but we could not be combined .
It created a team from the shoes .
The homeless work was better done .
The Myrsey estimates that Estonia would have to do more tactical errors in order to take up the momentum in the bud .
The latter quarter - we had a mistake , but the opponents have already received a number of rapid repetition .
The inadequacy and close pressure that was alagre with our weapon , now all of us , now have all of us .
Today , we had no force against them .
The baseline remained to be satisfied with its negligence , Matthias Tass .
The Turks generally can say good words about the whole team , to date a united soul .
It is a pity that , in the past , there was not already before .
The time has been a self @-@ confident and played out in the streets , but it seemed that he was tired - he has carried a very large burden .
However , he made a very fine move in some of the things that I have seen in the past , as I have seen in the past , in the Annex .
The terrible figures : Stumbled by the EM @-@ Turner in two fewer than 10 points ...
In the age of U18 , it is not just the case of young men B @-@ divisjon at the mercy of the &apos; B &apos; , and , in Tallinn , he started the day before in Dublin .
However , the anti @-@ Polish game , unfortunately , is in the area of antiquity .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , the state was 9 : 49 , or only the last ten minutes , opponents of a shoes and the period left all 16 : 16 .
Both in the first and the second quarter , Estonia &apos;s 4 , third point ...
In this regard , the first two minutes have been struck by the protagonship , but there are 25 pieces of the game , but there are 25 pieces of the game , then one of the trialogues and then 21 to wait ...
In almost half an hour , 47 remained one of the darkopts .
In addition , 2 points had to be found in four NGOs .
The number of losses was a reasonable figure , 12 .
At the end of the game , Poland was set up by 33 % and Estonia 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , on the day of opening up to 83 : 56 on the right to Portugal .
NATO vessels coming to Tallinn
Today , on 1 December , NATO has arrived at a scheduled port visit to Tallinn , in order to complement the stocks of ships and prepare for pre @-@ presumed habits .
During the visit to the sea , ships are preparing for the sea , giving them the possibility of a papal holiday holiday .
After the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of habits and be prepared for the future of historic explosive remnants .
&quot; The participation of children in the NATO body and the combination of operational training in local waters is clearly illustrated by our integration with the allies &apos; , &quot; said the operation and planning of the naval fleet in the capacity of the maritime fleet in the capacity and planning team in the field of the Governing fleet , &quot; said Next Reinmaa .
Since 29 June , NATO &apos;s Chief armed Forces of NATO will be chaired by Gvido Laudups , Gvido Laudups , who took over @-@ group tasks from the Estonian naval officers at the ceremony at the ceremony in RiRiga at a ceremony in the country in Riga .
The flag of the group is designated by the Latvian naval force , LVNS Virsaitis , which will also operate a group of leaders .
This semester is also part of the International unit of Estonia in the wake of the Estonian naval force .
One of the four groups of NATO naval forces under NATO &apos;s naval force is a permanent one @-@ stop @-@ off unit in NATO , a unit of primary speed , which could be sent to various places in the world during the course of five days .
4 . - On 13 August , Mr Pirita &apos;s mutuation has once again become a place where the Festival of Birgitta Festival has been carried out by 13 years ago by Mr Kards .
This year &apos;s Festival can be a beautiful , powerful and unprecedented leader in the threat of Joost ( 36 ) to the Risk to Joost in Tallinn .
The risk of Joost : Cuba will reach the classroom of the world class , &quot; Traviata &quot; and &quot; Tusca &quot; , Clethin answers , and the &apos; Tosca &apos; , the Countivise , and neither does its own manufacturer &apos;s own product , which will be the &apos; Aastatimes &apos; in the case of Joseph Haydn in 2015 , which led to the creation of the Piririst in 2015 . &quot;
It is much more than just a group and the answers to the theatre .
This is higher than any musicians in their normal form .
This is a festival , which is going to take power and will never be confused again .
Because the experience that listens to the hearing and the mysterious environment , human soul is brighted and is concerned with human beings in the way that cannot be described .
The first year of the threat by the arts leader of Birgitta Festival .
Did the shoes of the estro Eri Klaskin have not been seen as a little bit ?
Of course , as I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been a lot of help .
I am in favour of the whole of my student career and also supported a career at the beginning of the revised career .
Perhaps it is thanks to me that it is easier for me to continue his work .
In the different Klas , there has been a great deal of good and , of course , that has been carried out by the Festival of Birgitta Festival .
It was excellent to join the team who knows how things go .
It has also been a great heart to me , Mr Kards , in the city of Tallinn , which took good progress in the city of Birgitta Festival .
And here I am now and I can start !
What would be to be brought to the audience at the festival of today , which you offer special offer ?
We have the first musicians , from Latvia , Lithuania , Lithuania and surprise , to the front line , written by Astrid Lindgren &apos;s cheese .
&apos;Karlsson lds &apos; .
And one of the notorious nuances at this point is that it was the author of this balllas , Mr Karlau , the Latvian composer , who himself expressed a desire to write it .
He has already lived in a soul of Karlsson , who has already lived in a soul .
To the risk of how you do everything ?
Thanks to my support of life , I certainly will .
This work needs to be based on a system of love and a lot of love , and it is fortunate that I have a huge amount of love .
And I have noticed that my personal emotion is not dependent on the rest of the people , as I do not know how I am going to go against every new day .
And that being aware of the tone , keeping the positive sense and , in fact , laughing itself into the mirror , we made a significant increase in my happiness .
This week , in particular , when it is the most important test , I am particularly keen to have practised and work .
The naming of the activist will be dragged down and then increases the tone .
It is not just a word .
I think that people do not yet know the things that the universe offers to them , but it is a little for everyone to do so slowly .
Immediately , it is an important moment .
Is there any kind of ritual before the sink of dirigendi ?
It is still ridden to switch to more convenient reception .
This is a small moment for itself .
However , in general , I do not have the opportunity to make a little difference , or to make a little goat .
In fact , I even like to engage actively with people , even before the dirty pulled took place .
But come to all the Festival of Birgitta , there is also a great deal of self @-@ operability and a friend !
See a glaring video on the risk of Joostiga .
Publication of new findings of the age assessment of Swedish asylum seekers
In Sweden , there was a series of asylum seekers , which assessed their age with an innovative approach to medical examinations , showing that more than 80 per cent of the old Member States were considered to be more than 18 % , but not all of the specifications of the results .
The Swedish National Institute of medicine ( Reletsmedicinalverket ) started with tests on this year .
The tests were set up during the first application of the age of retirement , following the fact that they have not managed to correctly define the retirement age for many allegedly juveniles of minors .
To date , the &quot; Migransverket &quot; has sent the test of 80 80 cases and the Institute of medical medicine , between the middle of March 2017 , has issued a total of 24 81 test results by the middle of March 2017 .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) assessed the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Institute of medicine and the Institute for Health in the case of 25 cases , so that the test &quot; can be 18 @-@ year or old &quot; .
The 432 cases concluded that man is probably a younger than 18 .
The tests will only be used if the age of man is questioned .
The results of the Omedicine Institutional Johan GÃ¶ransson report are consistent with those of previous months .
&apos;We do not see a great difference from the statistics in previous months , the figures are quite consistent , &apos; said the Local .
It is not necessarily the case that a large proportion of the cases were evaluated than 18 , that does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been able to have their age .
The Institute was issued in May in the test of 581 , and said that 442 cases &apos; are references to the fact that the person who is studying is 18 years old or the parent &apos; .
However , when the newspaper Svensson , Mrs Libladet investigated the results of these 581 tests , was found that 243 was in fact , in the case of 18 people who have said that it will be 18 .
The method of assessing the age of medical age , during which there will be crÃ¨ches and disgust at MRL , and then they are being thrown into a toothless medical analysis , have been criticised in some circles .
One of the sceptics is Mr Marcus , who is among the endovishment of the Harolina Institute , whose work is the evaluation of people &apos;s maturity in order to find out whether they were carried out earlier , or later on .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measuring method currently used should be used .
The designation of biological age in such a way is very uncertain .
If we cannot say firmly , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he &apos; said the Metro .
However , the Institute of medicine in Johan GÃ¶ransson has defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; In general , the risk of disposing a child &apos;s inaccurate life is low .
Perhaps around 10 % of the risk is where the person is a little less than 18 .

The 20 @-@ year @-@ old bathing Maria Orel , Mrs Maria Orel , has made the London MMil beauty , with 67.37with a good 18 seats .
Mr Orel was the MM nothm , and a joyful woman confirmed that it hopes to fight for medals in the future .
The contest went well and received good experience .
With the first test ( 64.80 ) , I made the final result immediately , in the second ( 62.80 ) risk , at the risk of a very high level of time , and the third ( 67.37 ) I was able to keep a clear , &quot; said after the contest .
I had my own emissions and I am very pleased that I found it .
Anna Maria Oreli MM &apos;s debate ended in a fine 18 places .
The Oreliu did not have mixed up , because it will carry out the TTC in the stadium .
&quot; I am afraid of &apos; I am afraid of a small buyer &apos; .
The London Olympics had almost a half @-@ full house of the people of the Orel , or was he able to turn people out of their own ?
I have said , but in a positive way .
All of you say that it will give it - it is !
If it is to compete , it can be experienced .
Mr Orel assured that it remains to be satisfied with the MM &apos;s debate , and he is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here to the 32nd , last outcome of this year &apos;s season .
This is a very good result .
I am 2020 and Mil - this is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and , on the other day , I would like to compete on behalf of the meat .
Western Virgina kup announced party exchanges
The Governor of the Western Virginia Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , told us on Thursday evening , together with President Trumph , that he will change the parties .
&apos;Manie or not , but the democrats are walking away from my Jewish , &apos; said &apos; Governor Justice &apos; .
&quot; Today , I am saying to you , having vetoed and wondered ... today , I say to you , the West , to tell you that I can no longer help you as a democratic negotiator . &quot;

Mr Coe praised honest apologies for the Russians following the anti @-@ doping channel
The international rallies of Kergeon in Sebastian Coe were praised by his words &apos; Russia &apos; on Thursday , but it reiterated that it is not time to allow sport to be allowed to be returned .
On the eve of the International Council on the eve of the International Council on the eve of the World Cup on the eve of the Great Cup , Russia has said that the ban on the country &apos;s entry ban is right and is determined to fight against doping .
He apologises &apos; all of the lightitudes &apos; , who have been thrown away by the golden and silver bullet . &quot;
In spite of his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of leaving the ban on entry into force , which was established in November 2015 after the report by the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) provided evidence of a country &apos;s sponsorship in Russia .
&quot; In my opinion , this was a very honest answer , a very honest presentation , &apos; Mr Coe journalists &apos; , the President of the IAEA , said .
&quot; The whole Council and Congress were satisfied that Russia was also recognised that they had quite complex times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Union . &quot;
He said , in addition , that he was happy to accept the criteria for admitting Russia .
&apos;I believe that it was a very constructive day and progress is taking place , but Congress supports the proposal for a group that is not the right time to withdraw Russia &apos;s return , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; We have to do everything possible in the next few months to normalise the situation .
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to be honest athletes to separate the system , &apos; Annex he &apos; .
Eighteen of the second Russian lecturers , which meet the strict criteria of the IAF , are competing with neutral sports athletes in London on Friday in London .
The leader of the IAAF Group , Rune Andersen , said Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of criteria for forecasting .
Following the presentation by the IAAF to the Council , he said in London that doping is still insufficient and the technicians who have received a ban are still free .
The revolution in electric cars makes a significant difference to the demand of metals .
Who is the winners and losers ?
Little of the fact that the revolution in electric cars makes a significant difference to the fuel market , up to infrastructure , creates new winners and losers in the metal market .
Although the mining companies like Glencore can say that one place they win and lose , then smaller mining companies will not help .
At the moment , Glencore coal and oil are currently serving , but in the age of electric cars , there is a growing number of cobalt , lithium , copper , aluminium and nickel .
This year , the decisions of the United Kingdom , France and Norway , which will allow us to ban fossil fuels on the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades .
Therefore , Volvo scientists have already informed that they intend to abandon the internal combustion engine and the Tesla will bring the market more cheaply to the market .
Banimal berg , according to the New Energy Finance forecasts , is already sold over two decades of cars using electric cars more than oil produced over the two decades .
&quot; In some parts of the metals , it will make all this &apos; , &apos; said Capital of Economics of raw materials , Simona Gambranin Banimal berg .
We have already seen a great deal of influence on metals such as cobalt and lithium , which have increased for years .
The electric car is about three times more than the ordinary car , the Glencore announced the Glencore .
More answers are needed at the chargers , which is why the Exur BNP Paris estimates that this will increase the demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
The increase in demand for electric cars means additional lithium , cobalt , graphite and manganese demand .
Glencore can be generated from rising electricity from electric cars and that it is the world &apos;s largest producer of cobalt , the forecast Jeffbies Group .
It estimates that the winning electric car will be won by Fbete @-@ McMoRan and the first @-@ time Quantum Minerals .
The market is already responding to the changing trend .
This year , 70 % of the fish caught in the metal stock in London .
The price increase was 37 % .
This year , too , there are 14 % of this year &apos;s calendar , mainly due to growth .
The Glencore excise unit rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the rival in Rio Tinto Group , BHP Billioni and Anglo , in the case of BHP Billioni and Anglo .
On the side of Kaomakers , companies are engaged in lead , like Recyclex and Campine , who must adapt to a new era .
The main final use of the Plii is the start of the start @-@ up of petrol and diesel cars , the garages .
Electric cars are used by utilities .
&quot; This is a serious risk for demand , except for the purpose of finding a other purpose that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said the Chairman of the Bank of America of America by Michael Widmer Lynch , Chairman of the Bank of America .
In the form of the price of the Plii price movements , there is not yet a disgusting effect .
It is 17 per cent this year , with the best methane metal in London among the main industrial metals in London .
Investors are only seeing problems in the future in the future .
&quot; I am not sure that this will be so bad , as cheap oil will keep ordinary cars in competition &apos; , said Mwig Schmidt in the light of the sale of metallic broker Triland Metalsi in the light of the sale of metals .
If lead is to fall , it will be slow .
It may be the case in some ten years .
Meanwhile , more stringent standards of exhaust gases mean that the demand for hybrid cars is growing , which is more dependent on the deployment of lead @-@ based axes in the run @-@ up to engines , an international lead and an organisation of research .
Kergmetal , like aluminium replacement , is replaced by a car that can go beyond electricity .
In this context , an additional EUR 1.6 million tonnes of lower minimum demand will be available until 2013 .
This represents 2.7 % of the total world of aluminium .
It is likely that this trend is getting worse , the Widmer .
Aluminium is the 13 % this year , as the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to the market deficit .
The steel manufacturers do not .
The blockade will work together with General Motors to use nano @-@ technology to produce light bullets .
ArcelorMittal and the Sen Europe are trying to develop a lighter melting of steel in order to withstand the lower minimum .
&quot; A strong steel should be a response to this development , &quot; said BNP Paris , Sylvain Brunet .
There is some success in Europe .
The end of the oil age can also lead to a plainum .
It took around half of this precious metal act as a catalyst for diesel cars , announced by the metal refinery Johnson Matta .
&quot; Many of the high demand for raw materials such as oil and platines may not be a major demand in the future , &quot; said Natixourselves , the raw materials analytics , Bernard Dahdah .
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole are becoming less important , but their importance is becoming 15 years .
The Plaatinatmakers believe continued demand for horrendous hysteria .
Mr Marc Grynberg , leader of the Uncore , said that in 2025 , more hybrid cars will continue to be sold into hybrid cars .
The great hope of the Plaatinatmakers of 10 years in the perspective of 10 years is Toyota Motors and Hysei Motosi , based on hydrogen elements based on a plainum that to produce electricity from hydrogen .
So far , however , this technology has not yet justified itself in business .
&apos;Dially seems to have a clear chaos on the road to electric cars &apos; , said Excelleness BNP Paribask Brunet .
German car manufacturers received a major setback in July , as Stuttgart &apos;s court in a ban on the use of diesel was banned by Mr GarcÃ­a @-@ Benz and Porsche hometown .
EU Financial rules on the transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the uncontrolled spending of European football clubs will not prevent the world record transition from the Spanish football clubs to the Barcelona club Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
Any consequences for the UEFA , governing body , governing the European game and in which we can ban teams from the prestigious League of Meters to participate , are waiting for the Paris Saint @-@ GerMay to be before .
The financial rules for fair play in 2011 ( FFP ) mean that the PSG needs to demonstrate at some time that Mrs Neymari &apos;s transition was funded without a huge damage .
To Barcelona , EUR 222 million was paid out of EUR 222 million alone for the Brazilians to buy their contract and the salary of dozens of dollars per year will go to tens of millions of dollars per year .
Here , there are some aspects of the transfer of French clubs to France .
The PSG is undoubtedly possible for the recruitment of Ms Neymarry and to include this kind of money , given that the team is funded by the government of the Star &apos;s power station .
They have been allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players , but they need to balance this legal income with those of a football company , which will allow them to come out of a football pitch .
FFP has laid the foundations for Michel Platini after he was elected as President of the UEFA President in 2007 .
This former French player , in which the clubs , who are in the search of a large debt , are actually dealing with fraud and risk buying when banks or owners should renounce their support .
Since 2011 , FFP clubs will focus on monitoring their losses .
This change means that the business model , the Roman Abramovich , first of all in 2003 in Chelbrics , was able to buy a club with a potential , and then to make huge costs to make the team better and to create a global brand - it is harder to implement .
During the current three @-@ year evaluation period , which runs until 2018 , the clubs will have to carry out the losses of up to EUR 30 million .
And despite the fact that Platini was discredited by the presidential office in 2015 , his UEFA &apos;s successor to Alexander Ceferin is still unimpeded to prevent overspending .
&apos;FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules &apos; , &apos; said last week &apos; The associated Ppressues &apos; , Mr Traverso , who is the adviser of FFP concessions .
Although the PSG clause for the overpurchase clause of Mrs Neymari , it will be possible to distribute this amount to the full duration of the entire agreement for the purpose of the entire treaty .
Mrs Neymar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it is possible to demonstrate a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years .
For the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , the Manchester Cityga , consisting of Abu Dhabi , became the most severely punishments .
The PSG was set at EUR 60 million ( at this point 82 million dollar ) , which was reduced later to EUR 20 million , and a club was required to limit the team of Measures for the 2014 @-@ 2015 season , rather than 25 to 21 players .
UEFA is looking for a club who could try to overturn the financial institutions , blowing its income through companies connected with the owners of the club .
The company &apos;s company may be sponsored by the PSG , but if sponsorship value is considered to be standard market rates , UEFA would not allow this formal income to be taken into account .
In 2014 , in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Qatar tourism has been inflated by the PSG .
It has been said that some sections of the PSG services can come from the three @-@ year @-@ of @-@ EU Cup for the Management Committee of the World Cup .
However , the PSG and Katar 2022 deny that Neymarra could become a world championship Ambassador , and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulators are capable of collating such a manoeuvring .
The penalties imposed before the PSG mean that UEFA is still more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
People who are familiar with the situation have spoken on Thursday that UEFA has not considered a precautionary approach to the changeover of the PSG .
They talked about The associated Ppresga , provided that their anonymity is guaranteed , because they have no chance of discussing the situation in the PSC .
The latest reports show that the PSG 2015 @-@ 2016 will be more than EUR 10 million for a total of around â¬ 542.4 million in turnover .
The data of the last financial year have not yet been published .
The PSG hopes that the arrival of Mrs Neymari on a well @-@ sponsorship transaction , to trade and to sales of swathes .
The club looks at at least 30 per cent growth in the agreement .
The Spanish too , having clearly upset the departure of one of the largest football stars , sought to prevent the move by claiming that the PSG is in breach of this FFP .
&quot; This is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with a club and a country , &quot; said La li President Javier Tebas , in the case of the Spanish newspaper , referring to the fact that the PSG is primarily part of the Qatar .
The Arsenal mountaer of Arsenal Wenger , whose club belongs to the American sports magnate , shares the attitude that the country will fund a club .
&quot; This is a consequence of property rights and it has changed completely the entire football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger Thursday .
&quot; If the club belongs to a country , everything can be done .
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules for fair play , since the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a major player . &quot;

Today , 50 years ago , the hurricancy storm in Estonia , which fox houses and windows .
The storms of the century , which , on 6 and 7 August , caused major damage , particularly in the Baltic States , Harpremaa and Rapid land .
In the run @-@ up to the Northwest in Estonia , more than 30 hours were at the heart of their days .
In my old guest , there was a banner of one card to another , and overlaps with them to support them .
All of it was a blind and ragon , as the global stage .
The Taamas have already been refined in the past , in 2002 , in the old Linda Kurova Haapsalust magazine , the Estonian nature of the Estonian nature .
The husband of the spouse saw how the planners collapsed .
However , what are you about to support , where you are receiving such a storm ?
The sea had to be introduced as a window , from the windows to the prits , &quot; the Kaphau Kalda has been living in the streets today by Mrs Linda at the time .

According to the local , Paraggression was behind the nature of the story , some of which are completely lengthy , some of them .
All of us saw very depressing , the storm went into the beautiful old trees as a radar and pragmatism , like war .
The Western Viruland could not have been severely hit by August 197 compared with Western Estonia , but the losses were large , the Virumaa Official Journal in 2007 .
The Limask Park and Paditself Park were swept away from the swept but also our own parks have been severely affected .
The wind in Tallinn has been measured to 35 metres per second , or about 130 km per hour .
In Tallinn , there was a few tears at 6.August this evening : &apos; Mother , mother !
The chickens are in the air and no longer , &quot; the Viruland Information Journal .
The common sense in Viljandiland is so much that it was decided to dismantle it at a later time .
The construction structures of TÃ¼ri ski were not adopted by August , which no longer was subsequently restored .
On 12 August , the Red Tblt , the Red Tblt , wrote on 12 August in order to ensure that cities and settlements have been halved by the trees and they are proceeding slowly , and the inhabitants could lead to a displacement .
In Turin , fertile crops have also been hit hard , and the newspapers announced that &apos; party organisations need to be both a repeat of the radability and the fertility of fertility and a guideline &apos; .
In the case of Orkaananes , the average speed exceeds 32.7 m / s .
The wind order in Estonia persists in 2 November 1969 , when the Ruhrid measure was measured in 48 m / s .

Secret beaches : Night @-@ cleaning work and poor coastline
The cold summer ills also mean lower harvests in the city of Tallinn .
&quot; If there is no , people are in the rank , and if there is no , there are no people , it is also a beer .
Stroom , in Stroom , is predatory .
They offer a tractor in the low @-@ mechanical competition , a tractor that lags behind the plainum of tricks .
In fact , the last seven cent of metre of deep @-@ seated sand over the last seven @-@ metre will be turned out of the sea and people left behind : Sinks , cigarette packs and other .
People are still going to face , regardless of whether water is soe or not .
If there is a beauty , people are in the rank , and if there is no , there are no people , it is also the administration of the private company to act as a beach to Mr Usov , Mr Usov .
At a time of 6.30 and ranges , there is a bitter record of cleaning work , because at 8 p.m. , there must be a poster for the people .
The Usov has already been completed at four o &apos;clock .
Besides Stroom , he is still watching the Pirita , Harma Lake , KakumÃ¤e and Paljasaare .
The quantities of PrÃ¼m have fallen .
For years , it was much more .
People are now to be able to assess what they are doing for them , the Usov , who has been corroted by 15 years .
Before that , if something new was put up , it was the next day .
It is now being kept in the rank .
The cost of clean beach
One of the biggest jobs in the Estonian beaches is to take stock of rubbish , in other words , advening the rubbish .
For example , the Pirita ranges must be shipped by 400 000 tonnes .
&quot; This is unbelievable , &quot; notes the Usov .
The second major category is municipal waste , or all the people who leave behind .
Half @-@ kilometre Stroom , Stroom , is eight major rubbish seiners , which are needed three times a week .
So much is the waste .
However , cold summer ills have meant that the waste is a fifth of less than otherwise .
The third category is abandoned .
In most cases , these television stations are .
As a result , the Usov sand has floated ten populations from the breakaway wave .
They will be left to the beaches on the road to the wooden wood .
&quot; They are usually more developed , but it is a normal harvest &apos; ; &apos; Usov is already aware that it will soon be in the sand .
Children come to the beaches and take the toys that they re @-@ energise them .
&quot; PrÃ¼m &quot; is being dismantled
The Erika Scholler , a representative of the administrative services , confers that the work of the tractor is disrupting local communities .
Noise , which lasts over the hours of thieves , is confused in the vicinity of people living in the neighbourhood .
This day , however , this work is impossible .
In one month , we have two times to war .
&quot; If we do not do this , the city of the city will be fined , &apos; notes the Scholler .
However , the aim is like Pirita , Pikakr and Persons , as well as in Stroom rand , with the quality of the international flag .
&quot; There is much more work to be done than Europe in Estonia , so that ranges are maintained , says Scholler .
We have more addayages and kids , and it is harder for the driving war .
However , we have less rubbish than elsewhere in Europe .
When it comes to the stringency of the rubbish , Martin forced a journalist who is living in Stroom beach , with a conversation with a journalist and corroal workers , highlighting the current bottlenecks .
Tomorrow , there is a picture of the gallery everywhere .
The problem is the problem of birds and deputslagers , who are rubbish candbags , &apos; Mr Martin .
Although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their practices so far , Mr Martin hopes that the government of the city will take action in refuse to do something , for example , to prevent at least the linkages in the news .
In general , however , Mr Stroom is satisfied with the development of Stroom .
It is seen that the city is taking care of it .
It has become more pleasant , enlightened and fresh , as well as the roads that have been identified .
It was ever that there was only one way to go , in cases of unfolding , by Martin .

Bank of England save interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to be aware that interest rates remain at the former level , as the powerless growth and inflation reduction has cushied speculation on the rise in speculation .
The Bank of England has warned that growth is stagnating , because household incomes have led to interest rates for waiting .
Policy makers of the Bank &apos;s monetary policy ( MPC ) have voted in favour of 6 : 2 + 0.25 % , and fewer members will require an increase in this month , as slow economic growth has weakened the support .
In its quarter of its quarter , the Bank cut the forecast of 1.7 % in 2017 and to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households remains at the rate , as the autumn is expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
At the same time , the Bank also signalled that the growth rate in the next few years is necessary to curb inflation from Brexitfrom from Brexmen , and in the financial markets , the expected increase in the cost of borrowing will be necessary .
Members voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the package of partial readmission in the world economy in Brexti as a result of the year ago .
The bank will put an end to the fixed @-@ term finance scheme in February , which provides a low @-@ cost finance for banks , even though it is now worth GBP 15 billion in the scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
In the minutes of the decision on the Protocol , the Bank says : &apos; The &apos; MPC centre forecast remains powerless in the near future , as the real income of households will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
In order to mitigate the rates of inflation , the need for a &apos; financial policy &apos; to be made in order to mitigate inflation is a matter of course , and &apos; somewhat more &apos; , if the markets are expected to be expected .
For the first time in the third quarter of next year , Mr BÃ¶rs will predict an increase in the second quarter of next year and the second year 2020 .
However , the bank emphasised that any form of hytric is gradual and limited .
The Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and the next year are comparable to projected 1.9 % in May and 1.7 % for the next year .
The forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 was maintained .
After this news , the dollar fell by the dollar and the euro .
Nael fell by 0.5 % of 1.31 US dollars and 0.4 % of 1.11 % .
The decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointment of the disappointing growth figures , which have increased hopes of rising growth in the second quarter of three months than 0.2 % in the previous three months .
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will be able to collect a little momentum .
The latest inflation report by the Bank gave rise to little reason to rejoice in the face of rising inflation and an abject increase in wages , saying that the situation is going to be slightly worse before an improvement .
It was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent the next few years from striking a blow , but a significant recovery is expected to put an end to the annual forecast .
As a result , the economy is also stimulated by increasing demand for British production , which is partly due to lower costs for consumers .
The decision must be taken after the rate of 0.25 % last August after shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the dollar .
The Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years in order to breathe full life into the prices and to the economy .
Prior to the last decision of the Bank , there was a growing demand for raising the rate , as inflation has increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers were required to increase 0.5 % .
Inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected to rise again and again in the coming months .
The Bank said that excessive growth compared to 2 % was entirely due to the weak pound .
Mr Montlake , leader of Creco mortgages , said : &apos; The recent drop in spreads seems to me that the mortgage market will once again become more competitive , because creditors want to work and put an end to the year in a positive way .
Mr BÃ¶rs seems to be particularly favourable to those whose transactions are coming to an end , because refinancing , often serving and low @-@ rate , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
10 000 people have been writing a contradiction between 10 000 people in connection with HIV medicine .
Patients have had access to pre @-@ emptive &apos; HIV @-@ friendly treatment &apos; , since September , with a battle that has been held in the Court of Justice on the need to finance the pharmaceutical industry .
The NHS has announced that public health care is now estimated at 10 000 people to pre @-@ pre @-@ empphylactic ( PrEP ) - an estimated 10 000 people in pre @-@ etal care ( PrEP ) - a tablet to what is being done before an arbitration and a reduction of the risk of infection in high @-@ risk people .
The NHS agreed to finance clinical trials after the Court of appeal was supported by the Court of Justice last year , according to which the NHS can pay for the PrEP , despite its own claims , that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Stevens welcomed the launch of this Thursday in the wake of the &quot; new large @-@ scale intervention &quot; at the same time as the National Eports ( NAT ) described this &quot; turning point &quot; .
Caning clinics in London , Bright ton , Manchester , Liverpoolis and Sheffield , among the first , are the first to be registered in October , in addition to the clinical trials before the programme is introduced in England by April 2018 .
Exposure to pre @-@ trial pre @-@ emplactic ( PrEP ) is an HIV @-@ drug lifestyle , which is taken before the incident in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
The results of clinical trials show that the PrEP will significantly reduce the risk of HIV among people with contagion .
The PrEP &apos;s adoption before the mid @-@ term means that there is sufficient quantities of certain medicines that prevent HIV infections from HIV .
Such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the mid @-@ term .
They include LGBT men , trans @-@ gender people and people , whose partners are infected with HIV and who are not treated with HIV .
The relevant people who agree to participate in clinical trial include men , women , trans @-@ gender people and those who are not engaged in antiretroviral treatment .
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor will be able to register their participation in local sexual health care in the programme participating in the programme .
The programme will pay GBP 10 million , and the NHS is signed by the Treaty in order to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of the PrEP , by collecting clinical evidence of those who are treated and how it is used and implemented .
Steven said : &apos; This new large @-@ scale intervention should complement and enhance the wide @-@ ranging and increasingly successful fight against HIV proliferation .
This is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of the greatest health problems in mankind . &quot;
Mr Deborah gold , the ManT of NAT , said : &apos; This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
The PrEP , if targeted correctly to those who need it and will be in risk , offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England .
Since September , high @-@ risk people in England have been able to access powerful new tools to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and dependent on the negotiating partner , thereby improving many lives .
We warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Mr Terrence , the Executive Director of the Foundation , said : &apos; Now it is a priority to ensure that the clinical trial of the country is rapidly being postponed and that no HIV risk does not fall apart .
Now that the PrEP &apos;s clinical trial has been procured , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who risk HIV infections in the face of HIV .
Sharon Hodgson , Minister for Public Health , said : &apos; PrEP @-@ i clinic attempt is very welcome and very late since the late months of delay and the lecturing of government shoes &apos; .
Evidence shows how significant changes can be brought to the elimination of HIV prevention and non @-@ proliferation of life @-@ related infection .
This clinical trial will lead us to a step closer to full understanding of the benefits of the PrEP .
It is now important for the clinical trial to be introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV and lead us to a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
The price of electricity rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
In a more recent context , the difference between the electricity prices in Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to EUR 1.94 , compared to EUR 7.71 in June this year , in Elering Elering .
The main cause of the price difference is the Russian @-@ Swedish community .
In Estonia , over â¬ 34.33 per megawatt @-@ hour and the price came from June to 12 % in the electricity centre in Estonia .
In Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by 5 per cent of 36.27 per megawatt @-@ hour .
In Finland , the price of EUR 34.17 was EUR 34.17 and the electricity exchange rate in Nord half of the system was at the level of EUR 26.37 per megawatt per hour .
Prices rose according to 12 and seven per cent .
Between Estonia and Finland , the electricity between Estonia and Finland was between the last few of the last month , and 16 % of the hours from Estonia to Finland .
The remaining nine per cent of the two countries did not take place in the next two days .
Between Estonia and Latvia , electricity reached between Estonia and Latvia at the time of Latvia and 73 % was at the disposal of all transmission capacity .
According to the last trading day of July , Nasdaq OMX on the market may have an estimated â¬ 34 and â¬ 37 per megawatt in August .
The price of carbon dioxide emissions affecting electricity prices last month came to 5.04 @-@ 5.47 per tonne .
Life of life - half @-@ truce and smart designer have changed the small Earls of the flater room for their homes
Joanne Leigh , former bankers who are passionate about property renewal , switched to the home of their great Knightsbridge in 2014 by Earls Courti .
It is based on Queen Anne Terlai , and that Joanne is not a packed @-@ up of the packed and repetitive , is an expression of respect for the new design .
&quot; Before I live together with the former co @-@ life , Knightsbridge , &quot; said Joanne .
&quot; I was something that would be equivalent to the price that I offer .
I was told by the Earls Court and had the same high waves .
I have a doctor in this and I made an offer on the same day .
Since the first visit , this 93 @-@ square metre has undergone full innovation .
At the beginning , it was one sleeping and a complex sleep , a sleep for a sleep , and Joanne wanted to add a spawning and a half @-@ truce in order to take advantage of high brains .
&quot; I wanted to see high light , high numbers of light .
These were my demands , &apos; he said .
He is asking the architectural and designer of Erriad Azadi Notting Hillis Duck &amp; D , to take advantage of 3.8 m people , and to create a home , which would not simply be the point of development , but a place where Joanne could live .
It was not high enough to add two space to each other , so the architecture of the architecture was to create a quasi @-@ truce in which it can stand up .
Mr Erriman had to be creative in the matter .
&apos;Metalroll &apos; is quite complex , it explains .
&quot; We had to reorganise space , so they will be based on each other , without any marching .
It was not just a platform to build a platform , but we used the construction of steel , so that both the excess and the upper limit is right . &quot;
This place allowed the Erphil to create two full @-@ time elements in the space of each other , with a great deal of dramatic elements .
In writing . - ( SK ) Our time is open to the old @-@ fashioned window of life in the old @-@ fashioned light of Retrouvius &apos;s window .
The golden furniture of Peegeldden , silver details and retrospective flage Mouille is underpinned by a space of space .
The use of cartels plays a role in the inclusion of theatre , space and lighting .
In the short corridor , the mirrors have been included in both sides of the corridor .
In the Knight , I will give the impression of a second log as an akin to another .
As a result , a snapshot will provide a snapshot for all Joanne &apos;s and the glass requirement .
The cost of life will add a false opportunity to shut down , if it is not used , creating a mockery of vision .
The glass kitchen is nothing new .
However , in this kitchen , it is a unique fact that this is the dissolution of the type of uprising of the garage .
&quot; This went a little in the design of a design , &apos; clarifies the nature of Mr MDF &apos; from the MDF .
&quot; This is a counterpart , which is why it is very simple , if it is to be rejected . &quot;
Thanks to space and space for smart use of space , Joanne is now 16 additional metres , an additional sleeping sleep and better harvesting .
&quot; After all , there is an insurgency that you sell - or what it gives property value , &quot; words Errir .
&apos;Kinnisan in the form of an outdated desert and makes calculations on the basis of land area &apos; .
Here , they have been able to increase the floors using high quality materials that add a luxury to a space .
&quot; Materials are the ones that you are missing and which will help to create an emotional link with the home , &apos; says Mr Harbour .
&quot; You are not in a power station in the insect .
It is important , but it does not give hearts to languages . &quot;
This shows that a good design and an increase in the area of the area will be amazed by something amazing .
In fact , they may create a desire not to leave , as was the case with Joanne .
Mr Jensen is a head @-@ off in Chicago &apos;s pilgrim , who will compete with a fellow Member who will compete with his fellow Member .
It does not seem to be the amount of money that has been made , which is to be forgotten by any ethics .
His wife and three children see a man in a murderous and late night .
In the first half of the film , I find myself in thinking that it is a version of the &apos; Cadiman house &apos; - even in Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler &apos;s speech is similar .
The film and the moral intention of the film @-@ makers will continue to be more transparent than the film @-@ maker , however .
Life @-@ related experience can be a key player in cancer .
There is now a choice between working and family life .
A poet of polemics , a poet of disappointments , makes a father in the shoes in Chicago &apos;s big buildings , just like faith , good , love ... , without even the twin disaster of the twin towers .
After the third , where the son &apos;s father opens up a eyes , there is a feeling that the film @-@ maker will certainly be able to obtain the audiences of the target , because even with the most basic heart , it will not be possible to keep a blind eye to the suffering of a dark cancer hospital .
If a son coincides and his situation seems hopeless , the father and the father of his work seem to be able to understand the morality of his work and do a man who is looking for a job .
I am now in a position of self @-@ betting - when the film is at the heart of it , then I will be rewarded with an intimate nature after the film imitate , but if I am wrong , at least one surprise may be commended .
There will be suspicion for a moment that ice , without a husband of the husband and a man in the middle of a motorised corridor , are going to be suspicious , if a husband is a rare disease .
However , Mr Poeg has been admirably healthy , and although his father has just lost his job , it will be positive because it is now time to deal with the family .
I can also feel well - I can already predict the end of the American drama !
The truth is that the film is well constructed , all the necessary elements are there .
It is going to be the case , the actors are good and morally : The money is not the most important thing in life .
It is a film that brings the film well .
The new staff transfer period is planned to limit the media consumption of the President .
Others have tried and failed .
Perhaps John F. Kelly will also be able to do so .
That would be the first .
The political tico writes that the new staff transfer of the White House is planned to limit the information provided by President Trumpin , including news , in the hope that it will keep the upper hand in a mistake .
There is an overlap of a reporter Joseph Dawseylt :
&quot; When the new staff transfer of the White House John Fe , Mr Kelly , , his first day of work came together with high officials , he pointed out the key problem with President Donald Trumpi Valmas , which he intends to resolve in the hands of the bad information in the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly said officials that information must be carried out , whether or not on paper or meetings , because the President would make better decisions when it was well informed . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems to be completely logical , but others have tried , and they have been trying to tame the Trumpn winter in his media consumption .
President Trumpi &apos;s relationship with television goes for decades , and now it is in the White House , it is not his television screens somewhere .
&quot; If a candidate Trump was dishonest about the discontent of the media , it would show him that he was published in a frank fashion , &quot; said Sam Nunberg , &quot; former campaign apparatus Sam Nunberg , Politicole in February .
The Politico Witharen wrote at the time that &apos; the &apos; six @-@ pack &apos; , according to the &apos; six @-@ pack &apos; , is a key tool for controlling the use of the Trumpi Twitter tool , if it is to ensure that it is also stable in its personal media consumption . &quot;
Good .
However , the idea that the habits used by Twitter by using the Trumppoint have ever been &apos; control &apos; , it is ridiculous .
Perhaps those campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know about the fact that the vutters in Trumpi would have been even more heartened without their intervention .
We will probably never know about the devolution that Trump did not postal .
If he had been able to rescue him or a couple of times , if he was able to save it or a couple of times , their efforts were worth .
However , no one has been able to prevent the polemics of the Trumpi consistently .
Part of the problem is that in the White Paper of the White House of the equation , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception , by transferring material to the bull , which supports their views on the world , but may not always be credible .
The whole story of a policy @-@ related policy is written in May by Counsellors for a strategic question of information to the President of the European Council .
One of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows :
&quot; The current and former Trumpi will say that Trump may react to a negative press , particularly on infants , an explosion in infants , with an explosive approach to identifying their source of departure .
At the end of February , when someone gave a happy copy to the President , Mr Charles C. Johnsoni , the website of GotNews.com , which blamed the staff deputies to Katie Walshi , has taken place at the end of February when someone had a lot of leaflets to the President .
It is not a difference that the Johnson has been blocked by Twitter because of a mockery or that he did not offer any specific evidence or that he has also passed the wrong accusations in the past and withdrawn .
The Trump read Article and started to ask Walshi . &quot;
The Goldmacher added that the time staffing of the staff in Reince Priebus and the head of the White House Rob Porter have tried to impose a system for managing the documents that reach the Trugin Trugin and document . &quot;
How did it manage ?
Mr Kelly is going to do exactly the same for three months later .
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but Trump is still an impulse and his abyss competition continues to have the effect .
These unchanging factors change the very difficult mission of the mission .
Music musicians who have come from abroad to the capital of the capital are not bitter enough .
There is a great deal of foreign affairs in the city of Tallinn .
Those who jump out have acknowledged that the town of Municipality can be found in the town without any permission .
The first was the three street musicians who have taken the same lead in the streets of Viru Viru .
It was clear to see that the rhythes and crrians were the musicians in absentia , to whom one of the duch marches were to be taken away .
In spite of the fact , the only woman in the company has played a ferry with a fortnight , while one man in front of the three colleges and furnalists brought closer together .
The third man was , alongside them , to one of their homes , and smokers themselves are ready to turn up their disgust .
These three homes did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the furniture of the nation .
In writing . - ( DE ) Mr President , Mrs Bob has played a gesture with the Casemi and palliates that he said that the black streets in the streets and after the money .
The aim of this House was to collect the ticket ticket for the same day in Finland on the same day .
On the question of whether or not they asked for urban protection in the old town , Noemi and Bob are shaking their heads .
Firstly , we did not know .
Secondly , we will never remain in one city more than a day or a few and most of them , for the time being promised , or something like this .
There is no point in paying for it , explaining it .
If we were to return to Virgu from around 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in the hands of musicians and they are going to go .
This journey is a challenge to the heart of the sacks and bags of plastic sacks and cocaine Viru .
Viru thanked the three Polish young men , one of whom played a fifth , the second knife , and the third was that it has been transported by electronic glass .
&apos;We are here to give people entertainment to be able to spread music and joy , and to make money for fuel and residence &apos; , explained the trio from Mivosh .
According to the Mivoshi , they are aware of the fact that the city &apos;s licence must be in place .
&quot; Of course , we do not have this &apos; yes &apos; , he said .
However , we hope that if people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
Of course , if the police have to be taken , we are going to go elsewhere , but we must try , in the Annex .
In the context of the public coffbuying programme of the euro area central banks in Estonia , a total of â¬ 4.36 billion , a central bank portfolio , grew up to â¬ 4.36 billion .
The Central Bank is not publishing more detailed information on purchases .
The President of Estonia , Hardo Hansson , has made clear in response to the former members of the national assembly that the system of central banks of the Eurosystem will cover three different purchasing programmes : The bonds of the financial sector ( &apos; No &apos; ) , guaranteed bonds ( ABS ) and public bonds ( PSPP ) .
The Central Bank is buying bonds from the market in order to encourage investors to invest money for investors .
The impact of purchases will fall in the production of lower @-@ risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks .
As a general rule , the government bonds in the public sector , with the government of the public sector , are in the framework of the government bonds , with no other country bonds .
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds , Estonia will make available a replacement shop within the limits of the amount allocated to them .
In these countries , the central banks are also making the purchase of their respective bonds limited .
The Estonian bank buy Hansson &apos;s assurances generally about bonds of European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank .
The Estonian bank buy bonds from March 2015 as part of the purchase programme .
In the meantime , treasury bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian bank of June 2016 will no longer be able to buy bonds .
In the name of the euro area central banks , since June , the Central Bank of Eleround and Estonia will buy bonds from the Central Bank .
The migratory movements are flourishing and returning to the &apos; millions of business &apos; .
Some of the West Midlands can once again find themselves in a confrontational confrontation with specific exposures , who have ignored the degree of Council @-@ led degrees in order to win back their cotton .
The migratory movements have parked their 20 trailers at the helm of a &apos; mill @-@ shirt &apos; in the street near the bricks of a &apos; mild &apos; in Solihulli .
They have returned , together with horses , children and lorry vehicles , if they were to be thrown out in May , without having to be confused with a degree of creeping in their invasion of Council .
The act group found a weakness in the defence limit , turning its vehicles through unimpeded parts , which were left to poke .
Maruangry people have surped the Solihull Council , saying that the &apos; problem &apos; is useless by the Council .
One anonymous person said : &apos; They are going to go there on Monday evening after their exclusion from Mr Heathfrom , where they were stolen by the proveners &apos; .
It must be embarrassed that they are going to act because they have been useless in dealing with the problem .
The migratory movements were there in May , they were going to go and now they are again .
This was the case yesterday evening , probably more . &quot;
He added : &apos; Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by acquiring a long barrier to protect their parks .
I live on the road to strike and I am not satisfied that I have to continue to pay the power of the Council if the Council cannot even prevent such a thing . &quot;
One local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said : &apos; It is ridiculous , we saw how the last few of these emigrants left , and there is already a new offensive .
This time , there has been an increase in the number and there is still a horse in the countryside . &quot;
The representative of the Solihulli Council said : &apos; We are aware that the road in the south of the street will be unacceptable in the countryside , and we will work with the Solihulli police to implement the necessary legal measures so that they can move as soon as possible .
It is very helpful when as many local people as possible , as many local residents , certain anti @-@ antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police , call the number of 101 seats .
This will help to create a picture of the Court of Justice if we are presenting the case . &quot;
The Weeky festival is also visiting the Minister for Culture , Indrek Saar , who is pleased that there has been real world top names in Estonia .
The question of why the Weeky Festival is so important , in the case of Saar , that it should be asked of all those who have been enjoying the louder at the festival three days at the festival .
However , he is aware that the real estate of the Italians has come to the fore .
&quot; Looking at the level of artists , which has been brought to Estonia , it is that the absolute excellence of this music jump will be brought home , often in the hands of the Minister for Culture , speaks of Minister for Culture .
What festival performers are in Saart himself most of all ?
I have to find myself in a relatively old age and I am certainly one of the most recent doctors , Armin van Beneren , who took place yesterday evening .
According to his plaice , all of us are at some point in the foot of the past , a word he has done .
However , he still has a number of names , such as Chainthia , Deadmau5 , Knifeak .
Of course , our own makers from Estonia - starting from NOx P and they can be counted as a whole series .
In reality , the known name concentration is very high , he says .

The Audi boosts the criticism of car manufacturers in the middle of up to 850 000 diesel vehicles .
The day before the Audi announcements , BMW said that it provides an incentive for more than 350 000 vehicles .
According to the BMW chairman , the company believes that &apos; there is a smarter option than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to cities in Europe , including BMW , in Munich , which has considered a ban on diesel vehicles or restrictions .
The Daimler announced on Tuesday that there are three million Mercedes of plans to reduce gas emissions in diesel engines in Europe .
No company has described them as a reminder .
European car manufacturers have been working enthusiastically in Europe and in the United States to help to comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions .
Nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and that may cause asthma .
The cost of exhaust gases emitting diesel vehicles for motor vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult for cars to compete in the price of cars .
At the same time , while German car manufacturers are in a thorough investigation , the Chancellor of the Federal Chancellor , Angela Merkel , is also accused of chairing the powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs that refer to the problem .
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen who quieter on the use of so @-@ called stockpiling devices , which allowed us to adapt to regulatory regulations for the time of the testing of gas emissions , but in normal circumstances .
A number of Volkswagen instructions have been prosecuted in the United States and others are under way in both sides of the Atlantic .
Last month , the former president of the Audi engine Development unit was arrested in Germany as a former president of the Audi engine Development unit .
The former President , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is not protected for extradition , and can be brought to justice in the United States .
At the beginning of this year , the Audi German Volkswagen had been drawn up in the area of Volkswagen , when the authorities accused the installation of the audit system in order to evade the quantities of European gas emissions by extending investigations , which had focused on the United States in the past .
The inclusion of the Audi could be a great blow to the Volkswagen , a huge blow to the Volkswagen manufacturer &apos;s profits in a disproportionately large part of the Volkswagen .
The Estonian schools will have 20 000 euro flags in the European Union .
The Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union by 1 September by 1 September .
Together with the measurements , the meters of the European Union flag for 570 educational institutions can be summarised .
Lipud is foreseen in indoor indoor doors , they must be carried out in high @-@ quality printed techniques in the quality of the quality print , the ERR is brokered by the ERR .
The text has a text : &apos; The recognition of the Estonian School of Estonia for the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , or one flag will cost EUR 35 .
Murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat of threat in Mexico
The Nweeks @-@ July Riodoce workers will normally gather in Wednesday , in order to review plans for the most recent loss of life in the State of the State of Europe , which sows organised crime , corrupt officials and ceased drug wars .
However , today they have gathered to discuss their own security in the shadow of a personal tragedy .
They are told that it is important to change their routine .
Two of the parents will be discussing , which seems to be safer : Either to bring children into office in an office that was a target for 2009 , or to leave them home .
The Turks have written a space to the heart of the city headed by the &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
They are asking reporters to give the reporters &apos; evidence of the fact that there is no need for a impressions , it is enough to have the impressions and invasions .
The presence of government or cartels is suspected of drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists , a whole list of people who are doing the risk of spreading chaos in Mexico .
There is no breath of violence , and the more the bodies of the country accumulate , the majority of them are journalists , according to data from the Committee on Civil Protection of journalists , from the nomination of at least 25 , since the attacks and threats of public protection in the country , at least at 25 in the seven state in the year , and this year , at least seven journalists in the seven state of the country have been killed .
The latest deaths include their editor and inspiration , Riodoce co @-@ founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .
&quot; The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &apos; wrote Valdez one of the books on drug violence in one of his many .
His absence is deeply felt , even though his presence can be perceived as a snapshot of the head of the State of Riodoce building in a faÃ§ade , with a great picture of the middle of Valdezist , with a bundle of &apos; fairness &apos; and two thirty @-@ reporreporters , Aaris Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , the T @-@ shirt , which has an image of his wife , or the amateur village of the Kiriam Ramirez .
The meeting will take place less than two months after the death of Reporters will be discussing a common trauma , their nightmare , unthinkable paranoia .
Although in 2010 , the public Prosecutor &apos;s Office has been set up to address cases of journalist , with the protection of journalists from the Committee on Civil Liberties , only two cases have been brought to justice by journalists .
As in the case of most of the most annual drug trafficking and organised crime , the number of which amounts to thousands , the killers of journalists are rarely prosecuted .
In the case of Riodoce editorial , there will be a continuation of the violence in the Sinhalas , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
Without the murder of the data and justice , there is a lot of benefits not to security , according to the Ibarra .
&apos;There is a very fine time at the meeting here , &apos; he says .
&quot; As long as the reason is not known , there is a mistrust of all . &quot;
On 15 May this morning , the State of Valdez kindle , the capital of the State of Valdez tÄ , on 15 May .
He has managed to travel only a few quarters , before the two men were captured by the Red Toyota Coroles , and he was forced to go out of the car and the 12 times that , in the name of the newspaper , which means translation in the &apos; twelfth river &apos; .
The armed man travelled to Valdez &apos;s car and did a disaster in the vicinity .
The Valdez was 50 years old .
A woman was left behind and two adults .
The Culiacan freely circulated freely .
However , there is only a silence on the subject of Valdez .
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of the United States in January , one of the most bloodiest battlefields in the country is the one most bloody battlefields in the country , since rivalry is fighting in a power vacuum .
It is not a difference that some people , or even several months , are being placed on the streets of oa , or that the deaths of the wretched flats are wrapped up to the smills of a fortnight , which are larger than many homes in many living homes .
Let us forget for a moment that the peace period refers to how the state of play of drug routes to the United States and the United States is only dominated by a cartel .
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the risks associated with his work , Riodoce and the President of Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) have enormous innocence in order to prevent him from defending his friend .
He believes that the killing was two injured .
The first of these was the publication of an interview with Mrs Guzman &apos;s poppers , and the cartel of war , which has been carried out in February , by publishing an interview with Mr Damascus in February .
This piece of correspondence may have been alluded to by the monarchies to the suspect who bought all the copies of the publication immediately when they arrived in the newspapers .
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave his own security country after it took place in one of the same respects as the newspaper broadcast in one another .
Valdez was legalised both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point against the violence against journalists in Mexico .
He has remained in life for so long , so that his friends and colleagues expect him to be permanently .
He worked in the newspaper Norol in 2003 in Norol in 2003 when he joined the five colleagues in order to create a Riodoce , the sale of 50 @-@ dollar parts .
Bojorquez has said that it was impossible to deal with the media without addressing the drug problem . &quot;
The total amount of time , your courageous and honest reflections , and sales and advertising increased .
In writing . - ( SV ) In a sympathetic manner , we have a great deal of research without censorship and readers , which they were able to read stories that nobody else dared to reflect .
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce , the newspaper has won the award of his Latin American mirrors to Maria Moors Caboti .
In the same year , the Wdez journalists &apos; Protection of the International Committee on Freedom of the Press ( AKK ) won his courage for his courage to follow the Mexican drug addicts all of which it leads .
He openly admitted that it was afraid .
&quot; I would like to live on , &quot; said the AKK , by adopting the prize .
Last October , he said to the television channel Rompeviento TV to interview that drug trafficking is a way of life .
The &apos; head of the task &apos; is to embrace the task that the office of the journalist is accompanied by another opportunity to play .
I do not want me to ask me that , in the face of so many deaths I did or why I did not talk about what is happening . &apos;
Riodoce collect is longing for Valdez , a joke , a roh like low , warring who divided embryos and advice , teachers who knew how to survive .
They are in favour of his routine .
He always made a barrel .
He went on the office of El Guatemyabo , a head of office in El Guatemyabo , at the same time .
Now they are asking whether his routine love was to be sent to him .
His death has also put them into doubt on how best to do their work and stay alive .
&quot; They do not like the blind to their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing records used for drug transport . &quot;
&quot; These things should not be touched , &quot; said Bojorquez .
The result is , even in the best times , strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ support .
Your instincts .
If it perfumes the myriad , the hotel away .
The problem is that &quot; fragrance can be deceived ... and this is the case with Mr Jasserv , Mr Andres Villarreali .
His and others say that the Sinhalas does no longer apply to the old rules , just as they do not apply to Thailand , Veracruzi , Guerreros or other states which are home to the toxic combination of revenue @-@ generating routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
The landscape is constantly changing .
In a space where the Belgian workers were met for security training , there were suddenly no longer mobile phones ; some days before it was revealed , that only a numbering bank for the governments was used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists .
The House had two police officers in front of two policemen puzzling the heat of 40 @-@ meadc heat .
They were appointed by the government by the government of Riodoce , which is located in the middle of the Culiacan Centre in Culiacan .
Some reporters were wondering whether these police officers are a number of their 50 % of police officers , whose Governor himself has been untrustworthy .
A number of months have passed since reporters have been travelling in mountain areas where control is de facto drug gangs .
The edition of the Riodoce and this week addressed three main pillars .
One of them was the murder of the former poet Julio Cesar Chavez , Sinhalas .
In addition , they had an revealing the spending of government finances to the home town of the Governor .
From one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , the public Prosecutor &apos;s cabinet , a group of people from Culiacan was kidnapped .
There was no formal announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened , so there was a need to be careful when it was time to write what everything in the city knows about a restaurant , both of the drug dealers and the authorities of the authorities .
The Reporter became aware of public documents that a restaurant is registered as a politician , who belongs to the present institution @-@ in @-@ Office of the Political Parties ( IRP ) , which dominated all levels of politics throughout the last century .
In recent times , several IRP leaders have been accused of corruption in the context of corruption .
In Villardy asked the reporter to write the previous incidents in place , including the pog of Guzman poppy in El Chapo in Guzman , who led to a coup d &apos;Ã©tat .
Just a few months earlier , readers have been looking for the Valdez &apos;s scok to obtain information on the best sources of the kidnappings .
&apos;sooner we have known what happened &apos; , &apos; 46 @-@ year @-@ old Villarline , whose broker body has earned his name &apos; El Flaco .
&quot; It is now all channels of communication that have broken off our sources . &quot;
The office of Valdez has become a space of storage and stickers , which protest against the killing of journalists and have become something that they never expected to expect for a pressurised activist .
The Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few eyes and direction next morning to the local Prosecutor &apos;s cabinet to a new journalist .
Mr Aus , Mr Aus , is three days after the killing of Valdez , in the State of Valdez .
It has been found to burned dead and officials , according to the DNA tests , to him .
Journalists have become more void of voice across the country , and a phrase &apos; SOS press &apos; , a phrase &apos; SOS press &apos; .
On this day , Mr Bojorquez is in Washington , trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez .
A day after the death of Valdez , the Yoroa case , we accused the authorities for journalists in a numbering and killing the truth as a result of the truth .
After that , he asked him to be directed towards the government &apos;s activities , when it is concerned that hatred has been affected by objectivity .
The Valdez was said repeatedly that Mexican journalists are in the &apos; restricted &apos; in the form of organised crime , compassion for public officials and indifference society .
In its last book , the drugs press , he wrote that the reporters will not be killed only by drug gangs , but also by the command of politicians and security forces who have organised crime .
The Media Monitoring Group ( JTIs ) , Mr Articulo 19 , gave more than half of the attacks on journalists in the police and civil servants last year .
&quot; In Mexico , you want to be silent , &quot; said Ramirez .
There are clearly spillover effects on the verge .
No one will forget a bloggger Maria Elizabeth Macias &apos;s death in the northern border in Thailand , six years ago .
He was found to be a dead , with a letter that was probably signed by the cartel in LOS Zetas : &apos; I am here in my report &apos; .
In addition to his magic cloutlet , computer glass and ears were burnt .
Some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Norte in the north @-@ east of Chihuahua , Chihuahuas , following the killing of their correspondents in the March by March .
Others will continue as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the murder of the President in 2004 .
In 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez drugs said &apos; What you want to &apos; Mida you yourself want &apos; .
Some journalists are in the state of home or even have fled the country .
This is a nervous decision .
It is difficult to find a job , and they still have to get to the streets to avoid the dangers .
And sometimes they are behind , as was probably the photographs of Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered together with four months of women in 2015 after Veracruz .
Those who remain in place and continue to work must be able to refute the risky decisions every day .
Ibarra , who wanted to become a poet , recognises that the display of drug trafficking is intimidating him .
&quot; Mexico is a road to hell , and that is why I am getting a reporter , &quot; said .
One of the recent midnight of Friday , when the latest number was already beached in Riodoce , sat in the head of the office and plundering the beer when it suddenly started to relax all the phones .
There were 19 people who have died in the wake of the rivalry and the rivalry that has taken place in the heels of Mazatlanin , in the wake of rivalry and security forces .
The war continues to continue , as has also been promised by a number of the messages that have been found in the region .
In the same way , the reporters made a reporter in Riodoce on a mobile phone when using a mobile phone .
In the next day , it was necessary to change .
The Sireens were overstretched by another additional fire in the region .
Mr Bojorquez piilus , for police officers on the right to see whether they are vigilant .
If they were afraid , they did not at least show them .
The massive entry into force of the Ajala site , with his average finger at seeing the whole of the Sinhalan , was delivered by Riodoce workers in his footsteps .
&quot; How can it be closed at all , &quot; said Bojorquez , &quot; while Javier killed , Mr President , he asked me to make a reporter to her report ? &apos;
Dinosaur used to prevent enemies of defence
At first sight , it seems like the form , although rather frightening .
Scientists have now unveiled the first findings of the unbelievable presence of Canadian miners , which are so well maintained , that experts have described it as a &apos; dinosaur Mona &apos; .
It has been so well maintained that it was even possible to ascertain that the leather covered by his Finns was coloured with red lignite and his past was somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
The report published by the current state of the Biology has described the assumption as &apos; best of the survivors , which has ever been found &apos; and &apos; one of the best departments in the world &apos; .
In the case of Ffossil , it is a new notenode which lived in the middle of an age , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
It is incredibly good to maintain the researchers who describe this &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
It is a plant covered by this kind of vegetation of a magazine , according to the National Geodade Accorts , the most survivors of this type of phosphorus , which has ever been found .
This was found on 21 March 2011 , when he was in the mining of Formal McMurray , in the mining of Formal McMurray , in the mining mine of the Suncor Millenum .
He has struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into it .
The phosphorus has been sent to Royal Tyrrell Palace , Museum .
The next six years have been developed in order to bring the animal to 2 500 navies ( 11.100 @-@ kilometres ) .
After all this hard work , the final result is now to bring the public back to the public .
&quot; If a little eye is streamed up , almost believe he is sleep , &quot; said the leading author Caleb Brown , the scientist Royal Tyrrell , in the museum , where the assumption is .
&quot; This goes down in the history of the history of one of the most beautiful and most well @-@ preserved hosts in the Mona @-@ city of Mona . &apos;
He looked at the researchers that , while they are covered by soya , and researched a sounder tank , it was likely to have a significant impact on meat gardens .
This multitude of sodity was used by red and white colours in order to hide behind predators , and implement medical prescriptions referred to as &apos; counter @-@ liability &apos; and which also used many of today &apos;s animals .
It has made it possible for experts to be better around the neighbourhood and to prevent the enemies , as the major interlocutors were likely to be hunt down .
This is the first time that the family belonging to a family of 110 million of the notesaurms of this year came to the news in May and is now visiting Royal Tyrrell Palace in the Museum .
The researchers have now investigated and gave the name of Mr Mitchell , the Museum of Borealpolil Marxchell , to a laboratory mark Mr Mitchell , which was the famous team that spent more than 7000 hours of unwise exposing of the demand .
Thanks to the very good preservation of the father , Mr Mitchell and the International Researchers &apos; teams can document the form of the form of soddy and size set up a body .
They discovered , in the name of a common defence method , a defence method that is widespread in the country of nature , which means that the intrusion of the assumption was a quarter of the aluge .
Although there is widespread controversy , bread will come as a surprise , because Borealpolitan is much greater than those who are currently living in a shadows today .
This implies that the dinosaur hunts in a sufficiently active manner in other musicians , so that the evolution preferred to obscure the opposite of the contrasts of survival tactic .
However , most of the animals used today - such as fear , bbers or doctors - are a lot smaller and more vulnerable , which indicate that the pressure of nodosaursis had to really work really to survive .
A robust hunt on the ground , which is covered by large and large @-@ scale Finns , shows how dangerous they were kidnapped by the infurrical infants , &quot; said Brown .
The chemical analysis of organic compounds has also revealed that the dinosaur leather was stunned .
Scientists continue to set up an investigation in order to get angles about their lives , including the content of this gender @-@ style shutdown in order to find out what the animal is in its own last einee .
They believe that the dinosaur collapsed in the death of rivers , thus becoming a sea in the sea , where it turned out to the ocean .
At that time Mr Albertas was just as soe as the South of Florence and rivers and oceans are likely to go far beyond the internal land as currently .
&apos;This nodosaurus is truly remarkable , since it is fully covered by a sober leaf , but it has also been a three @-@ dimensional , while maintaining the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; As a result , the animal is now almost the same as an infiltration age .
There is not a great deal of imagination to be used for this reconstruction - it is enough simply to predave the eyes and that it seems to be a sleep . &quot;
It was time for the crisis in which huge two legs were hijacked in the countryside - terogeneous .
Although the King Tyrannosaurus rex was living for millions of years later than Borealdouble , it could be hunted down some of his horrendous predecessors in his horrendity .
They include AcrocanthovÃ¡ , 38 footwear ( 11.5 metres ) and six tonnes of cholecum .
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in Biology , believe that Borealdouble were killed after death in the sea and the mutation mudiluted .
It was discovered on 21 March 2011 , when he extracted the mining of Millenium in Formal McMurray , near the North Albertas in Canada .
According to the Muuseum , this is the best preserved unit in the world , including leather and soya , and this is a comprehensive concentration of up to timber .
These assumptions were on average 18 years ( five metres ) long and more than GBP 3 000 ( 1300 kg ) .
There were two 20 customs @-@ long ora of customs on this shoulders .
Scientists believe that this is covered by the nights and seaflets covered by the current Western Canadian state , as long as it is flooded into the river .
However , the homage of the squares in the sea helped to maintain an excellent amount of detail in detail .
The residues of this particular father are so well maintained , so that the headlines behind the longevity of noise @-@ garsoal posters are still covered by skin @-@ leavers .
As Mr Greshko wrote in National Geovan : &apos; Such storage is as rare as a census &apos; .
What more I look at , it seems to be unbelievable .
The skin @-@ leaded leavers still cover the creation of myphic soybean plates .
A better front is stalling , and five of them have been rushed up .
I will be able to count on the sodden Finns . &quot;
How can one act found a response to the question of &apos; whom today ? &apos;
On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell had a full shock .
Just a day after the travel of New York in New York , this StLoui resident , via a temporary rented tower , is going to travel to Airbus , via Facebook .
He was not in the post of his former school commuter .
There was a &apos; police killing 18 @-@ year @-@ old adolescents &apos; and he is still in the streets . &quot;
He was confused , why someone else was not the subject of this information , which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
Mr Pidega @ TheePsucrose has repeatedly been divided on his record on his record .
Mr St. , a silicon from the region from the region , in real time , sent out the death of a young man of unarmed 18 @-@ year @-@ old age , who killed the White police officer in the Ferguson Missouris white police officer in the Ferguson Islands .
He gave a picture of the life of Browni living in which he was in a position to come to the streets , when it comes to four hours .
&quot; This is crazy , &apos; thought @-@ up &apos; has been interviewed .
However , death was nothing new for his or her community .
He has made a phone by his phone , but it later saw a shutdown , which said this time from the assembly of Canfield , Mr Drive .
Jagat photographs of the police and the terrible people , and the man who claimed himself to be the father of Browni and kept a label with the &apos; Fergusoni police killed just my unarmed son &apos; .
He watched in real time the stream in which the police officer stood up to the group of protesters responsible for the graves .
In the second video @-@ up , one another police officer , said that he said guns and fear : &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
The Ferrelle reminded us how he hit himself from thinking : &apos; It is unusual . &apos;
&quot; This is not a murder of this kind , which we are used to and what we could call a typical practice . &quot;
I felt at the moment .
I was outraged by the rain and I had tried . &apos;
He booked a flight and travelled home on the next day .
At the end of 23 May , she went to his father &apos;s six @-@ year tyre and decided that they will travel two years on the next morning with Fergusoni .
What Mr Ferrelli and Fergusonik took place in the next three years is the key issue in the new documentary document &apos; Wholean strikes ? &apos; ( &apos; Whose thanks today ? &quot; ) , which is taking place in cinemas on 11 August .
This is a story of survival and protections , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who met the answers today .
If Mrs Ferreira , together with the tyranny , who had a litilla and a peculiar chromer , the Fergusoni travelled , who spoke once again on the subject , which had previously been discussed before this morning , and with the experience of living conditions and conditions of life .
&apos;However , when I taught you how the community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; Recalls his question .
&apos;We are going to war with Fergusoni , because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and it is not right &apos; .
&quot; I did not have him to take it , &apos; said Ferreira &apos; later .
&quot; What is happening now is the culmination of what has happened in the past .
He needs to know this and see it in the middle of it .
He must learn from a activists and organise and feel the different strays of experience and living conditions , and that what we need to do is to free and liberate ourselves .
Even if I succeed in raising him so that he is not personally responsible for racism , it does not err on some of the other black girls .
I feel that I would make him a disservice when I would defend him from the world . &quot;
The first suspension , which they made by Mr Ferguson , was the South Fissanti path in the middle of a police station , which was in place for a certain kind of camp , where activists were waiting for the news of the police officer , Darren Wilson , who was not at the end of the accusation .
There was a link between Ferreira and his daughter and his daughter in the local business owner who prepared the lunch .
They put together food colours and helped to share them with the protests .
For the Ferrell , a new type of activist began slowly .
&quot; My activist became fully after 9 August , &quot; said that , when he was a Mistral @-@ St. Louine University student , he was the President of the European Union for students in VÃ¤vians and focused on food justice and health inequalities in communities .
&quot; I did not have any experience of organising .
This is all simply a lab . &quot;
At the time of the week , Mrs Ferreira , at the time of a trial , was a film director , SabIsh Folayante .
Mr Folayan said that he and the film operator Mr Alvarado wanted to record what is happening .
The issue of Mr Ferrelli arose : &apos; Do you try to record what is happening or find a story that can be used ? &apos;
Such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often painful - will come to the community and try to benefit from it , and its resilience to profit .
The Folayan interview in a recent interview : &apos; We had heard that the vote of the Ferguson born and grown people will not be heard and we wanted to do this differently . &apos;
The Folayan was already hit by his son Damis Davka , the region of the region , who had been sentenced to death sentences for activists who were well known for activists .
Its involvement has made the project more attractive , Ferweapli and still for six other local groups , which the film &quot; Wholean strikes for years after the shooting of Browni shoot for years .
&apos;This documentary does not speak for us or with us , but we are talking about ourselves &apos; said Davis .
&quot; For me , it was important how these people are portrayed , as I am also portrayed . &quot;
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrelli - it was wanted to show that the movement is not the case of &apos; lunatic &apos; , but from the community of the community , as the Folayan - it has been the most open participant in his film .
As a result , &apos; Wholean strikes ? &apos; , surprisingly personal aspects , the life of Ferrelli , as ravaging and their wife marry .
&quot; I felt it was , as I would be alpolited , &apos; said &apos; Ferreira &apos; , the first time on which he was prepared to see the city of the city .
&quot; However , I realised that it must be accompanied by certain vulnerability to the human being of this work and the people who live up to the black people . &quot;
Moreover , the story of Ferrelli emphasises and resets the role of the LGBT group in the wider Black Sea group on Matter movements .
Two of the three initiators of three initiators of the # BlackLivesMatter , after the murder of Hyvon Martini in the social media in 2012 , who thought the # BlackLivesMatter , are homosexual .
&apos;In a leading role &apos; , gay women have maintained the movement in general , &apos; said Ferreira , &apos; and this is precisely because we have to fight on several fronts .
The Roma women have to bear the burden of all the Roma people . &quot;
The Folayan agreed , pointing out that &apos; the movement really lives in a life cycle &apos; , women and many of them are black women . &quot;
He says , however , that &apos; this is not a kind of equality of opportunity &apos; - Ferrelli was not elected as a central point for his identity .
&quot; He was a man , the right energy of the evening , he said .
&quot; However , it is not a coincidence that it is directly at the frontline , because a great deal is at stake when it comes to LGBT women in their homes .
His energy can be perceived as a screen . &quot;
At the same time , the news cameras has long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
During the demonstration in the Ferrelle demonstration , the sentences handed down for blocking the road will run for another 2.5 years .
He describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region , which it calls on home , simply &apos; a huge threat &apos; .
Nevertheless , it still attaches great importance to the mantra which he has used to eat the memory of Mr Fergusoni for three years ago in Fergusoni .
&quot; Our duty is to fight for our freedom .
Our duty is to win .
We have to love each other and support each other .
We have nothing to lose apart from our chains . &quot;
7 nips , following the Weekle du pomelt
Some of the hens will find that there is a shortage of meals , after a scarce rig , that we are suffering from it .
Or in the light of the yelle , there is a shuttle , a pyrap . &quot;
However , it is only inevitable , and the health of health is a good thing .
What can you do to ensure that , after today and tomorrow , the Weekse trend of the Weekse - or other piles - to be felt as painlessly as possible in the morning ?
Joo water .
It is down to the Alpine and , after a great deal this morning , ... or even instead of alcohol .
As there is a great deal of liquids using alcohol consumption , it must be regained in any way .
In combination with water , minerals and stap are also a good haven of mineral water .
Since we are often confronted with a magic bullet , it is particularly good if it is in a flatless or a lightly insert .
To walk .
It would certainly not be a pockle to go to the old pumps - that may be a fatal fallacy .
However , it will be easy to remind the poor time that the feeling is alive .
A sleep and sleeping sleep is a time @-@ consuming for healthier life .
It is gradually slowly and cautiously that it has the power of energy .
If you are going to be on the already mediocre of yesterday , it will certainly not be possible to try to download a great deal of brave fine .
For example , the refreshing volume contained in the presence of the lion &apos;s high @-@ calibre access to a body is based on a high level of silence .
When the health of the South is already suffering , it could try , for example , to foot the baton .
And a little later on .
A coffee .
This diametrium will liberate your body from the rest of the water .
As has already been said : Water and volumes are friends .
There is a lot of painkillers .
If you have a painkiller in order to prevent a pot , then you need to address the wheel in addition to alcohol , or the prophecy , and thus lose the performance .
Both riches and in the future will continue to be a poppy worse .
In addition , there will not be a killer of painkillers in the very long term .
If you get a painkiller this morning , then the road to the plug will be glued up - it irritates the already dirty make .
Or if a partner is not taken , it cannot be well done with itself .
There are some same things as walking , but in footwear it cannot be done .
However , there should be too active pace and a handful of hangs at the time of the pot , the physical effort should be moderate .
A joke .
The story of the friends of the friends of the time , the simple totality and a naera @-@ friendly way of their own , as well as for their suffering .
The Nali and naer may not confuse the pot , but it is certainly a pleasure to endure them .
For once , the poet will go on anyway !
Professor of Lwestern &apos;s professors and the University of Oxford are being sought as suspects to murder murder
According to the police , the University of Northwood Western and the University of Oxford , who have received suspects after death row , are sought by the police , according to the police , and the University of Oxford University , which has become the lifeblood of the death row , is being sought .
According to the case of Cook County , on Monday , an arrest warrant was issued on a succession of 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi , and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni , accused of death by the first instance of his alleged association due to the death of his alleged association due to the death of his alleged association .
According to documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Duranleu died after repeated bullets .
The warning statement that the Chicago police station for the community was detected was discovered on 27 July .
Police officers received phone and found the Grand Plaza corterhouse in the Grand Plaza , who had a victim of several torturers .
According to the case of the Cornell @-@ Duranleu event , the Cornell @-@ Duranleu was admitted to death and investigators , while at the same time the police seek to actively seek two suspects .
They have worked as a co @-@ professors of microbiology and immunology from the University of Northwood in 2007 .
The Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations Alan Koma , Cubbage , said that the statement sent out to Mrs Lake has now been temporarily removed and has been banned from entering the University of Northwood City .
&quot; This is now a criminal investigation carried out by the competent authorities , and the University of Northwester will cooperate with researchers , &quot; said Cubbage .
Mr Warren is the senior assistant of the University of Oxford .
The representative of the University and Somerville College said : &quot; We have been in contact with the British police and the US investigation authorities in every possible way , &quot;
In addition , the statement stated that the Warreni colleagues are shocked and want him to make up .
The President of the Cicago police department , Anthony Guglielm , is urging the authorities to give them a suspicion .
&apos;The police have an idea where they are staying , but we are working more intensively on the definition of the exact location &apos; said Guglielm .
According to the Guglielm , suspects will help the suspects , both local , regional and national authorities .
The Guglielm said that the police received a telephone call from the Grand Plaza Grand Plaza Phouse , who had just had a cryptic rain that there has been something at the apartment .
According to the police descriptions , it was a spectacle .
According to the Guglielm Strait , it is not clear whether the event was also carried out on 27 July .
He said that the cameras to confirm the Lathemi and Warreni stay in the building .
&quot; We believe that Professor Lathamil and the victim were a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
The Grand Plaza administration sent a letter to the people : &quot; The police work at the moment by finding a chronology and victim background to events and examining the different motives , including the possibility that this was a family dispute . &quot;
Companies that help your businesses to avoid receiving the next Ubreath
Amy Errett wanted to measure its e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were lucrative .
The answers were very often vague , useless or even worse .
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; This system simply was not consistent and objective , &quot; said Errett , who will lead to the sale of e @-@ commerce companies operating with 75 employees in San Francisco , who is in charge of the myth in the Te @-@ commerce company .
He therefore called for external parties .
In the wake of the new types of human resources , the start @-@ ups of a new type of human resources which will help businesses to find out what their workers feel .
Developing and licensed software that aims to measure the involvement of workers , allowing them to make an act @-@ of @-@ art poll , to take firm teams and demographic groups , to give workers &apos; anonymity and the monthly line of complaints and , in some cases , to allow manufacturers to bypass the leaders of the C @-@ level and address directly to the Bureau .
&quot; There is now a tool such as Strait and Fitbi , which is designed to monitor health , but where Fitbi is called by Mr Barnet , the co @-@ founder and the executive director Redwood City start @-@ ups , a Glint , whose software analytics use companies to measure the inclusion of workers in the measure of inclusion .
According to Erretti , he has received three years when it has used the Glinti , a much better overview of what its staff think and feel .
In addition to the surveys on the intervention and firm teams , it offers a company &apos;s heat card , which gives an overview of how the departments are the most complaints and the managers of which have the lowest support , allowing it to identify the reasons for the reasons .
Companies have started to understand that they need to be aware of their culture of work , so that not change in the next Ubreath , which has been insurmounted in scandals since the former worker posted a blog , described by the harassed environment in which those who dared to speak should be punished .
For these start @-@ ups , such as Glint , an overview of the desire for a business is an opportunity .
The global governance , regulation and conformity area may be in line with the website of the website of MFAs , in accordance with the website of the website of MFAs , which is worth more than $ 1.7 billion by 2020 .
The degree of opinion of the Sveris Colorado firm , which will help businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , observed this year in the face of a dubious reputation and activity growth in Ubber .
The centil is almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
The Uber registered himself recently .
As Gling , the label allows companies to send a tailor @-@ made impulse , to collect real @-@ time confidential answers and to look at the problems of heat cards in areas of heat cards .
It also offers anonymous messages in a model that allows workers to know the inappropriate behaviour of the workers .
And when it comes to the executive , complaints are going directly to the Bureau .
&quot; Public opinion has been anchored by regulators &quot; said , Mr Patrick Quinlan , the Executive Director , Patrick Quinlan .
Quinlan said that if a company treats its employees ill or inadvertently , the company may face serious consequences , such as the boycott of the consumer , the departure of workers and court cases , even if regulators do not intervene .
The Ruby , restaurant , Picature , which has more than 25 000 workers in 500 places , has used more than a year to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and offer easy way to interact with the headquarters of the Corporation .
If a worker wanted to notify the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or email addressed to the corporation headquarters , and I hope that it will be taken seriously .
It was often a deterrent and inconvenient process , Mr James Vitrano , who said that there was no good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
However , now that the company is used centredly , it is possible to solve problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices which did not lead to the leading leaders in other cities or states , more quickly and to deal with them .
&quot; I will be able to get closer to a holy @-@ to @-@ ss experience of the workers , &quot; said Vitbeo , who is headed by the Ruby @-@ by @-@ by @-@ by @-@ line group of risk management groups .
&quot; And we defend our shareholders for litigation with workers . &quot;
Quinlan has said that companies started to act in ethics , values and the involvement of workers more seriously in 2002 , or after the audit company Arthur Andersen failed in connection with the ethical infringements of the Marroni scandal .
However , only when the social media became mature &apos; , it understood companies that they cannot prevent their breath publicly online .
&quot; Before the use of the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used the hope of a strategy , &quot; said .
Both Glint and the convergence measure offer their software as a service , taking advantage of companies periodically for their use of their products .
This is a business model and an opportunity which has the support of venture capital investors who have been based on both start @-@ ups .
It was censored in February 10 million dollar such companies , such as Sapphire Ventures and the Capital of Customs , thereby raising the value of capital for the value of 47 million dollars .
The Glinti invested USD 10 million in November by Bessemer Venture , by increasing its total funding to USD 60 million .
Such investment will not come as a surprise when it comes to the interdependence of companies , culture and venture capital .
More and more studies show that modern workers are waiting for more than before .
Competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects merely on the table .
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued , and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission .
&quot; If people are happy with the company , they feel that they are heard and that the work they are doing is satisfying , they are more committed to ensuring the success of a company , &quot; said Nina McQueen , who is the general benefit and the Vice @-@ President of the Inter @-@ expert department , LinkedInis , which uses both the so @-@ called cencentric and Glinti .
Investors earn revenue if their companies belonging to their portfolio are doing well ; businesses are doing well when workers are committed and involved .
If the third party analysts are allowed to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , we do not have these support .
The possession of data on the involvement of workers is important , according to the experts &apos; culture of work .
However , these data are useless if the supervisory viewers of the company are not going to do anything .
In fact , if a company asks its employees to receive feedback from its employees , expectations are expected to change .
And if the changes are not taken quickly or not at all , it could cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; If you ask the 4 000 proposals , you must be prepared to convert 4 000 conversations , &apos; the Consultative and Business Management company Kotter International President Russell Raath , who has seen how companies make a mistake to rely too much on data collection .
&quot; Because if things are not to be completed until the end , the workers are wondering : &apos; Do you actually have heard me ?
Do you care ?
And if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
According to Erretti , the Madison Reelis , which is now organising six studies , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem was reported by the Glinti through the Glinter .
And , after the decision @-@ making process and the quality of the communication , it was possible to re @-@ organise several teams in the enterprise and to provide communication training in order to address the problems .
However , in the Ruby @-@ by @-@ by @-@ the @-@ eye , new data will be collected on workers and it is hoped that in the long term it will lead to the longer @-@ term commitment of workers , which is known in terms of its great labour flow .
&quot; If you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose the people , &apos; Mr Kazbeo &apos; said .
&quot; And if you lose your people , you will lose your clients .
And if you lose your clients , you will lose businesses . &quot;
The star of the euro area is the Baltics : An increase in income fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had the effect of the Baltics , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , BSE , referring to the report by the European Central Bank .
According to the ECB , since 1999 , the overall output of the economy per capita is expected , in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
There is a low debt burden , a rapid improvement in the institutions and business @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; The Baltic States , however , are among the countries of the euro area , where the reactor has been significantly approaching the EU average of its GDP per capita , &quot; announced the Central Bank .
While the aim is to ensure that the overall output of the economy per capita is equal to the Western Europe , in 2015 , the overall output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2 / 3 of the average of 15 countries , which included the European Union before the enlargement rounds of 2004 .
Low wages have led to a better pay for foreign countries .
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light , and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic .
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania estimate that their economies are very well or rather well .
In the Czech Republic and Poland , it was slightly less than half of those questioned on their economies .
NCAA decision to lift two times a day to the trend of a return to Bruinsi &apos;s days
At the moment , almost 23 , when a host of UCLA football clubs will be suspended at the edge of a new exercise of a team of university university in the middle of a team .
Some of them have been burdened by a quibble , revealing their first days of work on their treasuries .
For a large proportion of the team , they will be able to make a break @-@ up to the middle day .
The deaf ears are going to take part after a three @-@ hour trend to learn from the trialogues , before returning to the WWman football front in the next morning at 6.30 meetings .
&quot; The next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Bruinsi treer , Jim Mora , before the Monday was on Tuesday .
The NCAA decision to lift the burden on players in order to reduce the burden of players is in fact a day @-@ to @-@ day trend , in fact , for a longer period of time - at least to one half on Friday .
For the first time , the UCLA was launched at 19.15 , in order to fit the already very tight schedule of players &apos; money .
The transition from a doubtful place will mean more than one per cent of the day , the beginning of the Bruinsi camp has been brought forward over a week before the last season , and the first time in Mora &apos;s six @-@ Westwl season is taking place during summer courses .
They are scheduled to take 18 weeks to 20 August , before the formal preparation of the opening @-@ up of the Texas A &amp; M @-@ M @-@ M @-@ M @-@ Max in September .
According to Mr Mora , he is in favour of a change of rules in the NCAA , although it adds another item on the close schedules of players .
&quot; They have huge burdens on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; And they are breaking out of this challenge ; they are making a lot of fine young people .
I believe that if there is a Saturday and we have more time , it will be a real bit . &quot;
If the camp is closed , UCLA will be closed down , which is not , however , a simple task , given the clear view of the fact that the clearest possible parking of their findings and by side Luskini &apos;s centre , a higher class hotels , which has already become a gateway from a protective net from a net shelters .
From this weekend , the Bruinsi players will be occupying hotels , but Mora admitted that there may be problems with free tobacco during the season .
&apos;We take security measures &apos; , said Mora .
&quot; This is a real concern , and it is not exaggerated to believe that people can get a dozen and treasurer filter .
If there is a record of a record , it can do a good deal .
However , we are using a security team there and 8 parking stations .
We are doing our best using the best .
I will try not particularly to worry about this .
We have a plan in place . &quot;
The Association of Election of the Ojuland , the Reform Group , which was launched by the Central Prix of the Climate Party , the designer of the Ojuland , the European Central Bank , is forced to go into the hands of the forces created by Mrs Kaljs , who will be in the hands of the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the European Commission , in Tallinn , which seems to be a party @-@ party in the first place in local elections this year , at least as much as political parties are in the local elections .
However , more buses are considered in the autumn , and the key issue will be whether the voters will be disappointed enough to all of them .
Who remains in Saduarega ?
If a small country has declined from the supporters of the Edgar Saduare , he can anticipate the events organised by his electoral union .
One of the Member States , some of the former and the current middle @-@ party players , and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
And is there any reason why , in Tallinn , some of the seamen are faithful to the guests and wars , can look for the list of &apos; Saduare the &apos; Saduare list &apos; , which is , at the forefront of corruption and suspected corruption , is becoming a reality ?
The Russian @-@ speaking bog of film @-@ driven musicians , which will take part in the town of Researchers in the town of Lapland ; and in every sense the original computer game , which the Prime Minister JÃ¼ri Ratas , has to avoid trying to evade and orchests on the road to the ballot box , is the first time that the voters of the 16th and 17th year old voters who are promised to take part in the ballot box ?
We look forward to the views of the political parties on the youth election campaign .
If the channel 2 or TV3 look at the city of entertainment rather than the beginning of August , two options will remain to be agreed , in the future , only with the ETV , ETV + + , Tallinn TV and English , and to surrender each month &apos;s 10 to some television operators .
There are probably also those who openly rejoice at the beginning of advertising televisions , but at the end of the day - although reluctantly - television and advertisements pay .
The deafening music , lent people and the ribrubbish left in the streets are an unpleasant side of any more musicians .
However , if we do not want to become a man , it is worthwhile to go to the home country , instead of painting pain , and a sleeping for the lung for the Festival .
Washington change the rules of the Green Card
Media publications are quoting President Trumpi , who said that the new US immigration plan , which is going to change the rules of the Green Card .
The plan envisages a reduction of the number of legal immigrants per year by 50 000 people per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary working visas and restrictions on family orientation with visas .
The new rules have been proposed by the republicans and the President .
The draft law is going to be discussed in the two chamber of the Congress .
&quot; This law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars on taxpayers &apos; money , as the way in which the US is issuing green maps to citizens of other countries of the US .
The law reduces migration and will replace the current programme .
The new application process will give the candidates to the candidates who are speaking English and who have financial resources to support their own economies , &quot; said Trump America , according to media publications in the United States .
Siberian youngsters move to the countryside , pensioners back to the land .
The Anatolyev Anatolyev Anatoly continues to be the culminers of the most famous &apos; gold mine &apos; of the River .
He is working on 140 kilometres away from the mother of Maana , as a motorised driver .
This is a tough job : Two months in a row without rest periods , and then only 10 days at home , and again , only 10 days ago .
During the three years of the hotel , Anatols has seen only one time .
&apos;There is a lot of time : There is a thorough checking of the way in which the viral does not lead to it , and that it does not take action , &apos; talks about Anatololi &apos; .
Haida Piho &apos;s satuadles Haida village at the local level Jaga , who has spoken to her family sites in Siberia on his family .
The archaic culture of the Siberian archaic culture will also affect the homes of the home , because it is simply a sham , it believes that the breaders have looked at the Piho Mare in the most distant way .
His first research trip to Siberia will pass this year to 30 years .
During this period , it has travelled to 14 times and has lived there in one year .
How much was the case in Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century in order to get the land here ?
This is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8000 .
I took note of the rumours of Siberian men who have also thought about this .
It is very difficult to say , because at that time there was up to 30 people in one group , but the passport was only a man .
The passport was granted only to one , but it was children , nurses and women .
Look at how much this territory was here !
This was a number of times the historic Setomaist .
After all , it was necessary to manage , in some way .
Setry came here as a farm pot , but their life change , because they were in the areas that were not only in agriculture but also in the river ( paltry ) , gold mines , industry .
For example , a new @-@ Petsert went on a dozen later the city of Krasnoara @-@ 45 ( where the Soviet power was built from uranium enrichment - Mr P. ) , when it was formed .
Was there a majority in the region at the time in the region ?
Yes , they lived in a compacket .
In addition , a long tradition of marry is maintained , and many children .
Seven @-@ eight children were commonplace .
How much of the Siberian culture differed and different from that of the mother tongue ?
They are different , although what was said here was never the same .
They brought about a great deal of money .
They did , too , also ( the shadow ideas ) , but they always made a distinction between what was set and what was done here .
Climate change was severely affected by the traditional rice , because there is a metre of meals here .
The proposed change has changed .
For example , Setomaal meat was the salt of meat , but here it was simply frozen .
Where Siberian villages are located in Siberia and what lives are living there ? / graphic : Alari Palace
The connection with the mother tongue was very strong , it was considered very important .
It seems to me that this Searland will now have to influence them .
These girls , who have lived in the family , have listened to the amazing stories .
The Piho must bear in mind the people of the Estonian delegation who came from Haida at the beginning of July in Haida Seto Kingdom , and lived four days in homes - J. P .
What is only here , it is shocking .
&apos;Tapy is very easy to come and also go down , because the city is an excellent location : The rail hubs and roads at the crossroads &apos; , says Tooperisolololfrom Reigo Tamm .
The city is no longer just a military capital , we have a great deal of hope , sport and culture , and a blind alley at every corner .
Tapa is a tip @-@ up city !
In the light of the ongoing White river , a small island is a small island where the palpable hunts have to be considered .
&quot; This beautiful train window does not seem to be &apos; , buried in Reigo .
Who is not afraid of the cold water , this river will be flooded because the river is full of sources .
I have been floating there , and I will be able to do so !
The water of the river will be able to hold long @-@ term and simply to make romantics - it can look at the flowing of the river and think about life and want .
I have also gone on my own .
The Ooperisolist Tammes , apart from everything else , has been in the way in which the three eyes of the river have been used : &apos; That this place is at the city of the city , no one may come up with the snows &apos; .
&quot; There is a wonderful look at Tapy , but there are also health professionals where there can be a drink , slashing and , for example , there is a golf course , for example , to play a golf course , and a golf course has been done , herechains can be boosted by sport . &quot;
The old professional bodies of course go there , but I do not have yet to play there .
It is probably my colleague , Mr Tapi , to call on the village of Tapale , because he has experienced his experience and he has a chain .
He will lend me to it .
Reigo and MÃ¤nder were inseparable at the time of childhood .
At least during the last few hours .
There has been a lot of tears , fraudsters , and you can live in my sporting life .
Not to mention the shackles and suicides .
&quot; The entire city is full of construction work , all of which will become known as &quot; , &quot; authorises the Reigo .
However , the old and tired building is a very attractive place in which the discoveries are being played .
I am pleased that in 2012 R.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.@@
Although this year &apos;s theatre season &apos; AlekseKarenka &apos; , it has just been carried out on 11 August , on 11 August , the railway station is being moved around in the 1980s .
&apos;The days of 11 @-@ 13 August are Tapa days , in which there has been a glimmer of open house coffee in the building of a stavage , and there are clothes of cultural events , among other things , by the Reigo , which suggests a city to visit the city of 9 @-@ 11 years .
As from 1 May of the Ppersonal troika , the museum has already been in 1994 .
&quot; The house is small , but it is well @-@ known , and there is a huge amount of information , &apos; praises &apos; in Reigo , which is full of history of the town of Tapa , which concentrates on the railways and to war .
Reigo hunting , if you have all proposed stamps , will go on a long distance empty , but fortunately small towns are full of coffee .
&quot; We have both good eating places and cafÃ©s sometimes there is sometimes a feeling that you are going abroad , he describes him .
Well educated and young Tapy soldiers spend a lot of time in pubs , a stap is there when they sit there , that you are in Estonia and in their home town , but there is an international company together .
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans .
There is a lot of wars , yes , there is a lot !
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tendering in Greece
Telekanal TV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who announced that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal brick .
The police arrested on 1 August this morning in Sithharmony on the island of Sithharmony , including two Bulgarians , among whom was also two Bulgarians .
They were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said television TV , the Bulgarian television channel , that Bulgarians could be released later .
The Greek authorities have increased free tendering restrictions and are already imposing severe fines on all those who are caught in a separate location which is not foreseen for this purpose .
The controls will continue throughout the season .
According to the Ministry , the Court may appoint a fine .
Young people teach the wolves of the sheep .
On the Hiiuland farmers , too , we have to give the junta back to the junta once again , the &apos; curriculum &apos; of his herds - probably cumbersome teaches wolves , already burnt down a lot of sheep .
This year , the wolves in the Hiiu countryside have broken the sheep of three times , with 23 sheep and wounded , eight , Hiiu leaf .
The soil was the figure that was just three years , 124 .
There is also an environmental Agency &apos;s data in the synchronisation of Murdonia , so that the soil of the last Hiiuland was not born and Hiiuland &apos;s information in order that this year , there are two wolla washing machines on the island .
The ÃÃ¶l has broken the wolves to Emulag Kolves in village of 15 lamps and injured half of 18 survivors .
The matridays of the thieves wiped out on the village of Requbacks in the village of Reparbacks and wounded by one of you , who had to be made an emergency .
The rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and the draft amending law on plant protection law .
The amendment to the law will give rise to the creation of a separate data collection for the crops of GM ( GM ) as well as for operators in the future , using a plant health register .
Furthermore , the obligation of GM crops to have a prior agreement on the appropriateness of the radio apiculture concerned will be amended .
Although there is currently no cultivation of GM crops in Estonia , we need clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
This is at least as long as it is not up to the Estonian GMO to declare the country , Mr Sigmar Suu Kyi , the Chairman of the World Health Department , Mr Sigmar Suu Kyi .
&quot; At the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , to take advantage of costs and administrative burdens on both private and public sectors , in the annex .
The draft law repeals the data collection and treatment of GM crops and operators in the field of GM crops , establishes the provisions on the handling of GM crops and the requirements for starting economic activities .
In relation to the specific apiculture , as regards the cultivation of GM crops , the current obligation to inform beekeepers of the cultivation of GM crops with the obligation to achieve an appropriate agreement on the cultivation of beekeepers prior to the introduction of an agreement with the beekeeper .
The draft law has been sent to ministries in coordination .
All interested parties will be able to examine the draft content in the information system , and if they wish to present their views on the World Health Ministry .
The proposed changes will affect persons in particular in the area of plant farming , beekeepers and agricultural authorities .
In the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 810 .
However , no Estonian farmer has been able to increase the cultivation of GM crops .
The reason is that in Estonia there are no magic wounds , a European vocation of a European chemisline , which is a magic tree of mon 810 resistant .
It is also a line that has been swept to the south of the south and it is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
In order to obtain certainty , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned research in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible GM organisms in Estonia , the seeds of maize and soya varieties in Estonia , maize and soya .
The results of the samples tested showed that seeds were not included in the host and concluded that the seeds , maize and soya varieties in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms .
It may , in turn , be concluded that in Estonia , there is no deliberate cultivation of GM crops , and it was also confirmed that there has been no accident .
Mr Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United coloured Temja Maticu in the form of &apos; genetic genius &apos;
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United America has been recruited in the form of Nemja Maticu , after the central player in the middle of a debate on Wednesday evening .
For the GBP 40 million @-@ spent player in Dublin , the last wave of seasonal pre @-@ operation in the Unites was in Dublin , prior to the UEFA Super Ccui line in Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 , with the impression of a defence role , while Paul Pogba and Mr Pereira received freely to attack on the offensive crusade .
However , while remaining aside from the Blueprint for seasonal Asia , the Maticu was badly needed to bury and it was only 45 minutes , and it has to be seen by 45 minutes , according to Mourinho , to improve the start of the front season .
&quot; He needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genime thinking - he has football &apos;s mouths , &quot; said Mourinho .
&quot; We are helping to achieve the form as soon as possible . &quot;
As in the past , the Aviva stadium also started other new coloured Victor Lindelof and Romlu Lukaku , and Mourinho began to put in place a thorny man in the beginning of the season .
The Independent public week that the Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers , but he confirmed that the club has already done a &apos; excellent job &apos; by concluding agreements with three priority areas of priority .
&quot; I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three four in the Annex . &quot;
&quot; I am more happy if they are able to make four four , but they have worked hard to me . &quot;
Yet another warm son received a GSM website on 1 August and this time in Mesus .
Mr Martinson , who is living in Sfragile , has received the first tranche to accompany Sfragile , and this washing wall is already burnt down , has left and joined by the Grand nights of Multi @-@ Grand Brake .
This is because Sfragile do not have the fruit of crops , the voice of the island writes .
At the time of this Tuesday , it is still relatively late , and it has been sent to another son , and the island of Mesu on the island .
The Martinson said , in fact , the installation of the embassies is an international project that bovine Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojans .
Mr Mullu was provided one of the son &apos;s son called Mati to Mrs Sdelicate in Sdelicate ves TÃ¼rzl .

British inventors to install a microchip in their own body in order to access their homes and cars
The British inventor became the first man in a country to install microchip so that he can only open its way to the office and even launch a car .
33 @-@ year @-@ old , Steven Northwest Children , is a tiny chip between their fins and the navel , and will now provide the service with the bioq of its company , and to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier .
It has joined forces in the Royal hospital of St Winchy Handes , the Royal hospital in Hante , Dr Geoff Watson , so as to ensure that the procedure complies with medical standards for medical standards .
The technology is similar to the microchips that are in place and the microchips that are being instaged and should be taken over just 30 seconds .
The Northwest company will also prevent the houses of houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the praise , by asking for a lump sum of GBP 300 .
This is a child &apos;s father of a child who has been running through technology now and in its own car , BMW Z4 , which is going to start when he has a hand in the wheel .
The White House has cost taxpayers a thousand
According to the open military documents announced by the letter of the press , the White House decision to fly the sea helicopter in the event of a ceremony in the south of the world last month to the end of American production would have to pay USD 24 000 .
The green and white colours Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , which is called the President of the President , Mrs One &apos;dam , was a central feature of the event that took place on 17 July in Valmas on 17 July .
President Donald Trump , Vice @-@ President Mike Pence and the White House were informed by the higher officials in the field of industrial products from all 50 states .
Scticutis was built on a snapshot of the image of the winning city , Wisconhadi , a fire @-@ fighting car and a Mistral turn , in Scticutis .
The Helicopter Squadris , the Jelicopter Squadris , responsible for the operation of the Helicopter Squadris one ( HMX @-@ 1 ) , in accordance with the documents , called the White House for a military cabinet , a handful of the presence of FARGO @-@ FARGO @-@ FARGO , a tiny 36 hours before the Helicopter &apos; event &apos; .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because this is an unusually high level of attention , &quot; said HMX @-@ 1 komcomÃ¶r , a day before the event , in the field of the sea , the chief officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
The message was noted that helicopter arrives at the southern height of 17 July this morning at 15 o &apos;clock , and remains to be held up to the end of the evening and 21 .
The fact that , if the departure of the Vomest from Majest leave is to be , there is a need for second @-@ time paperes due to the restrictions on working time .
The original flight crew were at a helicopter at a time and the escillary security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its long term .
The documents provided by the letter of the time have not been possible to read whether you were at the end of the second time in the past , or not .
The Hatch law prohibits the use of federal workers for political purposes for political purposes .
The documents show that HMX @-@ 1 examined whether this event can violate this provision .
&quot; We wonder whether this is a breach of the Hatch law , and we were told that there is no rice , &apos; written commander .
&apos;It seems that you have no choice &apos; , &apos; responded by a leading officer &apos; .
The White House announced the &apos; official event &apos; in America and the Hatch law would not have been covered by the Hatch .
However , even in the official events , there are political undertones .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Senate had supported the efforts of health reform in the Senate at the time and approved efforts to prevent government regulations .
The use of the aircraft known as &apos; Marine One or Air Force &apos; is not a new phenomenon for a politically profitable purpose .
Presidents must use them to travel .
However , the requirement to use these purely photographs is unusual .
In February , it would be brought to mind when the President of his first campaign in Florale Melbourne Melbourne , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the President , and he from Twitter to account from the messages that complain about how his predecessor , the President of his predecessor , used his or her predecessor .
&quot; The White Mal is very pleased to put forward &apos; in America , where products were represented in all 50 states , which have been prepared by American American American American workers &apos; , &quot; said White House spokesman for his duty and Lindsay Walters .
HMX @-@ 1 teams are often in the vicinity of Washington and the southern horses in order to get the US President of the United States with the White House of a centimetry with a centimetry .
When Trump July at the G20 Summit in Germany , the HMX @-@ 1 White House was organised by the HMX @-@ 1 White House .
According to business , the flight was considered to be the norm for the flight to be made in America by the flight crew in America .
At the time , the Eskaadr helicopters , in addition to 11 hours of the &apos; President @-@ in @-@ support mission &apos; , were not yet another .
The White House , according to the White House , has not been burdened by any other attempt at the taxpayer &apos;s pockets of the taxpayer .
According to Sikorsky , the company &apos;s helicopter was not involved in organising the seamless effort of the South .
HMX @-@ 1 does not maintain the budgetary documents of the President &apos;s flights and the precise costs of the event are difficult to find out .
However , at the time of the Ministry of Defence in 2017 , there is an amount of EUR 24 380 per hour on the basis of compensation for the AH @-@ 3D .
The Eskaadr &apos;s documents were mentioned by Quantico on the flight from Quantico to Virginia , both on the main basis of the flight , to Virginia .
The White House claims that the actual cost of using helicopter is very much below the amount .
The calculation of taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading , &quot; said Walters .
&quot; These estimates include a number of other irreversible costs for the staff , maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account in the annual appropriations . &quot;
According to the 2015 @-@ 2015 survey , compensatory salaries in the Ministry of Defence do not include compensatory costs for personnel costs , but they cover costs related to fuel , care and contracts .
The former spokesperson of the White House Sean Spicer defended the use of helicopter at the time .
&quot; The point is to show the things in America this week , &quot; said Spicer .
&quot; And I know that the State of Sikorsky and Connecticuti is very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security and that there are already hundreds of hundreds if not even thousands of people whose work depends on this .
And I believe that just like the majority of the Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .
So , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
It is not clear whether Trump cages in the south of the South will be able to circulate together with a helicopter or not , but the fire brigade was a father behind him .
In the White House , Trump Sikorsky was approached by Trump Sikorsky , on the media &apos;s media to make a joke of products in his personal aircraft .
&quot; I feel SikorskÃ¡ very well , &quot; said President , &quot; I have three products . &quot;
Gri Å adeiko - plumbers of peace and joy
In the last area of the MMil Daete , the MMil Daete , 800 800 beverages and stadiums were transferred to a stadium .
Immediately before it was , it has been able to go back to zero in China from scratch .
The intellectual property of the 2012 Helsinki formula , the injuries obtained , but in London during the debate in London , he received 60 to 13 points of 23 seats .
However , I still have failed .
After 2013 , Moscow &apos;s MMil became an antagonist for a long @-@ term disability in the wake of the Estonian Reference Day .
Two years later , he received the Beijing Mil 15 places and met the Olympic spirit , but that was the disappointment of the Olympic Games .
The wound stick was only passed by the image of Å adeiko , if it was not the case at the beginning of Amsterdam the Embassy .
I would just like to put one place or one of the things in place once again .
One time , sprayed Å adeiko .
Worse still , a month later in the Olympic contest , in Rios reievigasy , has already been a first barrier due to his Olympic contest .
The time needed to be taken - is the seven @-@ year competition to continue ?
Is the two days &apos; time all this worth ?
We had a long thought , but it was a peace of peace .
I have got to think about it .
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
Fortunately , it was time for himself to be treated and thought to be treated .
&quot; I knew that I am still not putting the picg on the table , talking about his self @-@ net from his self @-@ net .
I received a clean one from a clean front and to go ahead with the new momentum .
Mrs Anne Nagk said that it was negligent to look at the suffering , but it has realised that , in particular , sportsman itself has to find itself out of itself .
After all , he was so dressed by all .
It was difficult to tolerate .
&apos;Gi , however , he said he does not sign and he wants to prove what it is worth &apos; , says mountain .
There is now some kind of peace .
He is doing so to my joy .
The contest came back in May when the Sadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Sadeiko CÃ¶tzitself .
In a high @-@ level competition , she was able to have a personal marry at the height of the moon ( 13.89 ) and drink a record of the hurricane hurricane .
Then there was a patchwork of competition , so that it is not at all the capacity , but was removed from the first starvation of competition .
For many years , I say that the words of the Sadeiko are a student .
He is ready to be sportsman , she is a good training .
If something is wrong or is wrong , he will say it immediately .
He feels his own father and trusted its feeling .
That is what we must do .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we follow it .
The new approach has also been found in Å adeiko .
&quot; I am not one who is going to make the most of the trend , he speaks and say that the most important thing is the right to take care , because it also guarantees a good result .
I will be happy with the baby &apos;s baby .
There has also been good emotion for the Sadeikoman , as well .
Her former composite , Mari hill and Grete , recently received the parents &apos; grandparents and have received a lot of support from new weather citizens .
&apos;It is quite interesting &apos; , words to Å adeiko .
One alcohol , which is equivalent to the &apos; training &apos; of the brain , is one alcohol .
The Livesty writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is a father , so high wine , so that it believes that it can be trained better than any other thing in the world .
The Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale .
His message is not a matter of alcohol or how it affects our feelings and ideas , but instead of &apos; very active &apos; wine &apos; in the process of flavours .
By persuading wine , the beating of wine in a complex , enjoyment and ex @-@ post perception we are putting our own work in order to create a taste for wine .
According to the Sheperdi , there is not really a taste , but a taste in the way in which wine is stimulated .
He will bring about the way in which the brain is &apos; colours &apos; .
&apos;The taste in the wine is not a taste for wine , the taste of the wine &apos; , says Sheperd .
Things that are still affecting the taste of wine are , for example , our vanity , gender and even sylje , which man produces .
Of course , the wine is not , of course , that wine is not full .
&quot; There must be more &apos; activities &apos; , he says .
If you are too long , the system has been overcrowded .
The excessive drinking of wine can , at times , cause damage to the brain - according to the 2004 survey , people who drink over three sets of wine , memory loss , loss of balance and a reduced mental power .
10 % of the ICT sector in Estonia receives fewer salaries from colleagues
The Personalized company Fontes data reveals that 10 % of the ICT sector in Estonia receives less salaries from colleagues .
The pay gap between men and women , the portal , Geenius .
The Fund in the ICT sector took part in 59 IT and telecommunications companies .
A total of 8 577 posts were examined .
63 % of posts were male .
&quot; Although only 3 companies have made the difference between men and the rest of the companies , the pay gap is missing , in reality compared to the average salary for men per month , on average 10 % higher than women per month and an average of 8 % higher than men in the year , said Foncrates Ilmar Nordic .
The clip of the &quot; Narcococose &quot; season : Now that Pablo Escobar has gone , Netflix hittsark , Cali kartel
Despite the fact that &apos; Narcose &apos; revealed the second season of Pablo Escobari and is far from the Netflix sar from the Netflix .
The third and fourth season has received assurances from the stream , and the first of them has already been the clip of advertising , which hails the sardines and new pathogens .
The third season pays his attention to the world &apos;s richest drug organisation - Cali cartels .
They are acting in four powerful risking lines , as Ford , the 500 companies , just more bribery to government and violent factors .
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejeela ( Damian Alcazar ) is a cartel head of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejeela ( Francisco Denis ) , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) , led to Mexico and Chepe SantaH z London ( Pepe Rapazote ) , in New York .
Mr VÃ¤rskin saw the return of Mr Pascali , Javier Pencali , as a person who recruited the legal aid of the American and Colombian legal aid in war against drugs .
Other indicators include Matias Varela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .
The third season of &quot; Narcose &quot; will be open on 1 September .
According to the United Nations , the role of Afghan democracy in politics
The head of the UN Afghanistan mission , on Wednesday , said that the elections will only be able to represent the people if all members of society , including women , play their role .
The UN Assistance Mission , Nicholas Haysom , said that hundreds of women are standing in local Soviet elections , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % recently registered by women .
&quot; The role of women in underlining the importance of women cannot be exaggerated , &quot; said on Wednesday .
The elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
The local council elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
The Taliban have been threatened by the electoral process , which coincides with a transitional period when the role of international military operations is becoming advisable .
This year &apos;s elections will mark the first time that power is made calmly by the democratically elected government over the next .
According to the Haysmal , women play an increasing role in democracy in Afghanistan .
According to the Afghan independent electoral Commission , 1.2 million women have registered with 1.2 million registered voters .
It is a pleasure to make every difference to the big and small .
The common time has always been too little , but it is a good opportunity to combine meetings , a game , proximity and the burden .
And what convenient solution - wherever you were stupid in the summer , live life is always accompanied by , and reminds us of the very fine words of the eye : &apos; We are now making a trend ! &apos;
Alife insulation - very good is a very good gold game , or the sinking of the coastlines .
Is it a foundation of permanent and routinely permanent standing - who , in the summer , would like to take the form of sleeping sand in the summer ?
It is nice to use children instead of being used .
Firstly , it is a secure and convenient , rash , growing at the same pace as training and force .
There is also a great deal to do with big children .
The child is ascertaining a balance , it is clear that things are repeated and it is up to the chance to get a high level of attention and be important .
More children can do the same at the same time .
The scale of movement is set up in the area of land , and you are rushing .
The fingers right , you are asking a mini @-@ stick properly to keep them properly .
The child can read the flats and feel as a treasurer .
The Plank is very high , but an ever @-@ free exercise for the child is hopelessly .
However , it is easy to make things easier .
The game of plank : Take a long plank for a long plank , which will be eradicated .
In fact , it is more difficult , but much more indulgent to do if , in the meantime , you can give your hands to a friend .
In order to add burdens , we can stay at the plants , tears , and it is also going to go around .
In addition , the puzzling of a child may be placed on the puzzling of a child , but this exercise offers an end to all children .
At the same time , if the tap is sand , the triumph , ash and air muscles like contagious .
The child comes into the shoes so that his body is distributed equally and wants to do so .
The market will be able to keep the game .
The shoes and stubbornly get straight away .
I will be able to fly , to have a balance , to strike a balance , and to be the ones .
The lives of a small engineer will be trapped when it is possible to have a small minority in every way .
The additional burden will provide shoes in advance .
In order to keep a blind eye on a neutral location .
Children themselves have a lot of futile to do a scam and a plate .
There is a job and a batch on the batons .
Follow the child &apos;s safety , the proposition , and the horror in a neutral position .
All children &apos;s favourite and great salvation !
At the same time , the age of age is truly effective as a whole .
Sportic instruments were Our ( 10 ) , SÃ¤ves ( 8 ) , happiness ( 4 ) .
In the Philippines a wide @-@ ranging trip to a moefics of a wider world , a civil servant in the Philippines
In the light of red bags , the summer classroom , which has become an end in the last few years , which is one of the right brokers in the last few years , and which has been able to have the trail of a mockery , despite its modest origin , has been able to extract the price of an appropriate price .
There is probably one of the things that have been red @-@ red , which is one of the things that have existed in one order and that has not been given any special emotion .
It is simply there , and if there is no overlap .
However , there is now a real victory for beer and a moefics have switched to their mushrooms from the summer months instead of simple beer bags against plastic carrier bags .
It is not just a coastline , but today it is just as popular as it is today , and the courageous women do not even walk into the office .
However , at this point , it is worth making clear whether or not this summer &apos;s summer of summer is going to be held or a martyr , however , and , however , a little more official to be rejected .
However , the wealth of rife has made the love of women &apos;s real summer love .
For example , when it comes to foreign motives , the first thing is that the moughurs are saying that they are going to be the first thing in the first place on the local market , and acquiring a couple of beaches to which the whole range of holiday time is , and which is accompanied by rigour , on the market and also as a friend to the city .
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy the market from the market and sell them to their loyal readers .
It is worth pointing out that there is a high level of demand among the savers for the readers in the world , so that women in the world are going to be involved in the world ( and men ! ) , apparently , to be involved in each other &apos;s fish .
In some ways , such madness is also understandable , because it is rare for them to be repeated when the motto is going to be able to buy just a few of the ten euros for a few decades .
It is true that the loudest traders have also discovered a simple use of money , and so sell the brunt of luxury brands , and also for a few hundred years ago .
Obviously , that the richer customers should not feel as easy to feel , who will be protaging around the protags of low @-@ cost homes .
For example , it is possible to buy Dolce &amp; Gabbana , for example , over EUR 1 000 .
However , the interpretation of the interpretation of Chanel could be carried out in the circulation of 6 000 euros .
In contrast to most of the motives , there are no queries from some of the big fashions , but their story started in a far more distant way .
In particular , the beer is allegedly coming from the Philippines , where they have not been subjected to a wide range of them .
The lottery has been stunned there , in particular , in the case of export trade , and there is very often no room for the local people .
It is alleged that the 14th century has been said , and it is quite a horrendous bundle of normal corps .
However , as there is not such a strong red force as a basket , they can be subjected to musicians and other materials that are made more personalised and also more active .
For example , in recent times , there are very many chambers of colours where red coloured coloured paints or carcasses .
In particular , the jargon , however , can be sent to the beer , in particular , to send an actor in Jane Birkini , the largest red beer pocket before it was foreseen .
It was compatible with the beer of all the wearing apparatus , and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival .
However , it does not play a smaller role in the popularity of the Jews , but also that caring for them is a keystone and , unlike all the others , it is not up to these special instruments to care , but also the water and martyr .
As in the case of the trendy gauge , there are all sorts of interpretations that have come out of a classic appearance .
For example , there is a desire to purchase red lines for beer , or rather a tiny sleep , for example .
At the same time , it is worth remembering that the classic slurry will never be a mockle , but it is a mockery .
But what is classic beer ?
For centuries , there has been a classic ban on beer bags , which resembles a repetition of its style , is open and short , and it is short , as well as beer .

GMB is worried about investment in the McVitie plant in McVitie .
The trade union is awaiting confirmation from the leaders of the long @-@ term production plans in the Glasgow plant in Glasgow .
According to the Scotland of GMB , the company has remained silent on the future of this investment .
In the case of Hobnobsi and rich @-@ minded people , and other products are working more than 500 people .
The company McVitie , Mr Pladi , said that they have invested more than GBP 5 million over the last few years .
The workers and the union chairmen of the trade union are the first to hear , if something is changing in the activities of the plant .
In a letter sent to the company &apos;s site , GMB Scotland gave the McVitie company McVitie to the request that the funding is not used to modernise the production routes . &quot;
The GMB parental organiser Drew Duffy , said : &apos; The fact that we cannot provide clarity with the main head of the label on the business needs and the future investment plan for the future , is deeply concerned by our members .
There have been several generations of families here , and the workforce is largely made up of local community and the people around Glasgow , as an essential pillar in order to ensure decent employment in the region where high unemployment is high and social weather .
In view of the jobs , salaries and welfare of the Glasgow , and in the light of the chronic damage to production , a growing company in McVitie and the chronic damage to production are urgently needed in the context of the Glasgow . &quot;
The Pladesign representative said : &apos; The head of the Customs Council was a letter from GMB Scotch only yesterday and the company meets him directly because we value an active relationship with workers and trade union representatives .
Two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers and the representatives of the GMB , which discussed an open range of problems in an open way .
We discussed the workers , like all the companies in the extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we look at our activities at a time - and this applies to all our companies and objects - to ensure its competitiveness .
He added : &apos; In recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million in customs and more than GBP 5 million , most of it has gone into production routes and improvements .
We fully understand that at the time when it comes to the heritage of the production site and where there should be any changes in the activities of the object , workers and trade union representatives are the first to hear it . &quot;
Did the PSG alert Barcelona three years ago for convergence ?
With the Marco Verratti , the la can regret its interest in Marco Verratti
The Paris Saint @-@ Germain does not bring in the attempt to attract Mr mar in his ranks by making an offer of GBP 189 million , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquered rette ?
This sound approach has opened the summer &apos;s transition , and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break down more than double the current world record , which was set up at the last season by Paul Pogba returning to the Manchester Uniteba @-@ 89 million .
If the transition is completed , Mrs Neymarra will be able to become the most expensive player in the world and , at the same time , the highest paid professional sportsman in the world , who will be able to pay over GBP 500 000 a week after the payment of the PSG .
Barcelona is , of course , a reference to the way in which it is considered , and also because of the liberation of Mrs Neyra , although a source close to the chair of Catalansi confirms that the club is in football for the whole of his Santotus in 2013 .
But has the PSG warned a football world for this opportunity three years ago ?
When a Manchester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blaise Matuc Treaty in 2014 , the Nasser Al @-@ Khelgarf warned all those who are thinking about the best players in the number of PSG .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that if they concern some of our players , we will be against them and take contact with those players , &quot; said Al @-@ Khell .
&quot; We respect all clubs .
However , if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they must face the consequences . &quot;
The Barcelona seems to have taken this limit , as Spain has seen the interest of the PSG central player in the previous summer in Verratti .
The PSG has made it clear that they will not be allowed to leave and that the Barcelona can become a setback as a result of this interest , by abolishing Mrs marry as one of its expensive assets .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Brexitit .
&quot; Brexe is seriously threatened by the beauty of the Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , a &apos; warned Varader first visit to Northern Ireland after his entry into office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , he added .
Cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the free movement of people and goods , said Varadyr .
&quot; This is our vision for the future : To build bridges , not borders , it emphasised .
He said that he would prefer Britain to be part of the European Union , and because it cannot be seen as a part of the European common market .
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
The second option to make the withdrawal of Britain more smoother would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , the Irish Prime Minister .
Noting that such an agreement was in existence with Turkey , the Varadyr said &apos; certainly we could have such Britain &apos; .
The alternative to this would be to return to the customs points that would be a historic division and a political failure .
&quot; Raise your trade , prosperity and peace , &quot; said Irish Prime Minister .
He mentioned Brexitit &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that it could affect every aspect of the daily lives of Northern Ireland .
The Irish Prime Minister met Belfast visiting the leaders of the main parties of Northern Ireland .
