four members of the K@@ eme@@ ro@@ vo group arrested in Estonia and Spain
according to Pos@@ time@@ es , police in Spain have arrested S@@ lava Gu@@ levi@@ ch , the head of the so @-@ called K@@ eme@@ ro@@ vo group operating in the Estonian under@@ world , known in the criminal world by the name of S@@ lava K@@ eme@@ ro@@ v@@ sky .
a court had issued for the arrest of Gu@@ levi@@ ch in Spain .
yesterday the court also ordered that three suspects detained in Estonia be held .
according to the complaint , they are members of the so @-@ called K@@ eme@@ ro@@ vo criminal Organization ranging in age from 27 to 57 and committing primarily drug @-@ related crimes .
in the Mi@@ jas province of M@@ alaga in Spain , the alleged b@@ os@@ s of a criminal Organization was detained .
three men were detained as suspects in Estonia ; according to the gathered evidence , one of them is a leading figure of a criminal Organization and two of them are members of a criminal Organization .
the gathered information points to a clear division of roles and functions in the criminal Organization .
the objective of the criminal organiz@@ ations activity was to commit to drug crimes , and thereby earn criminal gains , <<unk>> commented the head of pre@@ trial proceedings in the criminal case , public Prosecutor Va@@ hur Ver@@ te .
<<unk>> We can &apos;t rule out that the number of suspects in this criminal case will increase . <<unk>>
these are people who have been in the sphere of interest for law @-@ enforcement agencies in the past and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Ver@@ te empha@@ sized that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has played an important part throughout the investigation .
<<unk>> International cooperation has become the standard for us and this week &apos;s operation shows success of the cooperation , <<unk>> commented Prosecutor Ver@@ te .
head of the central criminal police division ago Le@@ is said that the arrests were preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted almost a year a half .
<<unk>> The long @-@ running work came to fru@@ ition in the first half the week and we made simultaneous arrests of the suspects in these crimes in Estonia and Spain , <<unk>> he said .
Le@@ is added that central criminal police officials assisted in the Spanish arrests .
for years now , we have had good contacts and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil guard forces .
these arrests send yet another message to criminals that and we will get them from the other end of Europe , <<unk>> said Le@@ is .
the information gathered to this point shows unequivocally that if they remained at liberty , the men named in the complaint could continue committing new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office sought their arrests and the court approved it as well .
a man arrested in Spain now faces extradition to Estonia .
in the framework of this criminal case , real estate , vehicles and cash were im@@ p@@ ounded to secure the confiscation .
the pre@@ trial proceedings in the criminal case are being conducted by the criminal police &apos;s organiz@@ ed crime office and headed by the public Prosecutor &apos;s office .
in 2005 , Tallinn City Court convicted S@@ lava Gu@@ levi@@ ch of ex@@ tor@@ tion and sentenced him to five years in prison .
in the middle of last decade , he was considered to ran@@ k second in the Estonian criminal world after the under@@ world leader Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Gu@@ levi@@ ch , who is from K@@ eme@@ ro@@ vo , became prominent in the Estonian under@@ world in the early 1990s when he became involved in ex@@ tor@@ tion in Tallinn .
he allegedly put the squ@@ ee@@ ze on tax@@ i drivers and prostitu@@ tes operating at different ho@@ tels , and demanded monthly pay off from business@@ men .
joint international operations , confiscation of criminal gains , and court decisions handed down all confirmed that the fight against organiz@@ ed crime is effective .
for example the latest court decisions , the eight accused to be tried separately from the so @-@ called D@@ ika@@ je@@ v crime Organization criminal case , from whom 8@@ 0,000 euros was confis@@ cated , or the court decision with regard to nine persons accus@@ ing Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v of establishing in 2006 a crime Organization engaged in illegal trade in contra@@ band cigarettes and commission of crimes related to human smuggling in Ida @-@ Vir@@ u Coun@@ ty and southern Estonia .
the amount of criminal gains confis@@ cated in that case was close to 7@@ 1,@@ 500 euros .
what has ensured success in these criminal cases is the fact that police offices exchange information each day with their colleagues and prosecutors exchange evidence , and if necessary they conduct operations jointly in any other European Union member state .
civil rights group issues travel warning for Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i
the National Association for the advancement of C@@ olo@@ red People has put out an alert for people of col@@ or travel@@ ing to Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i because of the state &apos;s discriminatory policies and racist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ ACP Tra@@ vel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , effective through August 28@@ th , 2017 , calls for African American tra@@ ve@@ lers , visitors and Mis@@ sou@@ ri@@ ans to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when travel@@ ing throughout the state given the series of questionable , race @-@ based incidents occurring state@@ wide recently , and noted there@@ in , &quot; the group &apos;s statement reads .
a recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law making it harder for people to win discrimination law@@ suits , as well as the state &apos;s law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert , the NA@@ ACP said .
&quot; you have violations of civil rights that are happening to people .
they &apos;@@ re being pul@@ led over because of their sk@@ in col@@ or , they &apos;@@ re being beaten up or killed , &quot; the president of the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i NA@@ ACP , R@@ od Cha@@ pel , told The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&quot; we are hearing complaints at a rate we ha@@ ven &apos;t heard before . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the Organization has issued for a state in the US .
the group cited incidents such as racial sl@@ urs against black students at the University of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i and the death of tory S@@ and@@ ers , 28 , a black man from T@@ en@@ nes@@ see .
S@@ and@@ ers died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while travel@@ ing through the state , and was taken into custody by Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the advisory also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i At@@ tor@@ ne@@ y General &apos;s Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pul@@ led over than wh@@ ites .
&quot; the advisory is for people to be aware , and warn their families and friends and co @-@ workers of what could happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , &quot; Cha@@ pel said .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it &apos;s bringing bail money with them , or letting relatives know they are travel@@ ing through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ B@@ I &apos;s hate crime reporting pro@@ gram , ranking the state at 16@@ th in the country in terms of the number of such violations .
the travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a business for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel advis@@ or@@ ies for T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to de@@ tain people on immigration violations which the AC@@ L@@ U said would increase racial profiling .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but la@@ tely , advo@@ c@@ acy groups have resor@@ ted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what should everyone know about the different forms of this serious disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis <<unk>> inf@@ lam@@ mation of the li@@ ver <<unk>> may be caused by any of five he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses <<unk>> A , B , C , D and E .
all of these vir@@ uses cause acute inf@@ lam@@ mation of li@@ ver t@@ issue .
chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B and C have a mal@@ ign@@ ant profile , which can progress to cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis and li@@ ver cancer .
health Board epidemi@@ ology advis@@ or Ku@@ ul@@ o Ku@@ tsa@@ r says that the symptoms of acute he@@ pati@@ tis are the same for all types of li@@ ver inf@@ lam@@ mation <<unk>> f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ gue , loss of appe@@ tite , na@@ use@@ a , v@@ om@@ iting , ab@@ domin@@ al pain , gre@@ y@@ ish st@@ ool@@ s , dark ur@@ ine , mus@@ cle and joint pain and y@@ el@@ low@@ ness of sk@@ in and mu@@ c@@ ous me@@ mb@@ ran@@ es .
the latter condition is the origin of the popular name for he@@ pati@@ tis in Estonian , kol@@ la@@ <<unk>> or y@@ el@@ low disease .
in children , he@@ pati@@ tis can progress without symptoms .
the various types of he@@ pati@@ tis can be diagno@@ sed only through laboratory testing .
but he@@ pati@@ tis can change over to the chronic form of the disease and have a course of decades without symptoms , which means that people may not necessarily be aware that they have a dangerous disease that damages the li@@ ver .
Ku@@ tsa@@ r notes the different forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their course in detail .
He@@ pati@@ tis A vir@@ uses spread from a sick person and infec@@ t us through eating of contaminated food or drinking of water , during sex , contact between hands and fa@@ ec@@ es from infected people and from hands to food , sur@@ faces , objects , through contact with the mouth , and drug use .
among the risk group for he@@ pati@@ tis A infection are family members and ca@@ regi@@ vers , people with chronic li@@ ver diseases , sex partners of infected people , men who have sex with men , drug ab@@ users , and travellers to countries with a high incidence of he@@ pati@@ tis A .
infection can be prevented through vaccination . above all , vaccination is recommended for people who travel often and people in the he@@ pati@@ tis A risk group .
in addition , following everyday good hygiene is important : was@@ hing or dis@@ infec@@ ting hands , was@@ hing all fru@@ its and vegetable before use as food .
He@@ pati@@ tis B vir@@ uses spread through contact with the blood from a sick person , drug injec@@ ting , ta@@ t@@ too@@ ing , pi@@ er@@ cing , use of everyday items contaminated with blood ( too@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ hes , sha@@ ving ac@@ cess@@ or@@ ies ) , donor blood , sex with a person suspected of having he@@ pati@@ tis , and from mother infected with he@@ pati@@ tis to a fo@@ etus / new@@ born .
among the risk group for he@@ pati@@ tis B infection are drug ab@@ users , sex partners of infected persons , men who have sex with men , infected mother to a new@@ born , family members and ca@@ regi@@ vers of the sick , healthcare , rescue and police workers exposed to blood and other bo@@ d@@ ily flu@@ ids and travellers visiting countries with high incidence of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
prevention of he@@ pati@@ tis B is possible by vacc@@ in@@ ating people ; vaccination is also recommended for people in risk groups , along with people with chronic li@@ ver diseases , and people with HIV , ST@@ D@@ s and diabe@@ tes .
other ways of preventing he@@ pati@@ tis B are : ref@@ ra@@ ining from sharing personal hygiene and man@@ ic@@ ure ac@@ cess@@ or@@ ies , other objects with bla@@ des and sy@@ ring@@ es and need@@ les , ref@@ ra@@ ining from ta@@ t@@ too@@ ing and pi@@ er@@ cing , and using a con@@ dom during sex with the risk of infection or sexual ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence .
in Estonia , he@@ pati@@ tis B vacc@@ inations are a part of the state immun@@ iz@@ ation plan and are free for children .
He@@ pati@@ tis C vir@@ uses spread from exposure to the blood of a sick person , drug injec@@ ting , ta@@ t@@ too@@ ing , pi@@ er@@ cing , use of everyday items contaminated with blood , donor blood , sex with a person suspected of having he@@ pati@@ tis and from a mother sick with he@@ pati@@ tis to fo@@ etus / new@@ born .
among the risk group for he@@ pati@@ tis B infection are injec@@ ting drug ab@@ users , sex partners of infected persons , men who have sex with men , an infected mother to new@@ born , family members and ca@@ regi@@ vers of the sick , healthcare , rescue and police workers exposed to blood and other bo@@ d@@ ily flu@@ ids , people infected with HIV , and travellers visiting countries with high incidence of he@@ pati@@ tis C .
preventive measures for he@@ pati@@ tis C are : ref@@ ra@@ ining from sharing personal hygiene and man@@ ic@@ ure ac@@ cess@@ or@@ ies , other objects with bla@@ des and sy@@ ring@@ es and need@@ les , ref@@ ra@@ ining from ta@@ t@@ too@@ ing and pi@@ er@@ cing ; and using a con@@ dom during sex with the risk of infection or sexual ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence .
there is no vaccine for he@@ pati@@ tis C .
He@@ pati@@ tis D is caused by the he@@ pati@@ tis D virus , which re@@ produces in the presence of the he@@ pati@@ tis B virus .
thus he@@ pati@@ tis D is co @-@ mor@@ bid with he@@ pati@@ tis B or a super@@ infection among those with chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B .
He@@ pati@@ tis D vir@@ uses spread through exposure to blood and other bo@@ d@@ ily flu@@ ids , sy@@ ring@@ es and need@@ les contaminated with blood and other bo@@ d@@ ily flu@@ ids , sexual transmission and , rarely , from infected mother to fo@@ etus .
the risk group for he@@ pati@@ tis D is chronic carriers of he@@ pati@@ tis D virus and people who lack immunity to he@@ pati@@ tis B .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination with the he@@ pati@@ tis B vaccine , which also protects people from he@@ pati@@ tis D infection .
He@@ pati@@ tis E vir@@ uses are spread through the fa@@ ec@@ al @-@ oral route involving drinking water and food , including under@@ c@@ oo@@ ked meat , consumption of fish and sh@@ ell@@ fish , through donor blood , shared sy@@ ring@@ es and from infected mother to fo@@ etus .
travellers may become infected with he@@ pati@@ tis E in countries with high incidence .
preventive measures for he@@ pati@@ tis E are following good hygiene : was@@ hing or dis@@ infec@@ ting hands after using the w@@ ash@@ room , before food preparation and eating , and after providing care to patients .
W@@ ash fru@@ its and vegetables before consumption , avoid eating under@@ c@@ oo@@ ked meat , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , drink only safe drinking water and refrain from use of drugs .
although challen@@ gers tried to crow@@ d out the four @-@ time Olympic champion in the final la@@ p , 34 @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ara@@ h du@@ g deep on the home stret@@ ch and won with a time of 26 : 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
without breaking stri@@ de , F@@ ara@@ h brought his wife T@@ ania and his children on to the track with him after he finished .
it was a special moment for me .
I really miss my family .
having them with me on the track was ama@@ zing , <<unk>> F@@ ara@@ h told the journalists .
in London , F@@ ara@@ h is e@@ ye@@ ing a double victory in the 5000 and 10@@ 000 metres for a fifth champi@@ on@@ ship in a row .
everything is possible if you believe in it .
despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor &apos;s Lady in gold . the extraordinary story of G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t &apos;s mas@@ ter@@ piece , the portra@@ it of A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer , del@@ ves a good bit deeper into the late 19th and early 20th century history of Vienna cultural life .
but it del@@ ves even deeper into history .
the a@@ we @-@ inspiring amount of information could have benefited from less spar@@ ing cuts , and a narro@@ wer focus would have allowed the portra@@ it promised in the heading to sh@@ ine more .
right now , it &apos;s as if two books were inside one cover : the story of G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t and A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer de@@ pic@@ ted in his pain@@ ting The Lady in gold and a much larger and more swee@@ ping history book of distinguished Jewish families and the German occupation and its af@@ tere@@ ff@@ ec@@ ts in Austria .
the first third of the book leads us into the vibran@@ t Vi@@ enn@@ ese cultural life <<unk>> and anyone who has been to the Austrian capital will have little trouble imag@@ ining what life was like more than a hundred years ago around the R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ se or how all heads turned in the Central C@@ af@@ é when Kli@@ m@@ t entered .
the concentration of cultural figures in one of Europe &apos;s weal@@ thi@@ est cities was high and upon seeing a familiar name in the book , you feel that you yourself are a tiny bit more cul@@ tured .
at the same time , the fact that , say , S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud lived and worked in a city teem@@ ing with un@@ treated sy@@ p@@ hi@@ lis ra@@ ged and having Europe &apos;s highest suicide rate do@@ es@@ n &apos;t lend much to the story &apos;s development .
and yet perhaps <<unk>> every br@@ us@@ h@@ stro@@ ke of a few sentences adds tone colour to the early 20th century cultural life in Vienna .
dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
in the closing decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had grown explo@@ sively , becoming the biggest Jewish community in Western Europe .
at the turn of the century , one in ten Vienna residents was Jewish .
A@@ dele &apos;s parents as well were new@@ com@@ ers to Vienna , but by the time A@@ dele mar@@ ried a Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ te twice her age , Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch , and posed for the Kli@@ m@@ t &apos;s famous pa@@ int@@ ings , her father &apos;s bank had become the seventh largest bank in the H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg emp@@ ire .
but A@@ dele was not drawn by the whole gla@@ mo@@ rous life she was a part of .
if we look at Lady in gold , it &apos;s hard to believe that toward the end of her life , this grand dame was infected by soci@@ alism and d@@ reamed of a trip to the US@@ SR .
by 19@@ 03 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to commission a portra@@ it of his wife from Kli@@ m@@ t , the latter was the hot@@ test pa@@ inter in Vienna .
Kli@@ m@@ t &apos;s commission at the time was 4,@@ 000 crow@@ ns , a quarter of the price of a good country house .
the fact that in the case of some portra@@ its , the master was suspected of having an affair with the model di@@ d@@ n &apos;t deter the mag@@ na@@ te .
as to A@@ dele , the only thing known for certain is that the close bond that developed between the model and the ar@@ tist during the pain@@ ting process persis@@ ted until the end of their lives .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor <<unk>> Lady in gold .
the extraordinary story behind the G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t mas@@ ter@@ piece , the portra@@ it of A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer , Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , translated from English by Al@@ do R@@ and@@ maa .
immediately before starting work with A@@ dele , Kli@@ m@@ t had been to the San V@@ ita@@ le B@@ asi@@ lic@@ a in Ra@@ ven@@ na and sch@@ ol@@ ars believe that it was the bri@@ lli@@ ant mo@@ sa@@ ics of the em@@ press The@@ o@@ dor@@ a he saw there that gave the ar@@ tist the idea of creating a gol@@ den portra@@ it of A@@ dele in the form of a pain@@ ted mo@@ sa@@ ic .
Kli@@ m@@ t presented his Lady in gold in Vienna in 19@@ 08 , and around the same time ( 19@@ 07 @-@ 19@@ 08 ) another gol@@ den pain@@ ting called K@@ iss was conceived .
the simil@@ arity between the two women was not overlooked by art his@@ tori@@ ans of course .
how is Hitler tied in to the story ?
<<unk>> I think that in memory of my friend Kli@@ m@@ t , I am in his debt that I should make his handi@@ work accessible to the public ; <<unk>> A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer wrote to the director of Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere M@@ use@@ um a few years after the de@@ mise of the ar@@ tist ( Kli@@ m@@ t died in February 19@@ 18 ) and expressed the wish that their family &apos;s Kli@@ m@@ t collection pass to the muse@@ um .
six years before his death , Kli@@ m@@ t had pain@@ ted another portra@@ it of A@@ dele .
in her testa@@ ment as well ( A@@ dele died in February 19@@ 25 ) , she asked that her hus@@ band leave her two portra@@ its and four Kli@@ m@@ t landscape pa@@ int@@ ings to the Austrian gallery .
she left her je@@ wel@@ le@@ ry to her ni@@ ec@@ es Maria and Lu@@ ise .
a year after Kli@@ m@@ t finished work on the <<unk>> Austrian Mon@@ a lisa , <<unk>> the 17 @-@ year @-@ od@@ l Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler had stri@@ ven for admission to the Vienna fine art A@@ ca@@ de@@ my , but failed his drawing examination .
although Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is sometimes attributed to Jewish profes@@ sors not ad@@ mitting him to the acade@@ my , in fact none of his exa@@ min@@ ers was a J@@ ew .
in any case , the function of the Austrian gallery mentioned in Maria &apos;s will had changed marke@@ dly by 19@@ 39 <<unk>> it was no important to find works from among Vienna &apos;s rich@@ ly endo@@ wed Jewish art colle@@ ctions that were to the lik@@ ing of the Nazi Party .
some of the works in A@@ dele &apos;s home were suitable for Hitler &apos;s personal art t@@ reasury , but not those of Kli@@ m@@ t .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the Nazi art he@@ ists , a 10 @-@ year @-@ long court dispute between the Austrian government and the success@@ ors of the B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ ers began .
let it be noted here that while K@@ iss can be seen in Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle in Vienna , a trip to New York &apos;s Ne@@ ue Gal@@ eri@@ e is required to see the de@@ pic@@ tion of A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer in Lady in gold .
and before a trip to Vienna , read the abo@@ ve@@ mentioned book .
even if you don &apos;t plan to go see works by Kli@@ m@@ t , after closing the book , at least my own emo@@ tions revol@@ ved around Nazi and Jewish themes more than the pain@@ ting sold for 135 million dollars and the model A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer .
thus it is not so much a portra@@ it but more of a story of the fate of a family <<unk>> and a very moving story at that .
the Bauer family t@@ ree re@@ produced at the start of the book made it significantly easier to orien@@ tate with regard to the events .
17 @-@ year @-@ old sw@@ im@@ mer in Canada comes very close to Estonian record
in the preliminary heat , gold was very close to her personal record in the 200 m back@@ stro@@ ke , with a time of 2 : 16.@@ 62 .
the 17 @-@ year @-@ old P@@ B comes from just a week ago , when her time in the Canadian j@@ uni@@ ors champi@@ on@@ ship was 2 : 16.@@ 58 , Pri@@ it A@@ avi@@ k reports in his Sw@@ im@@ ming B@@ lo@@ g .
gold got the last , 10th ber@@ th in the A final .
in the final , she covered the distance in a time of 2 : 15.@@ 76 for a solid seventh place with a new imposing personal best .
gold was just over half a second off A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or &apos;s Estonian record ( 2 : 15.@@ 13 ) .
in Estonia &apos;s all @-@ time ran@@ k@@ ings , gold rose to third and her latest personal best is the fifth all @-@ time Estonian result .
at the adult champi@@ on@@ ships of Canada , the young future hopeful will also start in the 100 m , 200 m and 400 m fre@@ es@@ ty@@ le and 200 m and 400 m med@@ le@@ ys .
last week , the Canadian j@@ uni@@ or champi@@ on@@ ships were held in Tor@@ onto , and gold had successful starts there as well .
she won a sil@@ ver me@@ dal in the 200 m fre@@ es@@ ty@@ le with a time of 2 : 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
the last time the distance was sw@@ um so fast by an Estonian woman was in 2008 .
only the record @-@ setting Estonian E@@ lina Par@@ <<unk>> ka has sw@@ um the distance faster than gold .
the Estonian living in Canada also won a b@@ ron@@ ze in the 100 m fre@@ es@@ ty@@ le with a super@@ b personal best and a new Estonian season high mark of 5@@ 6.@@ 66 .
Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k , a year older than her , has sw@@ um the distance just one hundre@@ d@@ th of a second faster .
she also set a person best in the 100 m back@@ stro@@ ke rela@@ y , with a time of 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 as the starting sw@@ im@@ mer .
in the event twice that distance , she only managed seventh , with a time of 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 in the final .
gold currently has the season &apos;s best Estonian time in four different distances .
Donald T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics shar@@ pen their teet@@ h
V@@ ac@@ ation season is here , which means rela@@ xation for US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp as well .
as T@@ ru@@ mp is one of the presidents who has taken the most days of holiday , critics are already shar@@ pen@@ ing their teet@@ h .
USA Today and CN@@ N report that the president plans to spend his 17 @-@ day holiday at the gol@@ f club named after him in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , which is located in New Jer@@ sey .
although the president &apos;s holiday started yesterday , T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s opponents have been speaking out on the topic of the va@@ cation for about a week now .
they cri@@ tici@@ ze T@@ ru@@ mp for going on va@@ cation too often .
namely , the president is in the ha@@ bit of spending the week@@ ends in his vil@@ las in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey .
by the way , T@@ ru@@ mp in his 19@@ 6 days in office has not taken the most va@@ cation time of any president .
for instance , George W@@ . Bush had already taken 67 days of holiday y that time , and Barack Obama half as much as T@@ ru@@ mp <<unk>> only 21 days .
but T@@ ru@@ mp does tend to forget things quickly .
just a few days after becoming president , T@@ ru@@ mp told 60 Minutes that he would not have time for long va@@ cations during his term in office , as there is so much to be done .
three years ago , he also expressed dis@@ pleasure over Barack Obama &apos;s va@@ cations .
the now president wrote on Twitter back then : while Obama va@@ cations , gol@@ f@@ s , atten@@ ds parties &amp; ja@@ z@@ z concer@@ ts , isis is ch@@ op@@ ping heads off of journalists . &quot;
White House officials say a 17 @-@ day gol@@ f club visit is@@ n &apos;t really rela@@ xing .
it is being official called a working va@@ cation instead , during which T@@ ru@@ mp will have no time to read or other fav@@ ou@@ rite activities .
in addition , there was said to be another reason for the working va@@ cation .
namely , the air condi@@ tioning I@@ ON the West wing of the White House is being replaced and thus all staff had to move out .
the West wing is where the O@@ val Office and other working areas for the present are located .
<<unk>> I don &apos;t think any of you would like to be in the West wing in an August D@@ .@@ C. summer day when it &apos;s over 100 degrees with no air condi@@ tioning , <<unk>> said White House spokes@@ person L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , who stressed that the president would continue working during his va@@ cation .
as to where President T@@ ru@@ mp will spend the next 17 days , the video gives some idea .
blocking critics from Facebook : don &apos;t run for public office , if you can &apos;t take heat from voters
the father of our country knew something about bad press .
Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but it di@@ d@@ n &apos;t take long for newspapers to start s@@ lam@@ ming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles .
he cha@@ fed at the criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
because back in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; the freedom of speech may be taken away - and , du@@ mb &amp; silent we may be led , like sheep , to the slaughter . &quot;
that brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land G@@ ov@@ . Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who needs to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liberties Union su@@ ed him for that earlier this week .
the govern@@ or &apos;s staff dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commen@@ tary was rich with a &quot; who ca@@ res ? &quot; back@@ lash .
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; plenty of fol@@ ks said .
but it matters .
and it especially matters when it &apos;s a Guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Re@@ publi@@ can govern@@ or in an overwhel@@ mingly Democratic state who is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second @-@ highest approval rating of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary ho@@ the@@ ad .
he &apos;s shown a steady hand in leading his state and a s@@ tern adherence to principles .
he &apos;s also been pretty de@@ ft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents , play@@ fully de@@ bu@@ ting his ha@@ ir@@ less head after che@@ mo treatments on his page .
so blocking people who come to the govern@@ or &apos;s page - which is a public forum , la@@ be@@ led as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington post , Ho@@ gan spokes@@ woman Ame@@ lia Ch@@ asse defended the govern@@ or &apos;s actions , arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moder@@ ating them .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of trol@@ ls or spa@@ m@@ mers or ha@@ teful fol@@ ks las@@ hing out online .
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and they &apos;@@ re just that - real people talking to their elected leaders : a teacher , a business owner and a pas@@ tor , not trol@@ ls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thou@@ gh@@ tful and not prof@@ ane .
the pas@@ tor quoted the Bi@@ ble in his post , appealing to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
At@@ tor@@ ne@@ y L@@ ak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ra@@ mani of Bo@@ wi@@ e , M@@ d . , was@@ n &apos;t ha@@ teful , but she asked about hate crimes .
&quot; I poli@@ tely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items , &quot; she wrote in the comment section of The post &apos;s news story .
&quot; I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic , they are immediately disregarded by some as a so @-@ called collective effort , rather than recogni@@ zed as a large group of concerned citizens . &quot;
what the govern@@ or &apos;s staff called a &quot; concentrated spa@@ m attack &quot; others would probably call &quot; advo@@ c@@ acy . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a cri@@ tic or dele@@ ting a negative comment .
it &apos;s a lot cleaner than the old days , when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and bur@@ n newspapers with critical edit@@ ori@@ als or ar@@ resting and si@@ len@@ cing prote@@ sters .
but that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening , only digita@@ lly .
Ho@@ gan is@@ n &apos;t the first public official to be cri@@ tici@@ zed for def@@ an@@ ging Facebook and other social media .
President T@@ ru@@ mp is being su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed .
one of the first land@@ mark rulings on this issue came down last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
the chair of the Lou@@ dou@@ n Coun@@ ty Board of supervisors violated the First Amendment , according to U.S. Dis@@ tri@@ ct Judge James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a constitu@@ ent from her Facebook page .
and in Ken@@ tu@@ cky , G@@ ov@@ . Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in ( R ) also got a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U over his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this sh@@ ou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t be so hard .
in Washington &apos;s time , the era of affordable pos@@ tage had an impact much like the Internet .
the number of newspapers qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ pled between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , and anon@@ ymous letter wri@@ ters ham@@ me@@ red his leadership .
and even back then , Washington had anon@@ ymous trol@@ ls .
people using the pse@@ ud@@ on@@ y@@ ms &quot; Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; all wrote letters to newspapers tras@@ hing Washington &apos;s decisions .
Petitions cri@@ tici@@ zing his stand on the Treaty of A@@ mity , Commerce , and Navigation with Britain overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ sent and dis@@ course lie at the very foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
R@@ on@@ an R@@ aff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfor@@ ts at R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ance club
former European No 1 R@@ on@@ an R@@ aff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for home comfor@@ ts over the next three days as the R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ance club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian ho@@ sts the 25@@ th edition of the Scottish senior Open .
the Northern I@@ ris@@ h@@ man , who led next door at Ar@@ cher@@ field links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul E@@ ales , is attached to the new ven@@ ue and is acting as t@@ our@@ na@@ ment Ambassador on behalf of the club &apos;s foun@@ der and CE@@ O Jer@@ ry S@@ arva@@ di .
&quot; I watched R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ance club being built , and we &apos;@@ re seeing it come to its gl@@ ory with this event , &quot; said R@@ aff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course at its fin@@ est , it is in f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous condition .
Jer@@ ry has done a f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous job setting this place up .
he &apos;s a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
Eng@@ lis@@ h@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a champi@@ on@@ ship for the first time despite winning on both the European T@@ our and European challenge T@@ our in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this does feel really special , &quot; said the Sou@@ th@@ port @-@ based player .
&quot; I di@@ d@@ n &apos;t get to defend the Ex@@ t@@ rema@@ du@@ ra Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it .
coming back to this part of the world is ma@@ gical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play gol@@ f in .
the memor@@ ies from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year .
it was a really special time and one we will always cher@@ ish . &quot;
making his return to action on home soil is G@@ ary Or@@ r , who joined the European senior T@@ our after turning 50 earlier this year .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the A@@ ber@@ de@@ en asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little bit more when you &apos;@@ re playing at home , &quot; said Hel@@ en@@ s@@ bur@@ gh man Or@@ r .
&quot; you want to do well ; but you do feel that extra pressure .
I &apos;@@ ve really enjoyed playing again and I &apos;@@ ve played some solid gol@@ f .
I &apos;m happy with how it &apos;s going so far . &quot;

poverty and death in Indonesia &apos;s land of gold
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i c@@ oo@@ ks dinner , she do@@ es@@ n &apos;t use a sto@@ ve .
she rarely even uses a po@@ t .
in her w@@ oo@@ den home in Ena@@ ro@@ ta@@ li , the capital of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i reg@@ ency in the res@@ tive Indon@@ esi@@ an province of Papua , the ho@@ use@@ wife usually just places a swe@@ et pota@@ to - known locally as &quot; no@@ ta &quot; - directly into the fi@@ replace .
after half @-@ an @-@ hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed and de@@ v@@ oured with eag@@ er , un@@ was@@ hed hands .

as the youn@@ gest of her hus@@ band &apos;s four w@@ ives , she has been assigned no fields to tend .
Pol@@ y@@ ga@@ my is common here .
of course , working late can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily , plus there are the soldiers .
&quot; no one da@@ res to walk around the village after 5 p.m. , &quot; she says .
it &apos;s a rare gli@@ mp@@ se of daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch col@@ ony that was absor@@ bed into Indonesia in 19@@ 69 following a controversial referendum , when just 1,@@ 0@@ 26 el@@ ders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops .
an existing movement a@@ gi@@ tating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta government , which maintains tight control over the region , bar@@ ring foreign journalists or rights monitors .
in 2003 , the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua , with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island .
Ena@@ ro@@ ta@@ li is as remote as it is de@@ so@@ late ; the journey here involves a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provin@@ cial capital Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ a to N@@ ab@@ ire , and then a st@@ oma@@ ch @-@ chur@@ ning five @-@ hour drive by h@@ ire car .

there were other changes , too .

Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and literacy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s land of gold .
the world &apos;s largest and most profitable gold mine , G@@ ras@@ berg , owned by P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x @-@ based F@@ ree@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an , lies just 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , a high@@ land province around the size of New Jer@@ sey and home to 15@@ 3,@@ 000 people .
in 2015 alone , F@@ ree@@ port mined some $ 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ per here .
in addition , Papua bo@@ asts timber resources worth an estimated $ 78 billion .
these ri@@ ches are , however , a source of misery for Pa@@ pu@@ ans , ensuring Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that F@@ ree@@ port paid local military personnel and units nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 to a single officer .
Pa@@ pu@@ an calls for greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den g@@ oo@@ se , and are dealt with mer@@ ci@@ lessly .
according to rights activists , more than 50@@ 0,000 Pa@@ pu@@ ans have been killed , and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esi@@ an military since 19@@ 69 .
mass killings in Papua &apos;s tri@@ bal high@@ lands during the 1970s amounted to genocide , according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
Indon@@ esi@@ an police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful prote@@ sters in the region last year alone .
we W@@ ill lose E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing , a 2016 report by the Ar@@ ch@@ dio@@ ces@@ e of B@@ ris@@ b@@ ane , contains testi@@ mony of atrocities committed the previous year , such as extra@@ judicial executions , torture - rape and electro@@ cu@@ tion are especially popular , according to another report - and the brutal crus@@ hing of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia research@@ er for Human Rights Watch .
the scre@@ ws have tightened as Papua &apos;s resources bring an influx of set@@ tle@@ rs from elsewhere in Indonesia .
the province &apos;s 3.5 million population is 83 % Christian , but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia &apos;s popul@@ ous islands of Ja@@ va , Bor@@ neo , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ esi .
Ja@@ van@@ ese war@@ ung can@@ te@@ ens sell fri@@ ed chic@@ ken and ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do mixed @-@ vegetables served with pe@@ anu@@ t sa@@ u@@ ce .
local people struggle to compete .
&quot; the migrants started to sell chic@@ ken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pa@@ pu@@ ans , &quot; explains abeth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old P@@ ani@@ a@@ i native who moved to the provin@@ cial capital Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ a for work .
&quot; it made the native Pa@@ pu@@ ans - the ma@@ ma @-@ ma@@ ma &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - lose their market . &quot;
Indon@@ esi@@ an President J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , po@@ p@@ ularly known as Jo@@ ko@@ wi , vo@@ wed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former car@@ pen@@ ter secured 27 of Papua &apos;s total 29 distri@@ cts - including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i - on the way to the presidential Pal@@ ace in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta .
but precious little has changed in Papua , and today local people feel bet@@ ra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jo@@ ko@@ wi , with the expectation that he would fulfil@@ l our hopes for justice to be restored , &quot; You says .
in fact , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i suffered a na@@ di@@ r just two months after Jo@@ ko@@ wi &apos;s October inaugu@@ ration .
on Dec@@ . 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children were outside s@@ inging Christmas ca@@ ro@@ ls in front of a bon@@ fire in Ena@@ ro@@ ta@@ li when two Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers on a motor@@ b@@ ike broke through the g@@ loom .
the star@@ tled children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took umb@@ rage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to local Pas@@ tor Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ eba@@ i .
the soldiers , who had been drinking , cha@@ sed and be@@ at the group with their ri@@ f@@ le but@@ ts , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ o , was beaten so badly he fell into a com@@ a .
a couple of hours later , the ne@@ ar@@ by government Ele@@ ction Commission building was set ab@@ la@@ ze , and things es@@ c@@ ala@@ ted the following day .
about 1,@@ 000 young Pa@@ pu@@ an men , women and children gathered on a so@@ cc@@ er field in front of the local police station and military command cen@@ ter to demand justice .
they carried cere@@ mon@@ ial hunting bo@@ ws and performed the wa@@ ita dance - running in circles and simu@@ lating bir@@ d@@ s@@ ong - of Papua &apos;s Me@@ e P@@ ago tri@@ be .
some prote@@ sters started hur@@ ling stones at police and military posts .
as temp@@ ers grew more heated , an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio : &quot; if the mas@@ ses offer resistance more than three times , shoo@@ t them dead , &quot; it said , according to an official document seen by time that has not been released to the local media .
Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ ame , 56 , the head of the Ke@@ go Ko@@ to neigh@@ bor@@ hood of Ena@@ ro@@ ta@@ li , saw the im@@ pending danger and ap@@ pealed for calm , im@@ pl@@ oring the crow@@ d to go back home .
nobody was in the m@@ ood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left w@@ rist , &quot; he told time on the por@@ ch of his b@@ rightly pain@@ ted w@@ oo@@ den house .
Ka@@ y@@ ame still do@@ es@@ n &apos;t know who fired but says the bul@@ let came from the ranks of amas@@ sed soldiers .
&quot; it was crow@@ ded , many sho@@ ts were fired , &quot; he adds .
local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , according to his co@@ usin who witnessed the sh@@ oot@@ ings .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only goes by one name , told time s@@ om@@ ber@@ ly .
&quot; I saw he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the Papua Police Chief In@@ spec@@ tor General Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende told repor@@ ters that his officers were only &quot; securing &quot; their station because it was under attack .
&quot; we have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; Papua Police spokes@@ person , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo said in 2015 .
&quot; it &apos;s a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prote@@ sters were killed and many more injured .
news of the killings only fil@@ tered through to J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta the following day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ wi gave an im@@ passion@@ ed speech in Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ a , where he expressed sympath@@ ies with the victims &apos; families and vo@@ wed to address the historic abuses in Papua .
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so it won &apos;t ever happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
security Minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non @-@ judicial mechanism to settle historic human @-@ rights violations .
but the ex@@ cus@@ es started almost immediately .
&quot; most of the violations occurred a long time ago .
some were in the &apos; 9@@ 0s and in early 200@@ 0s .
the point is we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes to go through , &quot; he said .
then W@@ ir@@ an@@ to back@@ tra@@ cked when speaking to time in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta on June 5 , saying he has no plans to establish a gri@@ ev@@ ance mechanism in Papua .
instead , &quot; All will be settled by law , &quot; he said .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who the U.@@ N@@ . has indi@@ cted for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; relating to more than 1,@@ 000 deaths during East Timor &apos;s bloody 1999 independence vote , said that 11 cases of human @-@ rights violations in Papua have already been settled , including the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i incident .
families of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i victims g@@ ree@@ ted such claims with gri@@ m inc@@ re@@ du@@ lity .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve been inter@@ viewed four times for the past three years , but there has been no progress at all , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es says .
&quot; I &apos;m ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that years later , he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his bro@@ ther Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us echo@@ ed the view that people in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are fe@@ ar@@ ful of discussing the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bur@@ y four of the victims .
&quot; after bur@@ ying the bodies , the military came looking for me , &quot; he says .
the sh@@ oot@@ ings ha@@ ven &apos;t stopped .
on Tuesday , Indon@@ esi@@ an police shot at villa@@ gers in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i &apos;s neigh@@ b@@ oring D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i reg@@ ency .
one person died and 17 others were w@@ ounded , including children , during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an un@@ conscious man to hospital .
the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w who dro@@ w@@ ned while he was fishing in a ne@@ ar@@ by river , died on the way to hospital .
In@@ cen@@ sed villa@@ gers prote@@ sted in front of the company &apos;s site office .
police said the villa@@ gers thre@@ w ro@@ cks at officers , who responded by fir@@ ing warning sho@@ ts .
but lo@@ c@@ als say the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indon@@ esi@@ an para@@ military police ) began shooting at the crow@@ d , killing one .
&quot; we were so pan@@ ic@@ ked , we are afraid there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hur@@ ried in , tells time .
&quot; I have been hiding in my house for two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile bri@@ gade to be withdrawn from the area .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ i has always been a trou@@ ble@@ spot for the Indon@@ esi@@ an government .
the lack of meaningful development fe@@ eds the dis@@ content of the tri@@ bal Me@@ e , M@@ oni , D@@ ani , and Da@@ mal peoples , who live spra@@ w@@ led across Papua &apos;s ver@@ dant central high@@ lands .
many joined the Free Papua Movement ( OP@@ M ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pa@@ pu@@ ans by launching spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidna@@ pping ra@@ ids on Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers .
some of the top OP@@ M leaders hail from P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years , under the gu@@ ise of &quot; safeguarding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never re@@ appear .
among the people of Papua , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty fe@@ eds the dis@@ content .
the little ri@@ ce on sale in Ena@@ ro@@ ta@@ li is too expensive for lo@@ c@@ als to buy .
B@@ read is just as out of reach .
people here grow everything they eat : mainly no@@ ta plus some fruit and le@@ af@@ y vegetables .
farming is the job of the women , who each can maintain four or five fields of the swe@@ et pota@@ to .
they usually keep most of the harvest for the family , with the rest sold in the local market .
ten pieces of no@@ ta cost only 10@@ ,000 Indon@@ esi@@ an ru@@ pi@@ ah ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have grown between the native Pa@@ pu@@ ans and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to N@@ ab@@ ire Air@@ port .
what few jobs exist typically go to the better @-@ educated and weal@@ thi@@ er migrants .
Pa@@ pu@@ ans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competi@@ tively .
&quot; the young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there &apos;s no jobs or money here , &quot; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , the chairman of the tri@@ bal council of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
isolation keeps the world &apos;s eyes off Papua .
in addition , reporting restrictions for international media remain tight .
earlier this year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were depor@@ ted from Papua for a &quot; lack of coordination with related institutions &quot; despite having been granted rare permission to film .
according to P@@ heli@@ m K@@ ine , Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , Jo@@ ko@@ wi &apos;s election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been re@@ ali@@ zed .
&quot; there are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s res@@ tive eas@@ tern@@ most provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa denial and black@@ listing , &quot; he said in a statement .
the lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indon@@ esi@@ an government has been largely limited to Papua &apos;s immediate neigh@@ b@@ ors .
in March , six Pacific nations - T@@ on@@ ga , Na@@ ur@@ u , P@@ ala@@ u , Tu@@ valu , the Mar@@ shall Islands , and the Sol@@ om@@ on Islands - urged the U.@@ N@@ . Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i shooting .
these same countries have historically backed the OP@@ M .
Indon@@ esi@@ an Foreign Ministry spokes@@ person Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r sh@@ ru@@ gged off the group &apos;s allegations , telling journalists in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , &quot; In Indonesia , a democratic system still applies and there &apos;s free media so it &apos;s hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the nation &apos;s human rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ a on May 4 , local people broke their silence , be@@ see@@ ching , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anon@@ ymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but Pa@@ pu@@ ans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jo@@ ko@@ wi .
&quot; Jo@@ ko@@ wi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i shooting , &quot; says Go@@ ba@@ i , the tri@@ bal council chairman .
he wants Jo@@ ko@@ wi to know that the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i people , aside from living under the loom@@ ing threat of a ra@@ pa@@ cious military , w@@ allow in de@@ stitu@@ tion , with pal@@ try education and health services .
Go@@ ba@@ i says the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i people , like other Pa@@ pu@@ ans , consider their vote to Jo@@ ko@@ wi as a &quot; debt &quot; he must re@@ pay .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and intimidation , families of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : bur@@ ying one victim &apos;s body on land just opposite the police and military station .
knowing that justice may never be served , at least they won &apos;t let those responsible forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us , head bo@@ wed .
&quot; what else could we do ? &quot;
fire eng@@ ul@@ f@@ s Du@@ ba@@ i &apos;s &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sk@@ y@@ scra@@ per for second time
a fire ri@@ pped through one of the world &apos;s tal@@ lest residential tow@@ ers in Du@@ ba@@ i on Friday , forcing hundreds of occu@@ pan@@ ts to fle@@ e the 3@@ 37 me@@ tre @-@ ta@@ ll , 79 @-@ sto@@ rey structure .
it &apos;s the second bla@@ ze to sweep through the high @-@ rise - which happens to be called the Tor@@ ch to@@ wer - in just two years .
the building was evacu@@ ated , no injuries were reported , and there was no immediate word on the cause of the bla@@ ze .
&quot; we were s@@ lee@@ ping and we wo@@ ke up to the fire alarm and people scre@@ aming .
we ran down the sta@@ irs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident who gave his name as George told Re@@ u@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ i &apos;s civil defence authorities said fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ting squ@@ ads put out the bla@@ ze at around 4.@@ 00 am local time ( 0@@ 000 G@@ MT ) and were cooling the building .
the government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected .
the incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the ex@@ teri@@ ors of ta@@ ll buildings across the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cla@@ d@@ ding , ex@@ teri@@ or pan@@ el@@ ling used for dec@@ oration or insu@@ lation .
in the UK , police have said they believe the system of insu@@ lation and cla@@ d@@ ding panels on London &apos;s G@@ ren@@ fell T@@ ow@@ er may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died .
watch : these phones should become the autumn &apos;s top selle@@ rs
the spring and autumn are a swe@@ et time for tech f@@ ans , because that I when telephone manufacturers unve@@ il their new top of the line models .
the spring saw the Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peri@@ a X@@ Z premium go on sale , and new hit smar@@ t@@ phones are awaited on shel@@ ves in the autumn .
Tele@@ 2 &apos;s marketing and sale director Krist@@ jan Se@@ ema says today &apos;s flag@@ ships are charac@@ teri@@ zed by an innovative design , ir@@ is scan@@ ner , edge @-@ to @-@ edge 4@@ K resolution screen and ultra @-@ fast pro@@ cess@@ or .
the Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 caused ri@@ pp@@ les of ex@@ ci@@ tement in the tech world , and it is now among the top selle@@ rs in Estonia .
the autumn holds the promise of even faster rapid charging , longer bat@@ tery life , higher quality camer@@ as and better water@@ pro@@ of@@ ness and dust resistance .
he added that rum@@ our allowed him to predict the four top models that will probably con@@ qu@@ er the sales ran@@ k@@ ings this year .
these four top models of smar@@ t@@ phones will go on sale only this autumn .
the long @-@ awaited i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach sto@@ res already in mid @-@ September .
Ru@@ m@@ ours are ri@@ fe about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it .
whereas the i@@ P@@ hone 7 di@@ d@@ n &apos;t bring anything significantly different to the i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , it &apos;s expected that on the occasion of Apple &apos;s 10th birth@@ day the new model will be completely distinct from previous ones .
four col@@ ours have been mentioned : Black , white , pin@@ k gold and ch@@ ro@@ me .
one of the elements of the new design is doub@@ tless the screen , which takes up the entire front panel of the phone , the home but@@ ton has been scra@@ pped and the finger@@ print rea@@ der has been built into the screen .
Apple &apos;s design chief J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve requires that the new i@@ P@@ hone model look like smooth glass .
there has also been talk of a cer@@ a@@ mic version of the i@@ P@@ hone .
besides ir@@ is scan@@ ner , wireless charging and an even better camer@@ a , a faster A@@ 11 pro@@ cess@@ or can be expected .
it is certainly one of the year &apos;s most eag@@ er@@ ly awaited smar@@ t@@ phones .
pre @-@ or@@ dering of the brand @-@ new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y note 8 begins on 23 August .
many rum@@ ours have been le@@ ak@@ ed about what the new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y note 8 will look like .
it &apos;s been said that more attention has been given to business users and the S pen allows even greater fun@@ ction@@ ality .
the phone should have two camer@@ as , of which one is wide @-@ angle and the other one is a telep@@ ho@@ to len@@ s with narro@@ wer angle .
currently no one knows what the two re@@ ar @-@ facing camer@@ as are capable of , but in any case , it is Sam@@ sun@@ g &apos;s first attempt , which is sure to be comparable to the i@@ P@@ hone 8 in terms of quality .
we are looking forward to 23 August with ba@@ ted b@@ reat@@ h .
although Nokia has launched three smar@@ t@@ phones this year , led by the Nokia 6 , their flagship is still missing <<unk>> the Nokia 8 , which will be released 16 August .
we expect an edge @-@ to @-@ edge 5.@@ 3 @-@ in@@ ch screen , a bla@@ z@@ ingly fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ nap@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 pro@@ cess@@ or and a longer bat@@ tery life .
a talking point for the Nokia is also the alu@@ mini@@ um body and no@@ te@@ worthy IP@@ 68 water@@ pro@@ of@@ ness and dus@@ t@@ pro@@ of@@ ness rating .
similarly to the Sam@@ sun@@ g , the new model of the Nokia has two re@@ ar @-@ facing camer@@ as , with Z@@ e@@ iss op@@ tics .
S@@ ony &apos;s stable flagship has been the X@@ Z premium to this point , but the manufacturer has said that in the near future at least two smar@@ t@@ phones with even more innovative functions will be added .
we are awaiting a smar@@ t@@ phone that while it is a little more modest than the X@@ Z premium , it will have a camer@@ a that is as good or better .
it has been specu@@ lated that the screen on the new S@@ ony model will be at least 6 @-@ in@@ ch .
we &apos;@@ ll get to see quite soon what the reality will be , as traditionally , S@@ ony has released its autumn flagship at the IF@@ A international tech fair , which runs from 1 @-@ 6 September this year .
T@@ ru@@ mp pres@@ sured Mexico on border wall payment according to le@@ ak@@ ed phone call trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts
Trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts of phone calls between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been le@@ ak@@ ed by the Washington post .
on 27@@ th January in a phone call to Mexic@@ an president , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to , T@@ ru@@ mp urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall .
the US President ber@@ ated him for publicly denoun@@ cing the wall , re@@ porte@@ dly saying to him &quot; You cannot say that to the press . &quot;
T@@ ru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vo@@ wed to make Mexico pay for the project .
Trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts of his first call with Austr@@ alian Prime Minister Malcolm Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l were also published reve@@ aling a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr T@@ ru@@ mp told Mr Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was &quot; ridiculous , &quot; &quot; ro@@ tten &quot; and &quot; stu@@ pid , &quot; insisting the deal , bro@@ ke@@ red under the Obama administration , would make him look like &quot; a d@@ ope &quot; after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US .
Mr T@@ ru@@ mp ended the call after telling Mr Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l &quot; this is the most un@@ pleasant call all day . &quot;

this was the procurement for regular public bus transport within the city of Tar@@ tu for the period 1 July 2019 to 30 June 20@@ 29 .

although many complain on social media that the noise from the weekend F@@ esti@@ val distur@@ bs their s@@ le@@ ep and that the whole city is full of d@@ run@@ ken re@@ vel@@ lers , there are also many who have nothing negative to say about the festi@@ val on the be@@ ach .
I &apos;m actually positively surprised that the festi@@ val@@ go@@ ers were so well beha@@ ved in the shop !
I di@@ d@@ n &apos;t see anyone in a stu@@ po@@ r or being un@@ civil .

<<unk>> It &apos;s so great that people come , have a stay and enjoy Pär@@ nu , which goes into hi@@ ber@@ nation in winter , <<unk>> she adds che@@ er@@ fully .
the p@@ ounding music heard from the be@@ ach do@@ es@@ n &apos;t keep La@@ ine up at night .
living in the city centre , she heard music coming from the be@@ ach , but now the walls of her home are out of range of the music .
<<unk>> Bu@@ t I hope I do hear it , <<unk>> she says che@@ er@@ fully .
Ag@@ nes , who also spoke with Õ@@ h@@ <<unk>> ht , said that the summer festi@@ val was a good rather than a bad thing for Pär@@ nu <<unk>> it boo@@ sts local merchan@@ ts &apos; turnover , after all .
she is also pleased that so many foreigners came to the summer capital .
the festi@@ val@@ go@@ ers &apos; re@@ vel@@ ry do@@ es@@ n &apos;t fa@@ ze the woman .
even though I don &apos;t go to the be@@ ach to sun@@ ba@@ the any@@ more , it &apos;s great that the be@@ ach has come to life .
and it &apos;s great that people are moving about and it &apos;s been that way for three times now , <<unk>> she says .
the first time it was a little worse , I think .
<<unk>> Th@@ at time there were complaints perhaps , <<unk>> she says , thinking .
but par@@ t@@ ying on the be@@ ach , she says , is a common thing for residents of the <<unk>> summer capital <<unk>> .
<<unk>> Th@@ at weekend is a great pro@@ mo for our little city , <<unk>> says Har@@ ri , who is l@@ ol@@ ling in the park .
the re@@ vel@@ ry and ca@@ ro@@ using has@@ n &apos;t turned his life up@@ side down .
but why ?
we all have to stick together .
we have to think about how the international relations could be better .
loud music do@@ es@@ n &apos;t get his spiri@@ ts down .
it do@@ es@@ n &apos;t b@@ other me , even though I live close by .
<<unk>> G@@ ood fol@@ ks are able to stick together and there &apos;s no trouble , <<unk>> he says .
the visitors to Pär@@ nu are well beha@@ ved , he says .
<<unk>> The@@ y hit the bot@@ tle pretty hard , of course , but ki@@ ds will be ki@@ ds and Lord , let it be , be decent and we &apos;@@ ll get by , <<unk>> he says .
the people living in the be@@ ach area go somewhere else for that time , to visit friends or family .
<<unk>> Bu@@ t in general , the festi@@ val life has a positive influence <<unk>> people like that kind of re@@ vel@@ ry , <<unk>> says Ti@@ ina , who was out wal@@ king with her children in Pär@@ nu .
the festi@@ val music do@@ es@@ n &apos;t b@@ other her family &apos;s slu@@ mber , even though last year it was heard a bit further than this year .
last summer , the stage faced the other way . then we heard more .
we actually live outside the city , and it can be heard quite well way over by the Pär@@ nu River , <<unk>> she says .
Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts another 3,@@ 000 jobs , s@@ las@@ hes dividend to revive business
British education group Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday it would cut another 3,@@ 000 jobs and s@@ lash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business .
the job cuts , which Chief Executive John F@@ all@@ on said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019 , are in addition to 4,@@ 000 roles lost in its previous restructuring .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million p@@ ounds ( $ 3@@ 94 @-@ million U.S. ) in May in a third cost @-@ cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell its stake in Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann last month , said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.@@ 05 billion p@@ ounds .

K@@ abu@@ l con@@ voy attack : NATO soldi@@ er killed in suicide b@@ last
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital , K@@ abu@@ l , killing a NATO soldi@@ er and w@@ ounding several others , officials say .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , a NATO statement said .
Un@@ confirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city &apos;s Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que b@@ last in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in K@@ abu@@ l .
a NATO statement said that Thursday evening &apos;s b@@ last happened when a joint pat@@ ro@@ l with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; personnel @-@ borne impro@@ vised explo@@ sive device . &quot;
the statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bag@@ ra@@ m air@@ field .
Cor@@ respondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ h is a major source of concern to NATO forces based in ne@@ ar@@ by Bag@@ ra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , Afghanistan saw at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017 , with about 20 % of those in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Sh@@ ia district of K@@ abu@@ l .
the Taliban said they had carried out that attack .
on 31 May , a huge bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people , the dead@@ li@@ est mili@@ tant attack in the country since US @-@ led forces ous@@ ted the Taliban from power in 2001 .
the violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp weigh@@ s up whether to increase the number of US troops a@@ iding the military and police in the country .
Cor@@ respondents say the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf G@@ h@@ ani .
EPA rever@@ ses decision to delay smo@@ g rule after law@@ suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama @-@ era rule requiring states to curb smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions , one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency over the move .
the EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so @-@ called &quot; 2015 ozone D@@ esi@@ g@@ nations &quot; late on Wednesday , saying it showed the agency &apos;s commitment to working with states .
&quot; we believe in dialogue with , and being responsive to , our state partners , &quot; EPA Chief Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t said in a statement .
P@@ ru@@ it@@ t in June had announced the EPA &apos;s intention to delay the ozone designa@@ tions - in which existing smo@@ g pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly Democratic states , along with the Dis@@ tri@@ ct of C@@ olum@@ bia , fi@@ led a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal .
the administration of President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp has been seeking to roll back a wide ar@@ ray of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda T@@ ru@@ mp says is aimed at spar@@ king economic growth .
but the efforts have triggered pus@@ h@@ back by Democra@@ tics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the EPA &apos;s website says brea@@ thing air containing ozone &quot; can reduce lun@@ g function and increase res@@ pira@@ tory symptoms &quot; like as@@ th@@ ma .

M@@ ike@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ ike@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should be on a col@@ lisi@@ on course to stage the most compe@@ lling bo@@ xing match under 147 p@@ ounds in the near future , met each other for the first time Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ P@@ N offices in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ les until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ beaten World Bo@@ xing Council ligh@@ t@@ weight champion , wal@@ ked down the hal@@ l@@ way to gre@@ et L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization super @-@ fea@@ ther@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanimous decision over former four @-@ division world champion Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er on Saturday on S@@ ho@@ w@@ time , both fighters are members of the top @-@ five p@@ ound @-@ for @-@ p@@ ound list .
Gar@@ cia extended his right hand and said , &quot; Ho@@ w you doing , cha@@ mp ?
best of luck to you . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko defends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 on ES@@ P@@ N .
as the pair posed for pho@@ tos , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko manager E@@ gis Kli@@ mas noted that a potential show@@ down between the fighters would be &quot; perfect siz@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a former fea@@ ther@@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded .
&quot; I moved up for B@@ ron@@ er &#91; at 140 p@@ ounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come down to ligh@@ t@@ weight .
and he &apos;s got to move up to ligh@@ t@@ weight &#91; 135 p@@ ounds &#93; and then we have a fight .
that &apos;s what the f@@ ans are asking for .
let &apos;s give them that . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; Bo@@ xing needs this fight . &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy he has to have L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko fight a 135 @-@ p@@ ound de@@ but b@@ out later this year to set up a date next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , who also has interest in fighting the Jor@@ ge L@@ ina@@ res @-@ Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ l winner following their Se@@ pt . 23 ligh@@ t@@ weight title b@@ out at the Forum .
&quot; this fight could be on pay @-@ per @-@ view because all the f@@ ans have been asking about it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package .
&quot; we &apos;@@ re the main names .
no other names can generate that kind of attention .
whenever they &apos;@@ re ready ... . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreci@@ ates L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko as &quot; a tremendous figh@@ ter , &quot; and may attend his Saturday b@@ out .
but L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko pa@@ used at la@@ vis@@ h praise for Gar@@ cia , saying he thought the three @-@ division champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looked &quot; very slow , sorry M@@ ike@@ y ... you wanted the kno@@ ck@@ out . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show pun@@ ching strength , then box .
they both said they can feel the momentum building for their own b@@ out .
&quot; this is the fight to be made .
no other fight creates as much attention and bu@@ z@@ z .
I &apos;m more than happy to work at it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said .
said L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko : &quot; I &apos;@@ ve wa@@ ited for the top fighters , and this is M@@ ike@@ y .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
what cor@@ ners of the world do people move to Estonia from ?
last year , the Police and Border Guard Board ( PP@@ A ) extended residence permits for a record more than 13@@ ,000 third @-@ country nationals who have mainly travelled to Estonia to pursue work , studies or for family .
for example , last year , it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6,@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , but the year before last the number was 4,@@ 9@@ 28 .
government offices can &apos;t say how many immigrants will end up staying in Estonia permanently , but the Ministry of the Interior is working on such an analysis .
whereas ten years ago , about 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia , this number has been approaching 2,@@ 000 in recent years .
the number of residence permit applicants grew in le@@ aps and boun@@ ds during the Ukrainian crisis <<unk>> in 2014 , 1,@@ 0@@ 87 received a temporary residence permit , 6@@ 75 in the year before that .
according to Statis@@ tics Estonia , the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing the fastest in Estonia <<unk>> last year , 850 more Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia than left .
<<unk>> The Ukrainian community in Estonia has always been big and due to the complicated situation in the country , it &apos;s natural that people look for work and study possibilities in a country where there is a community and many have family members already ahead of them , <<unk>> said Ministry of the Interior press representative Kris@@ tin Ram@@ mus .
last year and the year before last , the number of Ukrainians who have received a temporary residence permit was even greater than the number of Russian citizens , even though more the most temporary residence permits have been issued to the latter during the last ten years .
while Ukrainians come here predominantly to work , Russian citizens come for family migration .
<<unk>> Con@@ sid@@ ering the historical Russian community here , this they have likely the closest family ties to people living in Russia , <<unk>> said A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of Security Sci@@ ences migration research@@ er Hel@@ ina <<unk>> ing .
<<unk>> I@@ f we look at where Russian citizens who have received an Estonian residence permit have settled , Ida @-@ Vir@@ u Coun@@ ty comes right after Har@@ ju Coun@@ ty , <<unk>> she added and noted that 40 per cent of them are mar@@ ried to EU citizens .
last year , 1,@@ 6@@ 96 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit , which is also a record number .
the number of Russians who wished to extend residence permits decreased at the same time .
<<unk>> The ju@@ mp is because instead of extending residence permits , they have applied for a new residence permit for permanently settling in Estonia , <<unk>> said Interior Ministry press representative Ram@@ mus , who said interest among Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has ten@@ ded to be stable for years .
as of last year , foreign nationals who have lived here at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanently settling in Estonia .
the aim is to encourage people who have adjusted to the local situation to stay here .
the residence permit for long @-@ term residents requires five years , for instance .
the new residence permit has probably resulted in decreased exten@@ sions of old residence permits .
for instance , last year such a residence permit was issued to 146 Ukrainians who had lived worked here for at least three years .
now Ukrainians can change their employer and the Estonian state no longer keeps close tab@@ s on whether the salary criterion is fulfilled .
this residence permit became popular at one stro@@ ke <<unk>> applicants last year also included grey passport holders ( 1,@@ 0@@ 29 ) , Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , Indi@@ ans ( 54 ) and Nig@@ eri@@ ans ( 36 ) .
in total , 1,@@ 9@@ 68 people received a residence permit for the purpose of settling in Estonia , also including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and just as many Chinese .
in the first half @-@ year of this year , the total number of such applicants has already reached 1,@@ 2@@ 69 .
in ten years , Nigeria has surpris@@ ingly become the country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for the Estonian residence permit .
whereas in 2007 , three residence permits were issued to Nig@@ eri@@ ans , last year the number was 200 .
people come from Nigeria to study at local universities .
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgi@@ ans , Chinese and Tur@@ ks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen mainly due to study migration .
in their case as well , the rule is that where a community has taken shape ahead of them , others arrive more easily , <<unk>> added Ram@@ mus .
in ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia from , North Korea , and just as many from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 from South Korea , 40 from Indonesia and four from U@@ ru@@ guay .
in a given year , about 6,@@ 000 third @-@ country citizens receive a residence permit , which is about 0.@@ 46 per cent of the population .
even if we include EU citizens in the total , migration will be around 1 per cent , <<unk>> said <<unk>> ing , noting that the numbers are actually small .
in total , according to Statis@@ tics Estonia , 14@@ ,@@ 8@@ 22 people immigra@@ ted to Estonia , and 13@@ ,@@ 7@@ 92 emig@@ rated .
that means that immigration out@@ stri@@ pped emigration for a second year .
most immigrants and emig@@ ran@@ ts are Estonian citizens , but there are more of them among the ones leaving .
for that reason , the migration balance for Estonian citizens was negative 2,@@ 000 last year .
Est@@ oni@@ ans mig@@ rate between Finland and Estonia the most .

the opponents gra@@ b@@ bed 28 offensive re@@ boun@@ ds and got more s@@ cor@@ ing chances because of that .
we we@@ re@@ n &apos;t ready for their aggressive defence or offence .
many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds , we cou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t set up the defence .
they were able to get a hand in the way everywhere while on defence , and our play@@ making was ham@@ pered .
that kno@@ cked us off our feet .
our opponents had done their ho@@ mework better .
M@@ <<unk>> r@@ se@@ pp said Estonia should have committed more f@@ ou@@ ls to ni@@ p the opponents &apos; momentum in the b@@ ud .
in the last quarter as well , we had zero f@@ ou@@ ls but the opponents had already sco@@ red a number of quick bas@@ kets .
Ath@@ le@@ ticism and hus@@ tle , which were our weapon in the t@@ our@@ na@@ ment , now was turned against us .
today we were power@@ less against their aggressive play .
M@@ <<unk>> r@@ se@@ pp said he was satisfied with his charge on the Kal@@ e@@ v squ@@ ad , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s .
at the t@@ our@@ na@@ ment , generally good words can be said about the whole team , to this point we were a united strike force .
it &apos;s too bad that we ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t met such aggressive opponents before
T@@ as@@ s has been self @-@ confident the whole time and he had a strong ou@@ ting today as well , but it seemed he was ti@@ red <<unk>> he had been carrying a pretty heavy burden .
but he made a couple nice moves that I &apos;@@ ve seen before in practices , <<unk>> added the coach .
awful numbers : girls &apos; bas@@ ket@@ ball team held to under 10 points in three quarters at European champi@@ on@@ ship t@@ our@@ na@@ ment <<unk>>
not only the young men &apos;s European champi@@ on@@ ship division B bas@@ ket@@ ball t@@ our@@ na@@ ment is underway in U@@ 18 age class in Tallinn ; the young women started yesterday in Dublin .
and Estonia &apos;s game with Poland ten@@ ded unfortunately to be in the anti @-@ record category .
Estonia lost 65 @-@ 25 , but the score after three quarters was 49 @-@ 9 , meaning that only in the last ten minutes did the opponents take their foot off the gas and s@@ cor@@ ing in that period was even , 16 @-@ 16 .
Estonia sco@@ red 4 points in the first and second quarter and 1 point in the third <<unk>>
the Est@@ oni@@ ans made two of the first four field goal attempts in two minutes , from there on , they missed 25 in a row , then a three @-@ poin@@ ter went in , and then another 21 missed attempts <<unk>>
in other words , they made one out of 47 shot attempts in nearly half an hour .
in addition , 2 points came from four free thro@@ ws .
the number of turno@@ vers during that time was normal , 12 .
by the end of the game , Poland was shooting 33 % from the field ; and Estonia , 13 % ( 9 out of 68 ) .
Estonia started the t@@ our@@ na@@ ment with two losses , having to conce@@ de to Portugal , 83 @-@ 56 , on the opening day .
NATO ships come to Tallinn to re@@ plen@@ ish sto@@ res
today , NATO standing mine Counter@@ measures Group 1 arrived in Tallinn for a weekend port call to re@@ plen@@ ish ships &apos; sto@@ res and prepare for an upcoming exercise .
in the course of the visit , the ships will prepare for returning to sea and will give the crew members a chance for a couple days of shore leave .
after the visit , NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be prepared for future operations to search for historical ord@@ n@@ ance .

it is bigger than any other mus@@ ical theat@@ re in its conventional form .
it &apos;s a festi@@ val whose ma@@ gic gets a hold on you and do@@ es@@ n &apos;t quite ever let go .
because the experience that lis@@ ten@@ ers get in this sub@@ li@@ me and my@@ ste@@ rious environment makes human spiri@@ ts res@@ on@@ ate and touches human sen@@ ses in a way that can &apos;t be described .
Ris@@ to , it is your first year as artistic director of the Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
don &apos;t ma@@ es@@ tro eri K@@ las &apos;s sho@@ es seem a bit big for you ?
naturally but since I had a very personal relationship with eri K@@ las , that has helped me greatly .
he guided me throughout my time as a student and also supported ma at the start of my conducting career .
maybe thanks to this it is easier for me to continue his work .
eri K@@ las has in@@ jected so much good@@ ness into the Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val team and naturally it all spre@@ ads to me as well .
it was great to join a team who knows exactly how things work .
it was eri K@@ las &apos;s big heart that gave me energy to go ahead with Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val in the Tallinn P@@ hil@@ harmon@@ ic .
and here I am now , and I &apos;@@ ll manage !
what might ex@@ cite the public at this year &apos;s festi@@ val , anything special being offered ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and as a surprise the first bal@@ let based on an Astrid L@@ ind@@ gren story will be performed .
it &apos;s <<unk>> Kar@@ l@@ sson F@@ lies <<unk>> .

Ris@@ to , how do you find the energy for everything ?
thanks to my supportive partner , certainly .
this kind of work needs a support system and much love and fortunately I have that in spa@@ des .
and I &apos;@@ ve noticed that my personal emo@@ tions don &apos;t depend so much on other people , as on my own self <<unk>> on how I set out to face each new day .
and this sort of consci@@ ously maintaining one &apos;s tone , staying positive and actually s@@ mil@@ ing at yourself in the mir@@ ror in the morning significantly increased my happ@@ iness quo@@ ti@@ ent .
especially this week , with the most important re@@ hear@@ s@@ als , I have been avi@@ dly prac@@ tising it and works .
S@@ mil@@ ing at yourself stimu@@ lates the brain and improves tone .
it is@@ n &apos;t just empty words .
I think that people don &apos;t know half of the things about their body that the univer@@ se offers them , but I suppose everyone has to discover it little by little .
the big moment is about to come .
do you have any ri@@ tual before the as@@ c@@ end the conduc@@ tor &apos;s po@@ di@@ um ?

it &apos;s a little moment for myself .

new results of Sweden &apos;s asylum age assessment tests released
the latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medic@@ ally assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18 , but not everyone has faith in their accuracy .
Sweden &apos;s national For@@ en@@ si@@ c medicine Agency ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started carrying out the tests earlier year .
they are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Mig@@ ration@@ s@@ ver@@ ket ) was cri@@ tici@@ zed for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be under@@ age .
to date Mig@@ ration@@ s@@ ver@@ ket has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to be tested , and the For@@ en@@ si@@ c medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period between mid March until July 3@@ 1st , 2017 .
Eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged to be 18 or over , while in a further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ si@@ c medicine Agency judged that the subject was &quot; possibly 18 or over . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 . &quot;
the tests are only carried out in cases where the person &apos;s age is in question .
according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son from the For@@ en@@ si@@ c medicine Agency , the results are consistent with previous months .
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics from previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &quot; he told The Local .
the high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum see@@ ker li@@ ed about their age .
in May , the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 instances that &quot; suggest the person examined is 18 years or older . &quot;
when newspaper Sven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 2@@ 43 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year .
the method of medical age assessment , which consists of taking X @-@ ra@@ ys of wisdom teet@@ h and MR@@ I sc@@ ans of kne@@ e jo@@ ints , then having den@@ tists and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts analyse them , has also been criticised in some quarters .
one sceptic is K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute en@@ doc@@ rin@@ olo@@ gist Claude Mar@@ cus , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through pub@@ er@@ ty earlier or later than usual .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve had reason to think about this , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement being used should be .
Jud@@ ging biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we can &apos;t say it for sure we sh@@ ou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t pretend that we can , &quot; he told newspaper Met@@ ro .
the For@@ en@@ si@@ c medicine Agency &apos;s Gö@@ rans@@ son defended the accuracy of the tests however : &quot; in general you can say that the risk of in@@ accurately jud@@ ging a child to be an adult is small .
the biggest risk is if the person is just under 18 , in which case it &apos;s around 10 percent . &quot;

Mr. T@@ ru@@ mp promised earlier a big announcement at the West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a r@@ ally .
Mr. T@@ ru@@ mp won West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a by 42 points , and Justice did not endorse the Democratic n@@ om@@ ine@@ e , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .

Co@@ e pra@@ ises &apos; c@@ andid &apos; Russian apolo@@ gy for doping scandal
global ath@@ le@@ tics b@@ os@@ s S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e praised what he described as a c@@ andid apolo@@ gy from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be read@@ mitted to the sport .
Russia &apos;s ath@@ le@@ tics b@@ os@@ s D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ <<unk>> h@@ tin told an IA@@ AF Congress , held on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships , that his country &apos;s ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .
he said he was sorry to &quot; all ath@@ le@@ tes who have had gold and sil@@ ver med@@ als s@@ nat@@ ched from them at competitions . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in fav@@ or of maintaining the ban , imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) report found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very c@@ andid response today , a very c@@ andid presentation , &quot; IA@@ AF president Co@@ e told repor@@ ters .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recogni@@ zed themselves that they have been through some pretty tor@@ rid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is re@@ engine@@ ered . &quot;
Co@@ e said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to rein@@ state Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we need to do everything over the next few months to norm@@ ali@@ ze this situation .
the guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ le@@ tes from the tain@@ ted system , &quot; he added
N@@ ine@@ teen Russian ath@@ le@@ tes will be competing as neutr@@ als at the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships which start in London on Friday , having met strict IA@@ AF criteria .
the head of the IA@@ AF &apos;s Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for rein@@ statement .
drug @-@ testing was still insufficient and banned co@@ aches were still operating freely , he told repor@@ ters in London after a presentation to the IA@@ AF Council .
the electric car revolution is transforming demand for metals
who are the winners and losers ?
if it was@@ n &apos;t enough that the electric car revolution is transforming everything from the fuel market to infrastructure , it is also creating new winners and losers on the metals market .
although mining gi@@ ants such as G@@ len@@ core can say that they are winning in one area and losing in another , this is of no use to smaller mining companies .
G@@ len@@ core currently makes money on coal and oil , but in future , the demand for co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ kel will grow in the electric car age .
this year , decision by the governments of the United Kingdom , France and Norway have raised the s@@ takes with regard to the spread of electric cars , as they promise to prohibit the sale of fossil fuel powered cars in the decades ahead .
that &apos;s why Vol@@ vo has already announced that they plan to phase out internal combustion engines and T@@ es@@ la will be introducing a cheaper model 3 electric car .
according to B@@ loom@@ berg New Energy Finance , in the next two decades more electric cars will be sold than cars that use pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um @-@ derived fuels .
<<unk>> It will change everything with regard to some metals , <<unk>> Capital Economics commodities analy@@ st Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ ini told B@@ loom@@ berg .
we have already seen a great impact on such metals as co@@ balt and li@@ thi@@ um whose demand has grown for years .
electric cars have about three times more cop@@ per than conventional cars , <<unk>> said G@@ len@@ core .
there is even more cop@@ per in charging stations , which is why Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Pari@@ bas believes it will increase cop@@ per demand by about five per cent by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric car bat@@ teries will mean additional demand for li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ gan@@ ese .
G@@ len@@ core will derive income from the growing electric car trend from the rise in cop@@ per prices , and the fact that it is the world &apos;s biggest co@@ balt producer , the J@@ eff@@ eries Group has forecas@@ ted .
this bro@@ k@@ era@@ ge believes that F@@ ree@@ port @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ tum Min@@ er@@ als will be other winners from the as@@ cen@@ dan@@ cy of electric cars .
the market is already responding to the changing trend .
this year , co@@ balt has already risen 70 per cent in price on the London Me@@ tal Ex@@ change .
last year &apos;s price rise was 37 per cent .
Cop@@ per , too , is up 14 per cent this year , mainly due to economic growth .
G@@ len@@ core shares rose 20 per cent in London , out@@ stri@@ pping ri@@ vals Rio T@@ into Group , B@@ H@@ P B@@ illi@@ ton and Ang@@ lo American in its increase .
on the lo@@ ser &apos;s side , there companies engaged in lead , like Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine , which have to adapt to the new era .
the main end use of lead is in bat@@ teries that provide current to the star@@ ters of petrol and diesel cars .
electric cars use li@@ thi@@ um I@@ ON bat@@ teries .
<<unk>> This is a serious risk to lead demand , unless some other purpose is found for it , that would exceed the decline in demand , <<unk>> said Bank of America Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ ch &apos;s head of me@@ tal market analysis , Michael W@@ id@@ mer .
the effect of the un@@ fur@@ ling trend is@@ n &apos;t showing up yet in lead prices .
lead has increased in price by 17 per cent this year , being the biggest ga@@ in@@ er among industrial metals in London .
investors see problems for the me@@ tal only in the distant future .
<<unk>> I &apos;m not sure that it will be so bad for lead , because cheap oil will keep conventional cars competition , <<unk>> said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the sales director of the me@@ tal bro@@ k@@ era@@ ge Tri@@ land metals .
if lead demand falls , it will happen slowly .
perhaps it will happen in about ten years &apos; time .
for now , the stricter emissions standards mean growing demand for hybrid cars that depend on advanced lead @-@ based bat@@ teries for frequent engine starts , in the esti@@ mation of an international lead and z@@ in@@ c research Organization .
light metals such as alu@@ mini@@ um will replace steel , as a ligh@@ ter car can drive further on less electricity .
the additional 1.6 million tonne alu@@ mini@@ um demand in the years 2013 @-@ 2016 can already be attributed to this .
this makes up 2.7 per cent of the total world alu@@ mini@@ um production .
the trend will likely deepen , says W@@ id@@ mer .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um has increased in price by 13 per cent this year , as growing demand from auto makers has led to a market deficit .
steel producers not as@@ le@@ ep .
ak steel holding is partne@@ red with General Motors for using nanotechnology for manufacturing incredibly light car bodies .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and Ta@@ ta steel Europe are also trying to develop ligh@@ ter steel allo@@ ys to compete with alu@@ mini@@ um .
<<unk>> Ul@@ tras@@ tr@@ ong steel should be the answer to this development , <<unk>> said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Pari@@ bas analy@@ st Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
some success can be seen in Europe .
the end of the oil era can lead to tribu@@ lations for pla@@ tin@@ um as well .
last year , about half of this precious me@@ tal was used for cataly@@ tic conver@@ ters in diesel cars , <<unk>> said me@@ tal re@@ fin@@ er Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ they .
<<unk>> M@@ any commodities in high demand such as oil and pla@@ tin@@ um may not necessarily have high demand in future , <<unk>> said commodities analy@@ st for Na@@ ti@@ x@@ is , Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h .
this do@@ es@@ n &apos;t mean that commodities as a whole will become less important but their importance will change over the next 15 years .
Pla@@ tin@@ um producers believe there will be continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Un@@ core CE@@ O Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg said that in 2025 , sales of hybrid cars will still exceed that of fully electric cars .
Pla@@ tin@@ um producers &apos; big hope in the 10 @-@ year perspective rests with the hydrogen element based cars developed by To@@ y@@ o@@ ta motor and Hy@@ unda@@ i , which depend on pla@@ tin@@ um for producing electricity from hydrogen .
to this point , the technology has not proved its worth commercially .
<<unk>> diesel appears to be the clear lo@@ ser on the way to electric cars , <<unk>> said Br@@ un@@ et from Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Pari@@ bas .
in July , German auto makers experience d a big set@@ back as a S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art court for@@ bade the use of diesel in the home city of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how so@@ cc@@ er &apos;s financial rules impact Ney@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
rules aimed at preventing un@@ f@@ ette@@ red spending by European so@@ cc@@ er clubs will not dis@@ rupt Ney@@ mar &apos;s world @-@ record transfer from Spain &apos;s Barcelona to France &apos;s Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEFA , the governing body over@@ seeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the pres@@ ti@@ gious Cha@@ mpi@@ ons League t@@ our@@ na@@ ment .
financial F@@ air play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PS@@ G will eventually have to show that Ney@@ mar &apos;s transfer was funded without incur@@ ring huge losses .
Barcelona has been paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 2@@ 62 million ) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Ney@@ mar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ney@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly stu@@ mp up the cash to sign Ney@@ mar and add him to a g@@ ala@@ x@@ y of other sta@@ rs , given the team &apos;s funding from the energy @-@ rich ruling family of Q@@ a@@ tar .
clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counter@@ balance that with legitimate sources of income , allowing them to approach break @-@ even on their football @-@ related business .
F@@ F@@ P was conceived by Michel Pla@@ tini after his election as UEFA president in 2007 .
the former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , F@@ F@@ P shifted from focusing on clubs &apos; debts to monitoring their losses instead .
the change meant that the business model Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch initially used at C@@ hel@@ sea in 2003 - buy a club with potential , and then spend heavily to improve the squ@@ ad and build a global brand - become a tougher pro@@ position .
during the current three @-@ year F@@ F@@ P assessment period that runs through 2018 , clubs can inc@@ ur losses of 30 million euros .
and despite Pla@@ tini being ous@@ ted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in is still committed to deter@@ ring excessive spending .
&quot; certainly F@@ F@@ P is not dead and we will , for sure , reinforce the rules going forward , &quot; Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who over@@ sees F@@ F@@ P at UEFA , told The associated Press last week .
although PS@@ G will have paid Ney@@ mar &apos;s bu@@ y@@ out clause in one lu@@ mp sum , it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract .
Ney@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year deal , so the transfer fee could be shown as a 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million @-@ euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years .
the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 saw PS@@ G , along with Abu D@@ ha@@ bi @-@ owned Manch@@ ester City , hit with the hea@@ vi@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G was handed a fine of 60 million euros ( then $ 82 million ) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Cha@@ mpi@@ ons League squ@@ ads to 21 players for the 2014 @-@ 15 season instead of the normal 25 .
UEFA is on the loo@@ k@@ out for clubs who might try to ou@@ tw@@ it its financial regulators by inf@@ lating their income through companies linked to a club &apos;s owners .
while a Q@@ a@@ tari company could spon@@ sor PS@@ G , if the value of the spon@@ sorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income .
that is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Q@@ a@@ tar Tourism Authority spon@@ sorship of PS@@ G was inf@@ lated .
it has been reported that part of Ney@@ mar &apos;s PS@@ G earnings could come via payments from the 20@@ 22 World C@@ up organiz@@ ing committee in Q@@ a@@ tar .
but PS@@ G and Q@@ a@@ tar 20@@ 22 have denied that Ney@@ mar will become a World C@@ up Ambassador and such a man@@ eu@@ ver would be easy for UEFA &apos;s regulators to expose .
past sanctions s@@ lap@@ ped on PS@@ G means that UEFA will be even more watch@@ ful of any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
UEFA has not been in pre @-@ emp@@ tive discussions with PS@@ G about Ney@@ mar &apos;s transfer , people familiar with the situation said Thursday .
they spoke to The associated Press on condition of anon@@ y@@ mity as they were not author@@ iz@@ ed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published accounts show that PS@@ G made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 @-@ 16 on a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published .
PS@@ G expects Ney@@ mar &apos;s arrival to be a b@@ oon for spon@@ sorship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and j@@ er@@ sey sales .
the club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing .
clearly irri@@ tated to see one of so@@ cc@@ er &apos;s biggest players leaving , the Spanish League tried to st@@ y@@ mi@@ e Ney@@ mar &apos;s move , claiming that PS@@ G will be b@@ reaching F@@ F@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; , with the club and the state , &quot; La liga President Javier T@@ eb@@ as told Spanish newspaper AS , referring to Q@@ a@@ tar &apos;s ultimate ownership of PS@@ G .
Ar@@ sen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene W@@ en@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares La liga &apos;s reservations about a state funding a club .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner@@ ships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; W@@ en@@ ger said Thursday .
&quot; once a country ow@@ ns a club , everything is possible .
it becomes very difficult to respect the Financial F@@ air play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country . &quot;

Fif@@ ty years ago today : a storm of hur@@ ric@@ ane magnitude in Estonia , which tore ro@@ of@@ s and win@@ dows off houses
the hur@@ ric@@ ane , called the storm of the century , which ra@@ ged on 6 and 7 August , caused major damage above all in <<unk>> Coun@@ ty , Har@@ ju Coun@@ ty and Rap@@ la Coun@@ ty .
the wind speed in nor@@ th@@ western Estonia on those days was over 30 m / s .
my hus@@ band ran through the gar@@ den from one arching t@@ ree to the next trying to support them by hand .
it was all dark with a ru@@ mbling sound , like the end of the world .
Roo@@ f@@ s were already flying off the houses y@@ on@@ der , recalled an older woman , L@@ inda K@@ uro@@ va of Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ u , in an interview with the magaz@@ ine Eesti Loo@@ dus in 2002 .
L@@ inda &apos;s hus@@ band watched the or@@ ch@@ ard she &apos;@@ d plan@@ ted blow down .
but why try to support trees with your arms , what power do you have against such a storm ?
the storm surge came up to the window , water spra@@ yed in through the win@@ dows , <<unk>> said M@@ s. L@@ inda , who lived on Kal@@ da street in Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ u back then .
like most Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ u residents , only the following morning did L@@ inda see how the roads were full of trees and the ro@@ of of the railway station platform had flo@@ wn 20 @-@ 30 metres away
L@@ oc@@ als said trees behind Par@@ ale@@ pa were bo@@ wed over so that they were tou@@ ching the ground , some were completely fel@@ led , some s@@ na@@ pped in two .
everything looked really horri@@ ble , the storm had ra@@ va@@ ged the beautiful old trees much as a war might have done .
compared to <<unk>> Coun@@ ty , <<unk>> @-@ Vir@@ u Coun@@ ty did not sustain particularly severe damage compared to the August storm of 1967 , but the losses were high there , too , Vir@@ u@@ maa <<unk>> <<unk>> reported in 2007 .
Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ u cas@@ tle park and P@@ ad@@ ise park were wi@@ ped off the face of the earth , but par@@ ks in our area also sustained heavy damage .
in Tallinn , the wind speed was measured at as much as 35 metres per second <<unk>> in other words , about 130 kilometres per hour .
in the M@@ eri@@ <<unk>> part of Tallinn , on 6 August , one tiny sli@@ p of a girl was said to have sh@@ ou@@ ted : <<unk>> mother , mother !
the chic@@ k@@ ens are in the air and can &apos;t come down any@@ more , <<unk>> Vir@@ u@@ maa <<unk>> <<unk>> reported .
the <<unk>> li Man@@ or building in Vil@@ j@@ andi Coun@@ ty was so badly damaged by the storm that it was decided later to ra@@ ze it .
nor did the T@@ ü@@ ri ski ju@@ mp structures survive the August storm ; they were not restored later .
the newspaper Pun@@ ane T@@ <<unk>> t wrote on 12 August 1967 that cleaning up the cities and towns of fallen trees and branches was going slowly , and residents should pit@@ ch in in the clean@@ up work .
Or@@ ch@@ ards also suffered severely in the storm and the newspaper reported that <<unk>> party organiz@@ ations must provide inspiration and guidance in both the clean@@ up and the grain harvest <<unk>> .
a hur@@ ric@@ ane is when the average wind speed exceeds 3@@ 2.7 m / s .
the record for strongest wind gust in Estonia has stood since 2 November 19@@ 69 , when wind at a speed of 48 m / s was measured on Ru@@ h@@ nu Island .
the measurement device on V@@ ain@@ d@@ loo Island broke , and thus the precise speed of the strong wind could not be recorded there .
the secret of clean be@@ aches : n@@ igh@@ tly clean@@ up and poor be@@ ach weather
the c@@ oo@@ ler summer weather means less of a need for cleaning on Tallinn &apos;s be@@ aches .
<<unk>> I@@ f the weather is good , there are people at the be@@ ach , and if it is@@ n &apos;t there are no people , <<unk>> says be@@ ach cleaning person .
Se@@ ag@@ ul@@ ls sh@@ ri@@ ek at S@@ tro@@ omi B@@ each in North @-@ Tallinn .
they get some me@@ lo@@ dic competition from a tra@@ ctor ru@@ mbling in low gear , which is pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing stri@@ pes into the str@@ and .
actually , it is si@@ f@@ ting through the top seven c@@ enti@@ metres of sand to collect sea de@@ br@@ is and rub@@ b@@ ish left by people : bot@@ tle caps , cigarette but@@ ts and other things .
people still come to the be@@ ach regardless of whether the water is warm or not .
if it &apos;s nice weather , people are at the be@@ ach , and if it is@@ n &apos;t , there are no people , <<unk>> says Aleksand@@ r U@@ so@@ v , the head of cleaning operations for the private company Ha@@ ab@@ er@@ sti Hal@@ dus .
it &apos;s 6 : 30@@ am and clean @-@ up on the be@@ ach is in top gear because by eight , he expan@@ se must be in order for the people .
U@@ so@@ v has been on duty since four o &apos;@@ clock .
besides S@@ tro@@ omi , he also wat@@ ches over P@@ iri@@ ta , Har@@ ku La@@ ke , Ka@@ ku@@ mä@@ e and Pal@@ jas@@ saare P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ari be@@ ach .
the amounts of rub@@ b@@ ish have decreased .
years ago , there was a lot more of it .
people are now able to appreciate the good things do@@ e for them , <<unk>> says U@@ so@@ v , who has been cleaning be@@ aches for 15 years .
in the past , if something new was e@@ rec@@ ted , it was broken the next day .
now better care is taken of the things at the be@@ ach .
the price of a clean be@@ ach
one of the biggest jobs at Estonian be@@ aches is cleaning up the marine de@@ br@@ is that was@@ hes ash@@ ore <<unk>> the alga@@ e .
for instance , at P@@ iri@@ ta be@@ ach , 40@@ 0,000 tonnes has to be hau@@ led away each be@@ ach season .
<<unk>> Th@@ at &apos;s an un@@ beli@@ evable amount , <<unk>> notes U@@ so@@ v .
another major category is ordinary waste <<unk>> everything that people leave behind .
the 1.5 @-@ km @-@ long S@@ tro@@ omi be@@ ach str@@ and has eight large <<unk>> sters that need to be emp@@ tied three times a week .
that is how much waste is generated .
still , the c@@ oo@@ ler summer weather has meant that there is one @-@ fifth less waste than otherwise .
a third category is things left behind .
most of them are children &apos;s toys .
as today &apos;s haul , U@@ so@@ v has sho@@ vel@@ led around 10 model cars out of the sand .
they will be placed on the w@@ oo@@ den bo@@ ard@@ walk leading to the be@@ ach , to await their owners .
<<unk>> usually more of them emerge , but this is a normal yield . <<unk>> U@@ so@@ v already knows that soon he will find them in the sand again .
K@@ ids come to the be@@ ach and take the toys so they can bur@@ y them in the sand again .
Ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish is spread around
Ha@@ ab@@ er@@ sti management services representative Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler says that the tra@@ ctor si@@ f@@ ting work is a nu@@ is@@ ance for lo@@ c@@ als .
the noise , which las@@ ts from the night hours to early morning , distur@@ bs the s@@ le@@ ep of the people living in the neighbourhood .
during the day , the work would be impossible .
in one month , the be@@ ach has to be si@@ f@@ ted twice .
<<unk>> I@@ f we don &apos;t do it , the city district will fine us , <<unk>> says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
but the goal is to get an international blue flag for S@@ tro@@ omi , similarly to P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ari and Pär@@ nu .
<<unk>> compared to the rest of Europe , there is a lot more work in Estonia to keep the be@@ aches maintained , <<unk>> says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more sea@@ we@@ ed and stones and it is harder to si@@ ft through the sand .
but we have less tras@@ h on our be@@ aches than elsewhere in Europe .
upon hearing talk of tras@@ h on the be@@ ach , Martin , who lives near S@@ tro@@ omi B@@ each , jo@@ ins the conver@@ sation between the journalist and cleaning workers , noting the current problem areas for the be@@ ach .
in the morning , it &apos;s a dis@@ gus@@ ting scene everywhere .
the problem is with the birds and bot@@ tle colle@@ ctors , who have turned the tras@@ h bags up@@ side down , <<unk>> says Martin .
although it is a difficult pro@@ position to get people to change their behavi@@ ou@@ ral habits , Martin says he hopes the city government will do something about the waste rece@@ p@@ ta@@ cles and perhaps in@@ sta@@ ll li@@ ds to keep the birds from po@@ king around there .
in general , Martin is satisfied with the development of S@@ tro@@ omi B@@ each .
it can be seen that the city is caring for it .
the play@@ grounds , il@@ lu@@ min@@ ated and fresh@@ ly asp@@ hal@@ ted paths have made it more pleasant .
once upon a time , you could rol@@ ler @-@ s@@ kate only on one path , <<unk>> says Martin .
T@@ re@@ asures found at S@@ tro@@ omi : coins , only coins
For@@ ty @-@ year @-@ old D@@ mit@@ ri has come to take advantage of the morning l@@ ul@@ l , comb@@ ing the be@@ ach f@@ rin@@ ge with a me@@ tal dete@@ ctor as a t@@ reas@@ ure hun@@ ter .
he do@@ es@@ n &apos;t think that he will find anything valuable today or in future .
the go@@ ds of the sea are not that generous .
<<unk>> I &apos;@@ ve been doing it for a year and I ha@@ ven &apos;t found anything valuable yet , <<unk>> D@@ mit@@ ri says .
as an ama@@ te@@ ur t@@ reas@@ ure hun@@ ter , D@@ mit@@ ri has in his t@@ reas@@ ure p@@ ou@@ ch a few euro coins , bot@@ tle caps and dangerous na@@ ils , which he later thro@@ ws into the waste b@@ in .
usually it &apos;s coins .
<<unk>> There usually is@@ n &apos;t any gold , r@@ ings and su@@ ch@@ like , <<unk>> the t@@ reas@@ ure hun@@ ter says .
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after la@@ ck@@ lus@@ tre economic growth and easing inflation da@@ m@@ pen@@ ed speculation over a h@@ ike .
the Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squ@@ ee@@ ze on family incomes .
Poli@@ cy@@ makers on the Bank &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee ( MP@@ C ) voted 6 @-@ 2 to keep rates at 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members this month calling for a rise as la@@ ck@@ lus@@ tre economic growth has weakened support for a h@@ ike .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 and cau@@ tioned the squ@@ ee@@ ze on household incomes would continue , with inflation still expected to surge close to 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alled rate hik@@ es will be needed over the next few years to re@@ in in Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets .
Members also voted to withdraw part of the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h economy @-@ boosting package unle@@ as@@ hed a year ago in the aftermath of Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will call time on the term Fun@@ ding Scheme to offer cheap @-@ finance to banks from next February , although it said it was now expected to offer £ 15 billion more under the scheme - at £ 115 billion .
in minutes of the rates decision , the Bank said : &quot; in the MP@@ C &apos;s central forecast , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains slu@@ gg@@ ish in the near @-@ term as the squ@@ ee@@ ze on households &apos; real incomes continues to weigh on consumption . &quot;
on rates , it reiterated that &quot; some tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be needed to c@@ ool inflation and by a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; extent than markets expect .
markets are currently forecas@@ ting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
but the Bank stressed that any hik@@ es would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s downgra@@ ded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9 % and 1.7 % predicted in May .
it maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8 % in 2018 .
Ster@@ ling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news .
the p@@ ound was 0.5 % down at 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the no @-@ change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have da@@ m@@ pen@@ ed moun@@ ting expectations of a h@@ ike , with GDP ed@@ ging up to 0.@@ 3 % in the second quarter from 0.2 % in the previous three months .
growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year , according to the Bank .
its latest inflation report offered little che@@ er for households being hit by so@@ aring inflation and pal@@ try pay rises as it said the squ@@ ee@@ ze will get worse before it gets better .
it added that monetary policy &quot; cannot prevent &quot; the hit to incomes over the next few years , but expects wages will recover &quot; significantly &quot; towards the end of its three @-@ year forecast .
the economy is also set for a boost from sur@@ ging demand for British goods thanks to the weak p@@ ound , which will offset some of the lower consumer spending .
the decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the shock EU referendum vote , which sent the p@@ ound slu@@ mping .
the Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy .
prior to the Bank &apos;s latest rates verdict , there had been growing cla@@ m@@ our for a rate rise as inflation ra@@ mped up pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy@@ makers calling for an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation e@@ ased back to 2.6 % last month from 2.9 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months .
the Bank said the over@@ shoo@@ t relative to its 2 % target was &quot; entirely &quot; down to the weak p@@ ound .
Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , director at Co@@ rec@@ o mortgage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent fall in s@@ wa@@ p rates , the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as len@@ ders cla@@ m@@ our for business and look to end the year in positive fashion .
the market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re @-@ mort@@ ga@@ ges , many with fee @-@ free options as well as low rates , become ever more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10@@ ,000
patients will be able to access a &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ x@@ is ( Pr@@ EP ) , a pil@@ l taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk individuals by around 86 per cent , will now be provided by the health service through an initial three @-@ year trial to an estimated 10@@ ,000 people .
it agreed to fund the trial after the Court of appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year , which said the N@@ HS had the power to pay for Pr@@ EP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it .
the move announced on Thursday was ha@@ iled as a &apos; major new intervention &apos; by N@@ HS England chief executive Simon Ste@@ vens while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &apos; pivotal moment &apos; .
sexual health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ righ@@ ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ pool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to start en@@ rolling people , with more clin@@ ics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018 .
pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ x@@ is ( Pr@@ EP ) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV .
trials have shown Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at @-@ risk of infection .
taking Pr@@ EP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person &apos;s body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold .
such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex .
those eligible for the treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ gender people and those with HIV @-@ positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment .
Clin@@ ics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial , including men , women , trans@@ gender people , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti @-@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people living and registered with a G@@ P in England will also be able to en@@ ro@@ l for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clin@@ ic .
the programme will cost £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
the trial is designed to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted , taken up , and implemented on a large scale .
Mr Ste@@ vens said : &apos; this major new intervention should complement and super@@ charge the wide @-@ ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV .
it &apos;s another milestone in more than three decades &apos; worth of progress in tackling one of humanity &apos;s major health challenges . &apos;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , chief executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if targeted properly at those in need and at risk , offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic .
from September , people at high risk of HIV will have access via this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to an em@@ powering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &apos;
ian Green , chief executive of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Trust , said : &apos; the priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rol@@ led out spe@@ ed@@ ily across the country , and that no @-@ one at risk of HIV is left behind .
now that the Pr@@ EP trial drug has been procu@@ red , we &apos;@@ re well on the way to protecting over 10@@ ,000 people at risk of HIV . &apos;
shadow public health minister Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son said : &apos; the start of the Pr@@ EP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and he@@ el @-@ dra@@ gging by the Government .
the evidence shows just how trans@@ forma@@ tive this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this trial is rol@@ led out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society . &apos;
the price of electricity rose 12 % in Estonian , while it dropped in Latvia and Lithuania .
in July , the difference in the next @-@ day exchange process of power in the Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania bid@@ ding area decrease to 1.@@ 94 euros , compared to 7.@@ 71 euros this June , Ele@@ ring announced .
the main reason for the price difference was faul@@ ts in the Lithuania @-@ Sweden connection .
in Estonia , the average power exchange price of electricity last month shaped up to be 34.@@ 33 euros per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t @-@ hour and the price rose by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five per cent to 3@@ 6.@@ 27 euros per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t @-@ hour .
in Finland , the price was 34.@@ 17 euros and the system price on Nord pool power exchange was 2@@ 6.@@ 37 euros per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t @-@ hour .
prices rose 12 and seven per cent , respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity flow@@ ed to Estonia in 75 % of the hours last month and from Estonia to Finland in 16 % of the hours .
during the remaining nine per cent of the hours , no next @-@ day transactions took place between the two countries .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity flow@@ ed from Estonia to Latvia 99 % of the time and during 73 % of the hours , the entire transmission capacity was in use .
according to the transactions executed on the last trading day in July on the Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X market , the power exchange price electricity may end up being around 34 and in September 37 euros per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t @-@ hour .
the price of carbon dioxide , which impacts the power generation price , rose last month and transactions were conducted at a price of 5.@@ 04 to 5.@@ 47 euros per tonne .
living the high life : me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine floor and cle@@ ver design tri@@ cks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court flat into a spa@@ cious home
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for doing up property , down@@ sized from a large home in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court a@@ partment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of a smart Qu@@ e@@ en Anne ter@@ race - and it is a testa@@ ment to the new design that Jo@@ anne has@@ n &apos;t pac@@ ked her bags and sold on .
&quot; before this , I was living with my ex in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable for my price .
I was shown this a@@ partment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day . &quot;
since the first viewing , the 1,@@ 00@@ 0@@ s@@ q ft flat has had a complete overhaul .
originally a one @-@ be@@ dro@@ om property with a conv@@ olu@@ ted lay@@ out - you had to walk through the kit@@ chen to get to the be@@ dro@@ om - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine to make the most of the generous ceiling he@@ ight .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , big win@@ dows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
to this end , she employed Er@@ fan Az@@ adi of N@@ ot@@ ting hill @-@ based architecture and design stu@@ dio Du@@ ck &amp; shed to exploit the 12.@@ 5@@ ft ceilings and create a home that was@@ n &apos;t only a development but a place for Jo@@ anne to live .
the ceiling was@@ n &apos;t quite ta@@ ll enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine that you could stand up in .
Er@@ fan had to think crea@@ tively to resolve the brief .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to ar@@ range the spaces so that they stac@@ ked on top of each other without ne@@ eding to hun@@ ch down .
it was@@ n &apos;t just building a simple platform , but c@@ ranking the ste@@ els so that they were at the right he@@ ight for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to get two full @-@ he@@ ight rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added dra@@ ma .
for the me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine , a vin@@ tage cop@@ per light window from R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gla@@ mo@@ rous living area below .
M@@ ir@@ ro@@ red gold fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver acc@@ ents and vin@@ tage Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille lighting all set the style for the scheme .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a part in adding theat@@ re , space and light .
a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red at both ends to make it appear longer .
in the kit@@ chen , the mir@@ ro@@ red sp@@ las@@ h@@ back feels like a window to another room .
at the entr@@ ance , mir@@ ro@@ red units provide storage for all Jo@@ anne &apos;s cu@@ tle@@ ry and glas@@ sw@@ are .
giving the perception of a more gla@@ mo@@ rous space , the beau@@ ty of the living room is being able to close off the kit@@ chen when it &apos;s not in use .
Fol@@ da@@ way kit@@ ch@@ ens are nothing new .
what &apos;s unique about this one is that it &apos;s a gar@@ age @-@ style lift @-@ up door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went into that , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered M@@ D@@ F door .
&quot; it &apos;s counter @-@ weigh@@ ted so that when you push the door up , it gli@@ des really easily . &quot;
thanks to cle@@ ver use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne gained an additional 16@@ s@@ q m , an extra be@@ dro@@ om and an improved lay@@ out .
&quot; at the end of the day , floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size . &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its lux@@ uri@@ ous edge .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t fall in love with the electrical fe@@ eds in the walls .
these are important but they don &apos;t pull the heart str@@ ings . &quot;
it goes to show that through good design and increased square me@@ trea@@ ge , a flat can turn from something standard into something quite ama@@ zing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you may choose not to leave .

the only thing that matters for him is how much he ear@@ ns , and all ethical considerations fall by the wa@@ y@@ side .
he sees his wife and three ki@@ ds only early in the morning and late at night .
in the first half of the film , it occurs to me that it is a business @-@ world version of House of cards <<unk>> K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r even have a similar manner of speaking .
as the film we@@ ars on , the less of the House @-@ of @-@ cards element there is and the mor@@ alistic intentions of the film @-@ makers start becoming more evident .
a life @-@ changing experience is when the lead character &apos;s son is diagno@@ sed with cancer .
now he has to make a choice between work and family life .
on wal@@ ks to the Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s tow@@ ering buildings , his son , who dre@@ ams of an archite@@ ct &apos;s profession , makes his father think about what really matters , like faith , good@@ ness , love <<unk>> even the twin T@@ ow@@ ers attack is not neglected .
after the third scene , where the son opens his father &apos;s eyes , one gets a feeling that the film @-@ makers have set out to make a te@@ ar@@ j@@ er@@ ker , because even the hardest heart in the audience won &apos;t be able to hold back the te@@ ars upon seeing the ad@@ orable cancer @-@ stric@@ ken bo@@ y &apos;s suffering .
when the son falls into a com@@ a and his case seems nearly hope@@ less , the father finally re@@ ali@@ zes the am@@ or@@ ality of his work and does a good de@@ ed for an old man who is looking for a job .
now I have a bet I make with myself <<unk>> if a film has a happy ending , I reward myself with a coff@@ ee after the mo@@ vie , but if I &apos;m wrong , then at least the scre@@ en@@ writer can be praised for a surprise .
for a second , it seems I will go coff@@ ee @-@ less <<unk>> when his spo@@ use calls dane from the hospital and he runs toward the hospital room down the hal@@ l@@ way in slow motion .
the son has made a mira@@ cul@@ ous recovery , however , and although his father has just lost his job , that , too , proves positive , for now he has time to spend with his family .
it &apos;s a feel @-@ good moment for me , too <<unk>> I &apos;m getting pretty good at predi@@ cting the end@@ ings of American dra@@ mas !
truth be told , the film is very well constructed , all the requisite elements are there .
Lau@@ ghter , te@@ ars , the actors are good , and there &apos;s a good moral to the story : money &apos;s not the most important thing in life .
the film will no doubt do well at the box office .
T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president &apos;s media diet .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F@@ . Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President T@@ ru@@ mp - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the b@@ os@@ s on a more even keel .
here &apos;s a bit from repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when new White House Chief of Staff John F@@ . Kelly hu@@ d@@ dled with senior staff on his first day at work , he outlined a key problem in President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s White House that he planned to fix : bad information getting into the president &apos;s hands .
Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in bri@@ e@@ fin@@ gs - because the president would make better decisions if given good information . &quot;
Kelly &apos;s diagnosis makes perfect sense , but others have tried and failed to tame T@@ ru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
President T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he &apos;s in the White House , his TV @-@ watching ha@@ bit is still going strong .
&quot; if candidate T@@ ru@@ mp was upset about unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from ou@@ tle@@ ts that were persu@@ a@@ dable , &quot; S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , a former campaign advis@@ er , told Poli@@ tic@@ o in February .
Poli@@ tic@@ o &apos;s tara Pal@@ <<unk>> wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s Twitter ha@@ bit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise . &quot;
O@@ kay .
but the idea that T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s Twitter ha@@ bit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is la@@ ug@@ hable .
maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don &apos;t - that T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s t@@ we@@ ets would have been even more inf@@ lam@@ matory if not for their interventions .
we &apos;@@ ll probably never know about t@@ we@@ ets that T@@ ru@@ mp di@@ d@@ n &apos;t send .
if his staff@@ ers managed to him out of trouble even a few times , then their efforts were worthwhile .
but no one has been able to consistently prevent T@@ ru@@ mp from sti@@ r@@ ring up controversy .
part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing fac@@ tions , people in@@ vari@@ ably try to advance their agendas by presenting T@@ ru@@ mp with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their world@@ views .
Poli@@ tic@@ o - all over this story - reported in May on advis@@ ers &apos; pen@@ chan@@ ts for strategically feeding dubious information to the president .
this was one example , described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher :
&quot; current and former T@@ ru@@ mp officials say T@@ ru@@ mp can react volcan@@ ically to negative press cli@@ ps , especially those with damaging le@@ aks , becoming en@@ gro@@ s@@ sed in finding out where they origin@@ ated .
that is what happened in late February when someone mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article from G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com , the website of Internet provo@@ ca@@ te@@ ur Charles C. Joh@@ n@@ son , which accused Deputy chief of staff Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh of being &apos; the source behind a bun@@ ch of le@@ aks &apos; in the White House .
no matter that Joh@@ n@@ son had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lob@@ bed false accusations in the past and rec@@ an@@ ted them .
T@@ ru@@ mp read the article and began asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that then @-@ chief of staff Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us and White House staff Secretary Ro@@ b Por@@ ter &quot; have tried to implement a system to manage and document the pa@@ per@@ work T@@ ru@@ mp receives . &quot;
how &apos;@@ d that work out ?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing , three months later .
perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but T@@ ru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his a@@ ides are still v@@ ying for influence .
those im@@ mu@@ table factors will make Kelly &apos;s mission very difficult .
foreign street mus@@ ici@@ ans in Tallinn not it@@ ching to obtain bus@@ king permit .
many foreigners bus@@ k in the city centre of Tallinn .
the ones Õ@@ h@@ <<unk>> ht spoke to said admitted they were bus@@ king in the old town without the city government permit .
first , we found three street mus@@ ici@@ ans near the Vir@@ u gates . they had just as many do@@ gs with them .
it could be clearly see that the dread@@ locked mus@@ ici@@ ans we@@ aring ri@@ pped clothing were back@@ pac@@ ker va@@ g@@ ab@@ on@@ ds who would really benefit from a sho@@ wer .
in spite of their appearance , the only woman in the group played a tune with a j@@ olly r@@ hy@@ th@@ m on the accor@@ di@@ on , while one of the men ju@@ gg@@ led three bal@@ ls and be@@ c@@ kon@@ ed to pas@@ ser@@ s@@ by .
the third man next to them was sitting on a back@@ pack and cal@@ mly smoking a hand @-@ rol@@ led cigarette .
their three do@@ gs were un@@ fa@@ zed by the pas@@ ser@@ s@@ by .
No@@ emi , the one playing the accor@@ di@@ on , and Bo@@ b the ju@@ gg@@ ler said that they bus@@ ked for fu@@ n as well as for the money .
they were trying to raise enough money to buy tickets for a ship sa@@ iling to Finland the same evening .
asked whether they applied for a permit for bus@@ king in the old town , No@@ emi and Bo@@ b shoo@@ k their heads .
first of all , we di@@ d@@ n &apos;t know .
secondly , we &apos;@@ re never in one city for longer than a day or two and generally permits are handed out for a month or the like .
there &apos;s no point in paying for that , <<unk>> said Bo@@ b .
when we found ourselves by the Vir@@ u gates once again about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women had approached the mus@@ ici@@ ans and were telling them to move along .
the group with back@@ pac@@ ks and do@@ gs moved on to the Vir@@ u Kes@@ kus crossing to try their luck .
three young Polish men were also bus@@ king on Vir@@ u street , one of whom was playing the vi@@ olin , another the c@@ lar@@ <<unk>> and a third had even hau@@ led out an electronic pi@@ ano .
<<unk>> We &apos;@@ re here to offer people enter@@ tainment , to spread music and joy and to make money for gas and living expenses , <<unk>> explained M@@ iv@@ os@@ h , the pi@@ anist .
M@@ iv@@ os@@ h said they were aware they had to apply for a permit from city government .
<<unk>> O@@ f course we don &apos;t have that , <<unk>> he said in a light @-@ hear@@ ted manner .
but we hope that if people enjoy our music , then there won &apos;t be a problem .
naturally , if the police come , we will go elsewhere , but we have to try , <<unk>> he added .
in July , Bank of Estonia bought 149 million euros in bonds as part of the central banks &apos; government asset programme , and the central bank &apos;s bond portfolio grew to a total of 4.@@ 36 billion euros .
the central bank is not rele@@ asing more details on the purchases .
Bank of Estonia President ardo H@@ ans@@ son had previously explained in response to an inter@@ pel@@ lation from M@@ Ps that Eurozone central banks &apos; asset purchase programme encom@@ passes three different buying programmes : covered bonds , asset backed securities ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public sector purchase programme ( PS@@ PP ) .
the central bank bu@@ ys up bonds on the market , to encourage the investors who sold the bonds to invest money elsewhere .
as an effect of the purchases the yield of low @-@ risk assets decrea@@ ses , and this moti@@ vates investors to take bigger risks .
in general , in the context of the public sector bond purchase programme , each central bank bu@@ ys its own government bonds , other countries &apos; bonds are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Bank of Estonia ex@@ ec@@ utes what are called substitute purchases in the amount allocated to it .
Central banks also make substitute purchases in countries with a limited supply of the bonds con@@ forming to the purchase programme .
H@@ ans@@ son said Bank of Estonia generally bu@@ ys the bonds of European institutions , such as the bonds of the EFSF and the EIB .
the Bank of Estonia has been purchased bonds as part of the asset purchase programme since March 2015 .
in the interim , Ele@@ ring bonds were purchased , but as of June 2016 , the Bank of Estonia no longer bu@@ ys Ele@@ ring bonds .
the Finnish central bank bu@@ ys both Ele@@ ring and Eesti Ener@@ gia bonds on behalf of the Eurozone &apos;s central banks .
travellers negotiate tr@@ en@@ ch , return to &apos; Mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e &apos;s ro@@ w@@ &apos;
some of the West Mid@@ lands &apos; weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners are again at lo@@ gg@@ er@@ heads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council @-@ du@@ g tr@@ en@@ ch to rec@@ lai@@ m a field outside their man@@ sions .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ a@@ vans in a field outside a prosperous street of So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l du@@ b@@ bed &apos; mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e &apos;s row &apos; .
bringing hor@@ ses , babies and an army of vans , they have returned after being k@@ ic@@ ked out only in May , un@@ deter@@ red by a mo@@ at du@@ g by the council to prevent their incur@@ sions .
the tac@@ tful group found a gap in the def@@ ences , squ@@ ee@@ zing their vehicles though a section left un@@ barri@@ ca@@ ded to accommodate a path@@ way .
F@@ uri@@ ous residents have sa@@ va@@ ged So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Council saying it was &apos; useless at dealing with the problem &apos; .
one anon@@ ymous resident said : &apos; they moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath where they were throwing ro@@ cks at pas@@ sers by .
the council needs to be sha@@ med into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and now they are back again .
more arrived last night , probably even more today . &apos;
she added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m council knows how to deal with this by getting long in@@ jun@@ ctions to protect their par@@ ks .
I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can &apos;t even stop this . &apos;
one local resident who did not wish to be named said : &apos; it is ridiculous , we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving , only to be b@@ ligh@@ ted by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen gra@@ zing on the par@@ k@@ land . &apos;
a spokes@@ woman for So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Council said : &apos; we are aware of an un@@ authorised en@@ ca@@ mp@@ ment on land off Stre@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k Road and working alongside So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Police , we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible .
to support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .
this helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them . &apos;
culture Minister In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar is one of the atten@@ de@@ es at the weekend F@@ esti@@ val and says he is glad that true world head@@ lin@@ ers are playing in Estonia .
in response to the question of why the weekend festi@@ val is so important for Est@@ oni@@ ans , he said that the question should be asked of all those who are enjoying every aspect of the festi@@ val for three days in a row .
but he does admit the true top cal@@ ib@@ re performers have arrived in Pär@@ nu .
<<unk>> Loo@@ king at the level of artists that they &apos;@@ ve managed to bring to Estonia , these are the absolute top names in the mus@@ ical gen@@ re <<unk>> that do@@ es@@ n &apos;t often happen in these parts , <<unk>> says the minister of culture .
which of the artists performing at the festi@@ val res@@ on@@ ate with Sa@@ ar most ?
I consider myself a fairly old person and for older fol@@ ks like myself one of the artists we &apos;@@ ve had the most experience with is Ar@@ min van B@@ uu@@ re@@ n , who took the stage yesterday evening .

Au@@ di to modify U@@ p to 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles as Car@@ makers face Bac@@ klas@@ h
a day before Au@@ di &apos;s announcement , B@@ M@@ W said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the B@@ M@@ W chairman said the company believed &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; referring to the European cities - including Munich , where B@@ M@@ W is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the moves as recalls .
European car@@ makers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen ox@@ ides that diesel engines emit are considered carcino@@ gens , and can cause as@@ th@@ ma .
the cost to automotive companies of instal@@ ling equipment to neutr@@ ali@@ ze the fu@@ mes em@@ itted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
as German auto@@ makers face scrutiny , the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of co@@ d@@ dling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , which covered up its use of so @-@ called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested , but ease back in normal driving conditions .
several Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen execu@@ tives have been charged in the United States , and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mo@@ dynamics at Au@@ di &apos;s engine development department was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o , is Italian , and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States .
early this year , Au@@ di was swe@@ pt up into a German criminal investigation involving Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen after the authorities accused Au@@ di of instal@@ ling a system to evade emissions rules in Europe , broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Au@@ di in the investigation could weigh heavily on Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen : the luxury car@@ mak@@ er accounts for a disproportionate share of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen &apos;s profit .
European Union flags will be purchased for Estonian schools for 20@@ ,000 euros .
the Ministry of Education plans to buy European flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
a total of 5@@ 70 educational institutions will receive European Union flags measuring 105 x 15@@ 8 CM .
the flags are intended for dis@@ playing ; they must be executed in quality printing technique with tunnel fas@@ tening , ER@@ R news reports .
the flag@@ pole label bears a text : <<unk>> Gi@@ ft to Estonian schools for recogni@@ zing the first Estonian presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of the 5@@ 70 flags is put by the Ministry of Education at € 20@@ ,000 . in other words , one flag costs € 35 .
a journalist &apos;s murder under@@ sco@@ res growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce normally meets on Wednes@@ days to review their plans for coverage of the most recent may@@ he@@ m w@@ rought in Sin@@ al@@ oa state by organiz@@ ed crime , corrupt officials and cease@@ less drug wars .
but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they &apos;@@ ve come together to talk about security .
it &apos;s important to change their rou@@ tin@@ es , they are told .
two senior journalists discuss what feels safer : to take their children with them to the office , which was the target of a g@@ ren@@ ade attack in 2009 , or to leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a black@@ board at the front of the room : ad@@ vers@@ aries , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to suggest names for each c@@ olu@@ mn - no proof is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are enough .
there are drug @-@ traffickers , politicians , busines@@ spe@@ ople , journalists suspected of being on the pay@@ roll of the government or the car@@ tels , a catalo@@ g of villa@@ ins who make the job of covering Mexico &apos;s chaos per@@ il@@ ous .
there is no res@@ pi@@ te from the violence , and as bodies pi@@ le up across the country , more and more of them are journalists : at least 25 since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to took office in December 2012 , according to the Committee to protect journalists ; 5@@ 89 under federal protection after attacks and threats ; and so far this year , at least seven dead in seven states .
among the latest is their edit@@ or and inspiration , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce co @-@ foun@@ der Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on nar@@ co @-@ violence .
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is everywhere - a large pho@@ to of Val@@ dez dis@@ playing his middle finger , with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; han@@ gs on the fac@@ ade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building ; two repor@@ ters on their 30@@ s , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , wear T @-@ shir@@ ts that display his s@@ mil@@ ing , b@@ espe@@ c@@ ta@@ cled face or his trade@@ mark Pana@@ ma hat .
the work@@ shop takes place less than two months after his death ; the repor@@ ters discuss their shared trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ ma@@ res , in@@ s@@ om@@ nia , paran@@ o@@ ia .
although a special federal Prosecutor &apos;s office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists &apos; cases , it has only prosecuted two , according to the Committee to protect journalists .
as with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organiz@@ ed crime each year , the kil@@ lers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they persist in covering the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , though they are heart@@ broken , though the ter@@ rain is more tre@@ ac@@ he@@ rous now .
without information on the kil@@ lers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security , says I@@ bar@@ ra , is of little use .
&quot; it &apos;s very fo@@ ol@@ ish to waste my time in this work@@ shop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , you dis@@ trust everyone . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ rol@@ la was stopped by two men ; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times , presu@@ ma@@ bly for the name of the paper - which trans@@ lates as T@@ wel@@ f@@ th River .
the gun@@ man dro@@ ve away in his car and cras@@ hed it ne@@ ar@@ by .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
Ru@@ mor@@ s tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there &apos;s practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa has been one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ di@@ est bat@@ tle@@ grounds as ri@@ val fac@@ tions fight to fill the vacuum .
never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sin@@ al@@ oa , or that the ce@@ me@@ tery is filled with or@@ na@@ te , two @-@ story ma@@ us@@ ole@@ ums for drug k@@ ings , larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that a state of &quot; calm &quot; is when just one car@@ tel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug @-@ trafficking routes to the United States .
despite that , and the fact that Val@@ dez was in@@ timately aware of the per@@ ils of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , 60 , a co @-@ foun@@ der and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , is w@@ ra@@ cked with guilt for failing to protect his friend .
he believes two errors contributed to the killing .
first there was the publication in February of an interview with D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z , a leader of one of the ri@@ val car@@ tel fac@@ tions at war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
the piece may have an@@ gered the sons ; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to news@@ stands .
the second mistake was not forcing Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own safety after the seiz@@ ure of another newspaper that carried the same story .
Val@@ dez was a leg@@ end in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexic@@ an violence against journalists .
he &apos;@@ d survi@@ ved for so long , his friends and colleagues assumed he &apos;@@ d always be there .
he was a ve@@ tera@@ n repor@@ ter for No@@ ro@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling $ 50 shares .
in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; it was impossible to do journ@@ alism without tou@@ ching the nar@@ co issue , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage , and sales and advertising increased .
Re@@ por@@ ters lo@@ ved being able to publish hard @-@ hitting investigations without fear of censorship , and read@@ ers were fasc@@ inated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else da@@ red to cover .
eight years after Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was founded , it won the pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ abo@@ t award for coverage in Latin America .
that same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexic@@ an drug story wherever it led .
he freely acknowledged that he was frigh@@ tened .
&quot; I want to carry on living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
drug trafficking in Sin@@ al@@ oa &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October , in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV .
&quot; you have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play du@@ mb .
I don &apos;t want to be asked , &apos; What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why di@@ d@@ n &apos;t you say what was going on ? &apos; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce staff mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the jo@@ kes@@ ter who s@@ wor@@ e like a long@@ sho@@ re@@ man , the friend generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they reli@@ ed on his rou@@ tine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would go to El Gua@@ y@@ ab@@ o , the bar across from the office , and would always sit at the same table .
now , they ask : was his love of rou@@ tine his down@@ fall ?
his death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you mess with their women , their children , their clean businesses , their c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine air@@ stri@@ ps &quot; used to move drugs .
&quot; those things were off @-@ limits , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best of times , a high @-@ level of self @-@ censorship and self @-@ preservation .
T@@ rus@@ ting one &apos;s in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
if it s@@ mel@@ ls wrong , stay away .
the trouble , said Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce edit@@ or And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ real , is that &quot; sme@@ ll is a sense that can be foo@@ led ... and then the thing with Javier happened . &quot;
the old rules , he and others say , no longer apply in Sin@@ al@@ oa - just as they don &apos;t in Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ ro and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lu@@ cra@@ tive smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape constantly shif@@ ts .
in the room where Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce staff met for security training , suddenly no cell@@ phones were allowed ; days before , it was revealed that sp@@ y@@ ware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two police officers sought relief from the 104 @-@ degree ( 40 Cel@@ si@@ us ) heat in the sha@@ de of a t@@ ree .
they were assigned by the state government to guard Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s offices , ho@@ used in a four @-@ story building in a middle @-@ class neigh@@ bor@@ hood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half @-@ jo@@ k@@ ingly , some of the repor@@ ters won@@ dered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of c@@ ops whom the govern@@ or himself has said are not trus@@ t@@ worthy .
it has been months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountainous countryside , where the drug gan@@ gs are in de facto control .
for this week &apos;s edition Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was looking at three main stories .
there was the killing of former bo@@ xing great Ju@@ li@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez &apos;s bro@@ ther in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the govern@@ or &apos;s home@@ town .
and there was a group kidna@@ pping in one of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s most expensive restaur@@ ants , a block from the Prosecutor &apos;s office .
there was no official word on who was abduc@@ ted or how it happened , so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaur@@ ant is a fav@@ or@@ ite of both drug traffickers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaur@@ ant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party , or PR@@ I , which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century .
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors have been accused of corruption in high @-@ profile cases .
Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about prior incidents in that lo@@ c@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man esca@@ ped a military raid .
just months before , read@@ ers would have looked to Val@@ dez &apos;s c@@ olu@@ mn for the best @-@ s@@ our@@ ced information about the kidna@@ pping .
&quot; before , we would have already known what happened , &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , nic@@ k@@ named &quot; El Fla@@ co &quot; for his s@@ len@@ der build .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office has been re@@ pur@@ posed as a storage room for signs and stic@@ kers protesting journalist killings , as staff have become something they never expected to be : activists on behalf of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez gra@@ b@@ bed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local Prosecutor &apos;s office over yet another journalist .
Salvador A@@ dame disappeared in the western state of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an three days after Val@@ dez was killed .
a bur@@ ned body has been discovered and officials say it is his , based on DNA tests .
Na@@ tion@@ wide , journalists have become more vo@@ cal , scra@@ w@@ ling &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on side@@ wal@@ ks and buildings in organiz@@ ed protests .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington , trying to r@@ ally international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the govern@@ or of Sin@@ al@@ oa the day after Val@@ dez was killed , Ra@@ mi@@ rez accused authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth .
she has since asked to be reas@@ signed from covering the government , concerned that her anger has hur@@ t her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are &quot; surrounded &quot; by organiz@@ ed crime , compli@@ cit government officials and an indifferent society .
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are being killed not just by drug gan@@ gs but on the order of politicians and security forces in ca@@ hoo@@ ts with organiz@@ ed crime .
the media watch@@ dog group Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want to shut you up , &quot; Ra@@ mi@@ rez said .
clearly , the murders have a chil@@ ling effect .
no one for@@ gets the death six years ago of blo@@ g@@ ger Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ lip@@ as .
her body was found along with a note pur@@ porte@@ dly signed by the Z@@ e@@ tas car@@ tel : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer ke@@ y@@ board and head@@ phones lay next to her se@@ vered head .
some ou@@ tle@@ ts have opted to close , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te , in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , after the killing of correspon@@ dent Miro@@ sla@@ va breach in March .
others keep going , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do did following the killing of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z addressed the drug car@@ tels publicly with a front @-@ page edit@@ orial ti@@ tled , &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home states or even the country .
it &apos;s a w@@ ren@@ ching decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still s@@ can the streets , looking for danger .
and sometimes , they are hun@@ ted down , as apparently was photo@@ graph@@ er Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City a@@ partment three months after fleeing Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it &apos;s a daily dance of high @-@ risk decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra - who once wanted to be a po@@ et - ad@@ mits that covering the drug trade sca@@ res him .
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
at mid@@ night on a recent Friday , with the latest issue already put to bed , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce ed@@ itors sat on the side@@ walk outside the office , drinking be@@ er , when all at once , their phones began to bu@@ z@@ z .
a series of shoo@@ tou@@ ts involving gang ri@@ vals and security forces near the be@@ ach resort city of Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as was promised by a series of car@@ tel messages discovered in the area .
from the curb , via cell@@ phone , they put the news up on Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s website .
the front page would have to be changed the next day .
S@@ ir@@ ens wa@@ iled ne@@ ar@@ by - another sh@@ oot@@ out in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez g@@ lan@@ ced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert .
if they were at all afraid , they di@@ d@@ n &apos;t show it .
Bene@@ ath the massive portra@@ it of their newspaper &apos;s fallen foun@@ der , his middle finger displayed for all of Sin@@ al@@ oa to see , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was following in his foot@@ steps .
&quot; how can you even think of closing , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said , &quot; when the same day Javier was killed the inter@@ n asked me to send her out to report on the street ? &quot;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur used cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ge to evade its enemies
at first g@@ lance , it looks like a statu@@ e albeit a terri@@ fying one .
now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible r@@ hin@@ o @-@ sized crea@@ ture found by a Canadian min@@ er were so well preserved experts have described it as &apos; the Mon@@ a lisa of din@@ osa@@ urs &apos; .
it was so well preserved , they were even able to determine the colour of its sc@@ al@@ y sk@@ in was a red@@ dish Brown - and say it had something of a &apos; trou@@ bled past &apos; .
the report in the Journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology described it as &apos; the best @-@ preserved ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osa@@ ur ever found , and one of the best din@@ osa@@ ur speci@@ mens in the world . &apos;
the fossil is a new@@ found species of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur , which lived mid@@ way through the C@@ reta@@ ce@@ ous period , between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
it &apos;s incredible well preserved state has s@@ tun@@ ned researchers , who describe it as &apos; truly remar@@ ka@@ ble@@ &apos;
the ar@@ m@@ oured plant @-@ ea@@ ter is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found , according to reports in National geographic .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was dig@@ ging at the Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine near For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in northern Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
he hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding ro@@ ck , and decided to take a closer look .
the fossil he un@@ covered was sent to the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell M@@ use@@ um of Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology .
they spent the next six years working on un@@ covering the be@@ ast within the 2,@@ 500 @-@ p@@ ound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) lu@@ mp of earth .
after all that hard work , the finished result is now ready to be unve@@ iled .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you just squ@@ int your eyes a bit , you could almost believe it was s@@ lee@@ ping , &apos; said lead author Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , a scien@@ tist at the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell M@@ use@@ um where the crea@@ ture is on display .
&apos;@@ It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osa@@ ur speci@@ mens - the Mon@@ a lisa of din@@ osa@@ urs . &apos;
by studying its sk@@ in , researchers found that this plant @-@ ea@@ ter , though covered in ar@@ m@@ or and rese@@ mbling a wal@@ king tan@@ k , likely faced a significant threat from meat @-@ eating din@@ osa@@ urs .
the heavily ar@@ m@@ oured din@@ osa@@ ur used red and white cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ge to hide from pre@@ da@@ tors , and employed a shi@@ el@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ sha@@ ding , which is also used by many modern @-@ day animals .
this would have allowed it to better b@@ lend into its surroun@@ dings and evade its enemies , experts say , suggesting it was pre@@ yed on by larger din@@ osa@@ urs .
the 110 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old crea@@ ture , part of the no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur family , first hit head@@ lines in May and is now on view at the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell M@@ use@@ um of P@@ alae@@ on@@ t@@ ology .
researchers have now studied and named the be@@ ast Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ chel@@ li after muse@@ um techni@@ cian mark Mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours pain@@ stak@@ ingly un@@ covering it .
the ama@@ zing preservation of the speci@@ men made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pat@@ tern and shape of sc@@ ales and ar@@ m@@ our across its body .
they discovered counter@@ sha@@ ding , a common method of defence in the animal Kingdom , which means the top of the crea@@ ture was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although counter@@ sha@@ ding is common , the findings come as surprise because Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta &apos;s size far exceeds that of counter@@ sha@@ ded animals alive today .
it suggests the din@@ osa@@ ur was hun@@ ted by enough pressure meat @-@ eating din@@ osa@@ urs that evolution favoured conce@@ al@@ ment over confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that have counter@@ sha@@ ding -- think de@@ er , z@@ eb@@ ras or ar@@ mad@@ il@@ los -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as pre@@ y , sign@@ aling that this no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur faced a real struggle to survive .
&apos;@@ S@@ tr@@ ong pre@@ dation on a massive , heavily @-@ ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osa@@ ur illustrates just how dangerous the din@@ osa@@ ur pre@@ da@@ tors of the C@@ reta@@ ce@@ ous must have been , &apos; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds in its sc@@ ales also reveal that the din@@ osa@@ ur &apos;s sk@@ in would have been red@@ dish Brown .
scientists are continuing to study the animal for clu@@ es about its life , including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last me@@ al .
they believe that when the din@@ osa@@ ur died , it fell into a river and was swe@@ pt out to sea , where it san@@ k on its back to the ocean floor .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as south F@@ l@@ ori@@ da is today , and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now .
&apos;@@ This no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved sc@@ al@@ y sk@@ in , yet is also preserved in three dimensions , retaining the original shape of the animal , &apos; said Brown .
&apos;@@ The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the E@@ arly C@@ reta@@ ce@@ ous .
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to recon@@ stru@@ ct it ; if you just squ@@ int your eyes a bit , you could almost believe it was s@@ lee@@ ping . &apos;
the C@@ reta@@ ce@@ ous was a time when gi@@ ant the@@ ro@@ po@@ ds , meat @-@ eating din@@ osa@@ urs that stood on two leg@@ s , ro@@ a@@ med the Earth .
although the king of them all , Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , the ar@@ m@@ oured din@@ osa@@ ur may have been hun@@ ted by some of its for@@ mi@@ dable an@@ ces@@ tors .
they include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ sa@@ ur@@ us , a 38@@ ft ( 11.@@ 5@@ m ) long mon@@ ster weigh@@ ing six tonnes .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the Journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , believe Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta was was@@ hed out to sea after it died and mu@@ m@@ mi@@ fied in mud .
the crea@@ ture was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was dig@@ ging at the Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine near For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in northern Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the muse@@ um , it is the best preserved ar@@ m@@ oured din@@ osa@@ ur in the world , including sk@@ in and ar@@ m@@ our , and is complete from the s@@ n@@ out to hips .
the crea@@ tures were around 18 feet ( five metres ) long on average , and weigh@@ ted up to 3,@@ 000 p@@ ounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it fea@@ tured two 20 @-@ in@@ ch @-@ long s@@ pik@@ es which pro@@ tru@@ ded from its shoulders .
the researchers believe that the this ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ ea@@ ter lu@@ mbered through what is now western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river swe@@ pt it into open sea .
but the din@@ osa@@ ur &apos;s under@@ sea bu@@ ri@@ al preserved its ar@@ m@@ or in ex@@ qu@@ isite detail .
the fos@@ si@@ lised remains of this particular speci@@ men are so well preserved that rem@@ nan@@ ts of sk@@ in still cover bu@@ mp@@ y ar@@ m@@ our pla@@ tes along the din@@ osa@@ ur &apos;s s@@ ku@@ ll .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National geographic , such level of preservation &apos; is a rare as winning the l@@ ot@@ tery .
the more I look at it , the more mind @-@ bo@@ gg@@ ling it becomes .
F@@ os@@ sili@@ zed rem@@ nan@@ ts of sk@@ in still cover the bu@@ mp@@ y ar@@ m@@ or pla@@ tes d@@ ot@@ ting the animal &apos;s s@@ ku@@ ll .
its right fo@@ ref@@ oo@@ t lies by its side , its five dig@@ its s@@ played up@@ ward .
I can count the sc@@ ales on its sole . &apos;
how one activist came to learn the answer to the question : &apos; whose streets ? &apos;
on A@@ ug@@ . 9 , 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll was shak@@ en to her core .
just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip , the St@@ . Louis native sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b she was ren@@ ting , sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stu@@ m@@ bled upon a post from someone from high school .
&quot; the police just killed an 18 year old kid and he &apos;s still laying in the street , &quot; it read .
confused , notic@@ ing no one else on her feed had posted the information , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ P@@ <<unk>> ah was being constantly ret@@ wee@@ ted onto her time@@ line .
the St@@ . Louis @-@ area rap@@ per was live @-@ t@@ we@@ eting the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old killed by a white police officer in Fer@@ gus@@ on , mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lif@@ eless body stret@@ ched out in the street , where it would stay for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; Ferre@@ ll thought to herself .
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she put down her phone only to return later that evening to t@@ we@@ ets about people gathering on Can@@ field drive .
there were pho@@ tos of police tape and people y@@ el@@ ling , and of a Guy claiming to be Brown &apos;s father holding a sign that read , &quot; Fer@@ gus@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of prote@@ sters with a bar@@ king dog .
in another video , a different COP , she said , co@@ cked his ri@@ f@@ le and sc@@ reamed , &quot; I &apos;@@ ll kill all you ... animals . &quot;
&quot; &apos; this is not usual , &apos; &quot; Ferre@@ ll recalled saying .
&quot; &apos; this is@@ n &apos;t the type of murder that we &apos;@@ ve become used to and can call typical . &apos;
in that moment I felt chil@@ ls .
I was ang@@ ry and c@@ rying . &quot;
she boo@@ ked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11 p.m. , she pic@@ ked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old da@@ u@@ ghter from her dad &apos;s house and decided the two of them would head to Fer@@ gus@@ on the next morning .
what happened , to Ferre@@ ll and to Fer@@ gus@@ on in the following almost three years is the subject of a new docu@@ mentary , &quot; whose streets ? , &quot; in the@@ a@@ ters A@@ ug@@ . 11 .
it &apos;s a tale of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience from the van@@ tage point of the people who live in the community and pac@@ ked the streets demanding answers .
as Ferre@@ ll dro@@ ve to Fer@@ gus@@ on with her da@@ u@@ ghter , who was we@@ aring a fl@@ oral d@@ ress and mat@@ ching cro@@ wn , the two re@@ visited a conver@@ sation they &apos;@@ d had countless times before that morning &quot; about the black experience and black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in ? &quot; she recalled saying .
&quot; we &apos;@@ re going to Fer@@ gus@@ on right now because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old bo@@ y and it was@@ n &apos;t right .
I cou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t not take her , &quot; Ferre@@ ll said later .
&quot; this happening today is a cul@@ mination of ... that has happened in the past .
she needs to know it and see it and be raised in it .
she needs to be well developed in the area of not just activis@@ m and organiz@@ ing but knowing the different la@@ yers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free , to free ourselves .
even if I &apos;m fortuna@@ te enough to provide her an experience where she do@@ es@@ n &apos;t personally experience blatant racism , she is no different than the next black woman @-@ child .
I feel like I would be doing her a dis@@ service to shield her from that . &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in Fer@@ gus@@ on was on South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a site across from the police department that became a ca@@ mp@@ ground of sorts as the activists awaited word of officer Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son &apos;s eventual non @-@ indic@@ tment .
there Ferre@@ ll and her da@@ u@@ ghter linked up with a local business owner who was making sa@@ ck lun@@ ches .
they prepared bags and helped pass them out to prote@@ sters .
slowly , a new type of activis@@ m began to take shape for Ferre@@ ll .
&quot; my activis@@ m completely transformed after A@@ ug@@ . 9 , &quot; she said , noting that while an under@@ gra@@ d at the University of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Louis , she was president of the minority student N@@ ur@@ ses A@@ ss@@ n@@ . and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organiz@@ ing .
it all just came . &quot;
weeks later , Ferre@@ ll met Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ lay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors , during an evening demonstration .
Fo@@ lay@@ an said she and her director of photo@@ graphy Lucas Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r &quot; just wanted to document &quot; what was happening .
a question came to Ferre@@ ll &apos;s mind : &quot; do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot;
that <<unk>> ticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience .
as Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview , &quot; We had heard that people who are born and raised in Fer@@ gus@@ on were not having their voices cen@@ tered , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fo@@ lay@@ an had already linked up with co @-@ director D@@ am@@ on Da@@ vis , an area ar@@ tist known for his activis@@ m around death row in@@ mates .
his involvement <<unk>> red Ferre@@ ll to the project , along with six other lo@@ c@@ als the &quot; whose streets ? &quot; team followed in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this docu@@ mentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us , it &apos;s us speaking , &quot; Da@@ vis said .
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , because that &apos;s how I will be represented . &quot;
while the goal was@@ n &apos;t to focus on Ferre@@ ll &apos;s experience - in an effort to show that the movement is &quot; not about a mes@@ si@@ ah leader but a community coming together , &quot; Fo@@ lay@@ an said - she proved to be the most open of the film &apos;s participants .
as a result , &quot; whose streets ? &quot; documents surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of Ferre@@ ll &apos;s life , like falling in love and mar@@ rying her wife .
&quot; I felt like I was na@@ ked , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll , laugh@@ ing about the first time she saw the finished product .
&quot; but I understood that with doing this work and human@@ iz@@ ing black fol@@ ks , there has to be a level of vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , Ferre@@ ll &apos;s story reiterates and re @-@ cen@@ ters the role of black qu@@ e@@ er women in the broader Black lives matter movement .
two of the movement &apos;s three foun@@ ders - who co@@ ined # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Tra@@ y@@ von Martin - identify as qu@@ e@@ er .
&quot; Black qu@@ e@@ er women in leadership has sustained the movement overall , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll , &quot; and that &apos;s because we &apos;@@ re constantly at battle on multiple fronts .
Black qu@@ e@@ er women have to bear the br@@ un@@ t of it all . &quot;
Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed noting that &quot; the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of qu@@ e@@ er black women . &quot;
she insists , however , that &quot; this is not some affir@@ ma@@ tive action type of thing &quot; where Ferre@@ ll was chosen as the film &apos;s heart because of her identities .
&quot; she was the person who was gal@@ van@@ iz@@ ing this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s not a coincidence though she was on the front lines , because living life at those inter@@ sections as a black qu@@ e@@ er woman , you have so much on the line .
you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , back in Fer@@ gus@@ on , the news camer@@ as are long gone but frau@@ ght racial ties between the community and police persist .
Ferre@@ ll is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ more years for blocking a high@@ way during a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply : &quot; a mess . &quot;
still , she cl@@ ings to a chan@@ t she &apos;s committed to memory since taking to Fer@@ gus@@ on &apos;s streets a full three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose but our chains . &quot;
7 ti@@ ps for getting over the weekend F@@ esti@@ val han@@ go@@ ver
after a party with lots of drinking , a certain tougher bre@@ ed of people find themselves thinking the ha@@ ir of the dog that bit them might be a good idea .
or they follow the max@@ im <<unk>> avoid a han@@ go@@ ver , stay d@@ run@@ k . <<unk>>
but this is just putting off the inevitable and is quite a blow to one &apos;s health .
what can you do to feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow &apos;s weekend festi@@ val or other party and get over a han@@ go@@ ver as pain@@ lessly as possible ?
drink water .
before and after alcohol , after the big party in the morning <<unk>> or even instead of alcohol .
because the body loses lots of flu@@ id when consuming alcohol , it has to be re@@ plen@@ ished .
along with the water , miner@@ als are also f@@ lus@@ hed out of the body , and so it is good to drink mineral water .
the st@@ oma@@ ch lining is often irri@@ tated after tipp@@ ling , so still water or ligh@@ tly car@@ bon@@ ated water is especially good .
take a walk .
certainly it w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t be wise to go split wood at g@@ r@@ <<unk>> &apos;s <<unk>> that could be a fa@@ teful mis@@ cu@@ e .
but a light walk helps the body remember what it feels like to be alive .
lying in a tent and s@@ lee@@ ping off a han@@ go@@ ver is a more time @-@ consuming way of recovering .
give your body back its energy little by little , carefully .
if you &apos;@@ re already experiencing na@@ use@@ a because of yesterday &apos;s over@@ indul@@ gence , it is@@ n &apos;t a good idea to burden your li@@ ver with a big f@@ at@@ ty me@@ al .
start with fresh ju@@ ice , containing fruit sug@@ ars that will start giving your body sus@@ ten@@ ance qui@@ et@@ ly .
if your health is doing poorly around lunch , try some b@@ ou@@ ill@@ on for example .
and sol@@ yan@@ ka meat sou@@ p a bit later already .
avoid coff@@ ee .
this di@@ u@@ re@@ tic will ro@@ b your body of the last liquid .
as already said , water and ju@@ ice are your friends .
don &apos;t count on pain reli@@ ever@@ s .
if you take a pain reli@@ ever in the evening to avoid han@@ go@@ ver , your li@@ ver has to deal with the ac@@ eta@@ min@@ op@@ hen or i@@ bu@@ prof@@ en in addition to the alcohol and will lose strength .
you will do even more damage to your li@@ ver and your han@@ go@@ vers will be worse in future .
in addition , pain reli@@ ever@@ s don &apos;t stay in your body all that long .
if you take a pain reli@@ ever in the morning , don &apos;t take it on an empty st@@ oma@@ ch <<unk>> it will irri@@ tate your already infla@@ med st@@ oma@@ ch .
or if you don &apos;t have a partner , you can get along well with yourself .
it has about the same effect was a walk , except you don &apos;t org@@ as@@ m on a walk .
avoid a too active pace and wild positions <<unk>> physical exer@@ tion should be moderate during a han@@ go@@ ver .
use hu@@ m@@ our .
talk fo@@ ol@@ ish talk with your friends and co @-@ suff@@ e@@ rers , do stu@@ pid things and lau@@ gh in a friendly manner about your own and others &apos; ( suff@@ er@@ ings ) .
H@@ um@@ our and laugh@@ ter may not drive a han@@ go@@ ver away but it certainly makes it easier to tolerate the af@@ tere@@ ff@@ ec@@ ts .
at some point , every han@@ go@@ ver will go away .
North@@ western Professor and Ox@@ ford University employee wanted for Hom@@ icide
a nation@@ wide man@@ hun@@ t is underway for a North@@ western University professor and an Ox@@ ford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fa@@ tally sta@@ b@@ bed inside a luxury Ch@@ ic@@ ago a@@ partment , police said .
on Monday , first @-@ degree murder warrants without bail were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them , 42 , and Andrew W@@ arre@@ n , 56 , for their alleged involvement in the death of T@@ ren@@ ton H. James Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ lea@@ u , C@@ oo@@ k Coun@@ ty court records show .
the documents say Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ lea@@ u , 26 , died after being sta@@ b@@ bed multiple times .
a community alert released by the Ch@@ ic@@ ago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27 .
officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Pla@@ za A@@ par@@ tments and found the victim with several la@@ cer@@ ations on his body .
Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ lea@@ u was pronounced dead on the scene and dete@@ ctives are investigating the sta@@ b@@ bing as a hom@@ icide while police actively search for the two suspects , officials said .
La@@ them has been an associate professor of microbi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , the vice president for university relations , said in an ema@@ iled statement that La@@ them is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering North@@ western University ca@@ mp@@ uses .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities , and North@@ western University is cooperating in that investigation , &quot; C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge said .
W@@ arre@@ n is a senior t@@ reasury assis@@ tant at Ox@@ ford University .
a spokes@@ person for the university and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an ema@@ iled statement that , &quot; We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need . &quot;
the statement added that W@@ arre@@ n &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in .
chief Communications officer of the Ch@@ ic@@ ago Police Department An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities .
&quot; police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs but our efforts to lo@@ cate that are intensifying , &quot; G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said police received a call from the Grand Pla@@ za building manager who had just received a cry@@ p@@ tic ti@@ p that said something had occurred in a@@ partment 10@@ 08 .
police described the scene as very gru@@ es@@ ome .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27 .
La@@ them and W@@ arre@@ n were confirmed to be at the building by security camer@@ as , he said .
&quot; we believe Professor La@@ th@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said .
the management team at Grand Pla@@ za released a statement to residents saying , &quot; Police are currently working on the time@@ line and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of mo@@ tives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;

in addition to the s@@ na@@ p surveys and polls of specific teams , it offers a heat map of the company showing at a g@@ lance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval sco@@ res - allowing her to dri@@ ll down on why .
companies are coming to re@@ ali@@ ze they must stay on top of their workplace culture , lest they become the next U@@ ber , which has been en@@ me@@ shed in scandal since a former employee published a blo@@ g post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for oversight is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 118@@ .@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to finance tech insi@@ ghts website L@@ et &apos;s talk Payments .
Den@@ ver , Col@@ o . , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavi@@ or , saw an up@@ tic@@ k in interest and activity earlier this year amid U@@ ber &apos;s fall into dis@@ repu@@ te .
Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft , and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber recently signed up as a cli@@ ent .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent lets companies send custom@@ iz@@ ed &quot; pul@@ se &quot; surveys , gather confidential responses in real time , and view heat maps of its problem areas .
it also offers an anon@@ ymous tex@@ ting hot@@ line that lets employees report bad behavi@@ or .
and if the chief executive is impli@@ cated , complaints go straight to the board of directors .
&quot; the court of public opinion has usur@@ ped regulators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the foun@@ der and chief executive of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave une@@ th@@ ically , even if regulators don &apos;t step in , it can face costly consequences from consumer boycot@@ ts , employee at@@ tri@@ tion and law@@ suits , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaur@@ ant chain with more than 2@@ 5,000 employees across 500 locations , has used Conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters , lo@@ dge a formal complaint , and hope it was taken seriously .
it was often an intimi@@ dating and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ ran@@ o , Ru@@ by Tuesday &apos;s general coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints .
now that the company is using Conver@@ cent , though , problems that were previously hidden from execu@@ tives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to that holistic , 3@@ 60 @-@ degree view into the employment experience , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who over@@ sees Ru@@ by Tuesday &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; and we &apos;@@ re protecting our shareholders from employment liti@@ gation . &quot;
companies started taking ethics , values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen collapsed because of ethical violations from the En@@ r@@ on scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it was@@ n &apos;t until &quot; social media came into its own &quot; that companies re@@ ali@@ zed they cou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t stop their di@@ r@@ ty laun@@ dry from going vi@@ ral online .
&quot; prior to using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer their software as a service , charging companies recur@@ ring fees to use their products .
it &apos;s a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors , who have pro@@ pped up both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent raised $ 10 million in funding in February from firms such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and Tol@@ a Capital , bringing its total capital raised to $ 47 million .
G@@ lin@@ t secured $ 10 million in November from B@@ es@@ se@@ mer venture partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments hardly come as a surprise , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there &apos;s a growing body of research showing today &apos;s employees expect more from their workplaces than before .
in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high salaries and interesting projects are merely table s@@ takes .
employees want to feel that they &apos;@@ re accepted and valued and that they &apos;@@ re giving their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be at a company , feel their voices are heard , and that the work they are doing is re@@ warding , they are more committed to making that company successful , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , vice president of global benefits and employee experience at L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well ; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged .
if third @-@ party analy@@ tics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement , it &apos;s no wonder they &apos;@@ re finding backing .
having data on employee engagement is important , according to workplace culture experts .
but the data are useless unless a company &apos;s custo@@ di@@ ans take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees for their feedback , it can set an expectation that change is on the way .
and if change do@@ es@@ n &apos;t come fast enough , or at all , it can bre@@ ed disappointment and make employees dis@@ engaged .
&quot; if you &apos;@@ re going to ask for 4,@@ 000 suggestions , you need to be prepared to have 4,@@ 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; said R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , president of consulting at business management firm K@@ ot@@ ter International , who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection .
&quot; because if you don &apos;t follow through , employees will wonder , &apos; D@@ id you really hear me ?
do you care ?
and if you don &apos;t care , why should I care ? &apos; &quot;
Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , which now does monthly employee surveys , has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , according to Er@@ re@@ tt .
and , after gathering feedback from employees frustra@@ ted by the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , she was able to re@@ organ@@ ize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues .
over at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company is getting new insight on its employees , and it &apos;s hoping that in the long run , this will conver@@ t to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; if you &apos;@@ re not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you &apos;@@ re going to lose people , &quot; Vit@@ ran@@ o said .
&quot; and if you lose people , you &apos;@@ re going to lose customers .
and when you lose customers , you &apos;@@ re going to lose companies . &quot;
Bal@@ tics are a sh@@ ining sta@@ r of the Eurozone : incomes growing fast
although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Bal@@ tics , the three Baltic states are quickly approaching the aff@@ lu@@ ent countries of Western Europe in terms of income , B@@ loom@@ berg wrote , c@@ iting a report from the European Central Bank .
according to the ECB , starting in 1999 , the per capital GDP in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
low debt burden , rapidly improving institution and pro @-@ business and pro @-@ free @-@ market policies are responsible for the success .
<<unk>> The Baltic states along with Slovakia are among the few Eurozone countries where the real per capital gross domestic product measured in purchasing power par@@ ity has grown significantly closer to the EU average , <<unk>> the ECB said .
although the objective is for per capita gross domestic product to become equal to the weal@@ thi@@ er Western Europe , in 2015 per capital gross domestic product in the Baltic economies was just 2 / 3 of the average among the 15 countries that were members of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led Bal@@ ts to look for better pay abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Bal@@ tics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year as well , local residents are far from enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only one @-@ quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents felt that their economies were doing well or fairly well .
slightly under half of respondents in the Czech Republic and Poland thought the same .
the N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s elimination of two @-@ a @-@ day practices makes for a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it &apos;s pushing 11 p.m. as a th@@ ron@@ g of U@@ C@@ L@@ A football players ling@@ er to ch@@ at on one side of the team &apos;s new on @-@ ca@@ mp@@ us practice fields .
some have pe@@ eled off their j@@ er@@ sey top@@ s , reve@@ aling backs sli@@ ck with swe@@ at from the to@@ il of the first day of training camp .
for a good ch@@ un@@ k of the team , these id@@ le minutes constitute a mid@@ day break .
players en@@ rol@@ led in summer classes will head back to their dor@@ ms after the three @-@ hour practice to study for final exam@@ s before returning to the W@@ asser@@ man football Cen@@ ter for meetings at 6 : 30 the following morning .
&quot; this is a g@@ rin@@ d for these gu@@ ys the next three days , &quot; Bru@@ ins coach Jim Mor@@ a said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s elimination of two @-@ a @-@ day practices , designed to ligh@@ ten the load on players , has actually leng@@ th@@ ened their days - at least until fin@@ als end Friday .
that &apos;s why U@@ C@@ L@@ A &apos;s first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7 : 15 p.m. to accommodate players &apos; already cra@@ m@@ med schedu@@ les .
the trade @-@ off from no two @-@ a @-@ days is more one @-@ a @-@ days , the Bru@@ ins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mor@@ a &apos;s six seas@@ ons in W@@ es@@ tw@@ ood .
they are scheduled to hold 18 practices through A@@ ug@@ . 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their open@@ er against T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M on Se@@ pt .
Mor@@ a said he supported the N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s rule change even if it did add another item to players &apos; busy it@@ iner@@ aries .
&quot; we &apos;@@ re putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; and they &apos;@@ ve just pushed through it ; they g@@ rin@@ d , they &apos;@@ re great ki@@ ds .
I think once we get to Saturday and we &apos;@@ ll have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
U@@ C@@ L@@ A will close its practices once camp is finished , no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an ad@@ jac@@ ent par@@ king lot and the ad@@ joining L@@ <<unk>> in Cen@@ ter , an up@@ scale hotel that has already been pel@@ ted with foot@@ bal@@ ls that cleared a protective net behind a go@@ al@@ post .
Bru@@ ins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend , but Mor@@ a acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vac@@ ant during the season .
&quot; we will have security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; that is a real concern and it &apos;s not far @-@ f@@ et@@ ched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and video@@ tape a practice .
if you have video@@ tape of a practice , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we &apos;@@ ll have security there and we &apos;@@ ll have security up in Par@@ king lot 8 .
we &apos;@@ ll do the best we can with what we got .
I &apos;m not going to worry too much about it .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the Sa@@ <<unk>> ar @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va election coalition conceived as reven@@ ge against the Centre Party , the <<unk>> Tallinn coalition founded by Reform Party out@@ cast Kris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ and and EK@@ RE out@@ cast Maria Kal@@ j@@ uste , and the Te@@ gus Tallinn coalition of business@@ men hoping to show party members their place <<unk>> it appears that there will be just as many election coali@@ tions , created at the initiative of those who have got their fin@@ gers bur@@ ned in partis@@ an politics , participating in this year &apos;s local elections as there will be political parties .
but the chic@@ k@@ ens will be counted in the autumn and the key question will be whether there will be enough dis@@ illusi@@ oned voters for them all .
who will stick with Sa@@ <<unk>> ar ?
the d@@ wind@@ ling of his base can be seen in the events organiz@@ ed for the owner of his election coalition .
one mp , some former and current Centre Party members and many unknown faces <<unk>> will this really be the ma@@ ke@@ up of the election coalition ?
and might the reason that some of Sa@@ <<unk>> ar &apos;s loyal ad@@ her@@ ents are ref@@ ra@@ ining from running as candidates in Tallinn be found in the fact that the so @-@ called <<unk>> Sa@@ <<unk>> ar list <<unk>> led by the corrupt and those suspected of corruption crimes is becoming a reality ?

we will have to wait to see what other parties imagine a y@@ ou@@ th@@ ful election campaign to be .
whereas instead of enter@@ tainment programming , view@@ ers of Kan@@ al 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 see only a blan@@ k screen starting in early August , there are two choices : to accept that in the future , we will see only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn TV and the English @-@ language Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels on free @-@ to @-@ air TV , or pay 10 euros to some TV operator each month .

Washington changes the Green Card Rules
there is going to be new US immigration plan to modify Green Card rules , President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp said , quoted by the media .
it envisages reducing legal immigrants to 5@@ 0,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules are proposed by the Re@@ public@@ ans and are supported by the president .
the draft law is due to be discussed in the two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do this by changing the way the US issues Green cards to citizens from other countries .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme .
this new application process will benefit candidates who speak English , have financial resources to support themselves and show skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp , quoted by the American media .
young S@@ et@@ os in Si@@ beria are moving to town , pensioners back to the countryside .
A@@ nat@@ oli Y@@ ev@@ se@@ ye@@ v is continuing the tradition of the famous Se@@ to gol@@ d@@ min@@ ers along the river M@@ ana .
he works 140 km away from home along the Ku@@ vai , a tribu@@ tary of the M@@ ana , as a driver for a gold mining collective .
it &apos;s a hard job : 12 hours of work for two months straight without a day off and then only 10 days at home and back again .
during the three years that he &apos;s worked for the collective , A@@ na@@ tol@@ y has seen gold only once .
<<unk>> The rules are strict there : when you enter they check you thoroughly that you don &apos;t bring any vo@@ d@@ ka in and when you leave make sure that you don &apos;t take any gold with you , <<unk>> says A@@ nat@@ oli .
M@@ are Pi@@ ho talking to a local Se@@ to , Jan , in H@@ ai@@ da village , who has told her a lot about his family &apos;s memor@@ ies in Si@@ beria .
the archa@@ ic culture of the Si@@ b@@ erian set@@ tle@@ rs , which still survi@@ ves , is starting to have an effect on the set@@ tle@@ rs back at home too , because it &apos;s just so ama@@ zing , says M@@ are Pi@@ ho , who has studied the distant S@@ et@@ os most thoroughly .
this year marks 30 years since her first research trip to Si@@ beria .
since that time , she has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year .
how many S@@ et@@ os migra@@ ted from Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century to get land here ?
that &apos;s an un@@ settled question .
I say 8,@@ 000 .
I arrived at this number based on stories told by Si@@ b@@ erian Se@@ to men who have also thought about this .
it &apos;s hard to say exactly , because back then as many as 30 people could arrive in one group but passports were only given to men .
the passport was only given to one individual but there were children , sis@@ ters and other female relatives with them .
look how big this territory here was !
it several times bigger than historical S@@ eto@@ maa .
all that had to be culti@@ vated and managed in some way .
the S@@ et@@ os came here as pe@@ as@@ ants , but their life changed , because they found themselves in regions that we@@ re@@ n &apos;t tied only to agriculture but also to the river ( lo@@ g bar@@ ges ) , gold @-@ mining , industry .
for example , in New Pe@@ ch@@ ory , many S@@ et@@ os went to work later in the closed city of K@@ ras@@ no@@ y@@ ar@@ sk @-@ 45 ( which is where the Soviet regime built a uranium plant <<unk>> J. P@@ . ) once it was established .
did the S@@ et@@ os make up the majority of the population in this region ?
yes , they lived in Compact fashion .
the tradition of inter@@ marriage and families with many children also survi@@ ved for a long time .
it was common for families to have seven or eight children .
how much did Si@@ b@@ erian Se@@ to culture differ from that of the mo@@ ther@@ land S@@ et@@ os ?
they &apos;@@ re different , even though the aspects that were brought were once the same there .
they brought with them a great many fol@@ k co@@ stu@@ mes .
they made them as well , but they always drew a distinction between what they brought with them and what they had made on the spot .
climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of the S@@ et@@ os , because it &apos;s col@@ der here .
foods changed .
for example in S@@ eto@@ maa , meat was sal@@ ted , but here it was just frozen .
where are the Si@@ b@@ erian Se@@ to villages located and what kind of life two people live there ? / graphic : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ots
the ties with the mo@@ ther@@ land were spiri@@ tually strong , they were considered very important .
it seems to me that S@@ eto@@ maa starting to <<unk>> feed back <<unk>> there , it &apos;s starting to influence them .
the girls who have lived here in these families have heard aston@@ ishing stories .
Pi@@ ho is referring to people from the Estonian Se@@ to delegation who came to H@@ ai@@ da village in early July for the Se@@ to Kingdom day and lived in homes for four days - J@@ .@@ P .
what is left here is aston@@ ishing .
<<unk>> It &apos;s extremely easy to go to and from T@@ ap@@ a , because the city has a great location : at a railway junction and high@@ way crossing , <<unk>> says oper@@ a s@@ olo@@ ist Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m , who is from T@@ ap@@ a .
the city has long ce@@ ased to be just a military capital ; we have a lot of nature , sport and cultural venues and pi@@ z@@ za on every corner .
T@@ ap@@ a is a top @-@ class town !
the <<unk>> <<unk>> gi river flow@@ ing through the city has a little island where T@@ ap@@ a residents traditionally celebrate St@@ . John &apos;s eve .

if one is@@ n &apos;t afraid of cold water , the river is sw@@ im@@ ma@@ ble , as it is full of s@@ pr@@ ings .
I &apos;@@ ve gone sw@@ im@@ ming there , it &apos;s completely possible !
you can have a pic@@ nic on the ri@@ ver@@ bank for a ro@@ man@@ tic setting <<unk>> you can watch the river flow@@ ing by and think about the past and future .
I have wal@@ ked there with a gir@@ l@@ friend on occasion .
along with everything else , oper@@ a s@@ olo@@ ist Tam@@ m has practised his Arias between the three bridges on the ri@@ ver@@ banks : <<unk>> S@@ ince the place is on the outs@@ kir@@ ts of the town , I won &apos;t necessarily encounter anyone when I &apos;m hu@@ mming my tunes . <<unk>>
<<unk>> There &apos;s an ama@@ zing view of T@@ ap@@ a from M@@ än@@ ni@@ ku@@ mä@@ gi hill , but there &apos;s also recreational tra@@ ils for running or ski@@ ing in winter , and , say , play dis@@ c gol@@ f <<unk>> the dis@@ c gol@@ f course has been established , and the dis@@ cs can be ren@@ ted from the sports centre , <<unk>> says Re@@ ig@@ o .
Ve@@ tera@@ n players go there with their own dis@@ cs , but I ha@@ ven &apos;t made it there yet .
colleague Ras@@ mus Kul@@ l will probably have to be to be invited to T@@ ap@@ a as he is an experienced dis@@ c gol@@ f player and has his own dis@@ cs .
maybe he will lend them to me !

<<unk>> The whole city centre is now full of construction works , it is all changing beyond recognition , <<unk>> says Re@@ ig@@ o by way of praise .
T@@ ap@@ a &apos;s old and wor@@ n @-@ out station building is a very attractive place , where summer perfor@@ man@@ ces are sta@@ ged .

even though this year &apos;s theat@@ re season just ended with Ale@@ kse@@ i K@@ aren@@ in , on 11 August , El@@ lu@@ är@@ ka@@ mine ( coming B@@ ack to Life ) will be performed on 11 August at the railway station , when it will be the 1980s again in the old station building .

the tiny y@@ el@@ low house on the 1st of May B@@ ou@@ lev@@ ard has been a muse@@ um since 1994 .
<<unk>> The house is small but there are great many ex@@ hi@@ bits and a huge amount of information , <<unk>> says Re@@ ig@@ o in pra@@ ising the place , which is full of the history of the town of T@@ ap@@ a , the majority of which focuses on the railway and the military .
Re@@ ig@@ o ch@@ u@@ ck@@ les that if one were to visit all the recommended places in T@@ ap@@ a , one would get hungry , but lu@@ ck@@ ily the small city is full of ca@@ f@@ es .
<<unk>> We have good places to eat and sometimes , si@@ ting in the ca@@ f@@ é , you feel that you &apos;@@ re abroad , <<unk>> he says .
educated and younger soldiers who have come to T@@ ap@@ a spend a lot of time in the pub@@ s and ca@@ f@@ es , and thus there &apos;s the odd feeling that you &apos;@@ re in Estonia and in your home@@ town , but all around you there &apos;s this international set .
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or Americans .
yes , we have a lot of soldiers about town !
two Bulg@@ arians were detained For Il@@ legal Cam@@ ping in Greece

the rules for handling of genetic modified crops must be clear .
the Ministry of Rural Affairs has sent draft legislation amending the release into Environment of genetically modified organisms Act ( <<unk>> V@@ S ) and the plant Protection Act to minis@@ tries for endorsement .
the amendment to the legislation for@@ goes the creation of a separate database on locations of genetically modified ( GM ) crops as well as for hand@@ lers ; the plant health register will be used henceforth for this purpose .
also under the amendment , GM crop hand@@ lers have the obligation to have a pre @-@ existing agreement with a person engaged in ap@@ ic@@ ulture within a specified radi@@ us will be amended .
<<unk>> Although genetically modified crops are not currently grown in Estonia , we consider it necessary for there to be clear rules on the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
at least until such time that a decision has been taken to declare Estonia GMO @-@ free , <<unk>> said the head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs , S@@ ig@@ mar Suu .
<<unk>> A@@ t the same time , it must be taken into consideration that the measures developed must serve the required purpose , be proportional , and take into account the expenses and administrative burden of both private and public sector , <<unk>> added Suu .
the draft legislation repe@@ als the provisions of the <<unk>> V@@ S on database of locations of GM crops and training to handle GM crops , and establishes requirements on handling GM crops and commen@@ cing economic activity .
specifically in connection with ap@@ ic@@ ulture , the current obligation of GM crop growers to notify bee@@ keepers of commen@@ cement of growing GM crops will be sup@@ plan@@ ted with the obligation to achieve , before commen@@ cing growing of such crops , a corresponding agreement with the bee@@ kee@@ per .
the draft legislation has been sent to minis@@ tries for endorsement .
all parties have the opportunity to famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with it in the draft legislation information system and if desired , submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the planned changes affect , above all , persons engaged in the field of plant protection , bee@@ keepers and the Agricultural Board .
it is permitted to grow only one GM crop in the EU , including Estonia - mon 8@@ 10 maize .
to this point , no Estonian agricultural producers are interested in growing GM crops .
the reason is the fact that a maize pest , the European stem bo@@ rer , to which mon 8@@ 10 is resistant , is not found in Estonia .
the vari@@ eties of this maize line were b@@ red in southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climate conditions .
to gain assurance in regard to the above , the Ministry of Rural Affairs commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect potential contamination by GM organisms of seeds of summer rape , maize and so@@ y@@ bean vari@@ eties grown in Estonia .
the test results for the sam@@ ples collected showed that the seeds did not contain foreign gen@@ es and as a result of the study it was concluded that the rape , maize and so@@ y@@ bean vari@@ eties &apos; seeds did not contain GMOs .
from the above , it can be concluded in turn that no GM crops are being deliberately grown in Estonia and it was also confirmed that no acci@@ dental contamination has occurred .

however , having been left out of the Blu@@ es &apos; pre@@ season t@@ our of Asia , matic was severely lacking match f@@ it@@ ness and only managed 45 minutes , something M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Pre@@ mi@@ er League season .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ i@@ us in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; we will help him to be ready sooner rather than later . &quot;
as well as matic , fellow new sign@@ ings Vic@@ tor L@@ inde@@ l@@ of and Rome@@ lu Luka@@ ku also started the game at the A@@ vi@@ va Sta@@ di@@ um as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started to shape his starting xi for the start of the season .
the In@@ dependent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted another three sign@@ ings but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; of delivering three of his four priority sign@@ ings .
&quot; to get three out of four I thank the club for that , &quot; he added .
&quot; I will be hap@@ pi@@ er if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me . &quot;

British inven@@ tor micro@@ chi@@ ps himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand
a British inven@@ tor has become the first in the country to be f@@ itted with a micro@@ chi@@ p so he can open his front door , access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand .
Ste@@ ven North@@ am , 33 , had the tiny chi@@ p im@@ plan@@ ted between his th@@ um@@ b and finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .

the technology is similar to a micro@@ chi@@ p im@@ plan@@ ted for ca@@ ts and do@@ gs , and takes just 30 seconds .
Mr North@@ am &apos;s company will also alter lo@@ cks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chi@@ p , for a cost of £ 300 each lock .

White House Pro@@ p cost taxpayers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a Marine helicop@@ ter to the South La@@ wn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $ 2@@ 4,@@ 000 , according to military records released to time .
the green @-@ and @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , known as Marine One when the President is abo@@ ard , was the cen@@ ter@@ piece of the July 17 event at the White House show@@ cas@@ ing American construction pro@@ grams .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , Vice President M@@ ike P@@ ence and senior White House officials tou@@ red manufacturing products from all 50 states .
the Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut @-@ made helicop@@ ter was displayed alongside a y@@ ach@@ t from maine , a fire tru@@ ck from W@@ is@@ con@@ sin , and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mis@@ sis@@ si@@ ppi .
the White House Mili@@ tary Office requested the helicop@@ ter &apos;s presence in a frag@@ mentary order , or F@@ RA@@ G@@ O , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter lan@@ ded on the South La@@ wn for the &quot; unusual &quot; event , according to the records of Marine H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicop@@ ter .
&quot; I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it &apos;s such an unusual high visibility event , &quot; the com@@ man@@ der of H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ema@@ iled his sup@@ erior , the Marine Deputy Com@@ mand@@ ant for Aviation , the day before the event .
the message indicated the helicop@@ ter would arrive on the South La@@ wn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event , and remain until the la@@ wn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening .
the note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed , a second air@@ crew would be needed for the return flight due to duty @-@ hour restrictions .
the original flight crew was with the helicop@@ ter during the event , while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground .
it was not clear from records provided to time whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ at@@ ch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 inqu@@ ired about whether the event might violate the provision .
&quot; one question we asked was if it was a violation of the H@@ at@@ ch Act and were informed it was not , &quot; the com@@ man@@ der wrote .
&quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; the Deputy Com@@ mand@@ ant repli@@ ed .
the &quot; made in America &quot; event was designated an official event by the White House , and would not have been covered by the H@@ at@@ ch Act .
but even official events have political over@@ ton@@ es .
at the event , the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and tou@@ ted efforts to re@@ in in government regulations .
using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
Presidents are required to use them for travel .
but requisi@@ tioning their use solely for a pho@@ to @-@ op is unusual .
T@@ ru@@ mp drew scrutiny in February when the presidential air@@ plane tax@@ ied to the backdrop of his first campaign r@@ ally in Mel@@ bour@@ ne , F@@ la . , and his Twitter account is f@@ lus@@ h with messages complaining about his predecessor &apos;s use of the presidential aircraft .
&quot; the White House is thri@@ lled with the &apos; made In America &apos; show@@ case that fea@@ tured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials , &quot; said White House Deputy press Secretary L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South La@@ wn to practice deposi@@ ting the President of the United States at the White House with in@@ ches of prec@@ ision .
when T@@ ru@@ mp was at the G @-@ 20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 conducted 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House .
the flight for the made in America event counted toward the air@@ crew &apos;s training requirement for the month , an official said .
unit helicop@@ ters also fle@@ w an additional 11 hours that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps fea@@ tured at the event .
a spokes@@ person for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said the company was not involved in arran@@ ging for the helicop@@ ter to be displayed on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 do@@ es@@ n &apos;t maintain budgetary records for presidential flights , and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult .
but according to Department of Def@@ en@@ se h@@ our@@ ly rates for fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbursement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D is $ 2@@ 4,@@ 380 per flight hour .
unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
the White House argues the true cost of operating the helicop@@ ter is well below that rate .
&quot; to place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading , &quot; Wal@@ ters said .
&quot; these rate estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other sun@@ k costs that are included in annual appropriations . &quot;
according to a 2015 rand study , Do@@ D reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel , but do account for fuel , maintenance , and contracting costs .
at the time , former White House press Secretary Se@@ an S@@ pic@@ er defended the use of the helicop@@ ter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to show@@ case this week things that are made in America , &quot; S@@ pic@@ er said .
&quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security , that there are , I assume , hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that .
and I think , like most Americans , we &apos;@@ re all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly to do .
so , of course , it &apos;s appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
it was@@ n &apos;t clear whether T@@ ru@@ mp intera@@ cted with the helicop@@ ter as he tou@@ red the South La@@ wn for the event , but he did step into the driver &apos;s seat of a fire tru@@ ck .
inside the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp addressed S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky representatives , jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; the President said , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
G@@ rit Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o <<unk>> peace and happ@@ iness come through te@@ ars
at the 2011 world champi@@ on@@ ships in D@@ <<unk>> , Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o suffered a le@@ g cra@@ mp in the last event , the 800 metres , and was carried out of the sta@@ di@@ um on a stret@@ cher .
right before that , she had f@@ ou@@ led out of the long ju@@ mp at a t@@ our@@ na@@ ment in China .
the 2012 European champi@@ on@@ ships in Helsinki were mar@@ red by an injury sustained in the ja@@ ve@@ lin throw , but in her de@@ but Olympics in London , she got 23@@ rd with 60@@ 13 points .
her bad luck continued , though .
at the 2013 Moscow World Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships , the Estonian was on track for an Estonian record when she suffered an foot injury in the long ju@@ mp .
two years later , she got 15@@ th at the Beijing World Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships , and qualified for the Olympics , but even this was a disappointment for the ath@@ le@@ te , who had hoped for more .
Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o ran the hardest ga@@ un@@ tle@@ t last year when she di@@ d@@ n &apos;t get a result in the long ju@@ mp at the Amsterdam European champi@@ on@@ ships
I &apos;@@ d just like to have a decent performance at the he@@ p@@ ta@@ th@@ l@@ on or similar events .
just once , <<unk>> conf@@ es@@ sed Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
the worst was yet to come : a month later , her Olympics in Rio ended due to a th@@ igh injury at the first hur@@ dle .
she had to take time off <<unk>> whether to continue in the he@@ p@@ ta@@ th@@ l@@ on at all ?
was two days of effort worth all this , anyway ?
she thought for a long time , but then found peace of mind .
I achieved mental clarity
it &apos;s relatively hard to describe this experience , but I &apos;@@ ve thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen .
Lu@@ ck@@ ily there was time to heal up and reach clarity .
<<unk>> I knew that it was@@ n &apos;t time to pack up and reti@@ re , <<unk>> says Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o about her self @-@ cle@@ ans@@ ing .
I was able to turn a new page and continue with the same momentum .
coach Anne Mä@@ gi said it was hard to watch her charge suffering , but she knew that above all , the ath@@ le@@ te had to get clear herself on what she wanted .
she has been put down so much by everyone .
it &apos;s hard to take .
<<unk>> Bu@@ t G@@ rit said she won &apos;t give up and wants to prove to herself what she &apos;s worth , <<unk>> says Mä@@ gi .
now there &apos;s some kind of peace within her .
she does it for pleasure .
her lust for competing came back in May , when Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o set a new Estonian record at the G@@ öt@@ z@@ is with 6,@@ 280 points .
at this high @-@ level competition , she bes@@ ted her own top result in the shot put by close to a me@@ tre ( 13.@@ 89 ) and ran a near @-@ record in the hur@@ dles .
the he@@ p@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ te then re@@ ali@@ zed that it was still far from her best ; it only sla@@ ked her initial thir@@ st for competing .
Mä@@ gi , who has been co@@ aching her for years , says Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o is a model student .
she &apos;s a ready ath@@ le@@ te , she &apos;s easy to coach .
if something bo@@ thers her or is not right , she &apos;@@ ll say so right away .
she knows her own body and trus@@ ts her in@@ tu@@ ition .
that is what we have to start from .
I can &apos;t say what exactly has to be done and we follow that .
Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o has also found a new approach .
<<unk>> I &apos;m not the kind of person who gives their all in practice , <<unk>> she says and adds that the most important thing is getting the right feeling , because that guarantees a good result .
new arri@@ vals in families of friends and relatives bring che@@ er
Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o is also riding high on happy events in the lives of people close to her .
both her former training partners Mar@@ is Mä@@ gi and her sis@@ ter Gre@@ te recently became new mothers , and the he@@ p@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ te draws support from the new addi@@ tions to their families .
<<unk>> It &apos;s been pretty interesting , <<unk>> says Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .

Afghan democracy depends on political role for women , U.@@ N@@ . says

Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , acting head of the U.@@ N@@ . Assistance Mission said hundreds of women are running in provin@@ cial council elections , three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly @-@ registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ stated , &quot; he said in a statement Wednesday .
elections can only be truly representative and credible when women fully participate and are included in all parts of the electoral process .
Afghan provin@@ cial council and presidential elections take place April 5 .
the Taliban has issued threats against an election process that coinci@@ des with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time power is handed peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next .

from the Philippines to the wide world <<unk>> stra@@ w bags journey into the hearts of fashion f@@ ans
Bag@@ s wo@@ ven of stra@@ w are a summer classic that in recent years has become a hit product in its own right , which is de ri@@ gu@@ e@@ ur to han@@ g on an arm for anyone properly enjoying the summer . despite its hu@@ mble origins , merchan@@ ts have managed to ta@@ ck on a price be@@ fitting a hit .
a ba@@ g wo@@ ven from stra@@ w is one of the things that everyone has had at some point in their life and ow@@ ning which di@@ d@@ n &apos;t con@@ ju@@ re up any particular emo@@ tions .
you just had it and if you di@@ d@@ n &apos;t , there was nothing wrong .
but now , stra@@ w bags are really taking the world by storm , and for the summer months , fashi@@ on@@ ista@@ s have sw@@ ap@@ ped their sophisticated de@@ sig@@ ner bags for simple bags wo@@ ven from stra@@ w .
it &apos;s far from just a be@@ ach ba@@ g , but just as popular as a purse for urban set@@ tings , and b@@ older women even walk into the office carrying them .
yet it would be wise to be certain whether such a sum@@ mer@@ y style is all right with your b@@ os@@ s or whether it would be good to stick your day @-@ plan@@ ner and lap@@ top into a bit more official @-@ looking case .
the amount of variety has made stra@@ w bags a real summer f@@ ling for women .
for example , reading foreign fashion blo@@ gs , the first thing that catches the eye is that the first thing fashion con@@ no@@ isse@@ urs do when they &apos;@@ re travelling on holiday abroad is rush to the local market as the first thing and buy a stra@@ w ba@@ g they are loyal to the entire holiday and which ac@@ companies them to the be@@ ach , marketplace and while han@@ ging out on the town with gir@@ l@@ friends .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers have been so generous that they buy a larger pi@@ le of bags and sell or give them away to their loyal read@@ ers .
it is worth mentioning that demand for the bags is so high among read@@ ers that in the real world women ( and men ! ) would probably have to resort to violence to become the owner of a ba@@ g .
in some sense the cra@@ ze is understandable as it is rare to be able to acquire something with hit status in the fashion world for just a few do@@ zen euros .
true , cra@@ f@@ ty merchan@@ ts have hit upon an easy money making opportunity and thus fin@@ er luxury br@@ ands are selling stra@@ w bags for several hundred or thousand euros .
no doubt so that weal@@ thi@@ er customers don &apos;t have to feel that they are mere mor@@ tals pro@@ men@@ ading around with some cheap bags .
for example , you can buy yourself a D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a stra@@ w ba@@ g that costs over a thousand euros .
Chan@@ el &apos;s version of the stra@@ w ba@@ g will set you back about 6,@@ 000 euros .
unlike most fashion h@@ its , stra@@ w bags are not from some big fashion me@@ cc@@ a but their origins lie further off .
namely , the stra@@ w bags originate in the distant Philippines , from which they spread to the wide world .
there , wea@@ ving bags from stra@@ w is an export business above all and lo@@ c@@ als don &apos;t often go around with them .
it &apos;s claimed stra@@ w @-@ wea@@ ving techniques date from the 14@@ th century and they are quite similar to ordinary bas@@ ket wea@@ ving .
as stra@@ w bags don &apos;t have to be wo@@ ven as strongly as a bas@@ ket , patterns and other materials can be inter@@ wo@@ ven into them , which makes the ba@@ g more distinc@@ tive and , on that account , more attractive .
for instance , bags into which col@@ oured ri@@ b@@ b@@ ons or lea@@ ther stri@@ ps have been wo@@ ven are particularly tr@@ end@@ y .
Stra@@ w bags owe a thank you note above all to ac@@ tress J@@ ane Bir@@ kin , as a bigger fan of stra@@ w bags has yet to be seen .
namely , she paired a stra@@ w ba@@ g with all conceivable clothing en@@ semb@@ les and even went to Cannes film festi@@ val with one .
no less of a role in the popul@@ arity of the bags today is the fact that it &apos;s easy to care for them and unlike all sorts of other to@@ tes , they don &apos;t need to be maintained with special products . water and a da@@ mp tow@@ el will suff@@ ice .
as with fa@@ d products , brand have come up with all sorts of interpretations besides the classic look .
for instance , you can buy yourself a Lady &apos;s hand@@ ba@@ g wo@@ ven from stra@@ w or even a tiny shoulder ba@@ g wo@@ ven from stra@@ w .
it pays to remember that a classic stra@@ w ba@@ g will not go out of fashion , but a Lady &apos;s stra@@ w hand@@ ba@@ g will .
but what is a classic stra@@ w ba@@ g ?
the type of stra@@ w ba@@ g that has been considered classic for centuries is re@@ minis@@ cent of a bas@@ ket , open at the top , with short hand@@ les , also made of stra@@ w .

G@@ M@@ B concern over investment at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w factory
a union is seeking reas@@ surance from managers at bis@@ cu@@ it mak@@ er Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s over its long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in G@@ las@@ go@@ w .
G@@ M@@ B Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tol@@ l@@ cross site .
more than 500 people work at the plant , which produces H@@ ob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cu@@ its , among other products .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s owner Pla@@ dis said it had invested more than £ 5@@ m at the site in the last few years .
it added employees and union representatives &quot; will be the first to know &quot; if there were any changes to its operations .
in a letter to the company &apos;s site manager , G@@ M@@ B Scotland called on Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s to &quot; address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines . &quot;
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er drew Du@@ ff@@ y , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tol@@ l@@ cross is deeply concerning our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater G@@ las@@ go@@ w area , a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social de@@ priva@@ tion .
so , from the perspective of jobs , pay and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline , the east end of G@@ las@@ go@@ w desperately needs a thri@@ ving manufacturing presence at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the site manager at Tol@@ l@@ cross received a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives .
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ M@@ B representatives at Tol@@ l@@ cross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly .
we discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive .
she added : &quot; in recent years , we have invested over £ 5@@ m in our Tol@@ l@@ cross site , notably on production lines and operational improvements .
we fully recognise the heritage of Tol@@ l@@ cross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to know . &quot;
did PS@@ G warn Barcelona about move for Ney@@ mar three years ago ?
la liga side may ru@@ e their interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not let up in their pursuit of Ney@@ mar after lo@@ dging a £ 18@@ 9@@ m offer to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona of the world @-@ record raid three years ago ?
the sen@@ sa@@ tional approach has lit up the summer transfer window , with the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark , which saw Paul Po@@ g@@ ba return to Manch@@ ester United last season for £ 8@@ 9@@ m .
once completed , the move will see Ney@@ mar become the world &apos;s most expensive player and also the highest @-@ paid professional spor@@ ts@@ man in the world , with PS@@ G offering wages of over £ 50@@ 0,000 @-@ a @-@ week after tax .
Barcelona are known to be fu@@ rious with the manner of the approach and the way that Ney@@ mar has forced his way out , despite a source close to the Cata@@ lan@@ s &apos; board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manch@@ ester City expressed an interest in signing Bla@@ ise Ma@@ tu@@ idi in 2014 , N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a s@@ tern warning for any club looking to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we &apos;@@ ll contact their players , &quot; Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi said .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players , they &apos;@@ ll face consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appear to have cros@@ sed this line , with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti earlier this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Ney@@ mar .
Prime minister : after Bre@@ x@@ it , Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders .
<<unk>> Bre@@ x@@ it seriously threatens to drive a w@@ edge between Northern Ireland and Ireland as well as between Great Britain and Ireland , <<unk>> Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June .
<<unk>> I can &apos;t imagine who would gain from this , <<unk>> he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made possible the current freedom of movement of people and goods , he said .
<<unk>> This is our vision for the future : to build bridges , not borders , <<unk>> he stressed .
Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said he would prefer Great Britain to remain part of the European Union , or since this is not possible , to remain part of the European Single market .
this would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
another way to make the exit of Britain smoo@@ ther would be to establish a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explained the Irish prime minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said : <<unk>> Cer@@ tain@@ ly we could have such an agreement with Great Britain . <<unk>>
an alternative to this would be going back to customs che@@ ck@@ points , which would be a declaration of historical fragmentation and political failure .
<<unk>> A barrier to trade , prosperity and peace , <<unk>> said the Ta@@ o@@ ise@@ ach .
he called Bre@@ x@@ it <<unk>> our generation &apos;s challenge <<unk>> and warned that the outcome could affect all aspects of everyday life for Northern Ireland .
the Ta@@ o@@ ise@@ ach met with the leaders of Northern Ireland &apos;s primary political parties on a visit to Bel@@ fast .
