four members of KCape rovo group were arrested in Estonia and Spain
according to postal service , in Spain , the so @-@ called &apos; Cape rovo group leader &apos; in Estonia , Slava Gulevich , known as Slava KCape rovski , was detained by the police in the criminal world .
Guyvich , held in Spain , was arrested on trial .
yesterday , the Court also withdrew three suspects arrested in Estonia .
it is suspected that this is a so @-@ called &apos; Cape rovo &apos; criminal community members of the age of 27 @-@ 57 , which mainly commits crimes against drugs .
in the province of Mala , Spain , the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained .
three men were detained in Estonia as a suspect , one of them is , according to data , the leading figure of a criminal community and two are members of a criminal community .
the data collected indicate a clear division of roles and roles within the criminal community .
the activities of the criminal community were aimed at committing crimes against drugs and thus generating criminal proceeds , &quot; commented the head of the criminal case before the court , Public Prosecutor VaedaVerte .
&apos;We do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals in this criminal case is increasing &apos; , the Prosecutor added .
these are people who have previously found themselves in the interest of law enforcement authorities , some of whom have been punished for drug crimes .
Mrs Verte emphasised that cooperation with my Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become the norm for us , and this week &apos;s operation demonstrates the success of cooperation , &quot; commented the Prosecutor , Mrs Verte .
the head of the central criminal police service , ago Leis , said that detention was preceded by a preliminary investigation of nearly one and a half years .
&quot; in the first half of the week , long @-@ term work was carried out and , at the same time , in Estonia and Spain suspected of crimes , he said .
Leis added that central police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have good contacts and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
these detentions are yet another message to criminals that we will get them out of the other end of Europe . &quot;
the information gathered so far makes it clear that , when there is no doubt , the injured men may continue to commit new crimes , which is why the prosecution service asked for their arrest and the court also approved it .
a man arrested in Spain expects his surrender to Estonia .
as part of this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been frozen to ensure confiscation .
the criminal case before trial is conducted by a central criminal justice police agency and is run by a public prosecution service .
the Tallinn City Court sentenced Mr. Gulevich to blackmail in 2005 and punished him with five years &apos; imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the criminal world of Estonia following the then allilmaliyr Nikolai Tarankov .
Mr Gulevich , from Cape Verde , pointed out at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
he allegedly taxed taxed taxi drivers and women in different hotels and ordered a monthly carelessness tax on businessmen .
international joint operations , the confiscation of proceeds of crime and the entry into force of court judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the most recent court rulings , the eight accused persons allocated to the so @-@ called &apos; Dikyev criminal community &apos; , of whom EUR 80 000 were confiscated , or the nine individuals of the judgment , that Mr Aleynikov created a criminal community in 2006 aimed at illicit trade in cigarettes and the crime of trafficking in human beings in East Viruland and in South Estonia .
the proceeds of the seized criminal activity there are close to EUR 71 500 .
in these criminal matters , it has been a success for police officers to exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and , if necessary , to carry out operations in any country in the European Union .
civil Rights Group warns of Missouriss travelling
the National Association for the Advanwines of Colored People &apos;s ( NAACP ) has warned the people travelling to Missouriss against discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State .
the Group &apos;s statement states that &apos; the NAACP travel position issued for the State of Missouri , which runs until 28 August 2017 , calls on all African @-@ American travellers , visitors and southeans to be particularly attentive and extremely careful when moving around the country , given the dubious racial events that have taken place recently , and which have also been pointed out here &apos; .
according to NAACP , the group urged both the recent Missouri law , which makes it more difficult to win discrimination cases , and the fact that the destination for state law enforcement is unequal to a large extent minorities .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
they are being pulled down because of their skin colour , beaten or slaughtered , &apos; said Ro Chapel &apos;s newspaper The Kansas City Star , President of NAACP .
&quot; we have never received complaints so closely before . &quot;
this is the first such warning that an organisation has issued for the US State .
the group referred to events such as racist insults towards black students at Missouri University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black @-@ old model of Tennesta .
Sanders died at the beginning of this year , under dubious circumstances , after she ran out of a state of petrol and was arrested by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime .
in addition , a comment refers to a recent report by the Prosecutor of Missouri , which shows that in state , the cars of black drivers are being stopped by 75 % more likely than those of white men .
&apos;The comment is intended to make people aware and alert their families , friends and collaborators for what may happen in Missouris &apos; said Chapel .
&quot; people must be ready , whether it means engaging bail @-@ outs or informing relatives that they are going through the state . &quot;
according to the latest information from the FBI programme on hate crime , 100 hate crime were documented in Missouris in 2015 , which places the country in a supranational 16th place in terms of the number of similar violations .
a passenger warning is also a response to the new Missouri law , which makes it difficult to appeal to the Court of Justice for discrimination in search of housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Community ( IPCivil Aviation Union ) had previously issued travel reservations about Texas and Arizona , following the adoption by these states of immigration laws obliging local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences , as the ACLU says it will increase racial profiling .
normally , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about other countries , but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
Hepatitis : what can anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease ?
Hepatitis A , B , C , D and E may be caused by five different hepatitis viruses .
all these viruses provoke a liver acute infection .
however , with a bad natural cost , hepatitis B and C are chronic , which can continue to develop into a liver chlorine , a liver thread and a liver cancer .
Siulo Kutsar , an epidemiological Adviser of the Health Agency , says that the phenomenon of acute hepatitis is the same for all types of liver @-@ burn - fever , fatigue , sweets , birth , oinisation , aerial pain , grey evictions , dark horse mackerel , meat and excessive furniture , and skin and lipsy .
the last symptoms of the disease also include the popular name of a liver @-@ burn infection with therapeutic cancer .
children can experience hepatitis without disease .
it is only possible to determine the different types of laboratory research .
extreme hepatitis can be transformed into chronic hepatitis and will continue for decades without disease symptoms , meaning that a person may not know anything about his dangerous pay @-@ harm disease .
Siulo Kuavalr will identify different forms of hepatitis and will describe their progress more closely .
Furrical viruses of hepatitis are spreading from a hospital to a person and infected us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , from pigs , from infected man &apos;s emissions to hands and hands on foodstuffs , soil , items , communication and consumption of drugs .
a hepatitis was exposed to the risk of contagious infection - that is , family members and carers of the disease , people suffering from chronic liver diseases , sex people with a infection , male sex men , drug users , countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis A .
it is possible to prevent infection by vaccinations , in particular by proposing vaccination for people who travel a lot and who are at risk of hepatitis A .
furthermore , daily hygiene requirements are essential : to wash or disinfect hands , before consumed food , to wash all fruit and vegetables .
b hepatitis viruses virgins in contact with the blood of a sick person , in injection of drugs , in nurturing , honouring , honouring , using blood @-@ contaminated meters ( tootholves , parenthood ) , donor blood , sex treatment with hepatitis predators , and from hepatitis disease to animals / newborn babies .
b hepatitis @-@ infected drug users , sex partners of infected people , sex men with men , the newborn babies of the infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body fluids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police and countries with a high hepatitis B .
in order to prevent hepatitis , it is possible to vaccinate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk , as well as people suffering from chronic liver diseases , HIV infection , sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes .
b hepatitis is other preventive measures : refraining from the use of foreign hygiene and mannourishments , other sharp tools and systalgic needles , carelessness and honour and condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection , or preventing sexual risk .
vaccination against hepatitis b is part of the National immunity Scheme and is free of charge for children in Estonia .
Hepatitis C virus is spreading to the blood of a sick person , to inject drugs , to nurturing , to honour , to the use of blood @-@ contaminated meals , to blood blood , to the donor &apos;s blood , to the sex treatment of a hepatitis drug additive and to the animals / newborn from hepatitis disease .
the C @-@ hepatitis infection risk group consists of injecting drug users , sex partners for infected people , sex men with men , the newborn babies of the infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body fluids , health care , rescue workers and police , persons with HIV infection and countries with a high hepatitis C .
C hepatitis prevention is : refrain from the use of strangers hygiene and mangangs , other sharp tools and systalgic needles , carelessness and honour and condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection .
there is no vaccine against hepatitis C .
Hepatitis Dpatitis is caused by hepatitis D virus , which is spreading in the presence of hepatitis B .
as a result , hepatitis D , together with hepatitis B or superinformation , are chronic with hepatitis B .
Hepatitis viruses blood and other body fluids , contaminated systalles , sexually transmitted and rarely infected animals .
Hepatitis B is chronically infected with hepatitis B and people with no immunity from hepatitis B .
an effective preventive measure is the vaccination with the B hepatitis vaccine , which also protects a person from infection with hepatitis D .
Hepatitis viruses virgins are spreading on the motorway to drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and sea shellfish , donor blood , joint @-@ use needles and more infected animals .
passengers may be infected with the high incidence of E hepatitis in countries with high epidemics .
Hepatitis prevention measures are compliance with hygiene requirements : to wash or disinfect hands after swimming , before cooking and eating , after care for the sick .
Fruits and vegetables are deterred before consumption , avoid the feeding of little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , drink only safe drinking water and refrain from consuming drugs .
although in the past , competitors tried to push away from the four @-@ day Olympic winners , 34 @-@ year @-@ old Farah ended up with force and won 26.49.51 .
Farah did not think at length , drawing her husband Tania and children on the way after the finch .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much love my family .
it was wonderful to be on their way , &quot; said Farah for journalists .
Farah is targeting the fifth edition of the London title , a golden dump of between 5 000 and 10 000 metres .
everything is possible if believed in it .
despite the title , Mrs Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connormi &apos;s &apos; Daam gold &apos; , the exceptional story of Gustav Klimt &apos;s masterpiece , Ms Bloch @-@ Baueri , is &apos; from synthesis to one of the artistic works much deeper than the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to the cultural life of Vienna .
but more deeply in history .
the predatory inflow of information , perhaps the louder in the back @-@ up , the narrower subject would have been to have had more influence on the exceptional story of the Directorate @-@ General .
at present , there would be as if there were two books between some of them : Gustav Klimt and his father &apos; Daam gold &apos; , the story of Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri , and a much larger and more comprehensive history site from respectable Jewish families and the German occupation , with its aftermath in Austria .
the first third of the book is leading to a cultural life in the middle of the wedding Viin and who himself came to the capital of Austria , to the slightest wonder how life around Ringstrass more than a hundred years ago , or how the Centrali coffee all turned its heads when the climate invaded .
the concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe , and when you see the name in the book , you felt more like a gram of culture .
however , the fact , for example , that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where there was an untreated arsonist in void and there was the highest suicidal level in Europe , creates nothing more for development .
or perhaps , however , every couple of honest paints also add colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna .
dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
the exchange of time was almost one in ten inhabitants of Vienna .
parents were also newcomers in Vienna , but by the time the helplessness of Agile was opened up twice to the Czech sugar magnaad Ferdinand Blochi and climate climb for his famous paintings , his father had become the seventh largest bank in Habsburg Empire .
but let us not give up all the glazambique life he belonged to .
when you look at the &apos; Daami gold &apos; , it is hard to believe that , at the end of life , it was a great dage of socialism and dreaming of a trip to the Soviet Union .
in 1933 , when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband from the Klimese , the last minute was the Mazambique artist in Vienna .
the climb order then cost 4 000 kroons , a quarter of the price of a well @-@ established rural house .
some of the sports officers were suspected of being hampered by a bottle modelled by a master &apos;s artist , a sugar magne .
as far as the Adeletes is concerned , the only certainty is that the close relationship between the modelli and the artist created during their work continued to life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connor - &quot; Daam gold . &quot;
Gustav Klimti &apos;s masterpiece , Aute Bloch @-@ Baueri lar exceptional story , Varrak 2016 , translated Aldo Randland from English .
shortly before the start of the work with Adelet , the climate had been going to Ravennas San Vitale in the automotive sector , and the researchers think that it was the great mosaic mosaic mosads that were seen there who gave the artist the idea of making a golden athree Adeletes colour as a mosaic .
the climate presented its &apos; Daami gold &apos; in Vienna in 1908 and around the same time ( 1907 @-@ 1908 ) was born in another golden country .
the artistic historians did not notice the similarity of the two women .
what about nature is Hitler ?
&quot; I think that , to remember my friend , Mr Klimant , I owe him to make his job available to the public &apos; , Aute Bloch @-@ Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere museum in February 1918 and wanted their family &apos;s climate college to go to museums .
six years before the death , the climate had produced a troika of Adeleka .
in his wildlife , too , in February 1925 , he asked her husband to leave his two porters and four Gustamt meteorologists in Austria .
she wrote to the nurses of Mariana and Luora .
one year on from the end of the &apos; Annex to Austria Mona &apos; , the climate had attempted to escape Viin Kawond de Akademines from 17 @-@ year @-@ old Adolf Hitler , but fell through the drawing board .
although , sometimes , the reason for Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ Semitism is thought to be that Jewish professors did not accept him in the Acadean , none of his examiners was in fact Jewish .
in any case , the role of Austrian Galeri referred to in the testament had changed considerably by 1939 - it was important that the rich Jewish arts of Vienna have found the work of the Nazi parade .
Hitler &apos;s personal artistic assets were also bothered by some of the work at home for Arad , but not by the climate .
Sixty years after the artistic robbery of the Nazis , a ten @-@ year @-@ old dispute broke out between the Austrian Government and the heirs of Bloch @-@ Baudis .
at this point , it should be noted that when the &apos; novel &apos; faces the Belvedere Castle in Vienna , the &apos; Daami gold &apos; images of Aute Bloch @-@ Bauer must be seen to go to New York &apos;s Neue Galeri .
and before Vienna , the aforementioned book also reads .
even if you do not plan to look at the work of the climate , because at least my emotions , after the closure of the book , were more Nazi and Jewish than the land sold for 135 million dollars and modell Ays Bloch @-@ Bauer .
so it is not so much a fascinating story , rather than a sexually transmitted life - and a very moving story .
it significantly facilitated the orientation of the events at the beginning of the book on the issue of Baudis .
17 year old flood in Canada was very close to the Estonian record
in living memory , gold was close to a personal record of 200 metres of selizing , flooding close to 2.16.62 .
the Tippmark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ old years a week ago , when the Canadian APope Uikblog was awarded a prize at 2.16.58 .
the gold escaped , in other words , the A @-@ finalists of the last decade .
in Finally he graduated from 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a powerful new peak .
the Estonian record ( 2.15.13 ) , which is part of Ms Kendzie , left the Golden to be split just over half a second .
Estonia recorded a third increase in gold in all times , and its fresh personal excellence mark is the result of Estonia &apos;s five @-@ fold performance .
a young hope for the future will be in the launch of another 100 metres , 200 metres and 400 days in the inauguration of the Canadian adult championship and 200 mm and 400 times in the breadings .
last week , in Toronto , there was a Canadian Judaeo championship , and gold also made successful headway there .
he won 200 m in ampaste with a silver medal period of 2.03.22 .
so quickly , this distance was flooded most recently in 2008 .
only a record Estonian woman , Elina Partarka , has been distanced from this distance more quickly than ever in Estonia .
as a Canadian protagonist , a further Medal of 100 crèches won an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season with 56.66 .
for example , Kertu ly Alnek , a year old , has distanced itself from this distance by just one century more quickly .
he reached a personal peak point in an exchange of 1.03.69 with a further 100 metres of seluge .
half of the longer distance , he only gained a seat in the seventh place , when he was uttered at 2.17.31 .
gold is currently leading the ranking of the Estonian season on four distinct distances .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics amputable teeth
the time of the holidays is in place - that is , the rigidity of the US President , Donald Truts .
however , as the Trump has so far been the President who has taken one of the most holiday days , critics are already pumping teeth .
according to the US Congress CNN , the President intends to have 17 days &apos; leave in a non @-@ attached golf club in Bedminster , in New Jersey .
although presidential leave began yesterday , opponents of the Trumpi leave have been speaking for weeks .
they are throwing the bull over too frequently to the Olympic Games .
the President has the habit of dragging his weekend in Florida , Virginia and New Jersey &apos;s cotton .
incidentally , the Trump has not been cleared by the President in its 196 official days .
for example , Mr Bush had already managed to be 67 days on holiday , with Mr Obama half as much as Mr Trump , but 21 days on holiday .
however , the Olympic crisis tends to forget things quickly .
the days after he became President , Trump &apos;s receipt said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; that there would be no time for long holidays during his counterpart , as a great deal of work was needed .
he also expressed his outrage at Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
the current president wrote on Twitter : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , he is playing golf , the brakes and the jungle groups , journalists are dropping their heads from the eye &apos; .
according to officials in the White House , 17 days &apos; visit to golf club is not a miracle .
it is officially called &apos; work leave &apos; , during which the Truel does not have time to read or other forms of entertainment .
in addition , work leave had to be another reason .
indeed , the western part of the White House is being replaced by a special system of traditional retirement and therefore all staff had to leave it .
the West Bank is also based on Ovalkatellis and other functions of the President .
&apos;I do not think that any of you would like to be in the West in August , when there is 38 degrees and there is no traditional pensioner &apos; , said Lindsay Walters , spokesman of the White House , who stressed that the President would continue to work during his leave .
from where President Trump will spend 17 days , you will have an idea of video .
blocking critics from Facebook , X , do not stand for state office unless you tolerate the criticism of the voters .
the father of our country knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans loved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to start tyrant him for everything from internal politics to his political principles .
he was , of course , upset by criticism .
but he did not force his critics to remain silent .
because , in 1783 years , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression could be taken away from us and that , if we remain silent , we could be chairing the slaughterhouses &apos; .
it brings me to Maryland &apos;s governor Larry Hogan , who will have to work to be more like Washington .
Mr Hogan &apos;s submissions have blocked and deleted the postal services of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the American Civil Liberties Union ( IPACLU ) therefore referred it to the Court .
the Governor &apos;s official walked the action into empty and the web commentators banished from reactions in a style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos; .
&apos;This is just Facebook , &apos; many said .
but it counts .
and it is particularly important when it comes to honey like Hogan .
it is an amazing popular Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state .
his discharge percentage is from the top of the top 50 governors in the country .
Hogan is not an unwise , reactive head .
he has managed the state in a firm manner and remained firm in his principles .
in addition , it has used piracy rather skettingly as the main tool for dealing with its constituents , for example , by presenting its plastic head after chemotherapy for the first time .
thus , the Governor &apos;s website in kets is a public forum with official marks , managed by the staff paid by taxpayers &apos; dollars to block people who visit Washington , unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview given to Mr Chati , spokesman of the Hogan press , defended the conduct of the Governor , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than a modelling .
however , it is far too easy to paint a picture of online web @-@ run Internet guards , spawers or people filled with anger .
the post spoke with a number of people whose Hogan was blocked .
and that is precisely what they are people in charge of kets , who communicate with their elected leaders : the teacher , the owner of the undertaking and the pastor , not Internet control .
they all said that their comments were respectful , considered and not at all Roma .
Pastor quoted milk in his post , oppressing Hogan &apos;s Catholic movement .
the lawyer from Maryland Bowie , Lakshm Sarma Raman , did not incite hatred but rather hate crime .
&quot; I replied politely that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; he wrote the news story of The postal newsletter in the country of comment .
&apos;I also do not like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same subject , some call it an indifference to collective effort instead of acknowledging that it is a great deal of concern to citizens &apos; .
what the Governor &apos;s administration called &apos; targeted spam attack &apos; would probably invite others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era allows for easy matching of messages by simply blocking criticism or cancelling negative comments .
it is much cleaner than it was in the past when , to do the same , workers had to be deported so that they collect the newspapers with critical editorial letters and burn them or arrest protestors and force them to silence .
but that is exactly what is happening now , quite simply digitally .
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for the toothlessness of Facebook and other social media .
President Trumpi has referred Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter &apos;s stream .
one of the first notable sentences on this subject was passed last week in Virginia .
James C. Cacheris , the US District judge , decided in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the County Council of Loudouni had violated the first modification of the Constitution when he was blocked on his Facebook page by the constituent .
Ktuckys also visited Matt Bevin ( R ) , Governor Matt Bevin , after using ACTA LU Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
during Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar effect on the Internet .
between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers and anonymous writers typified his leadership .
and even then Washington had to face up to anonymous cheeses .
people wrote letters to newspapers from pseudo @-@ renyms such as Juricola , Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , clearing up the Washington decisions .
according to the historical documents harvested in the framework of the project to collect the signatures of Webi@-@ based George Washington , he buried her cabinet under petitions criticising his views on the friendship , Trade and shipping agreements with Britain .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , disagreement and debate are fundamental pillars of our country .
and proper management means accepting it .
Mr Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of Renaissance in Clubis home territory
the former European Chairwoman , Ronan Rafferty , hopes for the convenience of home territory in the next three days , when the Renaissance of the East Ltd at Clugolf fif &apos;s courses takes place 25 .
the Northern Ireland , which was head on the streets of Archerfield Linony in the vicinity of last year , before Paul EalES was left in the middle of the last round , is attached to a new orchestra and is filling in the role of the Ambassador of the club founder and executive director , Jerry S67 , rather than the head of the club .
&quot; I saw Renaissance in the Club building and now we see the club walking in full with this event , &quot; said Rafferty .
&quot; the players see the way in their best form , it is in a splendid state .
Jerry has done an excellent job in establishing this place .
he is a keen supporter of golfimgames and proud of what has been achieved here .
this will allow excellently to present the way . &quot;
an Englishman is ever looking forward to being able to defend the championship for the first time , even though the man has won both European Toubon and the European challenge Tour during her 32 @-@ year career .

&quot; I could not defend my Extremadura ODaul title , because it was taken off the competition calendar one year after my victory .
it is ironic to come back to this chicken .
it is an excellent place to play golf .
I remember the memories of last year , for me and for my wife , Mrs Sharon , last year &apos;s victory was special .
it was a very special time that we will always bear in our heart . &quot;
on home soil , Gary Orr , who joined the European Semester at the beginning of this year , is also returning to a competition when he became 50 .
this is his first event in Scotland in 2013 , following the participation of Aberdeen stock management Scottish Openil .
&quot; it is always a little bit more important to play at home , &quot; said Helensburgh man Orr .
&apos;Banks well done to appear , but you also felt that they did .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously , and I have shown quite a decent golfever .
I am satisfied that things have progressed so far . &quot;

poverty and death in Indonesia &apos;s gold @-@ rich land
when Barena Degei &apos;s dinner is produced , he does not use lead .
he even seldom uses pots .

Polygamy is commonplace here on May .
working late may , however , be dangerous for the majority of men in the home village , who are unemployed and many of them drink hard , plus soldiers .
&apos;No one dared to go around after five o &apos;clock in the evening &apos; he says .
it is a rare pill in Papua mäki , a former Dutch colony which was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 following a referendum that created controversy , forcing only 1 026 old people to vote in front of forces by raising their hands .
the movement from the supremacy of the Dutch supremacy from the supremacy of the Dutch people to the Jakarta Government , which continues to keep the region under its strong control , keeping foreign journalists and human rights watchdogs away .
in 2003 , the province was officially split into the Pope and the Western Pope , so the independent Papua New Guinea was left in the east of the island .

Papua on is the poorest province of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
however , it is also a case of Indonesia &apos;s gold @-@ rich land .
just 100 km from Paniao , which is a mountain province of approximately 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey , the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world is Grasberg , the Freexporting McMoran , a company operating in Phoenix .
in 2015 alone , around USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and discoveries extracted from FFriday &apos;s exports .
in addition , it can be enriched with consumer wood stocks with an estimated USD 78 billion worth .
however , these riches are the source of suffering for boats as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army .
a 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freexports paid around USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to USD 150 000 to one officer .
the attempts of the Pope to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden hall and is ruthlessly restructured .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army .
according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights , the mass killing of genocide in the mountains of Papua kians in the 1970s was a measure .
last year alone , more than 3 900 peaceful protestors were arrested in the Indonesian police area .
the 2016 report of the Main Archbishop of Birsbane , &apos; We shall lose all &apos; , contains testimonies of atrocities committed in the past year , such as extrajudicial executions , torture ( one report shows that rape and electric shocks are particularly widespread ) and the brutal suppression of peaceful protests .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as such incidents take place every week , &quot; says Human Rights Watch of Indonesia &apos;s investigator Andreas Harsono .
the kidnappings are even stronger , as Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new entrants from Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demographics are changing , as there are large @-@ scale economic migrants coming from the islands of Jaava , Kalimantan , Sumatra and Sulawes in Indonesia .
the fixed canteens are sold in the cholepets and mixed vegetables to gado @-@ gado , which is being canned with ground level .
local authorities cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started selling cannabis and vegetables more cheaply than their local boats on the traditional market , &quot; explain the 24 @-@ year @-@ old abeth Tajani born in Paniao , who was working for work in the province capital Jayapury .
&quot; the indigenous pawns of Papua mama @-@ mama &#91; women &#93; therefore lose their market share . &quot;
in his 2014 election campaign , the President of Indonesia , Joko Widodo , known as Jokow , promised to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Pope .
the former Mayor of the puppet won the Jakarta presidential Palace in Papua 29 out of 27 constituencies , including Paniai .
but in Pope , very little has changed and the local feels cheated .
&quot; our hearts have been broken because , in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jokow in expectation that he fulfils our hopes of restoring justice , &apos; says Opel &apos; .
in fact , just two months after Jokow took office in October , Paniai was at a low level .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children sworn stones along with Christmas when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle of blindness .
the children who arrived told them that they should include the front tables .
according to the words of the local passport Yavedt Teban , one of the soldiers insulted their tone and returned later with four soldiers .
according to the victims and witnesses , under the influence of drinking , soldiers hunted behind their children and deceived them with their guns .
then one of the soldiers shot among children .
one child , Yulianus Yeimo , aged 16 , was beaten so brutally that he fell into her own house .
a few hours later , the building of a close Election Commission was burnt and the following day things were even more escalated .
around 1 000 young people , Papua mers , women and children , met a football pitch in order to demand justice before the local police Department and the military command centre .
they carried refreshant refreshant buses and presented Papua mee &apos;s pago triumph of waita @-@ taninate , drinking around and burying poultry song .
some of the protestors started lobbying the police and the military .
Pahammatisation was sent to soldiers through internal gangs . &apos; whereas the mass of people is more than three times resistance , shot them down , they were said in accordance with the official document , which has been seen as a magazine but has not been issued to local media outlets .
in the city of Kego Koto , the oldest Yeremias Kayme ( 56 ) , in the city of Keremias ( 56 ) , felt threatened and called for peace by asking for the population to go home .
no one had the will to listen .
&apos;Reversal , I was suddenly shot in the left , &apos; he said to the magazine in his German colour on the verge of a disability house .
we still do not know who had been shot , but say that the soldiers &apos; rivals came from the month .
&quot; there was a lot of people , there were plenty of children in the House , &quot; he adds .
Alfius Youw , a local man , was shot three times when he was shot .
&quot; I look to him and I looked through her body to make sure that she is with him , &quot; said the magazine in Yohanes , who , like many indicators , uses only one name .
&quot; I saw that he has died ... I have returned to him . &quot;
the General Adviser of Papua Police , Yotje Mende , said to reporters that he would only guarantee the safety of his department because he was attacked .
&quot; we have to protect ourselves when we are threatened with killing , &quot; said Papua dian Media Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protestors were killed and there were many injured .
news of the killings came to Jakarta only next day .
three weeks later , Jokow Jayapuras held a passionate speech in which she expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses that took place in Pope .
&quot; I want to address this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would put in place an alternative mechanism to tackle human rights crimes .
but almost immediately , there were excuses .
&quot; most of the crimes happened a long time ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we must follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
speaking at Jakarta on 5 June , Wiranto , however , took back his words by saying that he had no intention of having a Pope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything would be done according to the law &apos; .
Wiranto , who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in relation to more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the bloody referendum on independence in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Paniao , including the one in Paniao .
the families of the victims of the Paniai adopted such claims with a gloomy disbelief .
&quot; I have been heard four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , &quot; said Yohanes .
&apos;I am tired &apos; .
he says that , years later , there is still fear .
&apos;I am afraid &apos; he says .
&apos;I am afraid that I am being arrested by the army , I am afraid I am being shot &apos; .
he confirmed in Yacobus that the people of Paniai are afraid of this incident .
he said that he got the army out of his hands after she had helped to bury four victims .
&apos;Following the burying of bodies , the army had to seek me , &apos; he says .
the abuses have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police fired the village inhabitants of Paniai in Deiyais .
one person was killed and 17 wounded , including children , when there was a war between the village population and the head of the construction company , which refused to transport an unknown man to hospital .
the men &apos;s people , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ravianus Douw , who drowned into nearby rivers , died on the way to hospital .
the recent village inhabitants protested on the construction site in front of the company office .
according to the police , villages stoned police officers , after which the latter responded with alerts .
however , according to local reports , mobile Britons ( the policeless police of Indonesia ) started shooting at the people , killing one person .
&quot; we were in great panic , we are afraid of retaliation , &quot; said Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and saw the release of the injured .
&quot; I have deceived myself in my own house for two days . &quot;
the Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and for the withdrawal of a mobile police force from the region .
Paniao has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the meters , mone , dances and damm living in Papua haljendable middle lands .
many of them have joined the army of free trade unionists ( VPL ) , which , in its own words , defends the rights of boats by orchestrating attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers .
some VPL leaders come from Paniao , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
in response to this , the army , under the pretext of &apos; defence of national sovereignty &apos; , has , in recent years , arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in Paniao .
some of them never appear again .
the people of Papua kian are known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty feeds dissatisfaction .
the little rice sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
milk is just as unattainable .
people themselves grow all of their food products , mainly at anchovy , plus a little fruit and vegetables .
farming is the work of women , each of whom can care for four or five bathing fields .
they usually hold most of the harvests to the family , the rest being sold on the local market .
ten Baha &apos;s cost only 10 000 Indonesian houses ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have deepened between the flotilla boats and new migrants from the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport to a wide range .
the few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
the Pope himself often does not have capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no jobs or money here , &apos; says John Gobai , President of the Paniai tribal Council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world out of the Pope .
in addition , strict restrictions on foreign media remain .
earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Babridge Longchamp were expelled from Pope because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , even though they had been given a rare film authorisation .
according to the Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch &apos;s Asian department , Pcomm Kine , the election promises made by Jokow to abolish the restrictions on reporting for transparency and development have not been implemented .
&quot; in Indonesia , new threats to journalists seeking to report from the most untroubled provinces in Papua kian and Western Pope are being threatened with rejection of the GHS visa and the inclusion of the blacklist , &quot; said in his statement .
the lack of an overview of media drilling means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua immediate neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries , Eurocontrol , Nauru , Belau , Tupainful , Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands , urged the UN Human Rights Council to examine &apos; various large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in Paniai , including the shooting of Paniai .
these same countries have historically also supported VPL .
Arrmanatha Nasir , the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed the group &apos;s charges by saying Jakartas to journalists : &apos; there is still democracy and freedom of the press in Indonesia , so it would be difficult to bury the evidence of cases of human rights &apos; .
the local people want to see more foreign governments .
when the Dutch official delegation , led by Mr Van Bari , visited Jayapura , the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , on 4 May , the local people interrupted their silence , according to the source that they wanted to remain anonymous , urging : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , there will be new presidential elections in 2019 , but the boats do not believe they will vote for Jokow again .
Jokowi is a man with good intentions , but the people around Jokow , who are involved in shooting Paniai , say Hobai , President of the tribal Council .
he wants to make it clear to Jokow that , apart from the chronic threat to the predatory army of Paniai people , they are suffering from misery because they are jobless in education and health services .
according to Gobai , the people of Paniai , like other boats , consider their vote to Jokow as debt he has to pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the misgivings and intimidation , the families of the rebel victims of Paniai managed to land with a last symbolic insurgency , with a single victim &apos;s body of police and army inmates .
knowing that justice can never be done , at least they will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Yacobu &apos;s head .
&apos;What else can we do ? &apos;
came second time before Dubai Torch &apos;s profiteer
on Friday , one of the highest residential blocks in the world was eaten in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from this 337 metre high and 79 @-@ clean building .
this is the second fire that has devastated the High Hall , which is called Torchi , in just two years .
the building was evacuated , none of the injuries were reported and there were no direct reasons for fire .
&quot; we sleeping and waking up the fire and the fear of people .
we would be waiting for a trainers and it took us some 10 minutes to get out of the 1950s , &apos; said Reutersi a resident who called himself George .
according to Dubai civil protection officials , the fire fighters also deleted the site at around 4 a.m. in a local time ( 00.00 GMT ) and cut off the building .
the government said they were working to guarantee shelter for the victims .
this incident may once again raise questions about the safety of high @-@ quality foreign materials throughout the world .
the investigation by the steering Board in Torch after the fires in 2015 found that the most damage was caused by the decordial panels and isolation of the Corsators , the external scene .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenreasury , Tower insulation and fast @-@ track panels , could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire that occurred there in June , with nearly 80 deaths .
see : these phones are likely to be sales hits in the autumn
Kenya and coal are a time for technological investors , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came to the wall , and in the autumn , new Hitt @-@ phones are expected for poelephants .
according to the director of Tele2 marketing and sale , Christian jan Sema , today &apos;s flagships are characterised by innovative design , eye @-@ fast shandner , screen @-@ servani 4K with a resolution and ultra @-@ fast Process .
in the world of technology , Samsung Galaxy S8 , which has also reached the forefront of the Estonian smartphone distribution table , has aroused great excitement .
autumn will allow even more advanced high @-@ speed chargers , more robust batteries , better quality cameras and greater water and customs certainty for smart primates .
he added that , on the basis of rumours , you can already speculate and predict four peak models that are likely to conquer up the street .
these four top @-@ level models for smartphones will be reached for boys later this autumn .
the expected iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to reach the shops in mid @-@ September .
however , the flooding that the new Apple model looks at and what can be done with it is spreading widely .
if iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences along iPhone 6s , Apple &apos;s tenth birthday is expected to see the new model completely separate from previous ones .
four colours have been spoken : black , white , rosé gold and chromium .
one of the elements of the new design will probably be a screen covering the full phone call , a loss of dogs and fingerprints on the screen .
JonyIve , the head of Apple design , demands that the new iPhone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk of an iPhone version .
in addition to an eye @-@ fast charger , a wireless charger and an even higher quality cameras , one can expect more rapid A11 processes .
it is certainly one of the most expected smart phones for one year .
the outsourcing of Galaxy gates 8 , a novel model , will start on 23 August .
there have been a lot of rumours about the new Galaxy club 8 .
Admittedly , there is even more business users and S pen allows for even greater functional functions .
the telephone should have two cameras , one of which is lainurry and the other with a narrow view of television .
at present , no one yet knows what two rebates are capable of , but in any case , it is the first Samsung experiment , which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8 in terms of quality .
however , we are eagerly awaiting 23 August .
although Nokia has brought sales this year with Nokia 6 , the three smart phones at the head of Nokia , there is still a lack of their flag ships - Nokia 8 , which will be presented on 16 August .
we expect from Nokia to 5.3 p.m. from then to the screen and ultra @-@ fast Qualcomm Smberdragon 835 stages and a more durable one .
in the case of Nokia , there is also talk of aluminium corps and significant levels of water and customs security IP68 .
like Samsulas , Nokia &apos;s new model has two taboos produced by Zeiss .
while Sony &apos;s fixed flag vessel has so far been XZ Premium , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smart phones with ever more innovative functionalities will be added in the near future .
we await a smartphone which is a little more modest than XZ Premium , but at least with the same good or better cameras .
with regard to the new model of Sony , it has been speculated that its screen is at least hot .
what reality brings us to see already soon , because traditionally , Sony has unveiled its autumn flag ship at the International Technology Treasury , which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September .
Trump Mexico pressed for payment of the border wall , according to leaks of telephone calls
the Washington post made public telephone calls between US President Donald Trumpi and Mexican and Australian heads .
on 27 January , Trump &apos;s telephone statement to the President of Mexico , Enrique Pena Nieto , went to the effect that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President craved with him for public condemnation of the wall , crying out : &apos; you must not say that to the press &apos; .
the band fixed its presidential campaign on the promise to build a long wall and age for the southern border of the United States to make Mexico pay for this project .
the transcriptions were also published of his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turnbull , which reveals an intense debate .
the band said to the Turnrist that the agreement that the United States would take refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; nerve &apos; and &apos; stupid &apos; , stating that the agreement reached under the Obama Administration would give him the impression &apos; lead &apos; , as it has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees in the United States .
the band ended the speech by stating to the Turnbull that &apos; this was the most unpleasant speech of the day &apos; .
the Court did not take up the town of OC MRP Lite with a complaint in the case of the town of Tartu rejecting their offer for the procurement of bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 2029 .
it is a letter rejecting the offer of the town of AC MRP at Tartu &apos;s bus and coach procurement , as the offer did not meet the requirements , explained by Anneli Abufftin , Head of the Civil Service of Tartu .
this is the procurement of direct bus and coach transport within Tartu &apos;s city for the period 01.07.2019 @-@ 30.06.2029 .
the city of MRP Liberia addressed the ruling of the Tartu District Court to the Supreme Court .
it was not brought before the Court of Justice .
although many people in the social media complain that a blown from the Weeky Festival is disrupting their night and that the whole city is full of drink @-@ driving brakers , there are also many who do not have any negative words to say about the festival on the flotilla .
I am even positively surprised that there were so many solemn visas in the shops !
I did not see any ambiguity or miscourtesy .
even from generosity I saw &apos; , there is a pious wave .
&quot; it is nice that he is coming , there is a joy and a joy of the Persia , which is like winter , &apos; , he is happily adding .
the wave of rubber @-@ coding is not destroyed .
while he still died in a central town that beach music is being played on the beach , now music has not yet reached his own egg .
&apos;but I hope I hear &apos; , he happily says .
also at the hearing in Agnes , the great festival is a good thing for the Performance - a good contribution to the turnover of local merchants .
it also welcomes the fact that the summer capital has come so much to a standstill .
the women of conscience do not come into play .
although I am no longer on the beaches , it is good that rand has revitalised .
and it is nice that the people are moving , and that has been the case three times now , &apos; she says .
perhaps the first time was a little worse .
&apos;That was perhaps complaints &apos; , he is wondering .
but , as he said , what is happening on the beach is commonplace for the summer capital cities .
&quot; this Weeky is a very good prophet for our small city , &quot; says Harri on the park .
Mever and midnight have not hit his elabyss either .
but for what ?
we should all pull together .
think about how this interethnic communication would be better .
after all , the music man is not black .
it is not about it , although I live near there .
&quot; good people can save and have no misfortune , &quot; he says .
the visitors who came to the Arctic are , as he said , visa @-@ free .
&quot; with the bottles they have , of course , also joined a little , but young people are young people and issant - give way , but be people and we can do it ! &apos; she says &apos;
the population on the ground has travelled off the ground by then , whether to relatives or to acquaintances .
&quot; but overall , the festival lives are having a positive impact - people like this mememory , &quot; The Vanus is talking to her children as a Tiina .
his family &apos;s und festival model is also not destroyed , even though it was farmed even further than it was in the street last year .
last summer , we heard more .
we live outside the city ourselves , saying that in fact it is a long way off the coast of the Persian river , &apos; he is speaking .
Pearson cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revitalise business
the British education company Pearson said on Friday that it will cut 3 000 more jobs and reduce its intermediate dividend by 72 % , thereby launching yet another restructuring programme to address the risks to business .
the planned jobs , which , according to John Fallon , CEO , will be concentrated at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will be added to the 4 000 posts lost in the previous restructuring exercise .
Pearson announced in May the plan to cut costs by another GBP 300 million ( USD 394 million ) under the third expenditure reduction programme in order to try and revive the business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning .
a company that agreed to sell last month &apos;s share of the company Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann said that their expectations for a year had not changed since the announcement of a 1 % increase in sales income in the first half of the year .

Kabul : a suicide attack killed a NATO soldier
according to officials , the suicide bombers attacked military convoys in Kabul , the capital of Afghanistan , killing one NATO soldier and several other injured .
the NATO statement stated that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to unconfirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in Qarabaghi .
this bombarment is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month , with more than 30 deaths in the Herat mosques attack on Tuesday .
on Monday two people were killed near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul suicide bombers .
NATO &apos;s statement stated that a fourth @-@ day explosion took place when joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a &apos; man @-@ made explosives &apos; .
the statement states that everything is in a stable state and is treated at the airport of Bagram in a US military hospital .
according to the correspondent , the increasing power of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( Pakistan ) is a source of serious concern for the forces in Bagram NATO .
according to UN data , in the first half of 2017 at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan , about 20 % of them in capital .
at the end of July , the car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people in the band of Shi &apos;ite .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in central town - the most deaths have been the military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces failed the Taliban force in 2001 .
this violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country &apos;s military and police .
according to the correspondent reports , the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also resulted in a public confidence crisis against the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf Ghan .
the EPA repealed the decision to postpone the oral amendment
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United Environmental Protection Agency Synergy ) annulled the decision to delay the Obama @-@ day regulation , which obliges states to limit emissions from whiting gases , one day after 15 states were sued to court by the Agency for this process .
EPA reported on the decision to proceed with &apos; buy @-@ in @-@ content @-@ marking procedures for 2015 &apos; late on Wednesday , saying that it demonstrates the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with the states .
&quot; we believe that we must engage in dialogue and listen to our partners in our states , &quot; said Scott Pruitt , the head of Economic Partnership .
Pruitt had announced in June that it would have deferred the ozone content levels in the GCC in various parts of the country in order to determine where its level of compliance with the highest air quality standard should be reduced by a further year until 2013 to SMS .
15 predominantly democratic states , together with the Colombian district of Columbia , presented an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision was illegal .
President Donald Trumpi &apos;s government has tried to bring back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to the Trumpi , is part of a broader plan to boost growth .
however , these attempts have provoked reactions among the democrats and conservation groups concerned by the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that the introduction of a ozone @-@ containing air &apos; may reduce the employability of Coptic workers and increase the risk of falling into respiratory diseases &apos; , such as asthma .
German cigarettes can come to a standstill .
German pigs and bovine animals can come in because heavy rainfall threatens the second largest wheat producer in the European Union , writes Bbeef berg .
this year , it can be said that the weekend @-@ to @-@ day sailing before harvesting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry would only be fed to animals .
&quot; the quality of content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; the analysis of Agras Raiffeisen said Mr Bernhard Piecyla .
this year , up to 40 % of the German nit for animal feed , which is from dozen to normal , is predicted in Agrad .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have experienced any beauty this year .
first of all , winter was too cumbersome .
then there was a cold spring , replaced by heat bulbs in June .
in July , Germany was hit by the incidents , which have continued in August .
many eyes have been turned to northern Germany , where the rain is blocking harvesting .
so far , only five per cent of the nightmare have been cleared .
most of the regions have not yet had a harvest status , stating the local buyer of the harvest in Ceras .
&quot; this is quite a difficult day , &quot; said Frank Deckert Rendsburg , the senior trader of Ceravis .
consistency in everything , in other words , soomy roofs of internal design of Finns
in Cauna , nature plays its part in the internights of nursery homes , as , through major windows , the equated views of the Saimaa fishermen reach many ( life ) tobacco .
every step is marked by the aspiration of our northern neighbours to create both hard and perfect ( energy saving ) homes .
self @-@ sufficiency , as well as compliance , merit the ability of Finns to use wood as construction and processing material , furniture and beauty .
virtual keys and smart solutions can be found in Tasty houses , both as a builder and as ( home ) builder .
it is striking there that black , white and grey compounds , if they are supplemented by wood storms and topes , can be very entertaining .
good ideas can be launched for a week to come , as the Fair will run until 13 August .
Tarvis and spices suggest that this kitchen is often copied .

when winter ended , a common mask of Czechs was dispersed from the city .

Mainy Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mainy Garcia , who should be on a collision course to face up to the most attractive potasy of the near future in a weighted category of up to 66.7 kg , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were at the office of the ESPN in LOS Angeles in separate tobacco , up to the Garcia , the bospel of the unrivalled World BoWashington Council , walked to the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenkot , the closing of World BoRivelzationi .
following the unanimous decision of Garcia , the victory of the former four @-@ time world champion , Adrien Broner , on Saturday in Showajar , both combatants are at the top of the table .
Garcia extended its better hand and said : &apos; how does you go , how does you go , cheer ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
Lomachenko will defend his bar Miguel Marriga against Saturday evening in 19 ESPN .
when a couple of photos were available , Esis Klimas , a mountain man of Lomachenko , said that there would be a &apos; perfect yardstick &apos; between the combatants .
&quot; I am a former consultant , &quot; recalled Garcia .
&quot; I grew up for Bronger &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small per 63.5 kg .
I want to move downwards .
and it needs to move upwards lighter &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the games have asked for this .
let us offer them this . &quot;
Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; the world of Poxing needs this fight . &quot;
the climate raised the question of whether it should be cost @-@ effective : part of its strategy of allowing Lomachenkol to rent the debate later this year in the 61.2 kg class to make it possible to meet with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 novans ) , who also has an interest in fighting the victory of Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbell after their friction of 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be cost @-@ effective , as fans have called for this confrontation , &quot; said Garcia , later , that she is open to fighting any channel that offers the best financial package .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name can attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Mrs Garcia said she considered Lomachenkot to be a &apos; force fighter &apos; and she could go to see her match on Saturday .
Lomachenko , however , was humble in praising Garcia , saying that she felt that she saw the champion of three divisjons from Riverside , &apos; very slow ; sorry , Mainy ... you wanted it &apos; .
according to Garcia , the aim was to show shock and then poke up .
both confirmed that they felt the increase in tension between them in order to meet the challenge of prosperity .
&quot; this is a fight that awaits realisation .
no other confrontation arouses so much attention and gender .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Garcia .
Lomachenko said , &apos; I have been waiting for the best combatants and Mainy is exactly that .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
which world incursions are being moved to Estonia ?
soil was extended and awarded a record number of more than 13 000 residence permits to third @-@ country nationals mostly travelling to Estonia for work , study or family .
when , for example , soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit for 6702 foreigners , this figure was 4928 .
the agencies cannot say how many immigrants ultimately remain in Estonia , but such an analysis is being drawn up within the Ministry of the Interior .
while , ten years ago , nearly 500 Ukrainians travelled to Estonia a year , in recent years , this figure will reach 2000 .
the number of applicants for residence increased exponentially during the Ukrainian crisis , with 1087 fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , a year before 675 .
in Estonia , we have the largest increase in the number of Ukrainian citizens , with the population of 850 Ukraine left in Estonia .
&quot; the Ukrainian community in Estonia has always been high , and it is natural that , due to difficult circumstances in the country , work and learning opportunities are being sought from a country in which the community and many others are already in front of the family &apos; , the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior , Kristin Rammus , stated .
soil and Cape Verde had a fixed @-@ term residence permit even higher than the number of Russian citizens , even though in ten years the number of fixed @-@ term residence permits have been issued to the latter .
when Ukrainians come here predominantly , Russian citizens come here for family migration .
&quot; in view of the historical Russian community here , they are also most likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said Helina Meing , the migrant theatre of the Internal Security Agency .
&apos;When you look at where Russian citizens who have benefited from Estonian residence have moved to , after Harjuland , there is now East Viruland &apos; , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them had married to a citizen of the European Union .
soil received a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit was reduced .
&quot; compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending residence permits , new residence permits have been requested for permanent entry to Estonia , &quot; the press officer of the Ministry of the Interior , Rammus , explained that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia &apos;s residence permit has remained stable for years .
the new residence permit for permanently located in Estonia will be available to foreigners living here for at least three years last year .
its aim is to encourage the dwardness of the people who are adapting .
however , long @-@ term residence permits require , for example , five years .
the extension of the old residence permit has also obviously declined for new residence permits .
for example , soil was given such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
now the Ukrainians can exchange work and the Estonian state no longer draws the finger at whether the pay criterion has been met .
this residence permit became popular : applicants for holders of a bad ( 1029 ) , Russians ( 487 ) , individuals ( 54 ) and noigers ( 36 ) .
a total of 1968 people , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 Georgians and as many Chinese , received a residence permit to settle in Estonia for the purpose of living .
this year &apos;s first half , the total number of such applicants is already 1269 .
in 10 years , Nigeria has become a staggering country with one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence .
when , in 2007 , three residence permits were issued to the young people , the soil was 200 .
Nigeria comes out of Nigeria to learn from these universities .
universities in Estonia are also popular , for example among Georgians , Chinese and Turks .
the number of Indian , Bangladesh and Nigeria citizens has increased largely due to student movements .
they also have the rule that , where the community is ahead , it will be easier to come to others , &quot; added Rammus .
in ten years two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , just as much from Laos and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 from South Korea , 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay .
while around 6,000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit per year , this is approximately 0.46 % of the total population .
even if you add to the citizens of the European Union , migration remains close to around a percentage , &quot; said Making that in fact the figures are small .
in total , 14 822 people emigrated to Estonia , out of which 13 792 were deported according to the statistical office .
this means that immigration exceeded emigration for the second year .
most of those who move and move are Estonian citizens , but there are more of them among those who are leaving .
as a result , Estonian citizens had a flood of 2 000 inhabitants .
Estonians , in particular , are emigrating between Finland and Estonia .
long ago Couture Princssimood heralds with sawn , thieves and sweets
in the north @-@ west of the story , however , there is history for Mrs Tampere - old fathers and defendants : &apos; I can dream of somewhere in the museum for hours and old @-@ age theft and crazy .
if you go down the road , you will study and learn about it every day .
this is a joy of discovery !
the world of Couture may seem like some life @-@ alien , but the designer does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much you are in your life !
as a friend , I have a whole saun full of the wounds couture that I have created .
because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not go on red whip every day , he also wants to wear the most beautiful brokers and she suffers !
you can live your own lives special !
the mobile artist does not recognise the Gulf between shining events and bad days .
it was this reasoning that drove out the plan to put high @-@ ranking countries in Estonia , between forests and fields , into people who often do not get anywhere .
the Manifesto was presented , for example , in comparison , Jevening and Pergraph moeallel , where 45 modelled Royal defilee filled the whole street .
in Tallinn , you are often picked up in shops , dressed up with dignity , but elsewhere there are more emotions - Welsh blarvo , standing up , wanting to thank you .
a large proportion of the audience had to be equally curious , but now they are the Mouture fans of the Couture .
if you exceed the expectations of the people , they will be delighted !
and I like the feeling that I am like my motives like the summer recess .
Pernus had a red carpet of 50 metres , full of bicycles on the streets , it seemed that they would not come to an end !
she also does not accept the fashionable idea that creation must be presented by a superficial supermodell , which will happily bring about ordinary women .
often I call my own customers in the Gulf - they have always come with pleasure .
after all , it is so layers of experience , you have found a shining thread on the ice route .
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen my own performance , I am always behind the ground in order to give the final simplification of things as a hopeless accomplice .

I like the whole process in which you played with details to discover .
I am never far from my nature and I am not afraid of work .

these working hours are still being experienced by fanatics enormously .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a joy !
I am still very lucky - it is like a litmus test of happiness : I am doing something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and yet more complicated .
it has been said several times that my brothers have a magic character : they make themselves feel like a princsman .

Martin Myrsesemium U18 boys : the arms of the Estonians &apos; alagropeak were now turned against us !
sorry , the fairytale ran out .
the first thing that happened was that we could not get our feet .
and when there is such a big difference on the table , there is nothing to do &apos; , Estonia said U18 Korvpallipods 61 : 75 abstentions for Britain : corvballer , Coev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsep .
the opponents took 28 faces out of a wave of attacks and , as a result , received so many more attacks .
nor were we prepared to protect them and attack them , it created them .
many attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds ; we were unable to build protection .
however , in defence they managed to keep their hands everywhere , we could not combine .
it created the crew &apos;s feet .
the home work against the opponents was better done .
Myrsepa estimates that Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to remove the tide of opponents .
on the last quarter , we had a mistake of zero , but had already had a number of quick harvests against opponents .
Intransigence and intense insistence , which was our weapon on alagroturney , have now been addressed to us all .
today , we did not have the strength against their aggressive character .
Myriflower remained complacent of its negligent basis in Kalevi , Matthias Tasga .
tourism in general can say fine words about the entire team , so far there was a single shock .
it is unfortunate that such an aggressive response had not been met before .
Tass has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but he seemed to have been tired - he has borne quite a heavy burden .
but he made some of the nice moves that I have seen in the past in trennides , added the mentor .
terrible figures : the corvpallililip of kidnens set out less than 10 items on EM @-@ turnitransplants with three quarter exceptions ...
in the U18 age classes , not only the young men &apos;s em B @-@ divisjon corvliturniir in Tallinn , she started the day before yesterday in Dublin .
and Estonia &apos;s game with Poland , though , was bogged down in antiremittances .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , 9 : 49 , in other words , in the last ten minutes , opponents took their feet from the gas pipeline and 16 : 16 .
in both the first and the second quarter , Estonia set out 4 , the third indent ...
in doing so , in the first two minutes , two pieces were caught by the Estonians in the first two minutes , but there were 25 pieces of the game , then there was a troika in and then 21 kicked over ...
perhaps in almost half an hour , there were 47 frames of one .
in addition , there were 2 points from four open lines .
the losses were a reasonable figure of 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland was hit 33 and Estonia 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , with Portugal having to be recognised on the open day as 83 : 56 better .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to replenish stocks
today , the NATO 1 permanent mine group arrived in Tallinn for a week @-@ to @-@ week exchange of planned port visits to supplement the stocks of vessels and prepare for the forthcoming exercise .
during the visit , ships will prepare for naming the sea , while giving crews the chance to leave their days .
after the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready to search for future historical explosives .
&quot; the participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the combined training they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with allied forces , &quot; said the head of the operation and planning unit of the navy fleet , the head of the military , the captain Arto Reinland .
since 29 June , NATO will chair the 1 permanent group of SPC Latvian navy Adviser Gvido Laudups , who took over the group &apos;s tasks from the Estonian Sea officer , Johan @-@ Elias explained , at a ceremony held in Riga .
the group &apos;s flag is LVNS Virsaitis , a Latvian naval support ship with the group leader .
during this half of the year , Estonian navies of mine hunting and Sakharov will also be part of the international force .
as one of the four groups of vessels subject to the NATO naval command , NATO 1 is a permanent anti @-@ mine group , one of the former rapid reaction teams , which the Alliance can send to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . until 13 August , the mutuals of the Pirita Monastery will once again become a place where the sweets of Birgitta Festival , which was called by Maestro Eri Kids 13 years ago , will be held .
this year &apos;s Birgitta Festival will , according to the artistic leader of Tallinn Film , risk to Joosti ( 36 ) , be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented .
risk to Joost : Cuba ends up in the class of the oopian world , &apos; Traviata &apos; and &apos; Tosca &apos; , ballelaanswers from the magic &apos; Bolerost &apos; Karlssonini &apos; , and there is also no plan for self @-@ productions , this time by the wonderful &apos; Aastaera &apos; of Joseph Haydni &apos;s wonderful oramusical &apos; by the same creative team who , in 2015 , even brought Pirilatal Hayral to the book &apos; .
Birgitta Festival has much more than just concerts and theatrical responses .
it is larger than any musical theatre in its usual form .
it is a festival whose snow is taking hold and never completely disrupts .
because the experience of which the listener receives in this superior and mysterious environment makes human spirits more generous and concerns human tragedies in a way that cannot be described .
for the first year , you are the art leader of Birgitta Festival .
did the maestro Eri KGermans not feel a little big ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has helped a great deal .
he pushed me through a whole of my student career and also supported me at the start of a dirigisme career .
perhaps this will make it easier for me to continue with his work .
the Festival team of Birgitta Festival in Clas has been so relieved of well and , of course , it is all handed over to me .
it was excellent to join a team that knows exactly how things are going .
it was the great heart of Eri KIsraelis who gave me the strength to go well with the Talşia Film , Birgitta Festival .
and here I am , and I can !
what sort of audience could this year &apos;s festival get , what do you offer in particular ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , by the way , the first ballett written to Mrs Lindgren &apos;s story , as a surprise and surprise .
it reads &apos; Karlsson lls &apos; .
and one of the criminal nüanss is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons , who himself expressed a wish to write it into action .
apparently he has already had the carater of Karlsson , a child in her breath .
at risk , how can you all kid it ?
my contribution to life is certainly due to my contribution .
such work requires a system of support and a lot of love , and fortunately I have it .
and I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend as much on other people as I am perhaps against every new day .
and this awareness of tone , maintaining a positive attitude and , in fact , naming ourselves in the mirror of the morning , significantly increased my happiness .
this week in particular , when there are the most important tests , I have been particularly keen to practise it and it works .
Stimulating ourselves is repulling the strings and raising the tone .
that is simply not a word .
I think people do not yet know what the universe is offering them , but everybody will discover it slowly .
right now , this is an important moment .
does you also have a ritual before you take the dirigent ?
there are still , clothing must be replaced against more comfortable ones .
it is a small moment for ourselves .
but in general , yes , I do not have the opportunity to pump or give a small indication before I speak .
in fact , I even like to engage actively with people , even before the dirigendium is taken .
but come to Burma all , to the Festival , which is also to be discovered not just to the great barley and the ballery .
look forward to seeing a video with the risk of Joostim !
new findings of Swedish asylum age assessment tests
the latest results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the constitution was assessed as older than 18 , but not all believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for medicine ( RSPtsSRinalverket ) started testing earlier this year .
the tests were set up to assess the age more precisely in the asylum application process , after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Migration adjustment sverket ) was criticised for failing to correctly define the age of a number of allegedly underage refugees .
so far , 68 80 cases have been sent to the test by Mr Migmigsverket , and the Institute of Justice has issued a total of 24 81 tests between mid @-@ March and 31 July 2017 .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) were estimated to be 18 or more old and 25 more were assessed by the Institute of Justice as being &apos; possibly 18 or more old &apos; .
in 432 cases , it was concluded that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
tests will only be used if people &apos;s age is in question .
according to Johan Göransson , who works in the institution of justice , the results are consistent with those of the past months .
&quot; we do not see a big difference from the statistics of previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &quot; he said to The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum applicants have been left to their age .
the Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that , in 442 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person investigated was 18 or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson Dagblad investigated the results of their 581 test , it turned out that in 243 cases the person had stated directly that he would be 18 this year .
this method of evaluating the medical age , whereby there is criticism in some quarters of the wise cord X and wastewater species MRI , which then allows them to be analysed by toothpaste doctors and radiologists .
one of the sceptics is the endokrinologist of the Karolinska Institute of Technology , Claude Marcus , whose tasks include assessing people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they were going through the normal audiences sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to reflect on this and I do not think that the measuring method currently used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very precarious .
if we cannot say clearly , we should not pretend we can , &apos; he said to the time line , Mr Metro .
but Johan Göransson , from the Institut of Justice , defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that the risk of a child becoming an adult is inaccurate .
perhaps at around 10 % , there is a risk if you are just under 18 . &quot;

Anna Maria Orel , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old dissident , made a beautiful debate in the City of London , receiving a fine 18th place with 67.37m .
after all , MM was a nofier of women and a happy woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future .
the contest went well and I got a good experience .
with the first test ( 64.80 ) , I immediately withdrew my average result , the second ( 62.80 ) I risk too much and the third ( 67.37 ) I was able to keep it quite soon , &quot; said Orel after Competition .
I took my emissions , and I am very pleased that I found that .
Ms Anna Maria Oreli MM ended up with a good 18 seats .
Mrs Orelit was not confused , as she is , after all , training the winter through the LTTE stage .
&apos;I am shred &apos; , he said with a little muddle .
the London Olympic Forum had almost a half @-@ hearted house of the people , did Orel regress around the people or were it able to turn off ?
I stood up , but in a positive sense .
everyone says it adds - that is the case !
if competition itself , it can experience it .
after all , it was confirmed that there would be some satisfaction with Mr MM &apos;s debate and that he would still have many good competitions : &apos; I came here with 32nd , the last result of this year &apos;s season , I stopped at 18 .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and Mil - that is the only thing that matters .
I am taking on a good experience , and some day I want to compete on behalf of the medals .
West Virgina kuberner announced party change
on Thursday evening , Jim Justice , the Democrat governor of West Virginia , announced that he would change political parties at a meeting with President Trumpm .
&apos;Let it or not , but the democrats walked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I say to you , having said a lot and thought @-@ out ... today I say to you , to the West , that I can no longer help you as a democratic hot guard . &quot;
the rumours of joy were cleared at the gathering .
&quot; so I will be a Republican tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a friend , I would say to you that it is time to play another game . &quot;
the band had previously promised a big announcement at the gathering of Western Virginia .
the Trump won 42 points in Western Virginias and Justice was not supported by the Democrat candidate , Hillary Clinton .
Justice , which is , according to Fortress , the only billion inhabitants of the state , was elected in 2016 .
it notes that he owns coal mines in five states and that he owns the coal business from his own father .
it is worth around USD 1.59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday evening , the National Committee of the Republican ( RNC ) published an announcement that &apos; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to the democratic party , which would rather prevent the country from being improved again rather than working towards it &apos; .
&apos;To just 15 hot spots and controls in the history of the lowest number of states - an announcement by Governor Justice is simply the most recent saying to the party that is guided by the outset and incapable of finding a positive and unifying message &apos; said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in his statement to CBS Newles .
it is no surprise , perhaps , that where there are many people , there are also many injured .

Villes and furniture fats are fundamental , excuses and simple defaults .
of course , there will also be cargoes , strikes and shoes .
Urmet says that visitors come to the Festival with false footwear and so problems come .
the media have also had to provide assistance to visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic cases , as well as one shower breaks .
we have also made novelty when a person has broken his hand or his finger .
we are doing smaller nurses here ; we are sending more nurses to hospitals .

Coe praised the honest apologies of the Russians for the doping scandal
the international dimension of the Lighten , Sebastian Coe , was praised for his words &apos; Russia &apos;s apologies for Thursday &apos; Doping , but repeated that now is not the time to allow sport back to the country .
at the last night of the Excellency World Cup , Dmitry Shylithtin , a Russian athlery , said at the ICAO Congress in the run @-@ up to the Furry World Cup that the ban on competitions against his country was right and he had a strong aim to fight doping .
he apologised to &apos; all lighter Christmas classes , from whom golden and silver medals have been squeezed in competitions &apos; .
despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the competition ban , which was introduced in November 2015 after the WADA report found evidence of state @-@ sponsored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think this was a very honest answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said to the press by the President of IAAF .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian League itself recognised that they had had rather complicated times and that they would do everything they could to reorganise the permanent alliance . &quot;
Coe also said he was pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own recovery .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the proposal of the Working Group that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; we must do everything possible in the next few months to normalise the situation .
we have always invoked the principle that we want to separate clean sportsmen and sportsmen from the broken system , &quot; she added .
Sixteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF are competing neutral athletes in the light of the lightweight World Cup , starting in London on Friday .
Rune Andersen , the head of the IAAF working group , said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet several criteria for recovery .
following a presentation to the IAAF Council , he told the press in London that doping control is still insufficient and that the trained engineers who have been banned are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution is changing dramatically the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
not only does the electric car revolution change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure , it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market .
although mining giants like Glencore can say that they will win from one place and lose out from the other , smaller mining firms will not help .
currently , Glencore coal and oil are serving , but in the era of electric cars , demand for cobalt , lithium , copper , aluminium and nickel will increase .
this year &apos;s decisions by the governments of the United Kingdom , France and Norway to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels have been raised in relation to the spread of electric cars .
therefore , Mr Volvo has already announced that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and that Tesla will bring onto the market a cheaper parameter of electricity .
Breatberg New Energy Finance estimates that , for two decades now , electric cars will be sold more than oil @-@ generated cars .
&quot; with regard to some metals , &quot; the Capital Economics Economics raw materials analyze Simona Gambranin Bbeef .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium , which have been growing demand for years .
electricity cars have about three times as many copper as ordinary cars , reported Glencore .
more answers are needed at charging stations , which is why Exane BNP Paris estimates that it will increase domestic demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
an increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for lithium , cobalt , graphite and mangangs .
Glencore will benefit from an increasing trend in electric cars from copper prices and from being the largest cobalt producer in the world , according to the Jeffreau Group forecast .
this broker company estimates that Freexports @-@ McMoRan and First QuanSafer Minerals will be the winners of the race for electric cars .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 percent of the London stock of metals has been caught .
soil price increases were 37 % .
the copper has also been captured this year by 14 % , mainly due to economic growth .
the share of Glencore in London rose by 20 % , exceeding the price rise to the rival Rio Tat Group , BHP Billitoni and Anglo Erdoğan .
on the side of the losers , lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine will have to adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ use of the bar is the batteries supplying the starters of cars with petrol and diesel engines with a flow of starters .
electric cars use glaciers .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; Michael Widmer , Chief analysis of the metallic market in the Bank of America , said .
the impact of the battery trend in price movements is not yet noticeable .
Plip has shrunk 17 % this year , with a price rise in London as the best metaphor for major industrial metals .
investors see problems for metals only a long way from the future .
&quot; I am not sure it will be so bad for lead , because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive , &quot; said Herwig Schmidt , the venue for the sale of Triland Metals .
if lead demand falls , it will be slow .
this may be the case in about ten years &apos; time .
meanwhile , stricter emission standards mean that demand for hybrid cars , which is regularly dependent on lead @-@ based batteries when engines are launched , will be assessed by the international lead and research organisation .
Kergmetallic meters like aluminium are substituting steel , as a lighter car can drive more with less electricity .
it explains an additional demand of 1.6 million tonnes from 2013 to 2016 .
it accounts for 2.7 % of the world &apos;s aluminium production .
this trend is likely to intensify , says Widmer .
the Aluminium has been fishing for 13 % this year , as growing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
steel producers will not .
the holding of ak Ssunway holding cooperates with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce miracle cars .
ArcelorMittal and VIIe Europe are also trying to develop a lighter meltdown from steel in order to resist the minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be a response to this development , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris &apos;s analysis , Sylvain Brunet .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to plates .
soil took around half of this precious diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , according to Johnson Matms .
&quot; many raw materials with a high demand today , such as oil and plate , may not have a great deal of demand in the future , &quot; the Natixis raw materials analyst Bernard Dahdah said .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole are becoming less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
Plato manufacturers believe in continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc Grynberg , leader of the Uncore , said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold .
the great hope of the Platiers in the 10 @-@ year perspective is for cars based on the hydrogen element developed by Toyota Motors and Hydal Motos , which depend on poster to produce electricity from hydrogen .
until now , however , this technology has not yet legalised itself commercially .
&quot; the Lady seems to have a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris from Brunet .
German car manufacturers suffered a severe setback in July , as the Stuttgart court refused to use diesel in the home town of Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche .
how the financial rules for football will affect the transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent the record transfer of Neyra from the Spanish football club to the French club of Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences of UEFA , the governing body , which dominates the European game and which has the power to ban crews from taking part in the League of Ministers of the prestigious Meisters , await Paris in front of Saint @-@ GerMay .
the Financial rules on fair play ( FFFP ) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that the PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neyra was funded without huge losses .
EUR 222 million ( USD 262 million ) were paid to Barcelona alone for the purchase of its contract by the Brazilians , and the pay of Neyra will reach tens of millions of dollars per year .
there are some financial aspects of Ms Neyra &apos;s transition to the French club .
the PSG will undoubtedly be able to pick up such money to recruit Neyra and add its stars to a multitude of riders , given that the team is funded by the family in charge of the Katar energy crisis .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot in order to recruit players , but they must balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out of their football business .
FFP was set up by Michel Platini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
it was the former French player who believed that the clubs , who are in search of success in search of debt , were actually involved in deceiving and risking ruin if the banks or owners were to give up their support .
since 2011 , FFFP will focus on monitoring these losses instead of the debts of clubs .
this change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 - shopping a club with potential and then spending hard to improve the crew and create a global brand - is harder to implement .
FFFP can bear losses of up to EUR 30 million during the current three @-@ year evaluation period , which runs until 2018 .
and despite the blatant exclusion of Platini from the presidential office in 2015 , his successor , Alexander Ceferin , remains committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; FFFP is certainly not dead , and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said last week The Inclusion Ppressed , Andrea Traverso , UEFA @-@ s FFP .
although PSG &apos;s remuneration for the Neyra overpurchase clause is one of the full payments , they will be able to distribute this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the contract .
Mrs Neymar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it will be possible to show a transitional fee in the next five years as the sum of EUR 44.4 million .
on the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , the PSG , together with Manchester Cityga in Abu Dhabi , received the most severe penalties .
a fine of EUR 60 million ( currently USD 82 million ) was imposed on the PSG , subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million , and a restriction on the team of the Meisters League of Ministers was requested in the period 2014 @-@ 2015 for 21 players instead of conventional 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs who can attempt to overturn the regulatory authorities by blowing up their income through companies linked to club owners .
while a dozen company may sponsor the PSG , if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
this was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Qatar tourism was worth the PSG support .
it has been said that some of Mrs Neyra &apos;s PSG service may come from KaInfrastructure through the contributions of the World Cup Committee of 2022 .
however , the PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neyra would be a member of the World Cup and claim that UEFA regulators would be able to easily reveal such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not pre @-@ empted the switch to PSG Neyra .
they spoke with Ms PCongress on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG .
the latest reports published show that the PSG earned more than € 10 million in profits at around € 542.4 million in 2012 @-@ 2016 .
the latest financial year data have not yet been published .
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have a positive impact on sponsorship transactions , trade and distribution of labels .
the club is looking forward to an increase of at least 30 percent in connection with the conclusion of the agreement .
Spain too , clearly irritated by the withdrawal of one of the largest football stars , attempted to block the transition of Neyra , claiming that the PSG was violating FFP .
&quot; this is a clear case of &quot; financial doping &quot; with club and country , &quot; said La ga President Javier Tebas AS , Spanish newspaper , indicating that the PSG was primarily a member of the Qatar .
Aren.htm Wenger , the archipelago of Arsenal , whose club belongs to American sporting magne , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger on Thursday .
&quot; when a club belongs to a country , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the country may have other ways or other interests so that such a large player can represent the country . &quot;

50 years ago today : the hurricane storm in Estonia , which broke off houses and windows .
the hurricane of the century , which raged on 6 and 7 August , caused major damage , particularly to the Baltic , the Harbour and the Raplalahland .
the Northwest Estonia was over 30 m / s during these days .
my old herd ran from one map to another in the garden , with orders to support them .
everything was blind and graphic , as was the global lesson .
Taamal has already passed the roofs from houses , recalling in 2002 the magazine of Linda Kurova Haapsalt in an interview with Estonian Nature .
the husband of Linda saw the houses he planted collapsed .
but what are you going to support with your hands , where are you going against such a storm ?
the sea came under the window , from windows to water &apos; , Mrs Linda tone , who lived on the streets of Haapsalus Kalda , spoke .
the fact that the roads were full and the cabin coverage of the railway station had been flying from 20 to 30 metres , saw Linda as the majority of wounds only next morning .
according to local reports , the hanging from Paralepa was hopeless , some are completely lengthy , some are boys .
everyone saw a very frustrating storm , with the beautiful old trees raging and pragmatism going through like a war .
Western Viruland was not particularly severely affected by the 1907 August storm , compared with Western Estonia , but the damage was huge there , written by the Viruland Official Journal in 2007 .
Sharapsalu Lfossil Park and the Padise Park were swept away from the ground , but our parks were also severely affected .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured at a speed of up to 35 metres per second , or around 130 kilometres per hour .
in Tallinn , Meriteral , on the evening of 6.August , a tears shout of lead : &apos; mother , mother !
the chicken is in the air and is no longer in place ! &quot; wrote the Viruland Official Journal .
the generational term in Viljandiland was destroyed by a storm so much that it was later decided to be dismantled .
Türi &apos;s ski @-@ mounted design was not opposed to the August storm , which was later not restored .
the newspaper Red Tung wrote on 12 August 191967 that the reconstruction of towns and settlements from mahalaned trees and their toys is progressing slowly , and the population could get involved in cleaning work .
fruit fields were also severely affected in Turin , and the newspaper reported that &apos; party organisations must be both an incentive and a guide for cleaning and fertility . &apos;
Orkades can be spoken of when average wind speeds exceed 32.7 m / s .
the net wind record in Estonia remains from 2 November 1969 , when Ruhknul measured the wind at 48 m / s .
Vaindstory on the island crushed the meter , so the strong wind measured there could not be registered accurately .
secret of ancient bathing areas : night @-@ night work on cleaning and poor coastline
the richer summer holidays also mean a smaller repeat effort in the beaches of Tallinn .
&apos;If there is no people on the beach , and if not , there are no people &apos; , the corner is recognised as the bearer .
Stroom , the town of Northern Tallinn , is preoccupied by cool beaches .
they are offered by a trauma tractor at low turn of competition that drives the poster down the triipe .
in fact , the last seven centimetres go from the depths of the sand , clearing out sea litter and the risk that people are left behind : pumps , cigarette packs and so on .
people still come to rank , regardless of whether water is soya or not .
if it is beautiful , then people are on the beach and , if not , there are no people either , &apos; the management of Haabersti says Alexander Usov , the head of the corn work of the company .
there is 6.30 p.m. and there is a bitter flat @-@ off operation on the beach , because at 8 : 00 the plate must be in order for the people .
Uproval is already at 4 : 00 .
apart from Stroom , he is still on the verge of Pirita , Harku Lake , Cakumäe and Paltiaare Pikakar .
the amounts of Prüm have fallen .
years ago , it was much more .
people can now already assess what is being done for them , &apos; Usov , who has multiplied the boat for 15 years .
before that , it was the case that , when something new was set up , it was already a day ago .
now what is on the ground is being kept .
prices of clean beach
one of the biggest entries on Estonian beaches is the clearing of the sea rubble , the admire .
for example , in Piria , it must be removed from the coastal season by 400 000 tonnes .
&apos;It is an incredible figure &apos; , notes Usov .
the second large category of municipal waste , that is , all that people are leaving behind , is the municipal waste .
one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ kilometre coastal Stroom has eight large wolf seiners , which need to be dumped three times a week .
so much will come of rubbish .
however , the cold summer weather has meant that the waste is by a fifth less than otherwise .
the third species comprise abandoned things .
in most cases , these are cargo flights .
as a beneficiary , the Usov sand has dumped ten metres out of the slump .
they are waiting for owners to go down the route leading to timber .
&apos;normally , they come out more , but that is normal harvests &apos; ; Usov already knows that she will soon find them in the sand again .
children come to rank and take toys in order to repump them into the sand .
&quot; Prüm &quot; is being broken
Erika Scholler , the administrative service representative , admitted that the work of the tractor was disrupted at local level .
noise lasting from night to night is hampering the souls of the people living in the neighbourhood .
however , this work is impossible on a day .
in one month , the rand will have to go through twice .
&quot; if we do not do that , we will be fined in the city of Scholler . &quot;
however , like Pirita , Pikakar and Peru , the aim is also to get Stroom rand to the quality mark of the international sinia flag .
&quot; there is much more work in Estonia than Europe to keep beaches in place , says Scholler .
we have more adolescence , more bullets and a harder war of sand .
however , our beaches are less rubble than anywhere else in Europe .
when you hear that there is talk of rubbish on the beach , a vibrant circle of journalists and coral workers near Stroom , highlighting the current bottlenecks .
Homo is a picture everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is with birds and wooden slaves who have pulled the rubbish bags in the first place &apos; , Martin says .
although it is hard to assume that people can change their habits so far , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the waste slogans and put them on the cave , for example , to prevent birds at least getting afoot there .
in general , however , Mr Stroom &apos;s star is satisfied with developments .
we can see that the city is taking care of this .
it has become more pleasant with children &apos;s fins , enlightened and newly asphoned roads .
it used to be the case that only one route was allowed to travel on the site , &quot; says Martin .
bread in Stroom : coins , only coins
the ten @-@ year @-@ old Dimitri , who , as an island village , is strangling the coastline with a metal detector , has had to be exploited .
it does not believe that something price will be found today or in the future .
marine jewels are not generous enough to do so .
&quot; I have been working on this for a year and have so far found nothing valuable , &quot; says Dmitry .
as a crude village , Dmitry &apos;s archipelago is a few euro coins , pumps and also a dangerous pound which later dump into the bin .
normally there are coins .
&quot; culture , finger @-@ pointing and so on are usually not , &quot; says the village of the island .
Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25 %
Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level , as weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have cushioned speculation in relation to the increase .
Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain a lottery as household incomes have been driven by interest rates .
policy makers in the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MPC ) voted 6 : 2 for 0.25 % retention and fewer Members demand an increase this month as slow growth has weakened support for growth .
in its quarterly inflation report , the bank cut its 2017 growth forecast from 1.7 % to 1.6 % in 2018 and 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes remained , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also signalled that the increase in the rate will be necessary to contain inflation due to Brextis over the next few years , and the expected increase in lending costs on the financial markets may be necessary .
Members also voted a year ago in favour of partial withdrawal of the mammoth package on the economy which is being launched as a result of Brext .
the Bank will end in February with a fixed @-@ term financing scheme providing banks with cheap financing , even though it said that now , under this scheme , it would be expected to make a 15 billion bigger offer , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the judgment on the rate , the bank says : &apos; in the mid @-@ term forecast of the MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain powerless in the near future , as the difficult situation of real household incomes continues to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
as regards the rates , it was repeated that , in order to mitigate inflation , some tightening up of the &apos; financial policy &apos; was necessary , to the extent that the markets were expected to do so .
Mr rs is now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any form of hypertension is gradual and limited .
Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
the forecast of 1.8 % growth in 2018 remained .
after this new , the pound fell against the dollar and the euro .
a drop of 0.5 % to 1.31 dollars and 0.4 % to 1.11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have muted the growing expectations of the increase in retail GDP in the second quarter of the previous three months to 0.3 % .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will start to boost slightly .
the Bank &apos;s most recent inflation report gave little reason for rejoicing rising inflation and abject wage @-@ raising households , saying that the situation will go a little worse before improvements were made .
it was added that monetary policy could not prevent an income @-@ hit shock over the next few years , but wages are expected to recover significantly towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
the pound &apos;s pound also encourages the economy to grow demand for British production , partly compensating for lower costs for consumers .
the decision comes one year after the 0.25 % rates were taken last August after the shocking EU referendum , which caused a sudden weakening of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to breathe into full benefits for prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision , there was a growing demand for higher rates , as inflation had increased pressure on hard households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth , compared to the 2 % target , was due to a completely weak pound .
Andrew Montlake , President of Coreco hypothetical brokers , said : &apos; in view of the recent downturn in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive once again , as creditors are losing their jobs and hoping to end the year positively .
Eurostars seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as refinancing , often without service and at a low rate , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
NHS launches 10 000 HIV @-@ related drugs
patients will have access , from September onwards , to &apos; transformational &apos; HIV preventive treatment after the battle against the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the medicine .
NEngland stated that public health now made available , during the initial three @-@ year clinical trials , an estimated 10 000 people , pre @-@ arranged contact prophylactic ( PrEP ) , a tablet manageable before the incident , showing a reduction of approximately 86 % in the risk of infected people .
the NHS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported last year &apos;s ruling by the Supreme Court , according to which the NHS is able to pay for PrEP , despite its own claims that the medicine should instead be financed by local authorities .
Simon Stebankers , Executive Director of NHS , welcomed the launch unveiled on Thursday as &apos; new , far @-@ reaching intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NAT ) described it as a &apos; pivotal moment &apos; .
Canal health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpolis and Sheffield are among the first to register people , and in October there will be further trials before the programme is introduced everywhere in England by April 2018 .
Cinema pre @-@ disability prophylactic ( PrEP ) is a hotline for HIV drugs , which will be taken before the interim period in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces transmission of HIV among people with a risk of infection .
taking PrEP before the mid @-@ term review means that there are sufficient amounts of medicines in the body that prevent HIV from being infected .
such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the interim period .
among the opportune candidates are LGBT men , transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot receive treatment .
clinical people who agree to be involved in clinical trials , including men , women , transgender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partners cannot receive antiretroviral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate at a local sexual health clinical in the participating programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed the contract to receive medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the aim of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in large cloud .
SteLithuanians said : &apos; this new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and intensify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
this is another milestone in the fight against one of humanity &apos;s biggest health problems in more than three decades . &quot;
Deborah gold , CEO of NAT , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
PrEP , if it is targeted correctly at those in need and in the middle of risk , provides an opportunity to change the UK &apos;s HIV epidemic .
since September , people at high risk of HIV in England , through this clinical trial funded by the NHS , have access to powerful new tools that are individually managed and do not depend on negotiating with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
the CEO of the Bonrence Higgins Foundation , Mr Green , said : &apos; now it is essential to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is swiftly launched and that none of the members of the HIV risk group are left behind .
now that the PrEP clinical trial has been acquired , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
Sharon Hodgson , Minister for Public Health , said : &apos; the start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delay and the lease of government shoes .
evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to stopping the spread of HIV prevention and life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will bring us a step closer to full understanding of the benefits of PrEP .
it is now important that the clinical trial is introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people with exposure to HIV and to bring us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices increased by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
in July , the difference in electricity prices between Estonian and Latvian and Lithuanian prices fell to 1.94 , compared to € 7.71 in June this year , announced Elering .
the main reason for the price difference is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , the average electricity price was set at € 34.33 per megawatt hour last month and increased by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania the price fell by five percent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 34.17 and the cost of the electricity exchanges on the Nord side was EUR 26.37 per megawatt hour .
prices rose by 12 and seven percent respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , 75 % of last month &apos;s hours went to Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine per cent of the hours between the two countries did not happen next day .
between Estonia and Latvia , 99 % of the time taken from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the time spent all transmission capacity .
according to the operations of the last July trading day in the Nasdaq OMX market , the wholesale price of electricity in August could be approximately 34 and 37 euros per megawatt hour .
the carbon price of electricity production increased last month and transactions were between € 5.04 and € 5.47 per tonne .
living a great deal of life - half @-@ time and smart designers have made it the house of the small Earls Court of Justice .
Joanne Leigh , a former banker , a passionate property referee , replaced her large Knightsbridge home in 2014 against the Earls Court Corter .
it is located at the first order of Queen Anne TerStream , and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold her flat on is an honour for the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived together with my former colleague in Knightsbridge on far greater ground , &quot; said Joanne .
&quot; I looked for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered .
I was alerted to this parade from the Earls Court and had the same high marks .
I took it and made an offer on the same day . &quot;
since the first visit , this 93 square metre has passed through a complete innovator .
at the beginning , it was a corb with a single sleeping room and a complex place : to get to the sleeping powder , it had to walk through the kitchen ; the Joanne wanted to add savings and half order to take advantage of the high discoveries .
&quot; I wanted high @-@ profile , big windows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he called Erfan Azadi Notting hill and hill from the architecture and design session Duck &amp; Cairo to take advantage of 3.8 metres of desert and to create a home that is not just a development object but a place where Joanne can live .
as a whole , it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so it was a architectural challenge to create half @-@ order in which to stand .
Erfan had to take a creative approach .
&quot; Metaldesign is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to reorganise facilities so that they were located on each other without having to bow .
it was not just about building a platform , but about using steel construction so that the peak of both upper and lower spaces would be right . &quot;
this imposition allowed Erfanl to create two full @-@ blown slots in the room with a number of dramatic elements .
the semi @-@ stark light of the old @-@ age Retrouvius window is emerging from a galloth housing window .
the golden furniture with a flavour , silver details and retrokolgic Serge Mouille &apos;s light highlight space style .
the use of shelves plays a role in adding theatrability , space and lighting .
spot mirrors have been added to both sides of the short corridor so that they appear longer .
in Kong , the beet beet beet beet is the second @-@ hand window .
during the course of the move , the meter provides savings for all the feed giants and glass requirements of Joanne .
the possibility of closing down vegetables , if it is not used , adds to housing , creating a more glazing space .
According kitchen is nothing new .
however , this kitchen is a unique fact that it is an uprising of the type of garage .
&quot; there was some design effort in it , &quot; &quot; explained the credentials of Erfan DF , who was spoilt by the strengthened MDF .
&quot; it has a counterbalance , which is why it is very simple to roll it out . &quot;
Joanne now has 16 additional capacity metres , an additional sleeping room and a better flame plan thanks to the smart use of space and savings .
&quot; after all , the flooring rooms are what you sell - or what gives value to property &apos; says Erfan .
&quot; the anchovy stock kler takes an outdated form of tumour and makes calculations based on the surface area . &quot;
here they have been able to increase the floor , while using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to space .
&quot; materials are the ones you touched upon and thus help to create emotional ties with your homes , &quot; says Erfan .
&quot; you do not hide into the existing electricity cable .
it is important , but it does not give heart to languages . &quot;
this shows that good design and an enlarged area are helping to make something amazing out of a rather normal flat .
in fact , they may even give rise to a desire not to leave , as happened with Joanne .
Understandably Jensen , the main figure , is Chicago &apos;s thorny oil in the photographics of Chicago , who is competing with a colleague for professional relief .
nothing but the amount of money earned , aside from which any ethics is forgotten , counts .
my wife and three children can only see the man in the early morning and late night .
in the first half of the film , I find myself in the idea that this is a version of the business world of the &apos; Kaardihouse &apos; - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler &apos;s speech .
the further the film , the less champagne , remains , and the moralising intention of filmmakers is increasingly beginning to appear .
a life @-@ changing experience will involve a bogeyman with cancer .
a choice must now be made between work and family life .
the articulate poet is making the father &apos;s walking visits to the big buildings of Chicago think about really important things such as belief , well @-@ being , love ... , without touching even the twin @-@ towers disaster .
after the third semester where a son &apos;s father opens his eyes , it is surely a feeling that filmmakers are guided by the aim of having a public eye , because even the most priest @-@ hearted spectator is unable to hold back tears when she sees the suffering of the armolecuous cancer @-@ sick boy .
when the son falls into the home and his situation seems hopeless , the father will ultimately understand the morality of his work and will do a good job to the old man who is looking for good work .
now I am taking a bet from my own point of view - if a film has a grid , I reward my generosity after a film coffee , if I am wrong , the stint may be rewarded for at least one surprise .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that there will be no shortage of coffee - when a husband calls a sick person and a man storms down the slow pot to a corridor palt .
after all , however , the mother has gone awkward and , although his father has just lost his job , it is also proving to be a positive thing , because now there is time to deal with the family .
I can also feel well - I can already predict the end of the American drama quite well !
in truth , film is well structured , all the necessary elements exist .
you can pick up , you can smile , you can see actors are a good and moral beauty : money is not the most important thing in life .
the film will come in well .
the new Staff College of the Trum plans to limit President media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps Mr F. Kelly can actually do that .
he would then be the first .
Politico writes that the new chief of staff in the White House plans to limit the flow of information reaching President Trumpin , including news , in the hope that it will balance the gap .
here , a full report from Mr Josh Dawseyi is available :
&quot; when the new College of White House &apos;s staff , John F. Kelly , met high officials on his first day of work , he pointed out the key problem of President Donald Trumpi Valges in the Malis , which he plans to solve by reaching out to the President a lack of information from Brazil .
Mr Kelly told the officials that information had to go through him , whether on paper or in meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . &quot;
Mr diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have also tried to do so and have failed to tame Mr Trumpi by monitoring his media consumption .
President Trumpi &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades and , even now that he is in the White House , his television viewing habits have not gone away .
&quot; when candidate Trump was a scapegoat for dishonest media coverage , he was told that he was also honestly reflected in the publications he affects , &quot; said Sam Nunberg , former campaigning Adviser , in February , to Politico .
Politico tara PalSea wrote at the time that &apos; Trumpi , according to the six former campaigners , is the key to controlling Twitter &apos;s habits by ensuring that his personal media consumption also includes a stable glory &apos; .
OK .
however , the idea that the habits of using Trumpi Twitter have ever been &apos; under control &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps these campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know would have been even more heartening without these interventions .
we will probably never know about the charges that the Trump did not post .
if she could save her a few times , either , from batteries , their efforts were worth doing so .
no one , however , has been able to prevent Trumpi from continually polemics .
part of the problem is that in Valges Malas , which consists of competing cats , people exclusively seek to promote their own interests by passing on material to Truel which supports their global views but may not always be credible .
Politico , which reflects the entire gold of the story , wrote in May from the advisers &apos; tendency to feed the President strategically questionable information .
one of the examples of a reporter Shane Goldmacher is :
&quot; the current and former Trumpi submits that Trum can react to negative press pressure , particularly disrupting leaflets , by taking an explosive approach to identifying their source of source .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone happily gave a copy of the photocopy printed to the President , Charles C. On the Internet provocation website of GotNews.com , a website belonging to Johnson , accusing the deputising officer , Katie Walshi , of being the white house of &apos; a source of information &apos; .
it does not matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of his mocking , or that he did not provide any specific evidence , or that he has also made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them .
the band has read the article and started to ask about the subordinate Wales . &quot;
Goldmacher added that Rob Porter , then head of Reince Priebus , and then head of the White House , had attempted to establish a system for managing and documentation the documents reaching Trumpini . &apos;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be the leader of Priebuss more effective , but the Trump remains an impulse and continues to compete for influence .
these changing factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .
street musicians who have come from foreign capital will not be allowed to obtain permission to speak .
there are many foreigners in the city of Tallinn .
those with whom the leaflet came to light acknowledged that they were playing in the old city without the permission of the urban government .
the first came from Viru gates close to the three street musicians who had taken with them just as much .
it was clear to see that musicians with rigs and scattered rivals were the cocktail slaves to whom a duchch would be spent .
despite the madness , the only woman in the company , acordional , played a straightforward rhythm , while one man , along with her , was in the jon and called the men closer .
the third man had sat along with them on one side of the House and smoked a corn @-@ hearted self @-@ prepared farce .
these three chambers did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people that passed .
Bob , who played the Akordion with the Noemi and the Palace , said that he was sounding up on the streets for both fun and money .
the aim of the event was to collect the ticket price on a ship travelling to Finland on the same day evening .
on the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for extremism , Noemi and Bob shook their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never be in one town for more than a day or a few , and mostly for a month or something like that .
there is no point in paying for this &apos; , Mr Bob explained .
when we returned to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in the hands of musicians and are getting away from them .
the task force cowed to the cross @-@ face of the Viru Centre with bags and bags .
on the streets of Viru , there were also three Polish young men , one of whom played the fifth , the other was charied , and the third had even been driven by electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people a sense of entertainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living , &quot; explained trio pipe Mivh .
according to Mivoshi , they are aware that there must be permission from the city government to speak .
&quot; of course we do not have it , &quot; he said jokes .
but we hope that when people enjoy our music there is no problem .
of course , when the police come , we go elsewhere , but we have to try , &apos; he added .
the Estonian Central Bank purchased bonds worth € 149 million under the euro area &apos;s public asset buying programme for Central banks , with a total increase of € 4.36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
the Governor of the Estonian Bank , Hardo Hansson , has made it clear in the past that the purchase plan for the central banks of the Eurosystem involves three different purchasing programmes : bonds covered by the financial sector ( Washington ) , early bonds ( ABS ) and public bonds ( PSPP ) .
the Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage bonds @-@ selling investors to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases will fall on the production of lower @-@ risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks .
as a rule , in the public debt buying programme , each Central Bank will buy its government bonds , other countries will not be able to buy bonds .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank will make so @-@ called substitution purchases within the amount allocated to them .
Central banks also shop in those countries where there are limited bond offers to the purchase scheme .
the Estonian bank , confirmed by Mr Hansson , generally purchases bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and EIB bonds .
the Estonian bank will purchase bonds from March 2015 as part of its asset buying programme .
meanwhile , bonds were also obtained from Eleround , but the Estonian bank will no longer buy bonds from June 2016 .
on behalf of euro area central banks , both Eleround and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds will be bought by the Finnish Central Bank from June onwards .
migrants ignore their degrees and return to the &apos; millions of business base &apos;
some of the most prosperous home owners of the West Midlands have once again found themselves in a fierce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the clandestine degrees of the Council in order to win back the nursery slope away from their cotton .
migrants have parked their 20 trailers on the back of the streets of the barn Solyull , a gang of &apos; millions of businesses &apos; .
they have returned , together with the army of horses , children and trucks , after they were only pulled out there in May , without letting themselves be confused with the ditches that were being bailed out by a council to block their invasion .
the working group found a weakness in the protection limits by turning its vehicles into an unhindered part left to a walker .
Micidal people have been touched by the Solyull Council saying that the Council is &apos; unhelpful in dealing with the problem &apos; .
a anonymous resident said : &apos; they danced there on Monday evening after being excluded from Bentley Heathis , where they were storing furniters .
the Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were driven away and now they are back .
more came yesterday evening , probably today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Burma lobgham council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect its parks .
I live on the street sbrook and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay the mandate if the Council is not even able to block such a thing . &quot;
a local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said , &apos; It is ridiculous ; we saw the latter left those migrants , and a new onslaught is already taking place .
this time , the number has increased and the grass @-@ land has even been seen as a horse in ruminant . &apos;
the representative of the Soungulli Council said : &apos; we are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the area close to the roads of street sbrook , and we are working with the Soungull police ; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
the gathering of evidence helps enormously when as many local people as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling for a figure of 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
Weeky Festival will also visit , among others , the Minister for Culture , Indrek Saar , who is pleased that Estonia has managed to bring real world excellence .
to ask why Weeky is so important for the festival Estonians , Saar says that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the full front of the festival for three days .
he says , however , that the Persian Esturias site has come from real players .
&apos;While looking at the level of artists that has been brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this musical gesture are being brought home - often not in our kings &apos; , the Minister for Culture talks .
which festivals will be held by artists , however , most of all by Saart himself ?
I consider myself to be relatively old @-@ fashioned and , for the elderly , one of the most experienced doctors , Armin van Brenegotiren , who stood up last night , is certainly one of the most recent speakers .
after all , at some point , all of us have also been complicating our own feet , &apos; he says .
however , he still identifies a number of names , such as Chainreau , Deadmau5 , KnifeGrosch .
of course , our own Estonian players too : starting with NOMarkets P and they can be read in a whole series .
in practice , this concentration of well @-@ known names is very large &apos; , he says .

the car manufacturers will renew their cars in the midst of criticism of up to 850 000 diesel vehicles
the day before the Audi announcement , BMW said it had software applications for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of BMW , the company believes that &apos; there are smarter alternatives than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the city of BMW , Munich , which has considered banning or limiting diesel vehicles .
on Tuesday , Daimler announced that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be renewing diesel engines to reduce emissions .
no company described these procedures as a call for withdrawal .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
however , nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and could cause asthma .
at the same time , the cost of the equipment installed to neutralise exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles for automotive companies is increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of branding up powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to prevent Volkswagen from repeating the mistakes of the Volkswagen , which was silent about the use of so @-@ called &apos; hidden devices &apos; , which made it possible to adapt the exhibition of exhaust gases to the regulations when the car was tested , but withdrew in normal driving conditions .
several head of Volkswagen have been charged in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , a former head of the Audi engine Development department was arrested in Germany .
former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be prosecuted in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , the Audi German criminal investigation concerning Volkswagen was drawn up when the authorities accused the installation of the Audit System in order to circumvent the requirements for European emissions of gas , thereby expanding the investigation that had previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the prize in research may be a major blow for Volkswagen manufacturers of X @-@ lock cars , generating a disproportionate share of the Volkswagen profits .
Estonian schools will be awarded European Union flags for EUR 20 000 .
the Ministry of Education intends to purchase EU flags to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency .
in total , the measure will be set at 105x158 cent of the European Union &apos;s flag of 570 education institutions .
flags are intended to be induced in indoor spaces ; they must also be carried out in high @-@ quality printing techniques with attestation , an ERR newsportal .
the text reads on the label : &apos; Regregation to Estonian schools to mark Estonia &apos;s first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 570 flags is € 20,000 at the cost of the Ministry of Education , or a single flag costs € 35 .
journalist murders underline growing danger in Mexico
Nocre Riodoce workers usually gather on Wednesday in order to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Blue oa , sown by organised crime , corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars .
but today they have gathered in the shadow of their personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their routine .
two elderly writers are discussing which sounds safer : either to bring the children to their office , which was the target of a subsidy attack in 2009 , or to leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the leader of the room : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutral &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking reporters to give every quarter of the water names without any need for liquidity , enough impressions and an internal feeling .
in the presence of a government or cartels , a list of drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists is suspected of making it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
violence has no breath and the more bodies are accumulating across the country , the greater the number of journalists made up of them , according to the Committee on Civil Protection of journalists , since the appointment of President Enrique Pena Kalinto in December 2012 , at least 25 , 589 journalists have died in seven states after attacks and threats , and this year at least seven journalists have been killed .
the latter include their editor and source of inspiration , Javier Valdez Carden , co @-@ founder of Riodoce .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug @-@ related violence .
his absence gives a deep feeling , even though his presence can be felt all along the front pages of the Sahrawi Buildoce building , a big picture of the Valdezi , showing an average finger with the slogan &apos; Justice &apos; and the two 30 @-@ year @-@ old reporters , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , carries T @-@ shirts , which have a face or a flavour characterising flavour .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death , and Reporters will discuss common traumas , their nightmare , their dream of unease , their paranoia .
although a separate public prosecution service was created in 2010 to address the cases of journalists , only two cases have been brought to justice by the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
as with most annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime , the number of which amounts to thousands , the killing of journalists is rarely brought to justice .
Riodoce &apos;s performance continues to reflect the violence in Blue alo , even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without murderers &apos; data and justice , the meeting on security , Ibarra said , will not do much .
&apos;It is very stupid to waste your time in this meeting &apos; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , you will distrust everyone . &apos;
Valdez left the State capital , Culiacan , from the office of Riodoce on 15 May .
he managed to travel just a few quarters before two men stopped the role of the red Toyota Corolla , who were forced to leave the car and were shot 12 times , supposedly because of the name of the newspaper , which translates into the &apos; twelfth river &apos; .
an armed man travelled in Valdez &apos;s car and made an accident close to it .
Valdez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adults .
the floods are spreading freely in Culiacan .
however , there is , principally , silence on the subject of Valdez .
since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of January to the United States of America , one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country has been Blue oa , as rival rivals are fighting to fill a power vacuum .
it does not matter that , on the streets of Blue oa , a few people , or even several , are being shot every day , or that the dead are stunned with double @-@ hull drug banners , which are greater than many lives .
let us remember for a moment that the time of peace indicates how precious ports and drug routes to the United States are headed by a cartel .
despite all this , and despite the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Riodoce &apos;s co @-@ founder and president , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , feels immense responsibility for not being able to defend his friend .
he believes that two errors contributed to the killing .
the first was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopezzi , a cartel competing with the son of Guzmann and on a military basis .
this piece of paper could be alluded to by the supposedly suspect members of gangs who bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they reached their timeshare .
the second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security after the wound took place in one of the newspapers that reported the same story in another .
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues had assumed that he would always exist .
he worked as a veteranreporter at Norou in 2003 when she joined five colleagues to create a Riodoce , selling 50 dollar shares .
Bojorquez said , &apos; It was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem &apos; .
the newspaper ran a long time with its courageous and honest reflections , and sales and advertising grew .
they were keen to publish vigorous studies without fear of censorship and snow readers in a book from which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Riodoce , the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her Latin American accounts .
in the same year , Valdez &apos;s Committee for the Protection of journalists ( AKK ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow the Mexican drug creator wherever it leads .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said when she received the AKK Prize .
in an interview given to the television channel Rompeviento TV last October , she said that drug trafficking was a way of life in Blue aloas .
&quot; mayors face up to the challenge that the journalist profession has of being able to play .
I do not want to ask what I did in the face of so many deaths , or why I did not say what is happening . &apos;
Riodoce &apos;s collectives longed Valdez , a joke who ropounded like a madness , a friend who had kindly shared embryos and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they supported his routine .
he always kicked his barrels .
he went from the office to the head of El Guatemyabo bar and was always sitting on the same table .
now they are asking whether his routine love was fatal to him .
his death has also prompted them to question how best to do their work and to stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the slackening of these women , their children , their legitimate businesses , with their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bojorquez .
the result , even in the best times , is strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ sufficiency .
confidence in your instincts .
when it comes to suspiciously , it goes away .
the problem , according to the editor of Riodoce , Andres Villarreali , is that &apos; the fragrance can be deceived ... and so was the case with Jaherer &apos; .
he and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Blue aloas , just as they do not apply to the toxic composition of Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerreiro or other states that are home to profitable trafficking routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is changing all the time .
in the space in which Riodoce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only the sugar assets sold to governments had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists .
in front of the house , two policemen sought shelter from 40 ° C months .
they appointed a stronger Riodoce office in a four @-@ pack building in Culiacan &apos;s middle @-@ class neighbourhood .
some reporters wondered half @-@ hearted if these police officers were to be among the 50 % police officers who have themselves been blown up untrustworthy .
several months have passed since reports have moved to mountain areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs .
Mr Riodoce &apos;s edition this week dealt with three main lines .
one of them was the murder of the former poxing legist Julio Graboar Chavez brona in Blue aloas .
in addition , they had a revealing story of the spending of government funds on the town of governor .
and a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , from the office of the Prosecutor , from the quarter .
there was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened , so caution had to be taken when it was time to write what everyone in the city of Flanders knows is a favourite place for drug dealers and authorities alike .
the editorial found out in public documents that a restaurant was registered to the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( IRP ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
recently , several IRP Governor has been accused of corruption within the framework of widespread coverage of court cases .
Villarli asked reporter to write previous incidents in the same place , including the way in which the son of Guzman , wearing the name El Chapo , escaped from military reins .
just a few months earlier , readers would have been looking to Valdez &apos;s columb to get information on kidnappings from the best sources .
&quot; in the past , we would have known what happened , &quot; said a 46 @-@ year @-@ old Villarreal , the body construction of whose brokers have earned him the slogan El Flaco .
&quot; now all communication channels with our sources have broken up . &quot;
the office of Valdez has become a reservoir to the bridges and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the workers of editorial activity have become something they could never have expected in the name of the Sahrawi press .
Reporter Miriam Ramirez seized a few eyes and returned next morning to a local Prosecutor &apos;s cabinet for yet another journalist .
in the western state of Michoacan , we echo the chaos three days after the killing of Valdez .
a burnt body has been found and , according to officials , it belongs to it on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists from all over the country have become more vocal and , as an organised protest , highlight the phrase &apos; SOS press &apos; on the roads and buildings .
on that day , President Bojorquez will be in Washington , trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case .
the day after the death of Valdez in meetings with the Yaloa Governor , the Ramirez authorities accused journalists of lying and killing them for telling the truth .
since then , he asked that he be diverted from reflecting the government &apos;s actions , concerned that hatred had affected objectivity .
Valdez had said on several occasions that Mexican journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , complicit state officials and a indifferent society .
in her latest book on the &apos; drugs press &apos; , he wrote that reporters are not only killing drug gangs but are also being killed on the orders of politicians and security forces , which are at the mercy of organised crime .
last year , the media monitoring group Articulo 19 awarded more than half of the attacks on the police and public officials .
&quot; in Mexico , you are kets because you want to keep quiet , &quot; said Ramirez .
the murder obviously has a bloody effect .
no one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .
she was found dead with a letter , which was probably signed by the cartel LOS Zetas : &apos; I am here for my reporting . &apos;
alongside his captured head , computer glass and headphones were leaked .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahuahua , following the killing in March of their correspondents , civilslava Betanh .
others will pass on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did in 2004 , following their assassination .
in 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez openly spoke to the front line &apos; What do you want ? &apos;
some journalists have fled from national states , or even from the country .
it is a nervous decision .
in theory , it is difficult to find work and they still need to be on the streets in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes behind them , as was probably the case with the photographi Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered , along with four women , in a series of Mexico in 2015 , three months after paracruz .
those who remain in place and continue to work must be resettled every day by risky decisions .
Ibarra , who once wanted to pop up , recognises that it is intimidated by reporting the drug trade .
&quot; Mexico is on the way to hell , and that is why I will report , &quot; she said .
one of the last Friday &apos;s midnight , when the latest number had already been shoved down , Riodoce editors were walking down to the office and plundering them when all phones suddenly started to be hijacked .
in Mazatlani , a poor European town of Mazatlani , 19 people were confirmed to have died in the fire exchanges between rival gangs and security forces .
the war continued to escalated , as did several of the messages left by the cartels found in the region .
on top of the same line , reporters picked up the Riodoce website using a mobile phone .
a change was needed in the front of the next day .
the upgrades were marked by a further migration of water in the Cariforum .
Bojorquez piilding policemen on the ground to see if they are vigilant .
when they feared , they did not at least show that .
under a massive portfolio of the falling owner of a newspaper , with his average finger on the whole of the Sinalo , Riodoce workers carried in his footsteps .
&apos;How could one think of closing down at all , &apos; said Bojorquez , &apos; whereas on the same day Javier murdered , a trainee asked me to send him to report back to the streets ? &apos;
Dinpartial pressure used the colour of protection to avoid enemies
at first glance , this sounds like a form , albeit rather frightening .
scientists have now made the first findings public concerning the incredible presence of the Macao figure found by the Canadian miner , which is so well retained that the experts have described it as &apos; dinosaurs Mona Lisat &apos; .
it has been so well maintained that it was even possible to establish that the skin covered by his soya was the colour of red boxes and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the latest Biology report , published in the magazine magazine , describes it as &apos; the best preserved biomalhosis that has ever been found &apos; and &apos; one of the best dinosaurs in the world &apos; .
in the case of fossil cars , this is a new type of nodosamic pressure that lived in the middle of the cricket season , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
its incredibly good survival was raped by scientists who describe it as &apos; really remarkable &apos; .
this herbal restaurant covered by soya has , according to the magazines National Geoguay , best preserved this type of phosphorus that has ever been found .
this was found on 21 March 2011 in the Shawn Funk , when he extracted the Suncor Millenium mine Fort McMurray near North Alberta in Canada .
it suffered something that did not remind the surrounding fibres and decided to look more closely .
the newly discovered phosphorus was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum .
the next six years were working to remove the animal from the land section of 2 500 women ( 1 100 @-@ kilometres ) .
after all this hard struggle , the end result is now finally ready to bring the public forward .
&apos;If you preach a little eyes , you can almost believe that he sleeping , &apos; said Caleb Brown , the leading author , a theatre in the museum of Royal Tyrrell , where the proposition is evicted .
&quot; it goes down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur - dinosaur Mona Lisana . &quot;
when she studied skin , she found that this vegetarian worker , who is covered by soya and is reminiscent of a taboo tank , was likely to be significantly threatened by the food dinosaurs of meat .
this dinosaur with many socks used red and white defence in order to hide himself from predators , and applied shadowing techniques , which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many of today &apos;s animals .
this enabled the dinosaur , according to experts , to be better around and to avoid enemies , as more dinosaurs were likely to have hunt .
the presence of the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old family of nodosaurts first entered news in May and is now on the way to the Paleontology of Royal Tyrrell .
the theatres have now studied the present state of existence and named Boeing &apos;s Marmitchell museum laboratory , mark Mitchell , a famous team that spent more than 7 000 hours trying hard to reveal .
thanks to the amazing survival of the father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the soominees .
they found out disshelter - the concept of protection in the country of origin , which means that the proverb of existence was a dead port as a bottom .
although objections are widespread , bread comes as a surprise , as Borealopelta is much greater than today &apos;s live with antidote animals .
it suggests that dinosaurs were sufficiently actively hunted by other muscle dinosaurs , that evolution preferred to be refuted instead of confrontation as a tactic of survival .
however , most of the animals using modern shelter - such as fears , swine bars or scars - are much smaller and more vulnerable as yields , which suggests that nodosaurry was really struggling to survive .
&quot; the strong hunting of dinosaurs covered by enormous and large amounts of soya shows just how dangerous animals may have been from the dinosaurs of the cricket era , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in Soomens also revealed that the dinosaur skin was a red cake .
researchers will continue to create an investigation to obtain indications of this life , including the content perpetuated by this warm style , in order to find out what the animal was saying for its last term .
they believe that dinosaurred failed rivers , thereby sliding into the sea with a stream in which it needed its back to the bottom of the ocean .
at the time , Mr Albertini was as warm as he was today in southern Florence and rivers and oceans were likely to go far beyond inland land than they are today .
&quot; this nodosamic pressure is truly remarkable , as it is fully covered by soomustic skin , but it is also three @-@ dimensional while maintaining its original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , today , the animal sees almost the same as in the era of cricket .
there is not much imagination to be used to reconstruct this - it is enough simply to preach our eyes and it seems like sleeping . &apos;
the crisis era was a time when the earth was flooded with gigantic dinosaurs - the teroshops - circulating on two legs .
although the King Tyrannosaurus rex of all of them lived many millions years later than Bodiamopelta , it could be hunted by some of his frightened predecessors .
these include Acrocanthurus , 38 legs ( 11.5 metres ) long and six @-@ tonne @-@ weighted monster .
scientists whose recent findings are published in the magazine mad Biology believe that Borealopelta was uhued into the sea after death , and this muzized sludge .
on 21 March 2011 , Mr Shawn Funk was discovered when he extracted Fort McMurray near the Millenium mine in Northern Albertini in Canada .
according to the museum , it is best preserved in the world , including skin and soya , and it is a complete collection right up to bottles .
these divergences were on average at 18 legs ( five metres ) , and were between GBP 3 000 ( 1300 kg ) .
two 20 customs @-@ length ora emerged from this shoulders .
scientists believe that this soya @-@ covered biota was searched through the current Western Canada until the river was inundated into the sea .
however , the sea @-@ based burying place of dinosaur contributed to maintaining its Finns in an excellent detail .
the remnants of this particular father , coal , have been so well preserved that the mygarlic soomposters of the dinosaur continue to cover skin ice .
as Michael Greshko wrote in the magazine National Georeau : &apos; such predability is as rare as a lottery .
the more I look at it , the more incredible it seems .
burnt skin residues continue to cover mysterious soomic plates located on the yellow .
a better front @-@ runners will beat him , and five of them will be scattered upwards .
I will be able to read the celebrations on his farm . &quot;
how did one activist find a response to the question &apos; Who thanks ? &apos;
Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock on 9 August 2014 .
just a day after the trip to New York , it was on the back of the village of St. Louise resident , on the flight of Airbus , on a mobile phone on Facebook .
he got on top of her former student &apos;s post .
it said : &apos; the police killed just 18 @-@ year @-@ old youngsters and he is still on the street &apos; .
he was confused why no one else had postal this information on his stream , which is why he closed down Facebook and opened Twitter .
the postal services of the Pidega @ TheeParoah user were repeatedly distributed on his line .
Mr St. Syppar from the Louise region , in real time , passed on to the death of Mr Michael Brown , an unarmed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black @-@ old black @-@ man murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson Missouris .
he gave a picture of the Have survived body in the streets , staying there for four hours .
&apos;It is crazy , &apos; thought the Ferreira brothers .
however , death was nothing new for him or his community .
he set up his phone but later later this evening saw again the shale announced this time at Canfield Drive .
there were photographs of the police and shellfish and of a man who claimed to be the father of Brown and kept the label &apos; the Fergusoni police killed my unarmed son &apos; .
he watched a real @-@ time stream in which a policeman stood up to a protest group with a hatching dog .
in the second video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... &apos; .
Ferber will remember how he struck himself with thought : &apos; this is unusual &apos; .
&apos;This is not a murder of this kind with which we are accustomed and which we could describe as typical &apos; .
I felt horrified at that time .
I was angry and I said . &apos;
he booked a return flight and went home the following day .
having buried at 23 : 00 , she went to her father for her six @-@ year @-@ old daughter and decided that they would travel next morning to two @-@ year Fergusoni .
what happened with Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years will be at the heart of the new documentary &apos; Whose Streets ? &apos; ( &apos; whose thanks ? &apos; ) , which will be presented in cinemas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who were thanking for their answers .
when Mrs Ferreira , together with her daughter - who had a faulty broker and beat a suitable chat with it - was driving to Fergusoni , they were talking again about the black experience and living conditions that they had been talking to them several times before this morning .
&apos;Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; he is reminiscent of asking himself .
&quot; we are now travelling to Fergusoni because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys , and that is not true . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him along with him , &quot; said Pall later .
&quot; what is happening now is the culmination of what happened in the past ...
it needs to know and see this and to grow in the middle .
it must learn about the organisation and organisation of the activist and , at the same time , recognise the different layers of experience and living conditions of the black tankers , and what we must do to free ourselves and free ourselves .
even if I succeed in bringing him up in such a way that he does not personally experience cruel racism , he does not differ from any other black girls .
I feel I would be doing him a disservice if I were to protect him from this world . &quot;
the first stop they did in the Ferguson gangs was on the way to South Florissanti - from the police to the wall , which had become a sort of camp in which activists were awaiting news about the police officer Darren Wilson , who was ultimately not charged .
there , Mrs Ferreira and her daughter joined forces with a local commercial owner who produced southern farms .
they brought together food homes and helped to share them with the protesters .
a new type of activist began slowly for Ferrelli .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said that , when she was a Missouri @-@ St. at Louise University , she was President of the Union of minority teachers and focused on food justice and health inequalities in poor communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organising .
all of this simply lacked . &apos;
after weeks , Mrs Ferreira met one of the co @-@ director of a film , Mrs Folayani , during an evening demonstration .
the Folayan said that he and film operator Lucas Alvarado @-@ Farrar simply wanted to document what is happening .
in the face of Ferrelli , the question was : &apos; are you trying to document what is happening or to find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases in which people - often painful - come to the community and try to reap the benefits of its pain and resilience .
the Folayan explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born and grew in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Mr Damon Davi , a fellow @-@ director of the site , had already struck his hands with an artificial city known as a well @-@ known activist in relation to the sentenced prisoners .
his involvement made the project attractive to Ferrell and another six local communities that were watched for years after the shooting of the Whose street ?
&quot; in this documentary nobody speaks for us or for us , but we speak for ourselves , &apos; said Davis .
&quot; it was important to me how these people are portrayed , as that is how I am perceived . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell &apos;s experience - it was wanted to show that the movement was not about &apos; the head of the ransom , but about bringing the community together &apos; , as Mr Folayan said - it formed the most open player in the film .
as a result , the &apos; Whose street strikes ? &apos; is a surprise to personal aspects of Ferrell &apos;s life , such as beating and married with their wife .
&quot; I felt as if I was naked , &quot; Mr Ferreira said , laughing over the first time he was prepared to see the urban act .
&quot; but I realised that this work and the humane treatment of black people must be accompanied by a certain amount of vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the Ferrelli story emphasises and puts at the centre the role of the black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement .
two of the three initiators of the movement who thought of the black teenager Trayvon Martin , in the social media in 2012 , after the killing of the black teenager , # BlackLivesMatter , are gay .
&quot; in leading role , the black homosexual women have maintained movement across the board , &quot; said Ferrell , &quot; and this is precisely because we have to continuously fight on several fronts .
Roma homosexual women must bear the full burden . &quot;
the Folayan agreed to state that &apos; mobility really is kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women &apos; .
he says , however , that &apos; this is no type of equal opportunities &apos; - Ferrell was not chosen to be the focus of a film because of his identity .
&quot; he was a man of whom the right energy was evening , &quot; he said .
&quot; but it is no coincidence that he was directly on the rindexes , because there is much at stake as a black homosexual woman living in such hubs .
his energy can be felt through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news cameras Fergusong have long gone , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the conditional sentence imposed on Ferber during the demonstration to block the road will last for another 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in a region he calls home simply as a &apos; huge free threat &apos; .
however , it still attaches importance to the mantra it has been eating since the time when it spent on the streets of Fergusoni as a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our responsibility to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
7 @-@ 7 pieces on how to overcome Weekenda pidu pohmelt
some of the most stubborn meals find , after a scarce stick , that they are suffering from , hence aid .
or on the basis of the saying &apos; avoid a pokbot , a pyle crack &apos; .
however , this is just an unavoidable postponement and a good blessing for health .
what can you do to get a better feeling in the morning after today and tomorrow &apos;s Weekside trall - or whatever else - and to overcome the potasy as painlessly as possible ?
Joo Water .
Alculean down and beyond , after a great deal in the morning ... or possibly even alcohol .
as a body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it must somehow be recovered .
with water , minerals and swine are also being thrown out of the body , and it is good for hair mineral water .
as the soil is often irritated after drinking , it is particularly good if it is soil @-@ free or just lightly constrained .
let us walk .
surely it would not cost the grandmother to go to a boy - it might prove fatal to be a false decision .
however , an easy process helps the body to remember once again what it is like to be alive .
Sleeping in Telg and playing out pokmax is a more time @-@ consuming way of getting healthy .
give little energy back to the body , slowly and prudently .
if you are already on the verge of overdrinking yesterday , it will certainly not be worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
to begin with , there is , for example , a fresh breadth containing fruit grades quietly on the shoulders .
if the South is already suffering from health , the wedding could be tried , for example .
and a little later on , it was clear .
there was no exclusion .
this diuFriday will rid the body of the last water .
as has already been said , water and volumes have your friends .
make a contribution to painkillers .
if you take a painkiller on night to prevent pokbot , you have to deal not only with alcohol but also with paratsetamol or ibuprophecy , and so you lose performance .
so many more of our pay streams and , in the future , boys will be worse off .
moreover , the painkiller does not stand in the past for a long time .
if you take a painkiller this morning , you will do it with empty noise - it will irritate the already torn wool .
or if you do not have a partner , you can go well with you .
it is about the same as walking , but walking is not going to be enough .
however , there was no too active a pace and an abject shop : in a boxing period , physical effort should be moderate .
go a joke .
the words of the friends of the time with their fellow sufferers , the easy doses of the road and the naera amicably over itself and others ( suffering ) .
the Lady and the wife may not be driven out of polemics , but they are certainly the result of the discovery of a more lax .
once again , the pokmetry goes through anyway !
Northwestern professor and staff at Oxford University are sought for suspicion of murder
according to the police , a professor at the University of Northwestern and a staff at the University of Oxford , who have become suspicious after having been killed by the westernese people &apos;s westerns , is being sought out of a single Chicago luxury corps .
according to the judicial documents of the Cook County , on Monday , an arrest warrant was issued for 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni , accused of being arrested on the grounds of their alleged affinity with Trenton H. James Cornell @-@ Durancy .
according to the documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Durancy died after repeated cycling .
according to a warning issued to the community by Chicago &apos;s police station , the body was found dead on 27 July .
the police received telephone calls and found the Grand Plaza Corterrand for the arrival of a victim whose body had several torboxes .
according to officials , Cornell @-@ Durancy was recognised as the scene and researchers are treating cycling as murder , while the police actively seek two suspects .
Mrs Laanda has been working as co @-@ professors of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .
Cubbage , Vice @-@ President of University of Public Relations , said in a statement sent as e @-@ mail that Laâria has now been temporarily removed from work and has been prohibited from entering the towns of the University of Northwestern .
&quot; this is now a criminal act to be investigated by competent authorities , and the University of Northwestern is cooperating with researchers , &quot; said Cubbage .
Warren is a senior assistant in the finance area of Oxford University .
the representative of the University of Somerville College said in a statement delivered as e @-@ publisher : &apos; we have been in touch with the British police and ready to assist the US investigation authorities in every possible way &apos; .
moreover , the statement stated that the Warreni colleagues were shocked and would like him to extradited .
Anthony Guglielm , Head of the Police Department of Chicago , urges , on suspicion , to call on the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are , but we are increasingly busy in defining the exact whereabouts , &quot; said Guglielm .
according to Guglielm , suspects can be sought by local , regional and national authorities .
Guglielmi said that the police had received telephone calls from the haldurival of the Grand Plaza Korterhouse , which had just received a chryptic hint that something had happened in the corps No 1008 .
according to the police , this was a spectacular spectacle .
according to Guglielm , it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July .
he said that the security cameras confirmed the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor Lathaka and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
the management of the Grand Plaza sent a letter to the population : &apos; the police are currently working on the identification of the quronology and victim background of events and are looking into different motives , including the possibility of being a family dispute &apos; .
Idufirms that help your company avoid becoming next UG
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his eCommerce start @-@ ups , but the surveys were futile .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anonymity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Errett , the company that sells hair maintenance products with 75 employees in San Francisco , Madison Reed .
so he called outsiders .
start @-@ ups dealing with new types of human resources are starting to help businesses find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software with the firm aim of measuring the involvement of workers , they will enable companies to conduct quarterly surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , provide workers with anonymity and a hot line for complaints and , in some cases , allow them to bypass the heads of the C level and address directly to the Bureau .
&quot; now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbi , but where is Fitbi for your business ? &apos; asked Jim Barnet , co @-@ founder and CEO of Redwood City start @-@ up , Glint , whose software analytics are used by companies to measure worker involvement .
according to Erretti , he has had a much better idea of what his staff think and know for three years when he has used Glint .
in addition to the investigations and the surveys targeted at certain teams , it provides a company &apos;s insulation card , which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , enabling them to identify the causes .
companies have begun to realise that they have to stay informed about their working culture so that they do not change to the next Ubhur , which has been embroiled in scandals since the former worker published a bloggery which described a harassing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as Glint , the wish to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity .
the global area of governance , regulation and conformity could be worth more than USD 1187 billion by 2020 , according to the Let Veld data on financial ethics statistics .
this year , in the face of the dubious reputation of Uber , CARcent , a company operating in Colorado , which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , noted an increase in interest and activity .
Tajikistan has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
Uber recently registered himself as a customer .
like Glingi , ops cent companies will be able to send adjusted impulses , collect real @-@ time confidential answers and look at the problem areas of heat cards .
it also provides a anonymous message paper that allows workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has been forgiven by regulatory authorities , &quot; said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and CEO of EUROSUR .
I happen to say that if a company is found to mistreat its employees or behave unethically , it could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts , the departure of workers and court cases , even if regulators do not intervene .
Ruby cable restaurant , with more than 25,000 employees in 500 places of operation , has been used by DEcent for more than a year to ensure employee awareness of rules and procedures and to provide a simple way of communicating with the corporation headquarters .
when a worker wanted to report a problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address at the headquarters of a corporation , make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously .
it was often a daunting and uncomfortable process , Mr Vitrano , the Ruby Satellite Counsellor , said that there was no good way to monitor staff complaints .
however , now that a company uses IACcent , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices can be identified and dealt with more quickly by managers in other cities or state offices .
&quot; I can get to grips with the Holy 360 degree experience of workers , &quot; said Vitrano , who heads the Ruby Regulators Group .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders against legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Quinlan said that companies started taking ethical behaviour , values and the involvement of workers more seriously in 2002 , in other words , after the failure of the audit company Arthur Andersson due to ethical irregularities in relation to the Enroni scandal .
however , only when the &apos; social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they cannot prevent their black washing on the web openly .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both Glint and grid cent offer their software as services , with companies receiving periodic fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors , who have been supporting both start @-@ ups .
EUROSUR financed USD 10 million in February by firms such as Sapphire Ventures and customs Capital , thereby raising the value of the capital collected to USD 47 million .
in November , the Glinti invested USD 10 million in Bessemer Venture partners by increasing the total company funding to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise , given the interconnectivity of businesses , culture and venture capital .
more and more studies show that modern workers expect more jobs than they did in the past .
in more competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high wages and interesting projects are mere contributions on the table .
the workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy with the company , they feel they are being listened to and satisfied with the work they do , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said Nina McQueen , Vice @-@ President of the Global Department for profit and staff experience in LinkedInis , who uses both cyclict and Glint .
investors will earn money if companies within their portfolio do well ; businesses will do well when workers are committed and involved .
if analytical tools on the third party allow for an increase in workers &apos; commitment and involvement , it is no wonder that they will receive support .
having data on worker involvement is , according to professionals , important .
however , these data will be useless if the company &apos;s successors do nothing with them .
in fact , when a company asks for feedback from its employees , it can generate expectations of change .
and if changes do not happen quickly enough or at all , this could cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; when you ask for 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Raath , President of the Consultative and Business Management Company , Kotter International , who has seen companies making a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&apos;For if things do not end up , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Erretti , the Madison Reeal , who is now organising monthly surveys among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day that the problem has been reported through the Glint .
and after receiving feedback from disappointed workers about the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communications , he was able to reorganise several company teams and provide communication training to tackle problems .
however , heading 1a will gather new data on workers and it is expected that , in the long term , it will result in a longer @-@ term commitment of workers to an industry known for its high turnover of labour .
&apos;If you are not committed to transparency , you will lose people , &apos; Vitrano said .
and if you lose people you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you lose businesses . &apos;
euro area shining star : Baltics high incomes
although the crisis of 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , Breatberg is writing a report from the European Central Bank .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
the success is due to low debt , fast @-@ growing institutions and business and non @-@ market @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where the EU average has been significantly closer to the buying power of the triple @-@ GDP per capita . &quot; said the Central Bank .
although the objective is for the total economic output per capita to be equal to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 the total production of the Baltic economies per capita represented only 2 / 3 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement .
low wages have led the Cubans to seek better wages abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , less than half thought about their economies .
NCAA decision to cancel the two @-@ day trends changing the long days of Bruinsi
it is almost 23 : 00 when the football club UCLA is stopped to talk at the edge of a new venture in the team &apos;s university city .
some of them have been saddled by the company , revealing their efforts in the first day of the week of the training camp .
for a large part of the team , these minutes of prosperity offer paperwork from midday .
after a three @-@ hour trend , the participants in the courses will go back to learn to the final stages of a common life before returning to Wbilisi at 6.30 next morning .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mora , the Bruinsi trainer , shortly before Monday became Tuesday .
the NCAA decision to cancel the trends taking place twice a day to reduce the burden of players has in fact made their days longer - at least until they get to one side of the game on Friday .
for this reason , the first three rounds of UCLA were timed to start at 19.15 in order to fit into the already tight timescale of players .
moving from two strikes a day to another day means more one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ all days - the start of the Bruinsi training camp was raised almost a week before the last season , and for the first time during the Mora six Westwood season , there are trips during summer &apos;s ceremonies .
they will have 18 trends until 20 August before formal preparations begin for the September opening play against Texas A &amp; M .
according to Mora , he is in favour of a change in the rules of the NCAA , although it adds another item to the close schedules of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden three or four days and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; and they break through this challenge ; they are wonderful young people .
I believe that when the Saturday comes and we have more time , it is really nice . &quot;
once the camp is over , UCLA &apos;s trainings will be closed down , however , which is not an easy task , given the clear view of the parking plate close to their fields and the departing from the Luskini centre , the high @-@ class hotel that has already escaped from the protective network around the gates with football .
since this weekend , the players in the hotel Bruinsi are occupying , but Mora acknowledged that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&apos;We are implementing security measures &apos; said Mora .
&quot; this is a real concern and it is no exaggeration to think that people can rent a cheque and filter there .
if you have a record of a train , you can deal quite well with it .
but we are using a security team there and on the 8th parking site .
we will do our best by using our existing tools .
I will try not to be very concerned about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the election union of Saremare @-@ Ivanova , a government that has been born for the centre , a government that has been expelled from the Reform Party from Christiina Ojuland and has been forced to leave the ECB , would seem to have at least as much faith in the local elections as political parties in the local elections set up by the Commonwealth of the forces of Kaljese .
however , buses are considered in the autumn , and the key question will be whether they all have sufficiently disappointed voters .
who will remain with the Sahel ?
how small the support team of Edgar Sa176 are has been reduced , he can foresee events organised to honour his electoral union .
a member of the Assembly of State , some former and current partisan parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and why , for reasons of candidacy in Tallinn , is some of Satenare &apos;s honest sympathisers and sisters sitting aside , finding that the &apos; Sastalare list &apos; of the entrepreneurs , led by corruption practices and suspected of corruption , is becoming a reality ?
the popular musicides uttered on the part of the city &apos;s government to the Russian @-@ speaking poem , with the participation of the oldest city of the Lasnamäe ; and in every sense the original computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas , the chief figure , when he travels on the radauta , has to avoid the dead and slaves that are on the way - is it the first time that the CCP is trying to secure the votes of 16 and 17 @-@ year @-@ old electors ?
we look forward to the views of the other political parties on the youth election campaign .
if Kanal 2 or TV3 look against black spots instead of entertainment at the beginning of August , two options will remain : to accept that in future , only ETV , ETV2 , ETV + , Tallinn &apos;s TV and English @-@ language France24 channels or give up ten @-@ month telecommunication operators .
there are probably also those who openly rejoice at first about free television experiences , but ultimately - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and advertisements .
the deafening music , the lungs of the people and the rubble left on the streets are almost every major music fan .
however , if a man does not want to be part of her own , it is worth going home rather than having to pain home to discover - and leaving the room for sleeping for the Coptic sum of the festivals .
Washington changes the green card rules
media publications are quoted by President Donald Trumpi , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year of 50 000 people , stricter rules for the acquisition of temporary employment visas and restrictions on family orientation visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Republics and supported by the President .
the draft legislation will be discussed in two houses of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , as it will change the way in which the US handles green cards to the citizens of other countries .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process is an advantage for candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economies , &quot; said Trump in the US media outlets .
Siberia &apos;s young people are moving to the countryside , pensioners .
Jevseyev Anatoly continues the tradition of the famous functionaries of the River Maana .
she works 140 kilometres away from home at Maana additional time at Kuvai as head of the gold village .
it is a tough piece of work : two months in a row , 12 hours in work without rest days and then only 10 days back home and again .
Anatoly has only once seen gold in three years at the site .
&apos;There is a stark procedure there : when you go in , you go into a thorough check so that you do not lead to it , and when you go away &apos; , you are talking about Anatoly .
Mr Piho is speaking in the village of Haida about the local seto Jaani , who has spoken to him a great deal about the memory of his family in Siberia .
the still preserved archaic culture of Siberian setode will also have an impact on home @-@ seals , because it is simply so shocking that Piho Mare , in the most detailed terms , thinks of the farmblets studied .
his first trip to Siberia this year is 30 years since .
during that time he has been there fourteen times and lived there for a year .
how much did Siberia still emigrate at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I calculated it on the basis of the talks of Siberia &apos;s seto men , who have themselves thought about it .
it is hard to say precisely because at that time , up to 30 people could come in one group , but only a man was given a passport .
only one passport was issued , but had children , sisters , etc .
look at the size of this territory here !
it was many times greater than the historic Setomach .
it was , after all , necessary to educate , manage it in some way .
the sites came here as farmers , but their lives changed because they came to areas that were not only agricultural but also river ( palgiparking ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New Petseris , many sedozens later employed in the secret city of Krasnobillion @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power built the uranium @-@ enrichment plant - J. P. ) when it was formed .
did pigs then represent the majority of the population in this region ?
yes , they lived in tandem .
in addition , the tradition of marriage and multi @-@ child clarity maintained for a long time .
seven or eight children were in their families .
how much did Siberia &apos;s setode culture differ and different from that of the mother tongue ?
they are different , although what was brought here was once the same .
they brought with them a great deal of calm .
they did so by themselves ( ideas for peace ) , but they always made a distinction between what had been brought about and what had been done here .
climate change has had a strong impact on the traditional rice of seals , because it is a cold .
the proposed changes were made .
Setomaal meat , for example , was favoured , but was simply frozen here .
where are the villages of Siberia and what life is living there ? / graphics : Alari Paluends ?
the ties with the mother country were spiritually strong , it was considered to be very important .
it seems to me that now that country is starting to give back to the ground , is beginning to affect them .
those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories .
Piho is thinking of the people of the Estonian setode delegation , who came to the day of the Haida village Seto , at the beginning of July , and lived four days in homes - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is very easy to come and go , because the city has an excellent location : railway shoulder and road risking place , &quot; says Reigo Tamm from Taphen .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a great deal of nature , sport and culture , and we have a carrot in every corner .
Tapa is the tip of the city !
there are small islands on the verge of the River Carinine , where the fabrics are routinely engaged in hunting .
&quot; this beautiful place on the train screen does not appear , famously Reigo .
those who are not afraid of cold water can flood in this river , as the river is full of resources .
I have been there , you can do it !
the waters of the river can keep a distance and simply make a romantics : the flow of the river can look at it and think about life before and behind .
I have also been to my friends there .
apart from anything else , Mrs Tampere has visited the river archipelago between her three bridges : &apos; as this place is close to the city , no one can come back when their stories were uttered &apos; .
&quot; a wonderful view of Tapale is emerging from the magic mountains , but there are also health professionals where you can drink , you can pick the winter and you can now play the game , for example , of a discgolf - golf has been done , you can borrow from sporting pride . &quot;
the old professionals are , of course , going there with their keynote , but I have not yet been able to play there .
obviously , my colleague , Mrs Tapale , must be invited , because she has experienced a disposer and has a hecktag .
perhaps he lends me !
Reigo and Männikup were inseparable from the current opera period of childhood .
at least during the summer hours .
there are many tears left to this memory , many frustrations and you can see in my sporting life .
not to mention the shattered boxes and squares .
&quot; the entire city of Reigo is now full of construction works , all of which is changing to madness . &quot;
however , the old and tired wall building is a very attractive place where ski discoveries are played .
I am pleased that in 2012 , the head of R.A.A.A.A.A.M adopted my idea by noting in Meos , and had to make a tacit summer theatre with his theatre .
even though this year &apos;s communication season &apos; Aleprises i Karenin &apos; has just passed , on 11 August , the railway station is in the &apos; Elluärm &apos; , when the old Muslim building is moving around the 1980s .
&quot; between 11 and 13 August , the city of Tapa is the city of Tapa , which has seen the opening house of silence and rival cultural events , including the popular treasure , &quot; says Reigo , who recommends to visit the city of 9 years in the nodays .
in the mini @-@ colony of 1 May on the bottle , the museum dates back to 1994 .
&quot; the house is small , but the ponders are well and the information enormously &apos; , praises Reigo &apos;s place , full of the history of the city of Tapa , most of which focuses on rail and war .
Reigo mutes that , if you go through all the recommended sites in Tapal , you will go a long way but , fortunately , your young town will be filled with coffee .
&quot; we have such good eating places and sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad when you sit in cafés . &quot;
educated and young soldiers coming to Tapale spend a great deal of time in pumps , a wall when they sit there is a gigantic feeling that you are in Estonia and your own town , but around there is such an international company together .
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans .
we have a lot of troops , yes !
two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tendering in Greece
television channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , which reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering .
in the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of unlawfully commissioned people on the island of Sithonia , including two Bulgarians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the television channel bTV that Bulgarians were subsequently released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone who is caught in a clean @-@ up place , which is not intended for that .
the checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
the wolves taught by the novelty are breaking the sheep .
the farmers of the shelf land will have to give the wolves their &apos; learning material &apos; after a year - apparently puppet @-@ trained wolves have already broken a number of sheep .
this year sheep in the Hiiu County have broken the sheep three times , 23 sheep and 8 have been injured , writing the Hiiu site .
soil was the corresponding number only three , a year before 124 .
there is also data from the Environment Agency in synchrony that the wolf washing machines of soil in Hishelf land were not born and that the Hisunk Council had information that this year two wolf washing lines have been fixed on the island .
Mr Ööl opposed Monday , the junta Emdows opened up 15 sheep in Kabul and injured 18 survivors .
in the morning &apos;s early morning of the morning , the wolves broke a sheep on the pasture of the village of Rehedin and badly injured another , to whom an emergency killer had to be made .
rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Department of Rural Affairs sent a coordination front on the draft legislation on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment ( GMOs ) and on the amendment of plant protection legislation .
the amendment to the law removes the creation of a separate collection of data for both genetically modified ( GM ) crop sites and operators , which will henceforth be used as a plant health register .
in addition , the obligation of the GM crop manager to have prior agreement with the designated person dealing with beekeeping will be modified .
although currently no GM crops are grown in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified crops and non @-@ modified crops .
this is at least as long as it is not up to Estonia to declare GM @-@ free , &quot; said Sigmar mouth , Head of the plant Health Department of the World Department .
&quot; at the same time , it has to be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors , &quot; added the mouth .
the draft law repeals the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of genetically modified crop sites and handling facilities , sets out requirements for the handling of GM crops and for starting economic activities .
specifically with regard to beekeeping , the current obligation of GM crop growers to notify beekeepers of the start @-@ up of GM crops is replaced by an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeeping before farming begins .
the draft law has been sent to the Ministries for coordination .
all interested parties have the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the draft information system and , if they so wish , to give their opinion to the World Department .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , those active in the field of plant farming , beekeepers and the farming profession .
in the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize 810 - is allowed to be grown .
hitherto , however , none of the Estonian farmers are interested in the cultivation of GM crops .
the reason for this is that Estonia does not have a mamourty greedy , a European media corn with a maize line of 810 resistant .
it has also been trampled on the southern regions and is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
in order to secure this , the Department of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various suicides , maize and soya @-@ type grown in Estonia .
the analysis of the samples carried out showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soya varieties in Estonia did not include genetically modified organisms .
in turn , it could be concluded that in Estonia , genetically modified crops were not grown consciously , and it was also confirmed that there had not been any random contamination .
Jos Mourinho believes Manchester United colour in Nemanja Maticu as &quot; genius &quot;
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited her debate on Wednesday evening against Nemanja Maticu in the form of &apos; genius &apos; , after being a central player , Samenemoria .
in Dublin , in the last seasonal game of United , in front of UEFA Super Cupi &apos;s line against Madrid on Tuesday , GBP 40 million of whom he bought a player over Chelsea , began a victory of 2 to 1 in the algorithm , giving an impression of a defence role , while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on the crusade .
however , having left behind the seasonal Asian architecture of Blues , Maticd lacked much @-@ needed buzzling and only held 45 minutes , according to Mourinho , it must be corrected by a generalist before the start of the Premier League .
&quot; he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genius mentality - he has the mindset of football , &quot; said Mourinho .
&quot; we will help him to get a form as soon as possible . &quot;
like the NGOs , the Aviva stadium started by other recruited Victor Lindelof and Romeva lu Lukashenko , and Mourinho kicked up his single @-@ starting man at the beginning of the season quietly .
the Independent published this week that Mourinho still wanted to recruit three football clubs , but he confirmed that the club had already done &apos; excellent work &apos; by concluding agreements with three of its four priority choices .
&quot; I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four , &quot; she added .
&quot; I am even happier if they can deliver four out of four , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
another poet of salt was beaten by the GSM Embassy on 1 August and this time in Muhu .
Mati Martinson andus , a fragile poultry observer , got the first bull equipped with the embassy in Shaves , and this washer is already flying around , has left the washing ground and has joined a large dinner assembly in the Bay of Mullutu @-@ Large .
this is because , after all , there is no fruit fields , the voice of the islands writes .
this Tuesday , rather late to walk the course , another pump was taken on the island of Muhu .
according to Martinson , the installation of embassies is , in fact , an international project carried out by Mr Leito and Mr Ojens .
soil was supplied with a hot son called Mati GSM Embassy , Shaves Turkey .
&quot; his activities on the Internet are all on the watch : how he went to farm in Spain , he came back a long time at the German @-@ Polish border and then came to Saareland &apos; , Mr Martinson spoke .
British inventors to install microchips in their own body to get into their handful houses and cars
a British inventor became the first person in a country to which a microchip was installed so that he can only open his example with his hand , get access to the office and even launch a car .
33 @-@ year @-@ old Steven Northam children to install a small chip between their pöidla and their naming fingers and now also provide this service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier through BioTeq , through their own company .
he has combined forces with the Roman doctor @-@ anesthesiologi , Dr Geoff Watson , in Winchester , in Hande , in the county of Hampshire , to ensure that the installation procedure meets medical standards .
technology is similar to that of microchips installed on cats and bags , and it takes only 30 seconds for procedures .
the Northam company is also changing the snow of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip by asking for GBP 300 per snow .
this father of a child in a marriage has now installed the technology both at home and in his car , BMW Z4 , which is running when she has a hand in the wheel .
white house electronics cost taxpayers thousands
according to the military documents published in the magazine magazines , the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicopter last month for an event involving the production of America was to cost the southern taxpayer as much as USD 24 000 .
the Green and White colour Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , referred to as Marine One during the President &apos;s parity , was at the heart of the event presenting American construction programmes in Valges Maks on 17 July .
President Donald Trump , senior officials of Vice @-@ President Mike Pence and White House reported on industrial products from all 50 states on their tour .
the helicopter built in Connecticutis was driven together with the leader from the repute , the fire @-@ fighting car from Wisconsa and the palliative button produced in Missiszinsip .
according to the documents of the MaHelicopter Squadron One ( HMX @-@ 1 ) , the presence of the White House &apos;s military cabinet , or FARGO , sketched 36 hours before the helicopter scorned on the southern horror for the &apos; extraordinary &apos; event .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an unusually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said HMX @-@ 1 commander a day before the event in an e @-@ mail , an officer in charge of the navy to Deputy aviation .
it was stated in the message that the helicopter arrived at the southern horror at around 7 : 7 : 15 : 00 in the morning and stays there until the Christmas night between 18 and 21 is cleared .
added was the fact that , if the departure from Valgest Majlis were to take place , a second @-@ class flight is needed due to the restrictions on working time .
the initial flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the Icaandinavian security team remained close to the aircraft for the entire time it was on the ground .
it was not possible to read out from the documents given to the magazine magazine whether or not it was eventually necessary to have a second parcel .
the Hatch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political ends .
the documents show that HMX @-@ 1 examined whether this attempt could infringe this provision .
&quot; we asked if it infringes Hatch &apos;s law , and we were told that it would not breach , &quot; wrote commander .
&apos;You seem to have no choice , &apos; replied to the Deputy chief officer .
the White House project was announced as a &apos; made in America &apos; official event and the Hatch law would not have covered it .
but even official events have political undertones .
the event was supported by the President &apos;s efforts to reform health at the time in the Senate and praised attempts to keep government regulation at risk .
the use of a aircraft known as Marine One or Air Task Force for political profit is no new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them purely as a photograph is unusual .
the band drew attention in February to the first campaign event in Mauriidas Melbourne , a President &apos;s plane in water background , and he will be sleeping from Twitter &apos;s accounts messages complaining about how the President of his predecessor used the plane .
&apos;White Mal is very pleased with the display &apos; made in America &apos; , where products were represented in all the 50 states produced by American workers from American materials &apos; , &apos; said Lindsay Walters , the spokesman of the White House .
HMX @-@ 1 teams often carry out experiments around Washington and the southern horror in order to get used to putting the white house of the President of the United States down with a single cent meters .
when the Trump was in Germany at the start of July at the G20 summit , 58 attempts were made in the HMX @-@ 1 White House &apos;s care .
according to the official , the event &apos; made in America &apos; was considered to be the norm for the flight crew at that time of month .
helicopters from Eskar then lent an additional 11 hours &apos; for non @-@ President @-@ related support missions &apos; .
according to the White House , none of the other branches of this event burden the taxpayers &apos; purse .
according to the Sikorsky representative , the company was not involved in the operation of eviction on the southern horror of the helicopter .
HMX @-@ 1 will not preserve the budgetary documents for President flights and the precise costs of the event will be difficult to identify .
however , the VH @-@ 3D reimbursement rate is 24 to 380 per hour , according to the calendar of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017 .
the Eskar documents set the flight long from its basic naval base , the Quantico airport , Virginia , for 30 minutes .
the White House says that the real cost of using helicopter is well below its amount .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; costs on the basis of estimated compensations is very misleading , &quot; said Walters .
&quot; these estimates of reimbursement include staff , maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account for annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the rand survey of 2015 , the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation levels for personnel costs , while they cover the costs of fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former spokesman of the White House , Sean Simaer , defended the use of the helicopter at the time .
&quot; the idea is to show things made in America this week , &quot; said Snaper .
&quot; and I know that the State of Sikorsky and Connecticuti is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are presumably hundreds , if not thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on .
so it is , of course , right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not Trump was in touch with helicopter in the southern horror as part of the event was taking place , but he was hiding behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
within the White House , Trump Sikorsky addressed representatives by pulling off media outlets about the products of his company in his own aircraft park .
&apos;I know Sikorská very well , &apos; said , Mr President , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .
Grit Šadeiko - through tears peace and joy
Mil Daegus in 2011 hit Šadeikot in the last area , 800 metres drink the shower and the stadium was taken away with the headscarf .
just before that , he had got a zero leap from the University of Inter @-@ District in China .
in 2012 , Helsinki was a source of cheap injury , but at the time of the debate in London , she got 60 @-@ 13 points 23 .
however , my misfortune continued .
the Moscow Muna of 2013 became a remote fan of the Estonian record after its launch day .
two years later , he became the 15th place of the Beijing Mil and held Olympic anslam , but it was also a disappointment to the interested athlete .
Siko passed through Hebadeiko when the Amsterdam Pact did not first receive the result of a bail @-@ out letter .
I would simply like to put together a proper multicontest once and for all .
once , &apos; sprayed Šadeiko .
worse still : a month later , his Olympic contest in Rios broke out of the first barrier because of the revanity .
time had to be taken down - will you go ahead with 7 ?
is it all worth two days of effort ?
Neiu thought at length but found peace itself .
I could think about it soon .
it is quite difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time to cure ourselves and think about it .
&quot; I knew I did not yet put my fingers on the picture , &quot; is talking about Sadeiko &apos;s self @-@ cleansing .
I was able to turn a clean page and go ahead with a new impetus .
according to Treener Anne hill , it was very difficult to watch the suffering of care , but she realised that , above all , the athlete himself had to get clear .
after all , he was so buried by everyone .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; however , Grit said that he would not give up and he would like to prove to himself what he was worth . &quot;
now you have some sort of peace .
he will do so to his delight .
the contest came back in May , when Šadeiko set 6280 points in the new Estonian record at the Götzise multicontest .
in a high @-@ level competition , she improved her personal peak mesh with nearly one metre ( 13.89 ) and ran a record near @-@ peak barrier .
then the multi @-@ competitor felt that it was not at all a ceiling of capabilities , but only the first hunger of the contest was extinguished .
he has been guided for years by a phrase that Siko is a black student .
he is ready to be a sportsman , he is well trained .
if something goes wrong or is wrong , he says so immediately .
it feels its own body and trusts its sense .
that is what we have to do .
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we will follow it .
the new approach has also been found in Shadeiko .
&apos;I am not the one who makes the curve to the maximum &apos; , he says and says that the most important thing is to get the hour right , because it also ensures a good result .
baby walkers grenadier
the good emotion has also been offered to the Shaadeik by friends .
both his former sister in the field of training , Maris hill and sister Grete , recently became parents , and he has received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;It has been quite interesting &apos; , it says Sadeiko .
a alcohol with a drinking is synonymous with &apos; training &apos; .
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is such a great wine fan that he believes that wine can be trained better than any other thing in the world .
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University .
his message is not about alcohol , or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine grazing process .
Wooking up the sheep , chatting up the wine , enjoying it and feeling the aftertaste , we are putting our taste into work to create a taste for wine .
according to Sheperdi , the presence of algae does not actually include taste , but taste is born of the way in which wine stimulates the brain .
he brings a comparison to how brain &apos; sees &apos; colour &apos; .
&quot; taste is not wine , taste wine is a delict , &quot; says Sheperd .
the things that are still affecting the taste of wine are , for example , the amount of our age , gender and even coal that man produces .
Sheperd , of course , is manned that wine is not full of hair .
&apos;There must be more in action &apos; , he says .
if you are too fat , the system has overgrown .
excessive drinking can harm brain use instead of profit - according to a 2004 study , people who drink three glass with wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity risk .
10 % of Estonian ICT workers pay less than colleagues
the data from the staff search company , Fontes , reveal that 10 % of Estonian ICT workers receive less pay than colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , the portal Geenius writes .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector &apos;s salary survey .
a total of 8 577 posts were examined .
63 % of the posts were male .
&quot; although only 3 companies said that the pay gap was in favour of men and that there is no pay gap between the remaining companies , in reality , the basic pay of men per month is on average 10 % higher than that of women and an average of 8 % higher than that of women in the year of men , &quot; the analysis of the Fund , Ilmar Karas , said .
&quot; Narcose 3 &quot; advertising clip : now that Pablo Escobar has gone , Netflix hittsara takes centre stage Cali cartel .

the third and fourth times of the season have been confirmed by the quota @-@ back service and the first has already been a promotional clip that hampers the sardines with new torns .
in the third season , DEA pays its attention to the world &apos;s richest drug organisation - the Cali cartel .
they operate under the leadership of four powerful crosses &apos; such as Forty 500 companies &apos; , simply with more bribery to the government and more violent actions .
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is head of cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Oreyela ( Francisco Denis ) , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) is leading links with Mexico and Chepe Santasanitary London ( Pepe Rapazote ) in New York .

UN says Afghans &apos; democracy depends on the role of women in politics
the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
the head of the UN assistance mission , Nicholas Haysom , said that hundreds of women were standing in local Soviet elections , three women are standing as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; by underlining the importance of women &apos;s role , he said in a statement made on Wednesday .
elections can truly represent the people and can only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
for its part , the Taliban have threatened the electoral process , which coincides with a transition period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections will mark the first time that power is handed over calmly from one democratically elected government to the next .
according to the ysms , women &apos;s strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan is increasing .
according to the Independent Election Commission in Afghanistan , 1.2 million registered voters are women .
the joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both large and small .
there is always too little time in common , but trenn with words is a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , closeness and burdens .
and what convenient solution - wherever you go in summer , live pigs are always with you and you will remember with your fine @-@ handed vote : &apos; let us now also make a trail ! &apos;

a piece is the cornerstone of a lasting settlement of shoes and tubes - who would then like to take the form of a wave of sand stunned over the summer ?
it is wonderful to use children instead of cannabis !
first of all , it is secure and convenient , with the difficulty gradually increasing at the same pace as the training team .
mature children can also be accommodated with quite large children .

in order to add the burden , there can be a plant , a tear turf , and there is also something to walk around .
there may be a minor parent planting for the hip , but this exercise offers a slap to all children .
while crabs are joining the siblip , the tricipe , ash and kaeromeat will be burdened as they were infected .

it is possible to fly , relax , strike a balance and be difficult .
a little girl &apos;s life is an exhortation if he gets small things in coming up .
there is an additional burden on clearing feet .

children themselves have a lot freelance to do with thick and plate .

at the same time , parents have a truly effective whole body trend .

Philippines at the heart of moefles - Tarlgkot in the wider world
red bags in the newspapers are a summer class which in recent years has become a self @-@ employed product , one of the right skippers must even hang their hand and which , despite its modest origin , has been picked up by traders to use a price label appropriate to their hives .
the red tape of the bars is probably one such thing that has existed in the life of the age of justice and that has not aroused any particular emotion .
it is simply there , and if it does not exist , there will be no overlap .
now , however , beer bags are making a real victory , and moefers have switched their musical design bags for summer months instead of simple red cows .
it is not only a coastline , but today it is also just as popular as a street chamber , and it is even more courageous women who walk into the office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear , before it is over @-@ the @-@ top , whether this summer &apos;s temperature is sitting , or whether it is worth noting and laptopping the laptops are still slightly more formal .
however , the wealth of religion has made beer bags a real summer love for women .
when you read foreign moilters , for example , the first thing is that the moeghurts will prove to be the first thing to be on the local market when they travel on holiday , and they will acquire some beer to which there is a truce for a whole holiday , and which will be accompanied by beaches , the market , as well as friend when they are lying on the town .
some bloggers are so generous that they buy their homes on the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers .
it is worth noting , however , that there is such a demand among readers that women ( and men ! ) apparently go to each other in the real world in order to become a happy owner for some homes .
in some ways , this madness is also understandable , as it is rare to have these regimes when you can buy some of the things that have risen into collective redress yesterday for just a few euros .
it is true that the chambers of shops have also found a simple way of making money here , and so selfish @-@ rich luxury @-@ brands sell their bags for a few hours and a few thousand euros .
obviously , still so that the richer customers do not have to feel easy to die , who are trying around with some cheap bags .
for example , Dolce &amp; Gabbana will be able to buy a beer of over EUR 1 000 .
however , the interpretation of the Chancellery beer can be found in the circle of EUR 6 000 .
however , unlike most motives , beer bags do not come from a few big Cape Verde , but they were born in a much more distant way .
in fact , beer bags supposedly come from far from the Philippines , where they have been wearing them wide .
there is , first and foremost , a red covert of newspapers and very often no trace of the export trade and the local circle .
it has been said that mining technology originates from the 14th century and is quite a sardine with the usual coral .
however , as beer dogs do not have to be as red as corn , they can intercept muscles and other materials that make the dog more individualised and , by extension , more actrate .
recently , for example , there are particularly trendy bags where colourless paints or skin boxes have been squeezed in .
however , the letter of directors can first of all be sent to the Koran Jane Birkinkini , the largest red @-@ red brewl of which was not seen before .
indeed , he matched the shoulder to all sorts of clothing sets and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival .
however , the popularity of the applicants nowadays also does not play a lesser role in ensuring that they are looked after and , unlike every other ski , they do not have to be cared for by special means , but also by the water and wet .
as in the case of trendy predators , apart from classical straits , brands have emerged with all possible interpretations .
for example , if you wish , you can buy a red @-@ red riders or a little nursery .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classic beer will never go from fashion to beer .
but what is the classic beer ?
for centuries , a red copy of beer has been considered classical , which resembles a flat from its style , is on the sidelines and is short , as well as from its benches .

GMB is concerned about investment in the McVitie plant
the trade union expects leaders in McVitie to confirm long @-@ term plans for production at the Glasgow plant .
according to GMB Scotland , the company has remained silent on the subject of the future of the investment .
more than 500 people work in a theatre producing Hobnos and rich know @-@ how and other products .
the owner of McVitie in Pladis said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in an object in the last few years .
more staff and trade union chairmen were employed there , &apos; are the first to hear &apos; when something changes in the operation of the factory .
in a letter to the head of the company , the GMB Scotland company , McVitie , called for &apos; concerns about the lack of funding for modernising production lines &apos; .
GMB senior organisator Drew Duffy said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the seat on the business needs and the future investment plan for customs purposes is a source of deep concern for our Members .
several generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is largely made up of local communities and people around Glasgow , a vital pillar for decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social insecurity .
therefore , in the context of jobs , wages and prosperity in the eastern part of Glasgow , Brext , the rise in living costs and the chronic fall in production costs , a thriving manufacturing company in McVitie is sorely needed . &quot;
the Pladise representative said : &apos; only yesterday , the head of customs services received a letter from the GMB Scotju , and the company replies directly to him , as we value an active relationship with the representatives of workers and trade unions .
two months ago , a regular meeting took place at customs level between workers and representatives of the GMB , which openly discussed a number of issues .
we discussed with the workers then that , like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are reviewing our activities from the current point of view - and this applies to all our businesses and all our objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
he added , &apos; In recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million in customs roaming , most of which has gone into production lines and improvements in operations .
we fully understand customs tariffs as a source of heritage and , if there were any change in the operation of the site , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago against Neymarii &apos;s approach ?
la li regrets its interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not give up in its efforts to attract Neymar in its ranks by offering him an offer of GBP 189 million to buy him , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record consolation ?
this verbal approach has opened summer as a transitional window , and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the current world record of buying more than double that set at the previous time by Paul Pogba &apos;s return to Manchester Unitede for GBP 89 million .
once the transition has been completed , Neyra will as a result be the world &apos;s most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world , which will pay more than GBP 500 000 a week after payment from the PSG .
Barcelona is , of course , a hint both because of the approach and because of the break @-@ down of Neyra , although the source close to the chair of the Catalansi confirms that the club has always looked after the football camp since its arrival in Santoi in 2013 .
but did the PSG President warn the football world of this opportunity three years ago ?
when Manchester City showed interest in the conclusion of the Blaise Matuga Agreement in 2014 , Nasser Al @-@ Khelaif strongly warned all clubs thinking about the recruitment of some of the best players in the PSG .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that , when they concern some of our players , we will accommodate them and contact those players , &quot; said Al @-@ Khelaif .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but when they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appears to have gone beyond this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the PSG central player Marco Verratti .
PSG made it clear that they would not allow them to leave their itan , under any circumstances , and that Barcelona could be a setback as a result of this interest by removing one of their precious assets in the form of Neyra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders after Brexitit .
&quot; Brexit is seriously threatened with a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Varadkar on his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&apos;I cannot imagine who would benefit from this &apos; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods , said Varadkar .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; he emphasised .
he said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as it cannot , to remain part of the European single market .
this would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
another way of making British opt @-@ outs smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , Varadkar said : &apos; surely we could have that with Britain &apos; .
the alternative to this would be to return to customs items that would declare historical divisions and political failure .
&quot; raise trade , prosperity and peace , &quot; said the Prime Minister of Ireland .
he called Brexitit &apos; A challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when he visited Belfast .
Avja , the first and a half @-@ long triathon , is a sign of Ironman &apos;s ability to go through everyone .
today , the greatest Triatlonifers of the Baltic States were held in the capital of the winter , when nearly a thousand tricks were brought to the competition of half @-@ long Ironman from over thirty countries .
70.3 miles of design consisted of 1.9 km of swimming , 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling .
among others , the first Triatlon of his life has also been successfully closed down by a note of Avences .
&quot; I thought that it would be difficult and , in the end , it was difficult to do so , &quot; said Avja &apos;s finch .
despite the complexity of Avences , in fact , the triathlon is fit for nearly everyone .
&quot; not disdance kills but the pace kills , &quot; he said , suggesting that , at an affordable rate , everyone will reach the finalist .
except Ott Sepp : &apos; everything is fine , but unfortunately it cannot swallow &apos; .
Avences had already made a very strong move since February .
initially 4 @-@ 5 hours per week , but 10 hours a week later .
time 05 : 34 : 12 reached 2760 seats in general terms .
although Avences lost both Raio Piiriro ( time 04 : 59 : 53 ) and Jürgen Ligi ( time 05 : 06 : 37 ) , she won other so @-@ called &apos; prominent &apos; classes .
in seven minutes ( 05 : 41 : 54 ) , journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes ( time : 05 : 50 : 23 ) , Kalev Krnew and Raivo E. Tamm ( times : 31 : 53 and 06 : 45 : 45 ) .
John Moldan , a German with 3 : 58 : 27 , Estonians with the best Ivo Grear 04 : 14 : 09 , the overall winner of the Otepää phase .
among women , the Danish Lady Helle Frederiksen won 04 in time : 24 : 01 , Estonians , Maria Jänese , who lost Frederiksen almost half a hour and received 04 : 58 : 58 .
Avences went from 1.9 km to 42 minutes and 14 seconds .
he came out of 410 positions .
