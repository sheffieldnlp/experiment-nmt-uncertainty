four members of K@@ Cape ro@@ vo group were arrested in Estonia and Spain
according to postal service , in Spain , the so @-@ called &apos; Cape ro@@ vo group leader &apos; in Estonia , S@@ lava Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , known as S@@ lava K@@ Cape ro@@ v@@ ski , was detained by the police in the criminal world .
Gu@@ y@@ vi@@ ch , held in Spain , was arrested on trial .
yesterday , the Court also with@@ drew three suspects arrested in Estonia .
it is suspected that this is a so @-@ called &apos; Cape ro@@ vo &apos; criminal community members of the age of 27 @-@ 57 , which mainly commits crimes against drugs .
in the province of M@@ ala , Spain , the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained .
three men were detained in Estonia as a suspect , one of them is , according to data , the leading figure of a criminal community and two are members of a criminal community .
the data collected indicate a clear division of roles and roles within the criminal community .
the activities of the criminal community were aimed at committing crimes against drugs and thus generating criminal proceeds , &quot; commented the head of the criminal case before the court , Public Prosecutor Va@@ eda@@ Ver@@ te .
&apos;@@ We do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals in this criminal case is increasing &apos; , the Prosecutor added .
these are people who have previously found themselves in the interest of law enforcement authorities , some of whom have been punished for drug crimes .
Mrs Ver@@ te emphasised that cooperation with my Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become the norm for us , and this week &apos;s operation demonstrates the success of cooperation , &quot; commented the Prosecutor , Mrs Ver@@ te .
the head of the central criminal police service , ago Le@@ is , said that detention was preceded by a preliminary investigation of nearly one and a half years .
&quot; in the first half of the week , long @-@ term work was carried out and , at the same time , in Estonia and Spain suspected of crimes , he said .
Le@@ is added that central police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have good contacts and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are yet another message to criminals that we will get them out of the other end of Europe . &quot;
the information gathered so far makes it clear that , when there is no doubt , the injured men may continue to commit new crimes , which is why the prosecution service asked for their arrest and the court also approved it .
a man arrested in Spain expects his surrender to Estonia .
as part of this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been frozen to ensure confiscation .
the criminal case before trial is conducted by a central criminal justice police agency and is run by a public prosecution service .
the Tallinn City Court sentenced Mr. Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch to blackmail in 2005 and punished him with five years &apos; imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch was considered the second most important man in the criminal world of Estonia following the then alli@@ l@@ m@@ ali@@ y@@ r Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Mr Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , from Cape Verde , pointed out at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
he allegedly taxed tax@@ ed tax@@ i drivers and women in different ho@@ tels and ordered a monthly ca@@ rele@@ ss@@ ness tax on business@@ men .
international joint operations , the confiscation of proceeds of crime and the entry into force of court judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the most recent court rulings , the eight accused persons allocated to the so @-@ called &apos; D@@ ik@@ ye@@ v criminal community &apos; , of whom EUR 80 000 were confis@@ cated , or the nine individuals of the judgment , that Mr Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v created a criminal community in 2006 aimed at illicit trade in cigarettes and the crime of trafficking in human beings in East Vir@@ u@@ land and in South Estonia .
the proceeds of the seized criminal activity there are close to EUR 71 500 .
in these criminal matters , it has been a success for police officers to exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and , if necessary , to carry out operations in any country in the European Union .
civil Rights Group war@@ ns of Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ s travelling
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ wines of C@@ olo@@ red People &apos;s ( NA@@ ACP ) has warned the people travelling to Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ s against discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State .
the Group &apos;s statement states that &apos; the NA@@ ACP travel position issued for the State of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which runs until 28 August 2017 , calls on all African @-@ American travellers , visitors and sou@@ the@@ ans to be particularly attentive and extremely careful when moving around the country , given the dubious racial events that have taken place recently , and which have also been pointed out here &apos; .
according to NA@@ ACP , the group urged both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it more difficult to win discrimination cases , and the fact that the destination for state law enforcement is unequal to a large extent minorities .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
they are being pul@@ led down because of their sk@@ in colour , beaten or slaugh@@ tered , &apos; said R@@ o Cha@@ pel &apos;s newspaper The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r , President of NA@@ ACP .
&quot; we have never received complaints so closely before . &quot;
this is the first such warning that an organisation has issued for the US State .
the group referred to events such as racist insul@@ ts towards black students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black @-@ old model of T@@ en@@ nes@@ ta .
S@@ and@@ ers died at the beginning of this year , under dubious circumstances , after she ran out of a state of petrol and was arrested by the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
in addition , a comment refers to a recent report by the Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which shows that in state , the cars of black drivers are being stopped by 75 % more likely than those of white men .
&apos;@@ The comment is intended to make people aware and alert their families , friends and collabor@@ ators for what may happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people must be ready , whether it means engaging bail @-@ outs or informing relatives that they are going through the state . &quot;
according to the latest information from the F@@ B@@ I programme on hate crime , 100 hate crime were documented in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is in 2015 , which places the country in a supranational 16@@ th place in terms of the number of similar violations .
a passenger warning is also a response to the new Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it difficult to appeal to the Court of Justice for discrimination in search of housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Community ( IP@@ Civil Aviation Union ) had previously issued travel reservations about T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona , following the adoption by these states of immigration laws obli@@ ging local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences , as the AC@@ L@@ U says it will increase racial profiling .
normally , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about other countries , but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what can anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis A , B , C , D and E may be caused by five different he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses .
all these vir@@ uses provo@@ ke a li@@ ver acute infection .
however , with a bad natural cost , he@@ pati@@ tis B and C are chronic , which can continue to develop into a li@@ ver ch@@ lor@@ ine , a li@@ ver th@@ read and a li@@ ver cancer .
Si@@ ul@@ o Ku@@ tsa@@ r , an epidemi@@ ological Ad@@ vis@@ er of the Health Agency , says that the phenomenon of acute he@@ pati@@ tis is the same for all types of li@@ ver @-@ bur@@ n - f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ gue , swe@@ ets , birth , o@@ in@@ isation , a@@ erial pain , grey evi@@ ctions , dark horse mackerel , meat and excessive fur@@ ni@@ ture , and sk@@ in and li@@ ps@@ y .
the last symptoms of the disease also include the popular name of a li@@ ver @-@ bur@@ n infection with th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic cancer .
children can experience he@@ pati@@ tis without disease .
it is only possible to determine the different types of laboratory research .
extreme he@@ pati@@ tis can be transformed into chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and will continue for decades without disease symptoms , meaning that a person may not know anything about his dangerous pay @-@ harm disease .
Si@@ ul@@ o Ku@@ aval@@ r will identify different forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and will describe their progress more closely .
F@@ ur@@ ric@@ al vir@@ uses of he@@ pati@@ tis are spreading from a hospital to a person and infected us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , from pigs , from infected man &apos;s emissions to hands and hands on foodstuffs , soil , items , communication and consumption of drugs .
a he@@ pati@@ tis was exposed to the risk of conta@@ gious infection - that is , family members and carers of the disease , people suffering from chronic li@@ ver diseases , sex people with a infection , male sex men , drug users , countries with a high pre@@ valence of he@@ pati@@ tis A .
it is possible to prevent infection by vacc@@ inations , in particular by proposing vaccination for people who travel a lot and who are at risk of he@@ pati@@ tis A .
furthermore , daily hygiene requirements are essential : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands , before consumed food , to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
b he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses vir@@ g@@ ins in contact with the blood of a sick person , in injec@@ tion of drugs , in nur@@ turing , hon@@ ouring , hon@@ ouring , using blood @-@ contaminated me@@ ters ( too@@ th@@ ol@@ ves , par@@ enth@@ ood ) , donor blood , sex treatment with he@@ pati@@ tis pre@@ da@@ tors , and from he@@ pati@@ tis disease to animals / new@@ born babies .
b he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ infected drug users , sex partners of infected people , sex men with men , the new@@ born babies of the infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body flu@@ ids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police and countries with a high he@@ pati@@ tis B .
in order to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis , it is possible to vacc@@ in@@ ate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vacc@@ in@@ ate people at risk , as well as people suffering from chronic li@@ ver diseases , HIV infection , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
b he@@ pati@@ tis is other preventive measures : ref@@ ra@@ ining from the use of foreign hygiene and man@@ n@@ ou@@ ris@@ h@@ ments , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ gic need@@ les , ca@@ rele@@ ss@@ ness and honour and con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection , or preventing sexual risk .
vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis b is part of the National immunity Scheme and is free of charge for children in Estonia .
He@@ pati@@ tis C virus is spreading to the blood of a sick person , to in@@ ject drugs , to nur@@ turing , to honour , to the use of blood @-@ contaminated me@@ als , to blood blood , to the donor &apos;s blood , to the sex treatment of a he@@ pati@@ tis drug addi@@ tive and to the animals / new@@ born from he@@ pati@@ tis disease .
the C @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis infection risk group consists of injec@@ ting drug users , sex partners for infected people , sex men with men , the new@@ born babies of the infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body flu@@ ids , health care , rescue workers and police , persons with HIV infection and countries with a high he@@ pati@@ tis C .
C he@@ pati@@ tis prevention is : refrain from the use of stran@@ gers hygiene and man@@ gan@@ gs , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ gic need@@ les , ca@@ rele@@ ss@@ ness and honour and con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
He@@ pati@@ tis D@@ pati@@ tis is caused by he@@ pati@@ tis D virus , which is spreading in the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
as a result , he@@ pati@@ tis D , together with he@@ pati@@ tis B or super@@ information , are chronic with he@@ pati@@ tis B .
He@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses blood and other body flu@@ ids , contaminated sy@@ stal@@ les , sexu@@ ally transmitted and rarely infected animals .
He@@ pati@@ tis B is chron@@ ically infected with he@@ pati@@ tis B and people with no immunity from he@@ pati@@ tis B .
an effective preventive measure is the vaccination with the B he@@ pati@@ tis vaccine , which also protects a person from infection with he@@ pati@@ tis D .
He@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses vir@@ g@@ ins are spreading on the motor@@ way to drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and sea sh@@ ell@@ fish , donor blood , joint @-@ use need@@ les and more infected animals .
passengers may be infected with the high incidence of E he@@ pati@@ tis in countries with high epi@@ demics .
He@@ pati@@ tis prevention measures are compliance with hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands after sw@@ im@@ ming , before c@@ oo@@ king and eating , after care for the sick .
F@@ ru@@ its and vegetables are deter@@ red before consumption , avoid the feeding of little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , drink only safe drinking water and refrain from consuming drugs .
although in the past , competitors tried to push away from the four @-@ day Olympic winners , 34 @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ara@@ h ended up with force and won 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
F@@ ara@@ h did not think at length , drawing her hus@@ band T@@ ania and children on the way after the fin@@ ch .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much love my family .
it was wonderful to be on their way , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h for journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h is targeting the fifth edition of the London title , a gol@@ den du@@ mp of between 5 000 and 10 000 metres .
everything is possible if believed in it .
despite the title , Mrs Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ norm@@ i &apos;s &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , the exceptional story of G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t &apos;s mas@@ ter@@ piece , Ms B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , is &apos; from syn@@ thesis to one of the artistic works much deeper than the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to the cultural life of Vienna .
but more deeply in history .
the pre@@ da@@ tory inf@@ low of information , perhaps the lou@@ der in the back @-@ up , the narro@@ w@@ er subject would have been to have had more influence on the exceptional story of the Directorate @-@ General .
at present , there would be as if there were two books between some of them : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t and his father &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , the story of A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , and a much larger and more comprehensive history site from respec@@ table Jewish families and the German occupation , with its aftermath in Austria .
the first third of the book is leading to a cultural life in the middle of the w@@ ed@@ ding Vi@@ in and who himself came to the capital of Austria , to the slightest wonder how life around R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ s more than a hundred years ago , or how the Cen@@ tr@@ ali coff@@ ee all turned its heads when the climate inva@@ ded .
the concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the rich@@ est cities in Europe , and when you see the name in the book , you felt more like a gram of culture .
however , the fact , for example , that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud operated in a city where there was an un@@ treated ar@@ son@@ ist in vo@@ id and there was the highest su@@ ici@@ dal level in Europe , creates nothing more for development .
or perhaps , however , every couple of honest pa@@ ints also add colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna .
dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had explo@@ ded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
the exchange of time was almost one in ten inhabitants of Vienna .
parents were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time the hel@@ ple@@ ss@@ ness of A@@ gile was opened up twice to the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ ad Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch@@ i and climate cli@@ mb for his famous pa@@ int@@ ings , his father had become the seventh largest bank in H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg E@@ mp@@ ire .
but let us not give up all the gla@@ z@@ ambi@@ que life he belon@@ ged to .
when you look at the &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; , it is hard to believe that , at the end of life , it was a great da@@ ge of soci@@ alism and dre@@ aming of a trip to the Soviet Union .
in 19@@ 33 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band from the Kli@@ m@@ ese , the last minute was the Ma@@ z@@ ambi@@ que ar@@ tist in Vienna .
the cli@@ mb order then cost 4 000 kro@@ ons , a quarter of the price of a well @-@ established rural house .
some of the sports officers were suspected of being ham@@ pered by a bot@@ tle mo@@ del@@ led by a master &apos;s ar@@ tist , a sugar mag@@ ne .
as far as the A@@ dele@@ tes is concerned , the only certainty is that the close relationship between the mo@@ del@@ li and the ar@@ tist created during their work continued to life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - &quot; Da@@ am gold . &quot;
G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti &apos;s mas@@ ter@@ piece , A@@ ute B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri lar exceptional story , Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , translated Al@@ do R@@ and@@ land from English .
shortly before the start of the work with A@@ dele@@ t , the climate had been going to Ra@@ ven@@ nas San V@@ ita@@ le in the automotive sector , and the researchers think that it was the great mo@@ sa@@ ic mo@@ sa@@ ic mo@@ sa@@ ds that were seen there who gave the ar@@ tist the idea of making a gol@@ den ath@@ ree A@@ dele@@ tes colour as a mo@@ sa@@ ic .
the climate presented its &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; in Vienna in 19@@ 08 and around the same time ( 19@@ 07 @-@ 19@@ 08 ) was born in another gol@@ den country .
the artistic his@@ tori@@ ans did not notice the simil@@ arity of the two women .
what about nature is Hitler ?
&quot; I think that , to remember my friend , Mr Kli@@ m@@ ant , I owe him to make his job available to the public &apos; , A@@ ute B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer wrote to the director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere muse@@ um in February 19@@ 18 and wanted their family &apos;s climate college to go to mus@@ eu@@ ms .
six years before the death , the climate had produced a troika of A@@ dele@@ ka .
in his wil@@ dlife , too , in February 19@@ 25 , he asked her hus@@ band to leave his two por@@ ters and four G@@ usta@@ m@@ t meteoro@@ logis@@ ts in Austria .
she wrote to the nur@@ ses of Mari@@ ana and Lu@@ ora .
one year on from the end of the &apos; Annex to Austria Mon@@ a &apos; , the climate had attempted to escape Vi@@ in Ka@@ w@@ ond de A@@ ka@@ de@@ mines from 17 @-@ year @-@ old Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , but fell through the drawing board .
although , sometimes , the reason for Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is thought to be that Jewish profes@@ sors did not accept him in the A@@ ca@@ de@@ an , none of his exa@@ min@@ ers was in fact Jewish .
in any case , the role of Austrian Gal@@ eri referred to in the testa@@ ment had changed considerably by 19@@ 39 - it was important that the rich Jewish arts of Vienna have found the work of the Nazi par@@ ade .
Hitler &apos;s personal artistic assets were also bo@@ thered by some of the work at home for A@@ rad , but not by the climate .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the artistic rob@@ ber@@ y of the Naz@@ is , a ten @-@ year @-@ old dispute broke out between the Austrian Government and the he@@ irs of B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ dis .
at this point , it should be noted that when the &apos; novel &apos; faces the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle in Vienna , the &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; images of A@@ ute B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ er must be seen to go to New York &apos;s Ne@@ ue Gal@@ eri .
and before Vienna , the aforementioned book also reads .
even if you do not plan to look at the work of the climate , because at least my emo@@ tions , after the closure of the book , were more Nazi and Jewish than the land sold for 135 million dollars and mode@@ ll A@@ ys B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer .
so it is not so much a fasc@@ in@@ ating story , rather than a sexu@@ ally transmitted life - and a very moving story .
it significantly facilitated the orientation of the events at the beginning of the book on the issue of Bau@@ dis .
17 year old flood in Canada was very close to the Estonian record
in living memory , gold was close to a personal record of 200 metres of se@@ li@@ zing , flooding close to 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 .
the Ti@@ pp@@ mark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ old years a week ago , when the Canadian A@@ P@@ ope U@@ ik@@ blo@@ g was awarded a prize at 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 .
the gold esca@@ ped , in other words , the A @-@ fin@@ alists of the last decade .
in Fin@@ ally he gradu@@ ated from 2.@@ 15.@@ 76 and achieved a good seventh place with a powerful new peak .
the Estonian record ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) , which is part of Ms K@@ end@@ zi@@ e , left the Gol@@ den to be split just over half a second .
Estonia recorded a third increase in gold in all times , and its fresh personal excellence mark is the result of Estonia &apos;s five @-@ fold performance .
a young hope for the future will be in the launch of another 100 metres , 200 metres and 400 days in the inaugu@@ ration of the Canadian adult champi@@ on@@ ship and 200 m@@ m and 400 times in the b@@ read@@ ings .
last week , in Tor@@ onto , there was a Canadian Ju@@ da@@ e@@ o champi@@ on@@ ship , and gold also made successful head@@ way there .
he won 200 m in am@@ p@@ aste with a sil@@ ver me@@ dal period of 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
so quickly , this distance was floo@@ ded most recently in 2008 .
only a record Estonian woman , E@@ lina Par@@ tar@@ ka , has been distan@@ ced from this distance more quickly than ever in Estonia .
as a Canadian pro@@ tag@@ on@@ ist , a further Me@@ dal of 100 c@@ r@@ è@@ ches won an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season with 5@@ 6.@@ 66 .
for example , Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k , a year old , has distan@@ ced itself from this distance by just one century more quickly .
he reached a personal peak point in an exchange of 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 with a further 100 metres of se@@ lu@@ ge .
half of the longer distance , he only gained a seat in the seventh place , when he was u@@ tte@@ red at 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
gold is currently leading the ranking of the Estonian season on four distinct distances .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics am@@ pu@@ table teet@@ h
the time of the holidays is in place - that is , the ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity of the US President , Donald T@@ ru@@ ts .
however , as the T@@ ru@@ mp has so far been the President who has taken one of the most holiday days , critics are already pu@@ mping teet@@ h .
according to the US Congress CN@@ N , the President intends to have 17 days &apos; leave in a non @-@ attached gol@@ f club in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , in New Jer@@ sey .
although presidential leave began yesterday , opponents of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i leave have been speaking for weeks .
they are throwing the bul@@ l over too frequently to the Olympic Games .
the President has the ha@@ bit of dra@@ gging his weekend in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey &apos;s cotton .
incidentally , the T@@ ru@@ mp has not been cleared by the President in its 19@@ 6 official days .
for example , Mr Bush had already managed to be 67 days on holiday , with Mr Obama half as much as Mr T@@ ru@@ mp , but 21 days on holiday .
however , the Olympic crisis tends to forget things quickly .
the days after he became President , T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s recei@@ pt said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; that there would be no time for long holidays during his counter@@ part , as a great deal of work was needed .
he also expressed his outra@@ ge at Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
the current president wrote on Twitter : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , he is playing gol@@ f , the brak@@ es and the j@@ ung@@ le groups , journalists are dro@@ pping their heads from the eye &apos; .
according to officials in the White House , 17 days &apos; visit to gol@@ f club is not a mira@@ cle .
it is officially called &apos; work leave &apos; , during which the T@@ ru@@ el does not have time to read or other forms of enter@@ tainment .
in addition , work leave had to be another reason .
indeed , the western part of the White House is being replaced by a special system of traditional retirement and therefore all staff had to leave it .
the West Bank is also based on O@@ val@@ ka@@ tellis and other functions of the President .
&apos;@@ I do not think that any of you would like to be in the West in August , when there is 38 degrees and there is no traditional pension@@ er &apos; , said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , spokes@@ man of the White House , who stressed that the President would continue to work during his leave .
from where President T@@ ru@@ mp will spend 17 days , you will have an idea of video .
blocking critics from Facebook , X , do not stand for state office unless you tolerate the criticism of the voters .
the father of our country knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to start ty@@ rant him for everything from internal politics to his political principles .
he was , of course , upset by criticism .
but he did not force his critics to remain silent .
because , in 17@@ 83 years , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression could be taken away from us and that , if we remain silent , we could be cha@@ iring the slaugh@@ ter@@ houses &apos; .
it brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s govern@@ or Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who will have to work to be more like Washington .
Mr Ho@@ gan &apos;s sub@@ missions have blocked and deleted the postal services of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the American Civil Liberties Union ( IP@@ AC@@ L@@ U ) therefore referred it to the Court .
the Governor &apos;s official wal@@ ked the action into empty and the web commen@@ ta@@ tors b@@ anis@@ hed from reactions in a style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is just Facebook , &apos; many said .
but it counts .
and it is particularly important when it comes to honey like Ho@@ gan .
it is an ama@@ zing popular Re@@ publi@@ can Governor in an overwhelming democratic state .
his discharge percentage is from the top of the top 50 govern@@ ors in the country .
Ho@@ gan is not an un@@ wise , reac@@ tive head .
he has managed the state in a firm manner and remained firm in his principles .
in addition , it has used piracy rather sk@@ et@@ ting@@ ly as the main tool for dealing with its constituents , for example , by presenting its plastic head after che@@ mo@@ ther@@ ap@@ y for the first time .
thus , the Governor &apos;s website in kets is a public forum with official marks , managed by the staff paid by taxpayers &apos; dollars to block people who visit Washington , unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview given to Mr Ch@@ ati , spokes@@ man of the Ho@@ gan press , defended the conduct of the Governor , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than a mo@@ del@@ ling .
however , it is far too easy to pa@@ int a picture of online web @-@ run Internet guards , spa@@ w@@ ers or people filled with anger .
the post spoke with a number of people whose Ho@@ gan was blocked .
and that is precisely what they are people in charge of kets , who communicate with their elected leaders : the teacher , the owner of the undertaking and the pas@@ tor , not Internet control .
they all said that their comments were respectful , considered and not at all Roma .
Pas@@ tor quoted milk in his post , op@@ pressing Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic movement .
the lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan@@ d Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ m Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not inci@@ te hatred but rather hate crime .
&quot; I repli@@ ed poli@@ tely that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; he wrote the news story of The postal news@@ letter in the country of comment .
&apos;@@ I also do not like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same subject , some call it an in@@ difference to collective effort instead of acknowledging that it is a great deal of concern to citizens &apos; .
what the Governor &apos;s administration called &apos; targeted spa@@ m attack &apos; would probably invite others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era allows for easy mat@@ ching of messages by simply blocking criticism or cancel@@ ling negative comments .
it is much cleaner than it was in the past when , to do the same , workers had to be depor@@ ted so that they collect the newspapers with critical edit@@ orial letters and bur@@ n them or arrest protest@@ ors and force them to silence .
but that is exactly what is happening now , quite simply digita@@ lly .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to be criticised for the too@@ th@@ lessness of Facebook and other social media .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has referred Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter &apos;s stream .
one of the first notable sentences on this subject was passed last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is , the US Dis@@ tri@@ ct judge , decided in Alexand@@ ria that the chair@@ woman of the Coun@@ ty Council of Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i had violated the first modification of the Constitution when he was blocked on his Facebook page by the constitu@@ ent .
K@@ tu@@ ck@@ ys also visited Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in ( R ) , Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in , after using ACTA L@@ U Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
during Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar effect on the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters ty@@ pi@@ fied his leadership .
and even then Washington had to face up to anon@@ ymous che@@ e@@ ses .
people wrote letters to newspapers from pseu@@ do @-@ ren@@ y@@ ms such as Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , clearing up the Washington decisions .
according to the historical documents harves@@ ted in the framework of the project to collect the signatures of We@@ bi@@ @-@ based George Washington , he bu@@ ried her c@@ abinet under petitions criticising his views on the friendship , Trade and shipping agreements with Britain .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , disagreement and debate are fundamental pillars of our country .
and proper management means accepting it .

the Northern Ireland , which was head on the streets of Ar@@ cher@@ field L@@ in@@ ony in the vic@@ inity of last year , before Paul E@@ al@@ ES was left in the middle of the last round , is attached to a new or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra and is filling in the role of the Ambassador of the club foun@@ der and executive director , Jer@@ ry S@@ 67 , rather than the head of the club .
&quot; I saw R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ance in the C@@ lu@@ b building and now we see the club wal@@ king in full with this event , &quot; said R@@ aff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; the players see the way in their best form , it is in a splendid state .
Jer@@ ry has done an excellent job in establishing this place .
he is a keen supporter of gol@@ f@@ im@@ games and proud of what has been achieved here .
this will allow exc@@ el@@ len@@ tly to present the way . &quot;
an Eng@@ lis@@ h@@ man is ever looking forward to being able to defend the champi@@ on@@ ship for the first time , even though the man has won both European Toubon and the European challenge Tou@@ r during her 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this is a very special feeling , &quot; said the pe@@ as@@ ant player in Sou@@ th@@ sport .
&quot; I could not defend my Ex@@ t@@ rema@@ du@@ ra O@@ Daul title , because it was taken off the competition calendar one year after my victory .
it is iron@@ ic to come back to this chic@@ ken .
it is an excellent place to play gol@@ f .
I remember the memor@@ ies of last year , for me and for my wife , Mrs Shar@@ on , last year &apos;s victory was special .
it was a very special time that we will always bear in our heart . &quot;
on home soil , G@@ ary Or@@ r , who joined the European Semester at the beginning of this year , is also returning to a competition when he became 50 .
this is his first event in Scotland in 2013 , following the participation of A@@ ber@@ de@@ en stock management Scottish O@@ pen@@ il .
&quot; it is always a little bit more important to play at home , &quot; said Hel@@ en@@ s@@ bur@@ gh man Or@@ r .
&apos;@@ Ban@@ ks well done to appear , but you also felt that they did .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously , and I have shown quite a decent gol@@ f@@ ever .
I am satisfied that things have progres@@ sed so far . &quot;

poverty and death in Indonesia &apos;s gold @-@ rich land
when Bar@@ ena De@@ ge@@ i &apos;s dinner is produced , he does not use lead .

working late may , however , be dangerous for the majority of men in the home village , who are unemployed and many of them drink hard , plus soldiers .
&apos;@@ No one da@@ red to go around after five o &apos;@@ clock in the evening &apos; he says .
it is a rare pil@@ l in Papua mä@@ ki , a former Dutch col@@ ony which was incorporated into Indonesia in 19@@ 69 following a referendum that created controversy , forcing only 1 0@@ 26 old people to vote in front of forces by raising their hands .
the movement from the sup@@ rema@@ cy of the Dutch sup@@ rema@@ cy from the sup@@ rema@@ cy of the Dutch people to the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta Government , which continues to keep the region under its strong control , keeping foreign journalists and human rights watch@@ do@@ gs away .
in 2003 , the province was officially split into the P@@ ope and the Western P@@ ope , so the independent Papua New Guinea was left in the east of the island .
in order to get here , the majority is both a distant and a left @-@ off place ; 90 minutes must be taken from Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ a , the capital of the province , to N@@ abi@@ ja and then a five @-@ hour journey with a ren@@ tal vehicle .
there is no public transport .
a city with around 19 000 inhabitants consists of houses surrounded by ba@@ mb@@ s and covered by la@@ zy iron ro@@ of@@ s , which have been transformed into different la@@ isse@@ z @-@ fa@@ ire lig@@ ni@@ tes .
very few ind@@ onists have taken the road here , not to mention journalists , and there have hardly been foreigners here either .
before the arrival of Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago pa@@ ved the je@@ wel@@ s with the name of T@@ ame@@ e .
there were other changes .
&apos;@@ We were not used to wear such clo@@ thes , &apos; says De@@ ge@@ i , referring to the market cra@@ zy hand @-@ in @-@ mouth , dark plu@@ us@@ s and private sc@@ ars .
&quot; before that , we only had a plant cow . &quot;
Papua on is the poorest province of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
however , it is also a case of Indonesia &apos;s gold @-@ rich land .
just 100 km from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , which is a mountain province of approximately 153 000 inhabitants of New Jer@@ sey , the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world is G@@ ras@@ berg , the F@@ re@@ exporting Mc@@ Mor@@ an , a company operating in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x .
in 2015 alone , around USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and disco@@ veries extra@@ cted from F@@ Friday &apos;s exports .
in addition , it can be enriched with consumer wood stocks with an estimated USD 78 billion worth .
however , these ri@@ ches are the source of suffering for boats as they result in the suff@@ oc@@ ating presence of a powerful Indon@@ esi@@ an army .
a 2005 study by The New York Times showed that F@@ re@@ exports paid around USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to USD 150 000 to one officer .
the attempts of the P@@ ope to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den h@@ all and is ru@@ th@@ lessly restruc@@ tured .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 69 and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esi@@ an army .
according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights , the mass killing of genocide in the moun@@ tains of Papua ki@@ ans in the 1970s was a measure .
last year alone , more than 3 900 peaceful protest@@ ors were arrested in the Indon@@ esi@@ an police area .
the 2016 report of the Ma@@ in Ar@@ ch@@ bis@@ ho@@ p of Bir@@ s@@ b@@ ane , &apos; We shall lose all &apos; , contains testi@@ monies of atrocities committed in the past year , such as extra@@ judicial executions , torture ( one report shows that rape and electric shocks are particularly widespread ) and the brutal suppression of peaceful protests .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as such incidents take place every week , &quot; says Human Rights Watch of Indonesia &apos;s investi@@ g@@ ator Andreas Har@@ son@@ o .
the kid@@ napp@@ ings are even stronger , as Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new entrants from Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing , as there are large @-@ scale economic migrants coming from the islands of Jaa@@ va , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ es in Indonesia .
the fixed can@@ te@@ ens are sold in the ch@@ ole@@ pe@@ ts and mixed vegetables to ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do , which is being can@@ ned with ground level .
local authorities cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started selling can@@ na@@ bis and vegetables more cheap@@ ly than their local boats on the traditional market , &quot; explain the 24 @-@ year @-@ old abeth Tajani born in P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , who was working for work in the province capital Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ y .
&quot; the indigenous pa@@ w@@ ns of Papua ma@@ ma @-@ ma@@ ma &#91; women &#93; therefore lose their market share . &quot;
in his 2014 election campaign , the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , known as Jo@@ ko@@ w , promised to address these inequalities and human rights violations in P@@ ope .
the former Mayor of the pu@@ p@@ pet won the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta presidential Pal@@ ace in Papua 29 out of 27 constitu@@ encies , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
but in P@@ ope , very little has changed and the local feels chea@@ ted .
&quot; our hearts have been broken because , in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w in expectation that he fulfils our hopes of restoring justice , &apos; says Opel &apos; .
in fact , just two months after Jo@@ ko@@ w took office in October , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i was at a low level .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children s@@ wor@@ n stones along with Christmas when two Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers appeared on the motor@@ cycle of blin@@ dness .
the children who arrived told them that they should include the front tables .
according to the words of the local passport Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ eba@@ n , one of the soldiers insul@@ ted their tone and returned later with four soldiers .
according to the victims and witnesses , under the influence of drinking , soldiers hun@@ ted behind their children and dece@@ ived them with their gun@@ s .
then one of the soldiers shot among children .
one child , Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ o , aged 16 , was beaten so bru@@ tally that he fell into her own house .
a few hours later , the building of a close Ele@@ ction Commission was bur@@ nt and the following day things were even more es@@ c@@ ala@@ ted .
around 1 000 young people , Papua mers , women and children , met a football pit@@ ch in order to demand justice before the local police Department and the military command centre .
they carried ref@@ res@@ h@@ ant ref@@ res@@ h@@ ant buses and presented Papua me@@ e &apos;s pa@@ go tri@@ ump@@ h of wa@@ ita @-@ tan@@ in@@ ate , drinking around and bur@@ ying poultry s@@ ong .
some of the protest@@ ors started lobbying the police and the military .
Pa@@ ham@@ ma@@ tisation was sent to soldiers through internal gan@@ gs . &apos; whereas the mass of people is more than three times resistance , shot them down , they were said in accordance with the official document , which has been seen as a magaz@@ ine but has not been issued to local media ou@@ tle@@ ts .
in the city of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , the oldest Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ me ( 56 ) , in the city of Ke@@ re@@ mi@@ as ( 56 ) , felt threatened and called for peace by asking for the population to go home .
no one had the will to listen .
&apos;@@ Re@@ versal , I was suddenly shot in the left , &apos; he said to the magaz@@ ine in his German colour on the ver@@ ge of a disability house .
we still do not know who had been shot , but say that the soldiers &apos; ri@@ vals came from the month .
&quot; there was a lot of people , there were plenty of children in the House , &quot; he adds .
Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , a local man , was shot three times when he was shot .
&quot; I look to him and I looked through her body to make sure that she is with him , &quot; said the magaz@@ ine in Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who , like many indicators , uses only one name .
&quot; I saw that he has died ... I have returned to him . &quot;
the General Ad@@ vis@@ er of Papua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said to repor@@ ters that he would only guarantee the safety of his department because he was attacked .
&quot; we have to protect ourselves when we are threatened with killing , &quot; said Papua dian Media Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ors were killed and there were many injured .
news of the killings came to J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta only next day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ras held a passion@@ ate speech in which she expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses that took place in P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to address this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that he would put in place an alternative mechanism to tackle human rights crimes .
but almost immediately , there were ex@@ cus@@ es .
&quot; most of the crimes happened a long time ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and early 200@@ 0s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we must follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
speaking at J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta on 5 June , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , however , took back his words by saying that he had no intention of having a P@@ ope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything would be done according to the law &apos; .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in relation to more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the bloody referendum on independence in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , including the one in P@@ ani@@ a@@ o .
the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i adopted such claims with a g@@ loom@@ y dis@@ belief .
&quot; I have been heard four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&apos;@@ I am ti@@ red &apos; .
he says that , years later , there is still fear .
&apos;@@ I am afraid &apos; he says .
&apos;@@ I am afraid that I am being arrested by the army , I am afraid I am being shot &apos; .
he confirmed in Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are afraid of this incident .
he said that he got the army out of his hands after she had helped to bur@@ y four victims .
&apos;@@ Fol@@ low@@ ing the bur@@ ying of bodies , the army had to seek me , &apos; he says .
the abuses have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Indon@@ esi@@ an police fired the village inhabitants of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ is .
one person was killed and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , when there was a war between the village population and the head of the construction company , which refused to transport an unknown man to hospital .
the men &apos;s people , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ w@@ ned into ne@@ ar@@ by rivers , died on the way to hospital .
the recent village inhabitants prote@@ sted on the construction site in front of the company office .
according to the police , villages st@@ oned police officers , after which the latter responded with aler@@ ts .
however , according to local reports , mobile Bri@@ tons ( the poli@@ ce@@ less police of Indonesia ) started shooting at the people , killing one person .
&quot; we were in great panic , we are afraid of re@@ tali@@ ation , &quot; said Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and saw the release of the injured .
&quot; I have dece@@ ived myself in my own house for two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and for the withdrawal of a mobile police force from the region .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ o has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development fe@@ eds the dis@@ satisfaction of the me@@ ters , m@@ one , dan@@ ces and da@@ m@@ m living in Papua hal@@ j@@ enda@@ ble middle lands .
many of them have joined the army of free trade uni@@ onists ( V@@ PL ) , which , in its own words , defends the rights of boats by or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra@@ ting attacks and kid@@ napp@@ ings among Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers .
some V@@ PL leaders come from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , the army , under the pretext of &apos; defence of national sovereignty &apos; , has , in recent years , arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ a@@ o .
some of them never appear again .
the people of Papua ki@@ an are known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty fe@@ eds dis@@ satisfaction .
the little ri@@ ce sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
milk is just as un@@ at@@ tain@@ able .
people themselves grow all of their food products , mainly at anch@@ ov@@ y , plus a little fruit and vegetables .
farming is the work of women , each of whom can care for four or five bathing fields .
they usually hold most of the harves@@ ts to the family , the rest being sold on the local market .
ten Bah@@ a &apos;@@ s cost only 10 000 Indon@@ esi@@ an houses ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have deepen@@ ed between the flo@@ til@@ la boats and new migrants from the opening of new routes at N@@ ab@@ ire Air@@ port to a wide range .
the few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
the P@@ ope himself often does not have capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no jobs or money here , &apos; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , President of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ bal Council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world out of the P@@ ope .
in addition , strict restrictions on foreign media remain .
earlier this year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ bridge L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were expelled from P@@ ope because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , even though they had been given a rare film authorisation .
according to the Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch &apos;s Asian department , P@@ com@@ m K@@ ine , the election promises made by Jo@@ ko@@ w to abolish the restrictions on reporting for transparency and development have not been implemented .
&quot; in Indonesia , new threats to journalists seeking to report from the most un@@ trou@@ bled provinces in Papua ki@@ an and Western P@@ ope are being threatened with rejection of the GHS visa and the inclusion of the blacklist , &quot; said in his statement .
the lack of an overview of media drilling means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua immediate neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries , Eurocontrol , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ painful , Mar@@ shall Islands and the Sol@@ om@@ on Islands , urged the UN Human Rights Council to examine &apos; various large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
these same countries have historically also supported V@@ PL .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed the group &apos;s charges by saying J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas to journalists : &apos; there is still democracy and freedom of the press in Indonesia , so it would be difficult to bur@@ y the evidence of cases of human rights &apos; .
the local people want to see more foreign governments .
when the Dutch official delegation , led by Mr Van B@@ ari , visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra , the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , on 4 May , the local people interrupted their silence , according to the source that they wanted to remain anon@@ ymous , urging : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , there will be new presidential elections in 2019 , but the boats do not believe they will vote for Jo@@ ko@@ w again .
Jo@@ ko@@ wi is a man with good intentions , but the people around Jo@@ ko@@ w , who are involved in shooting P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , say Ho@@ ba@@ i , President of the tri@@ bal Council .
he wants to make it clear to Jo@@ ko@@ w that , apart from the chronic threat to the pre@@ da@@ tory army of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i people , they are suffering from misery because they are jo@@ ble@@ ss in education and health services .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , like other boats , consider their vote to Jo@@ ko@@ w as debt he has to pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the mis@@ gi@@ vings and intimidation , the families of the rebel victims of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i managed to land with a last symbolic insur@@ gency , with a single victim &apos;s body of police and army in@@ mates .
knowing that justice can never be done , at least they will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ u &apos;s head .
&apos;@@ What else can we do ? &apos;
came second time before Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch &apos;s prof@@ ite@@ er
on Friday , one of the highest residential blocks in the world was ea@@ ten in Du@@ ba@@ i , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to fle@@ e from this 3@@ 37 me@@ tre high and 79 @-@ clean building .
this is the second fire that has devastated the High H@@ all , which is called Tor@@ chi , in just two years .
the building was evacu@@ ated , none of the injuries were reported and there were no direct reasons for fire .
&quot; we s@@ lee@@ ping and wa@@ king up the fire and the fear of people .
we would be waiting for a train@@ ers and it took us some 10 minutes to get out of the 195@@ 0s , &apos; said Re@@ u@@ ter@@ si a resident who called himself George .
according to Du@@ ba@@ i civil protection officials , the fire fighters also deleted the site at around 4 a.m. in a local time ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and cut off the building .
the government said they were working to guarantee shelter for the victims .
this incident may once again raise questions about the safety of high @-@ quality foreign materials throughout the world .
the investigation by the steering Board in Tor@@ ch after the fires in 2015 found that the most damage was caused by the de@@ cor@@ di@@ al panels and isolation of the Cor@@ sa@@ tors , the external scene .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London G@@ ren@@ reasury , T@@ ow@@ er insu@@ lation and fast @-@ track panels , could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire that occurred there in June , with nearly 80 deaths .
see : these phones are likely to be sales h@@ its in the autumn
Kenya and coal are a time for technological investors , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peri@@ a X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um came to the wall , and in the autumn , new H@@ it@@ t @-@ phones are expected for po@@ e@@ lep@@ han@@ ts .
according to the director of Tele@@ 2 marketing and sale , Christian jan Se@@ ma , today &apos;s flag@@ ships are characterised by innovative design , eye @-@ fast s@@ hand@@ ner , screen @-@ servan@@ i 4@@ K with a resolution and ultra @-@ fast Process .
in the world of technology , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , which has also reached the forefront of the Estonian smar@@ t@@ phone distribution table , has aro@@ used great ex@@ ci@@ tement .
autumn will allow even more advanced high @-@ speed char@@ gers , more robust bat@@ teries , better quality camer@@ as and greater water and customs certainty for smart pri@@ mates .
he added that , on the basis of rum@@ ours , you can already specu@@ late and predict four peak models that are likely to con@@ qu@@ er up the street .
these four top @-@ level models for smar@@ t@@ phones will be reached for boys later this autumn .
the expected i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus are expected to reach the shops in mid @-@ September .
however , the flooding that the new Apple model looks at and what can be done with it is spreading widely .
if i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not bring significant differences along i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , Apple &apos;s tenth birth@@ day is expected to see the new model completely separate from previous ones .
four col@@ ours have been spoken : black , white , rosé gold and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one of the elements of the new design will probably be a screen covering the full phone call , a loss of do@@ gs and fingerprints on the screen .
J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve , the head of Apple design , demands that the new i@@ P@@ hone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk of an i@@ P@@ hone version .
in addition to an eye @-@ fast char@@ ger , a wireless char@@ ger and an even higher quality camer@@ as , one can expect more rapid A@@ 11 processes .
it is certainly one of the most expected smart phones for one year .
the outs@@ ourcing of G@@ ala@@ x@@ y gates 8 , a novel model , will start on 23 August .
there have been a lot of rum@@ ours about the new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y club 8 .
Ad@@ mittedly , there is even more business users and S pen allows for even greater functional functions .
the telephone should have two camer@@ as , one of which is la@@ in@@ ur@@ ry and the other with a narrow view of television .
at present , no one yet knows what two re@@ ba@@ tes are capable of , but in any case , it is the first Sam@@ sun@@ g experi@@ ment , which is certainly comparable to i@@ P@@ hone 8 in terms of quality .
however , we are eag@@ er@@ ly awaiting 23 August .
although Nokia has brought sales this year with Nokia 6 , the three smart phones at the head of Nokia , there is still a lack of their flag ships - Nokia 8 , which will be presented on 16 August .
we expect from No@@ ki@@ a to 5.@@ 3 p.m. from then to the screen and ultra @-@ fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ mber@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 stages and a more durable one .
in the case of Nokia , there is also talk of alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and significant levels of water and customs security IP@@ 68 .
like Sam@@ su@@ las , Nokia &apos;s new model has two tab@@ oo@@ s produced by Z@@ e@@ iss .
while S@@ ony &apos;s fixed flag vessel has so far been X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smart phones with ever more innovative fun@@ ction@@ alities will be added in the near future .
we await a smar@@ t@@ phone which is a little more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least with the same good or better camer@@ as .
with regard to the new model of S@@ ony , it has been specu@@ lated that its screen is at least hot .
what reality brings us to see already soon , because traditionally , S@@ ony has unve@@ iled its autumn flag ship at the International Technology T@@ reasury , which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September .
T@@ ru@@ mp Mexico pressed for payment of the border wall , according to le@@ aks of telephone calls
the Washington post made public telephone calls between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i and Mexic@@ an and Austr@@ alian heads .
on 27 January , T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s telephone statement to the President of Mexico , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ o , went to the effect that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President cra@@ ved with him for public condemnation of the wall , c@@ rying out : &apos; you must not say that to the press &apos; .
the band fixed its presidential campaign on the promise to build a long wall and age for the southern border of the United States to make Mexico pay for this project .
the trans@@ cri@@ ptions were also published of his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l , which reveals an intense debate .
the band said to the Tur@@ n@@ rist that the agreement that the United States would take refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ ve &apos; and &apos; stu@@ pid &apos; , stating that the agreement reached under the Obama Administration would give him the impression &apos; lead &apos; , as it has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees in the United States .
the band ended the speech by stating to the Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l that &apos; this was the most un@@ pleasant speech of the day &apos; .
the Court did not take up the town of O@@ C MR@@ P Li@@ te with a complaint in the case of the town of Tar@@ tu rejecting their offer for the procurement of bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 20@@ 29 .
it is a letter rejecting the offer of the town of A@@ C MR@@ P at Tar@@ tu &apos;s bus and coach procurement , as the offer did not meet the requirements , explained by An@@ neli A@@ buff@@ tin , Head of the Civil Service of Tar@@ tu .
this is the procurement of direct bus and coach transport within Tar@@ tu &apos;s city for the period 0@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 @-@ 3@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
the city of MR@@ P Li@@ beria addressed the ruling of the Tar@@ tu Dis@@ tri@@ ct Court to the Supreme Court .
it was not brought before the Court of Justice .
although many people in the social media complain that a blo@@ wn from the We@@ ek@@ y F@@ esti@@ val is disrup@@ ting their night and that the whole city is full of drink @-@ driving brak@@ ers , there are also many who do not have any negative words to say about the festi@@ val on the flo@@ til@@ la .
I am even positively surprised that there were so many sole@@ mn visas in the shops !
I did not see any ambigu@@ ity or mis@@ cour@@ tes@@ y .
even from generosity I saw &apos; , there is a pi@@ ous wave .
&quot; it is nice that he is coming , there is a joy and a joy of the Per@@ sia , which is like winter , &apos; , he is happily adding .
the wave of rub@@ ber @-@ co@@ ding is not destroyed .
while he still died in a central town that be@@ ach music is being played on the be@@ ach , now music has not yet reached his own eg@@ g .
&apos;@@ but I hope I hear &apos; , he happily says .
also at the hearing in Ag@@ nes , the great festi@@ val is a good thing for the Per@@ formance - a good contribution to the turnover of local merchan@@ ts .
it also welcomes the fact that the summer capital has come so much to a stand@@ still .
the women of conscience do not come into play .
although I am no longer on the be@@ aches , it is good that rand has revita@@ lised .
and it is nice that the people are moving , and that has been the case three times now , &apos; she says .
perhaps the first time was a little worse .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at was perhaps complaints &apos; , he is wondering .
but , as he said , what is happening on the be@@ ach is common@@ place for the summer capital cities .
&quot; this We@@ ek@@ y is a very good pro@@ ph@@ et for our small city , &quot; says Har@@ ri on the park .
M@@ ever and mid@@ night have not hit his el@@ ab@@ y@@ ss either .
but for what ?
we should all pull together .
think about how this inter@@ ethnic communication would be better .
after all , the music man is not black .
it is not about it , although I live near there .
&quot; good people can save and have no mis@@ fortune , &quot; he says .
the visitors who came to the Arctic are , as he said , visa @-@ free .
&quot; with the bot@@ tles they have , of course , also joined a little , but young people are young people and iss@@ ant - give way , but be people and we can do it ! &apos; she says &apos;
the population on the ground has travelled off the ground by then , whether to relatives or to acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces .
&quot; but overall , the festi@@ val lives are having a positive impact - people like this me@@ memory , &quot; The Va@@ nus is talking to her children as a Ti@@ ina .
his family &apos;s und festi@@ val model is also not destroyed , even though it was far@@ med even further than it was in the street last year .
last summer , we heard more .
we live outside the city ourselves , saying that in fact it is a long way off the coast of the Per@@ sian river , &apos; he is speaking .
Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revita@@ lise business
the British education company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that it will cut 3 000 more jobs and reduce its intermediate dividend by 72 % , thereby launching yet another restructuring programme to address the risks to business .
the planned jobs , which , according to John F@@ all@@ on , CE@@ O , will be concentrated at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will be added to the 4 000 posts lost in the previous restructuring exercise .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced in May the plan to cut costs by another GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) under the third expenditure reduction programme in order to try and revive the business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning .
a company that agreed to sell last month &apos;s share of the company Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House to its partner company Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann said that their expectations for a year had not changed since the announcement of a 1 % increase in sales income in the first half of the year .

K@@ abu@@ l : a suicide attack killed a NATO soldi@@ er
according to officials , the suicide bom@@ b@@ ers attacked military con@@ vo@@ ys in K@@ abu@@ l , the capital of Afghanistan , killing one NATO soldi@@ er and several other injured .
the NATO statement stated that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi .
this bom@@ bar@@ ment is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month , with more than 30 deaths in the Her@@ at mos@@ ques attack on Tuesday .
on Monday two people were killed near the Iraqi E@@ mb@@ assy in K@@ abu@@ l suicide bom@@ b@@ ers .
NATO &apos;s statement stated that a fourth @-@ day explosion took place when joint pat@@ ro@@ l with the Afghan army was attacked with a &apos; man @-@ made explosives &apos; .
the statement states that everything is in a stable state and is treated at the airport of Bag@@ ra@@ m in a US military hospital .
according to the correspon@@ dent , the increasing power of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( Pakistan ) is a source of serious concern for the forces in Bag@@ ra@@ m NATO .
according to UN data , in the first half of 2017 at least 16@@ 62 civilians died in Afghanistan , about 20 % of them in capital .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l killed at least 30 people in the band of S@@ hi &apos;@@ ite .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in central town - the most deaths have been the military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces failed the Taliban force in 2001 .
this violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country &apos;s military and police .
according to the correspon@@ dent reports , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also resulted in a public confidence crisis against the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
the EPA repealed the decision to postpone the oral amendment
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United Environmental Protection Agency Synergy ) annul@@ led the decision to delay the Obama @-@ day regulation , which obliges states to limit emissions from wh@@ iting gases , one day after 15 states were su@@ ed to court by the Agency for this process .
EPA reported on the decision to proceed with &apos; buy @-@ in @-@ content @-@ marking procedures for 2015 &apos; late on Wednesday , saying that it demonstrates the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with the states .
&quot; we believe that we must engage in dialogue and listen to our partners in our states , &quot; said Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t , the head of Economic Partnership .
P@@ ru@@ it@@ t had announced in June that it would have def@@ er@@ red the ozone content levels in the GCC in various parts of the country in order to determine where its level of compliance with the highest air quality standard should be reduced by a further year until 2013 to SMS .
15 predominantly democratic states , together with the Colom@@ bian district of C@@ olum@@ bia , presented an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision was illegal .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has tried to bring back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , is part of a broader plan to boost growth .
however , these attempts have provoked reactions among the democrats and conservation groups concerned by the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that the introduction of a ozone @-@ containing air &apos; may reduce the employability of Cop@@ tic workers and increase the risk of falling into res@@ pira@@ tory diseases &apos; , such as as@@ th@@ ma .

this year , it can be said that the weekend @-@ to @-@ day sa@@ iling before harves@@ ting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry would only be fed to animals .
&quot; the quality of content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; the analysis of A@@ gra@@ s R@@ ai@@ ff@@ e@@ is@@ en said Mr Bern@@ hard Piecy@@ la .
this year , up to 40 % of the German n@@ it for animal feed , which is from do@@ zen to normal , is predicted in A@@ gra@@ d .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have experienced any beau@@ ty this year .
first of all , winter was too cu@@ mber@@ some .
then there was a cold spring , replaced by heat bul@@ bs in June .
in July , Germany was hit by the incidents , which have continued in August .
many eyes have been turned to northern Germany , where the rain is blocking harves@@ ting .
so far , only five per cent of the n@@ ight@@ m@@ are have been cleared .
most of the regions have not yet had a harvest status , stating the local bu@@ yer of the harvest in C@@ era@@ s .
&quot; this is quite a difficult day , &quot; said Frank Dec@@ ker@@ t R@@ end@@ s@@ burg , the senior trader of C@@ era@@ vis .

virtual keys and smart solutions can be found in T@@ as@@ ty houses , both as a buil@@ der and as ( home ) buil@@ der .
it is striking there that black , white and grey comp@@ ounds , if they are supplemented by wood stor@@ ms and to@@ pes , can be very enter@@ taining .

M@@ ain@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ ain@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should be on a col@@ lisi@@ on course to face up to the most attractive po@@ tas@@ y of the near future in a weigh@@ ted category of up to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were at the office of the ES@@ P@@ N in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ les in separate tobacco , up to the Gar@@ cia , the b@@ os@@ pel of the un@@ ri@@ val@@ led World Bo@@ Washington Coun@@ c@@ il , wal@@ ked to the other end of the corridor to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , the closing of World Bo@@ Rivel@@ z@@ ation@@ i .
following the unanimous decision of Gar@@ cia , the victory of the former four @-@ time world champion , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er , on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ aja@@ r , both comb@@ at@@ ants are at the top of the table .
Gar@@ cia extended its better hand and said : &apos; how does you go , how does you go , che@@ er ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko will defend his bar Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ ga against Saturday evening in 19 ES@@ P@@ N .
when a couple of pho@@ tos were available , E@@ sis Kli@@ mas , a mountain man of L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko , said that there would be a &apos; perfect y@@ ard@@ stick &apos; between the comb@@ at@@ ants .
&quot; I am a former consul@@ tant , &quot; recalled Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I grew up for B@@ ron@@ ger &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small per 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move down@@ wards .
and it needs to move up@@ wards ligh@@ ter &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the games have asked for this .
let us offer them this . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world of Po@@ xing needs this fight . &quot;
the climate raised the question of whether it should be cost @-@ effective : part of its strategy of allowing L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to rent the debate later this year in the 6@@ 1.2 kg class to make it possible to meet with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ vans ) , who also has an interest in fighting the victory of Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ l after their fri@@ ction of 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be cost @-@ effective , as f@@ ans have called for this confrontation , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , later , that she is open to fighting any channel that offers the best financial package .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name can attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Mrs Gar@@ cia said she considered L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t to be a &apos; force figh@@ ter &apos; and she could go to see her match on Saturday .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko , however , was hu@@ mble in pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia , saying that she felt that she saw the champion of three di@@ vis@@ j@@ ons from Ri@@ ver@@ side , &apos; very slow ; sorry , M@@ ain@@ y ... you wanted it &apos; .
according to Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show shock and then po@@ ke up .
both confirmed that they felt the increase in tension between them in order to meet the challenge of prosperity .
&quot; this is a fight that awa@@ its realisation .
no other confrontation aro@@ uses so much attention and gender .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said , &apos; I have been waiting for the best comb@@ at@@ ants and M@@ ain@@ y is exactly that .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
which world incur@@ sions are being moved to Estonia ?
soil was extended and awarded a record number of more than 13 000 residence permits to third @-@ country nationals mostly travelling to Estonia for work , study or family .
when , for example , soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit for 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , this figure was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the agencies cannot say how many immigrants ultimately remain in Estonia , but such an analysis is being drawn up within the Ministry of the Interior .
while , ten years ago , nearly 500 Ukrainians travelled to Estonia a year , in recent years , this figure will reach 2000 .
the number of applicants for residence increased expon@@ enti@@ ally during the Ukrainian crisis , with 10@@ 87 fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , a year before 6@@ 75 .
in Estonia , we have the largest increase in the number of Ukrainian citizens , with the population of 850 Ukraine left in Estonia .
&quot; the Ukrainian community in Estonia has always been high , and it is natural that , due to difficult circumstances in the country , work and learning opportunities are being sought from a country in which the community and many others are already in front of the family &apos; , the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of the Interior , Kris@@ tin Ram@@ mus , stated .
soil and Cape Verde had a fixed @-@ term residence permit even higher than the number of Russian citizens , even though in ten years the number of fixed @-@ term residence permits have been issued to the latter .
when Ukrainians come here predominantly , Russian citizens come here for family migration .
&quot; in view of the historical Russian community here , they are also most likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said Hel@@ ina Me@@ ing , the migrant theat@@ re of the Internal Security Agency .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen you look at where Russian citizens who have benefited from Estonian residence have moved to , after Har@@ ju@@ land , there is now East Vir@@ u@@ land &apos; , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them had mar@@ ried to a citizen of the European Union .
soil received a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 16@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit was reduced .
&quot; compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending residence permits , new residence permits have been requested for permanent entry to Estonia , &quot; the press officer of the Ministry of the Interior , Ram@@ mus , explained that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia &apos;s residence permit has remained stable for years .
the new residence permit for permanently located in Estonia will be available to foreigners living here for at least three years last year .
its aim is to encourage the d@@ war@@ dness of the people who are adapting .
however , long @-@ term residence permits require , for example , five years .
the extension of the old residence permit has also obviously declined for new residence permits .
for example , soil was given such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
now the Ukrainians can exchange work and the Estonian state no longer draws the finger at whether the pay criterion has been met .
this residence permit became popular : applicants for holders of a bad ( 10@@ 29 ) , Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , individuals ( 54 ) and no@@ ig@@ ers ( 36 ) .
a total of 19@@ 68 people , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and as many Chinese , received a residence permit to settle in Estonia for the purpose of living .
this year &apos;s first half , the total number of such applicants is already 12@@ 69 .
in 10 years , Nigeria has become a sta@@ ggering country with one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence .
when , in 2007 , three residence permits were issued to the young people , the soil was 200 .
Nigeria comes out of Nigeria to learn from these universities .
universities in Estonia are also popular , for example among Georgi@@ ans , Chinese and Tur@@ ks .
the number of Indian , Bangladesh and Nigeria citizens has increased largely due to student movements .
they also have the rule that , where the community is ahead , it will be easier to come to others , &quot; added Ram@@ mus .
in ten years two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , just as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 from South Korea , 40 from Indonesia and four from U@@ ru@@ guay .
while around 6,@@ 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit per year , this is approximately 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if you add to the citizens of the European Union , migration remains close to around a percentage , &quot; said Ma@@ king that in fact the figures are small .
in total , 14 8@@ 22 people emig@@ rated to Estonia , out of which 13 7@@ 92 were depor@@ ted according to the statistical office .
this means that immigration exceeded emigration for the second year .
most of those who move and move are Estonian citizens , but there are more of them among those who are leaving .
as a result , Estonian citizens had a flood of 2 000 inhabitants .
Est@@ oni@@ ans , in particular , are emig@@ rating between Finland and Estonia .
long ago C@@ ou@@ ture Pr@@ inc@@ s@@ sim@@ ood h@@ eral@@ ds with sa@@ wn , thi@@ ev@@ es and swe@@ ets
in the north @-@ west of the story , however , there is history for Mrs Tampere - old fathers and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream of somewhere in the muse@@ um for hours and old @-@ age theft and cra@@ zy .
if you go down the road , you will study and learn about it every day .
this is a joy of disco@@ very !
the world of C@@ ou@@ ture may seem like some life @-@ alien , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much you are in your life !
as a friend , I have a whole sa@@ un full of the w@@ ounds cou@@ ture that I have created .
because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hol@@ ly@@ wood and does not go on red wh@@ i@@ p every day , he also wants to wear the most beautiful bro@@ kers and she suffers !
you can live your own lives special !
the mobile ar@@ tist does not recognise the Gulf between sh@@ ining events and bad days .
it was this reasoning that dro@@ ve out the plan to put high @-@ ranking countries in Estonia , between forests and fields , into people who often do not get anywhere .
the M@@ ani@@ fes@@ to was presented , for example , in comparison , J@@ evening and Per@@ graph mo@@ e@@ alle@@ l , where 45 mo@@ del@@ led Ro@@ yal de@@ fi@@ le@@ e filled the whole street .
in Tallinn , you are often pic@@ ked up in shops , d@@ res@@ sed up with dignity , but elsewhere there are more emo@@ tions - Wel@@ sh b@@ lar@@ vo , standing up , wanting to thank you .
a large proportion of the audience had to be equally cu@@ rious , but now they are the M@@ ou@@ ture f@@ ans of the C@@ ou@@ ture .
if you exceed the expectations of the people , they will be delighted !
and I like the feeling that I am like my mo@@ tives like the summer rec@@ ess .
Per@@ nus had a red car@@ pet of 50 metres , full of bic@@ y@@ cles on the streets , it seemed that they would not come to an end !
she also does not accept the fashi@@ on@@ able idea that creation must be presented by a super@@ ficial super@@ mode@@ ll , which will happily bring about ordinary women .
often I call my own customers in the Gulf - they have always come with pleasure .
after all , it is so la@@ yers of experience , you have found a sh@@ ining th@@ read on the ice route .
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen my own performance , I am always behind the ground in order to give the final simplification of things as a hope@@ less ac@@ compli@@ ce .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow a calm eye to be taken from the Chamber .
Maria is the mo@@ el@@ olo@@ gist of this kind , who does not only want to play a representative role but to be involved in everything .
I have my gen@@ esi@@ s in session , most of the colle@@ ctions myself .
I like the whole process in which you played with details to discover .
I am never far from my nature and I am not afraid of work .
it is not a matter of isolation , nor is it about cle@@ ric@@ iz@@ ation , logistics , organisation , organisation - everything must sli@@ p away from the day of a sta@@ tic woman .
these working hours are still being experienced by fana@@ tics enormously .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a joy !
I am still very lu@@ cky - it is like a lit@@ mus test of happ@@ iness : I am doing something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and yet more complicated .
it has been said several times that my bro@@ thers have a ma@@ gic character : they make themselves feel like a pr@@ inc@@ s@@ man .
the generous collection lines that made Mrs Maria talent famous overnight have long remained a wake @-@ up call from M@@ ou@@ ture until now .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ se@@ mi@@ um U@@ 18 boys : the arms of the Est@@ oni@@ ans &apos; al@@ ag@@ ro@@ pe@@ ak were now turned against us !
sorry , the fair@@ y@@ tale ran out .
the first thing that happened was that we could not get our feet .
and when there is such a big difference on the table , there is nothing to do &apos; , Estonia said U@@ 18 Kor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ po@@ ds 61 : 75 absten@@ tions for Britain : cor@@ v@@ bal@@ ler , Co@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p .
the opponents took 28 faces out of a wave of attacks and , as a result , received so many more attacks .
nor were we prepared to protect them and attack them , it created them .
many attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds ; we were unable to build protection .
however , in defence they managed to keep their hands everywhere , we could not combine .
it created the crew &apos;s feet .
the home work against the opponents was better done .
M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ pa estimates that Estonia should have made more tac@@ tical mistakes in order to remove the tide of opponents .
on the last quarter , we had a mistake of zero , but had already had a number of quick harves@@ ts against opponents .
In@@ tran@@ sig@@ ence and intense insistence , which was our weapon on al@@ ag@@ ro@@ tur@@ ne@@ y , have now been addressed to us all .
today , we did not have the strength against their aggressive character .
M@@ y@@ ri@@ f@@ lower remained compla@@ cent of its neg@@ ligent basis in Kal@@ ev@@ i , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ ga .
tourism in general can say fine words about the entire team , so far there was a single shock .
it is unfortunate that such an aggressive response had not been met before .
T@@ as@@ s has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but he seemed to have been ti@@ red - he has borne quite a heavy burden .
but he made some of the nice moves that I have seen in the past in tr@@ en@@ ni@@ des , added the men@@ tor .
terrible figures : the cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ p of kid@@ ne@@ ns set out less than 10 items on E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ transplants with three quarter exceptions ...
in the U@@ 18 age classes , not only the young men &apos;s em B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on cor@@ v@@ li@@ tur@@ ni@@ ir in Tallinn , she started the day before yesterday in Dublin .
and Estonia &apos;s game with Poland , though , was bo@@ gged down in anti@@ re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , 9 : 49 , in other words , in the last ten minutes , opponents took their feet from the gas pipeline and 16 : 16 .
in both the first and the second quarter , Estonia set out 4 , the third ind@@ ent ...
in doing so , in the first two minutes , two pieces were caught by the Est@@ oni@@ ans in the first two minutes , but there were 25 pieces of the game , then there was a troika in and then 21 k@@ ic@@ ked over ...
perhaps in almost half an hour , there were 47 fra@@ mes of one .
in addition , there were 2 points from four open lines .
the losses were a reasonable figure of 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland was hit 33 and Estonia 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , with Portugal having to be recognised on the open day as 83 : 56 better .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to re@@ plen@@ ish stocks
today , the NATO 1 permanent mine group arrived in Tallinn for a week @-@ to @-@ week exchange of planned port visits to supplement the stocks of vessels and prepare for the forthcoming exercise .
during the visit , ships will prepare for na@@ ming the sea , while giving cre@@ ws the chance to leave their days .
after the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready to search for future historical explosives .
&quot; the participation of Est@@ oni@@ ans in the NATO unit and the combined training they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with alli@@ ed forces , &quot; said the head of the operation and planning unit of the na@@ vy fleet , the head of the military , the cap@@ tain Ar@@ to Rein@@ land .
since 29 June , NATO will chair the 1 permanent group of SP@@ C Latvian na@@ vy Ad@@ vis@@ er G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , who took over the group &apos;s tasks from the Estonian Sea officer , Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as explained , at a ceremony held in Riga .
the group &apos;s flag is L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , a Latvian naval support ship with the group leader .
during this half of the year , Estonian na@@ vi@@ es of mine hunting and Sakharov will also be part of the international force .
as one of the four groups of vessels subject to the NATO naval command , NATO 1 is a permanent anti @-@ mine group , one of the former rapid reaction teams , which the Alliance can send to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . until 13 August , the mu@@ tu@@ als of the P@@ iri@@ ta Mon@@ as@@ tery will once again become a place where the swe@@ ets of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , which was called by Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ ids 13 years ago , will be held .
this year &apos;s Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val will , according to the artistic leader of Tallinn Film , risk to J@@ oo@@ sti ( 36 ) , be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented .
risk to J@@ oo@@ st : Cuba ends up in the class of the o@@ op@@ ian world , &apos; Tra@@ vi@@ ata &apos; and &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; , bal@@ le@@ la@@ answers from the ma@@ gic &apos; B@@ ole@@ ro@@ st &apos; Kar@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ ini &apos; , and there is also no plan for self @-@ produc@@ tions , this time by the wonderful &apos; A@@ asta@@ era &apos; of Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ni &apos;s wonderful or@@ a@@ mus@@ ical &apos; by the same creative team who , in 2015 , even brought P@@ iri@@ la@@ tal Ha@@ y@@ ral to the book &apos; .
Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has much more than just concer@@ ts and theat@@ ric@@ al responses .
it is larger than any mus@@ ical theat@@ re in its usual form .
it is a festi@@ val whose s@@ now is taking hold and never completely disrup@@ ts .
because the experience of which the lis@@ ten@@ er receives in this sup@@ erior and my@@ ste@@ rious environment makes human spiri@@ ts more generous and concerns human tragedies in a way that cannot be described .
for the first year , you are the art leader of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
did the ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ Germans not feel a little big ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has helped a great deal .
he pushed me through a whole of my student career and also supported me at the start of a di@@ ri@@ gis@@ me career .
perhaps this will make it easier for me to continue with his work .
the F@@ esti@@ val team of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val in C@@ las has been so reli@@ ev@@ ed of well and , of course , it is all handed over to me .
it was excellent to join a team that knows exactly how things are going .
it was the great heart of E@@ ri K@@ Israelis who gave me the strength to go well with the Tal@@ ş@@ ia Film , Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
and here I am , and I can !
what sort of audience could this year &apos;s festi@@ val get , what do you offer in particular ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , by the way , the first bal@@ le@@ tt written to Mrs L@@ ind@@ gren &apos;s story , as a surprise and surprise .
it reads &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson l@@ ls &apos; .
and one of the criminal n@@ ü@@ ans@@ s is that the author of this bal@@ le@@ t is the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ sons , who himself expressed a wish to write it into action .
apparently he has already had the car@@ a@@ ter of Kar@@ l@@ sson , a child in her b@@ reat@@ h .
at risk , how can you all kid it ?
my contribution to life is certainly due to my contribution .
such work requires a system of support and a lot of love , and fortunately I have it .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tions do not depend as much on other people as I am perhaps against every new day .
and this awareness of tone , maintaining a positive attitude and , in fact , na@@ ming ourselves in the mir@@ ror of the morning , significantly increased my happ@@ iness .
this week in particular , when there are the most important tests , I have been particularly keen to practise it and it works .
S@@ ti@@ mu@@ lating ourselves is re@@ pul@@ ling the str@@ ings and raising the tone .
that is simply not a word .
I think people do not yet know what the univer@@ se is offering them , but everybody will discover it slowly .
right now , this is an important moment .
does you also have a ri@@ tual before you take the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ t ?
there are still , clothing must be replaced against more comfortable ones .
it is a small moment for ourselves .
but in general , yes , I do not have the opportunity to pu@@ mp or give a small indication before I speak .
in fact , I even like to engage actively with people , even before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di@@ um is taken .
but come to Burma all , to the F@@ esti@@ val , which is also to be discovered not just to the great bar@@ ley and the bal@@ le@@ ry .
look forward to seeing a video with the risk of J@@ oo@@ sti@@ m !
new findings of Swedish asylum age assessment tests
the latest results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the constitution was assessed as older than 18 , but not all believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for medicine ( R@@ SP@@ ts@@ SR@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started testing earlier this year .
the tests were set up to assess the age more precisely in the asylum application process , after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Migration adjustment s@@ ver@@ ket ) was criticised for failing to correctly define the age of a number of allegedly under@@ age refugees .
so far , 68 80 cases have been sent to the test by Mr Mig@@ mig@@ s@@ ver@@ ket , and the Institute of Justice has issued a total of 24 81 tests between mid @-@ March and 31 July 2017 .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were estimated to be 18 or more old and 25 more were assessed by the Institute of Justice as being &apos; possibly 18 or more old &apos; .
in 4@@ 32 cases , it was concluded that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
tests will only be used if people &apos;s age is in question .
according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son , who works in the institution of justice , the results are consistent with those of the past months .
&quot; we do not see a big difference from the statistics of previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &quot; he said to The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum applicants have been left to their age .
the Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that , in 4@@ 42 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person investigated was 18 or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson Dag@@ bla@@ d investigated the results of their 581 test , it turned out that in 2@@ 43 cases the person had stated directly that he would be 18 this year .
this method of evaluating the medical age , whereby there is criticism in some quarters of the wise cord X and was@@ te@@ water species MR@@ I , which then allows them to be analysed by too@@ th@@ p@@ aste doctors and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts .
one of the sceptics is the endo@@ k@@ rin@@ olo@@ gist of the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute of Technology , Claude Mar@@ cus , whose tasks include assessing people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they were going through the normal audi@@ ences sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to reflect on this and I do not think that the measuring method currently used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very precarious .
if we cannot say clearly , we should not pretend we can , &apos; he said to the time line , Mr Met@@ ro .
but Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son , from the Institu@@ t of Justice , defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that the risk of a child becoming an adult is in@@ accurate .
perhaps at around 10 % , there is a risk if you are just under 18 . &quot;

Anna Maria O@@ rel , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old dissid@@ ent , made a beautiful debate in the City of London , receiving a fine 18@@ th place with 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7@@ m .
after all , M@@ M was a no@@ fi@@ er of women and a happy woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for med@@ als in the future .
the contest went well and I got a good experience .
with the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , I immediately with@@ drew my average result , the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) I risk too much and the third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) I was able to keep it quite soon , &quot; said O@@ rel after Competition .
I took my emissions , and I am very pleased that I found that .
Ms Anna Maria O@@ re@@ li M@@ M ended up with a good 18 seats .
Mrs O@@ reli@@ t was not confused , as she is , after all , training the winter through the LTTE stage .
&apos;@@ I am sh@@ red &apos; , he said with a little mu@@ d@@ dle .
the London Olympic Forum had almost a half @-@ hear@@ ted house of the people , did O@@ rel reg@@ ress around the people or were it able to turn off ?
I stood up , but in a positive sense .
everyone says it adds - that is the case !
if competition itself , it can experience it .
after all , it was confirmed that there would be some satisfaction with Mr M@@ M &apos;s debate and that he would still have many good competitions : &apos; I came here with 3@@ 2nd , the last result of this year &apos;s season , I stopped at 18 .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and M@@ il - that is the only thing that matters .
I am taking on a good experience , and some day I want to compete on behalf of the med@@ als .
West Vir@@ g@@ ina ku@@ ber@@ ner announced party change
on Thursday evening , Jim Justice , the Democrat govern@@ or of West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , announced that he would change political parties at a meeting with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ m .
&apos;@@ L@@ et it or not , but the democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I say to you , having said a lot and thought @-@ out ... today I say to you , to the West , that I can no longer help you as a democratic hot guard . &quot;
the rum@@ ours of joy were cleared at the gathering .
&quot; so I will be a Re@@ publi@@ can tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a friend , I would say to you that it is time to play another game . &quot;
the band had previously promised a big announcement at the gathering of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
the T@@ ru@@ mp won 42 points in Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ as and Justice was not supported by the Democrat candidate , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
Justice , which is , according to For@@ tress , the only billion inhabitants of the state , was elected in 2016 .
it notes that he ow@@ ns coal mines in five states and that he ow@@ ns the coal business from his own father .
it is worth around USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday evening , the National Committee of the Re@@ publi@@ can ( R@@ N@@ C ) published an announcement that &apos; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to the democratic party , which would rather prevent the country from being improved again rather than working towards it &apos; .
&apos;@@ T@@ o just 15 hot spots and controls in the history of the lowest number of states - an announcement by Governor Justice is simply the most recent saying to the party that is guided by the outset and incapable of finding a positive and uni@@ fying message &apos; said R@@ N@@ C Chairman R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in his statement to C@@ B@@ S New@@ les .
it is no surprise , perhaps , that where there are many people , there are also many injured .
Ur@@ met , who was in charge of online medicine , said yesterday to the Fac@@ ul@@ ty that they had had to distribute quite a lot of pos@@ ters .
Vil@@ les and fur@@ ni@@ ture fa@@ ts are fundamental , ex@@ cus@@ es and simple de@@ faul@@ ts .
of course , there will also be car@@ goes , strikes and sho@@ es .
Ur@@ me@@ t says that visitors come to the F@@ esti@@ val with false foot@@ wear and so problems come .
the media have also had to provide assistance to visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic cases , as well as one sho@@ wer breaks .

Co@@ e praised the honest apolo@@ gies of the Russians for the doping scandal
the international dimension of the L@@ igh@@ ten , S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , was praised for his words &apos; Russia &apos;s apolo@@ gies for Thursday &apos; D@@ oping , but repeated that now is not the time to allow sport back to the country .
at the last night of the Ex@@ cel@@ len@@ cy World C@@ up , D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lit@@ h@@ tin , a Russian ath@@ le@@ ry , said at the ICAO Congress in the run @-@ up to the F@@ ur@@ ry World C@@ up that the ban on competitions against his country was right and he had a strong aim to fight doping .
he apolog@@ ised to &apos; all ligh@@ ter Christmas classes , from whom gol@@ den and sil@@ ver med@@ als have been squ@@ ee@@ zed in competitions &apos; .
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the competition ban , which was introduced in November 2015 after the W@@ AD@@ A report found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think this was a very honest answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said to the press by the President of IA@@ AF .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian League itself recognised that they had had rather complicated times and that they would do everything they could to re@@ organise the permanent alliance . &quot;
Co@@ e also said he was pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own recovery .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the proposal of the Working Group that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything possible in the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we have always invo@@ ked the principle that we want to separate clean spor@@ ts@@ men and spor@@ ts@@ men from the broken system , &quot; she added .
Si@@ x@@ teen Russian ath@@ le@@ tes who meet the strict criteria of the IA@@ AF are competing neutral ath@@ le@@ tes in the light of the ligh@@ t@@ weight World C@@ up , starting in London on Friday .
R@@ une Ander@@ sen , the head of the IA@@ AF working group , said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet several criteria for recovery .
following a presentation to the IA@@ AF Council , he told the press in London that doping control is still insufficient and that the trained engineers who have been banned are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution is changing dramatically the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
not only does the electric car revolution change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure , it will also create new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although mining gi@@ ants like G@@ len@@ core can say that they will win from one place and lose out from the other , smaller mining firms will not help .
currently , G@@ len@@ core coal and oil are serving , but in the era of electric cars , demand for co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ kel will increase .
this year &apos;s decisions by the governments of the United Kingdom , France and Norway to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels have been raised in relation to the spread of electric cars .
therefore , Mr Vol@@ vo has already announced that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and that T@@ es@@ la will bring onto the market a cheaper parame@@ ter of electricity .
B@@ reat@@ berg New Energy Finance estimates that , for two decades now , electric cars will be sold more than oil @-@ generated cars .
&quot; with regard to some metals , &quot; the Capital Economics Economics raw materials analy@@ ze Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ in B@@ beef .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as co@@ balt and li@@ thi@@ um , which have been growing demand for years .
electricity cars have about three times as many cop@@ per as ordinary cars , reported G@@ len@@ core .
more answers are needed at charging stations , which is why Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that it will increase domestic demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
an increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ gan@@ gs .
G@@ len@@ core will benefit from an increasing trend in electric cars from cop@@ per prices and from being the largest co@@ balt producer in the world , according to the J@@ eff@@ reau Group forecast .
this bro@@ ker company estimates that F@@ re@@ exports @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ Safer Min@@ er@@ als will be the winners of the race for electric cars .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 percent of the London stock of metals has been caught .
soil price increases were 37 % .
the cop@@ per has also been cap@@ tured this year by 14 % , mainly due to economic growth .
the share of G@@ len@@ core in London rose by 20 % , exceeding the price rise to the ri@@ val Rio T@@ at Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ oni and Ang@@ lo Erdoğan .
on the side of the losers , lead companies such as Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine will have to adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ use of the bar is the bat@@ teries supplying the star@@ ters of cars with petrol and diesel engines with a flow of star@@ ters .
electric cars use gla@@ ci@@ ers .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; Michael W@@ id@@ mer , Chief analysis of the metal@@ lic market in the Bank of America , said .
the impact of the bat@@ tery trend in price movements is not yet notic@@ eable .
P@@ li@@ p has sh@@ run@@ k 17 % this year , with a price rise in London as the best meta@@ ph@@ or for major industrial metals .
investors see problems for metals only a long way from the future .
&quot; I am not sure it will be so bad for lead , because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive , &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the ven@@ ue for the sale of Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ s .
if lead demand falls , it will be slow .
this may be the case in about ten years &apos; time .
meanwhile , stricter emission standards mean that demand for hybrid cars , which is regularly dependent on lead @-@ based bat@@ teries when engines are launched , will be assessed by the international lead and research organisation .
Ker@@ g@@ metal@@ lic me@@ ters like alu@@ mini@@ um are substitu@@ ting steel , as a ligh@@ ter car can drive more with less electricity .
it explains an additional demand of 1.6 million tonnes from 2013 to 2016 .
it accounts for 2.7 % of the world &apos;s alu@@ mini@@ um production .
this trend is likely to intensify , says W@@ id@@ mer .
the A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um has been fishing for 13 % this year , as growing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
steel producers will not .
the holding of ak S@@ sun@@ way holding cooper@@ ates with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce mira@@ cle cars .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and V@@ II@@ e Europe are also trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down from steel in order to resist the minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be a response to this development , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris &apos;s analysis , Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to pla@@ tes .
soil took around half of this precious diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , according to Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ ms .
&quot; many raw materials with a high demand today , such as oil and pla@@ te , may not have a great deal of demand in the future , &quot; the Na@@ ti@@ x@@ is raw materials analy@@ st Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h said .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole are becoming less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
Pla@@ to manufacturers believe in continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , leader of the Un@@ core , said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold .
the great hope of the Pla@@ ti@@ ers in the 10 @-@ year perspective is for cars based on the hydrogen element developed by To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ dal Mo@@ to@@ s , which depend on pos@@ ter to produce electricity from hydrogen .
until now , however , this technology has not yet leg@@ alised itself commercially .
&quot; the Lady seems to have a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris from Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers suffered a severe set@@ back in July , as the S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art court refused to use diesel in the home town of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how the financial rules for football will affect the transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the un@@ bri@@ dled spending of European football clubs do not prevent the record transfer of Ney@@ ra from the Spanish football club to the French club of Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences of UEFA , the governing body , which domin@@ ates the European game and which has the power to ban cre@@ ws from taking part in the League of Ministers of the pres@@ ti@@ gious Me@@ is@@ ters , await Paris in front of Saint @-@ Ger@@ Ma@@ y .
the Financial rules on fair play ( F@@ F@@ F@@ P ) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that the PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of Ney@@ ra was funded without huge losses .
EUR 2@@ 22 million ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) were paid to Barcelona alone for the purchase of its contract by the Brazili@@ ans , and the pay of Ney@@ ra will reach tens of millions of dollars per year .
there are some financial aspects of Ms Ney@@ ra &apos;s transition to the French club .
the PS@@ G will undoubtedly be able to pick up such money to recruit Ney@@ ra and add its sta@@ rs to a multi@@ tude of ri@@ ders , given that the team is funded by the family in charge of the Ka@@ tar energy crisis .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot in order to recruit players , but they must balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out of their football business .
F@@ F@@ P was set up by Michel Pla@@ tini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
it was the former French player who believed that the clubs , who are in search of success in search of debt , were actually involved in dece@@ iving and ris@@ king ruin if the banks or owners were to give up their support .
since 2011 , F@@ F@@ F@@ P will focus on monitoring these losses instead of the debts of clubs .
this change means that the business model that Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch first used in C@@ hel@@ sea in 2003 - shopping a club with potential and then spending hard to improve the crew and create a global brand - is harder to implement .
F@@ F@@ F@@ P can bear losses of up to EUR 30 million during the current three @-@ year evaluation period , which runs until 2018 .
and despite the blatant exclusion of Pla@@ tini from the presidential office in 2015 , his successor , Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , remains committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; F@@ F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead , and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said last week The Inclusion P@@ pressed , Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , UEFA @-@ s F@@ F@@ P .
although PS@@ G &apos;s remuneration for the Ney@@ ra over@@ purchase clause is one of the full payments , they will be able to distribute this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the contract .
Mrs Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it will be possible to show a transitional fee in the next five years as the sum of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million .
on the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G , together with Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga in Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , received the most severe penalties .
a fine of EUR 60 million ( currently USD 82 million ) was imposed on the PS@@ G , subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million , and a restriction on the team of the Me@@ is@@ ters League of Ministers was requested in the period 2014 @-@ 2015 for 21 players instead of conventional 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs who can attempt to over@@ turn the regulatory authorities by blow@@ ing up their income through companies linked to club owners .
while a do@@ zen company may spon@@ sor the PS@@ G , if the value of spon@@ sorship is considered to exceed standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
this was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar tourism was worth the PS@@ G support .
it has been said that some of Mrs Ney@@ ra &apos;s PS@@ G service may come from Ka@@ Infrastructure through the contributions of the World C@@ up Committee of 20@@ 22 .
however , the PS@@ G and Q@@ a@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ ra would be a member of the World C@@ up and claim that UEFA regulators would be able to easily reveal such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on the PS@@ G mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not pre @-@ emp@@ ted the switch to PS@@ G Ney@@ ra .
they spoke with Ms P@@ Congress on condition that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PS@@ G .
the latest reports published show that the PS@@ G earned more than € 10 million in profits at around € 54@@ 2.4 million in 2012 @-@ 2016 .
the latest financial year data have not yet been published .
PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ ra will have a positive impact on spon@@ sorship transactions , trade and distribution of labels .
the club is looking forward to an increase of at least 30 percent in connection with the conclusion of the agreement .
Spain too , clearly irri@@ tated by the withdrawal of one of the largest football sta@@ rs , attempted to block the transition of Ney@@ ra , claiming that the PS@@ G was violating F@@ F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear case of &quot; financial doping &quot; with club and country , &quot; said La ga President Javier T@@ eb@@ as AS , Spanish newspaper , indicating that the PS@@ G was primarily a member of the Q@@ a@@ tar .
Ar@@ en.htm W@@ en@@ ger , the arch@@ i@@ pe@@ la@@ go of Ar@@ sen@@ al , whose club belongs to American sporting mag@@ ne , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; when a club belongs to a country , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the country may have other ways or other interests so that such a large player can represent the country . &quot;

50 years ago today : the hur@@ ric@@ ane storm in Estonia , which broke off houses and win@@ dows .
the hur@@ ric@@ ane of the century , which ra@@ ged on 6 and 7 August , caused major damage , particularly to the Baltic , the Harbour and the Rap@@ la@@ lah@@ land .
the North@@ west Estonia was over 30 m / s during these days .
my old her@@ d ran from one map to another in the gar@@ den , with orders to support them .
everything was blind and graphic , as was the global lesson .
T@@ aa@@ mal has already passed the ro@@ of@@ s from houses , recalling in 2002 the magaz@@ ine of L@@ inda K@@ uro@@ va Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ t in an interview with Estonian Nature .
the hus@@ band of L@@ inda saw the houses he plan@@ ted collapsed .
but what are you going to support with your hands , where are you going against such a storm ?
the sea came under the window , from win@@ dows to water &apos; , Mrs L@@ inda tone , who lived on the streets of Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us Kal@@ da , spoke .
the fact that the roads were full and the cab@@ in coverage of the railway station had been flying from 20 to 30 metres , saw L@@ inda as the majority of w@@ ounds only next morning .
according to local reports , the han@@ ging from Par@@ ale@@ pa was hope@@ less , some are completely lengthy , some are boys .
everyone saw a very frustra@@ ting storm , with the beautiful old trees ra@@ ging and pragmatism going through like a war .
Western Vir@@ u@@ land was not particularly severely affected by the 19@@ 07 August storm , compared with Western Estonia , but the damage was huge there , written by the Vir@@ u@@ land Official Journal in 2007 .
Shar@@ ap@@ sal@@ u L@@ fossil Par@@ k and the P@@ ad@@ ise Par@@ k were swe@@ pt away from the ground , but our par@@ ks were also severely affected .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured at a speed of up to 35 metres per second , or around 130 kilometres per hour .

the chic@@ ken is in the air and is no longer in place ! &quot; wrote the Vir@@ u@@ land Official Journal .
the generational term in Vil@@ j@@ an@@ di@@ land was destroyed by a storm so much that it was later decided to be disman@@ tled .
T@@ ü@@ ri &apos;s ski @-@ moun@@ ted design was not opposed to the August storm , which was later not restored .
the newspaper Red T@@ ung wrote on 12 August 19@@ 1967 that the reconstruction of towns and settlements from ma@@ hal@@ an@@ ed trees and their toys is progressing slowly , and the population could get involved in cleaning work .
fruit fields were also severely affected in Tu@@ rin , and the newspaper reported that &apos; party organisations must be both an incentive and a guide for cleaning and fer@@ tility . &apos;
Or@@ ka@@ des can be spoken of when average wind speeds exceed 3@@ 2.7 m / s .
the net wind record in Estonia remains from 2 November 19@@ 69 , when Ru@@ h@@ k@@ nu@@ l measured the wind at 48 m / s .

apart from S@@ tro@@ om , he is still on the ver@@ ge of P@@ iri@@ ta , Har@@ ku La@@ ke , Ca@@ ku@@ mä@@ e and Pal@@ ti@@ a@@ are P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ar .
the amounts of Prüm have fallen .
years ago , it was much more .
people can now already assess what is being done for them , &apos; U@@ so@@ v , who has multipli@@ ed the boat for 15 years .
before that , it was the case that , when something new was set up , it was already a day ago .
now what is on the ground is being kept .
prices of clean be@@ ach
one of the biggest entries on Estonian be@@ aches is the clearing of the sea rub@@ ble , the ad@@ m@@ ire .
for example , in P@@ iri@@ a , it must be removed from the coastal season by 400 000 tonnes .
&apos;@@ It is an incredible figure &apos; , notes U@@ so@@ v .
the second large category of municipal waste , that is , all that people are leaving behind , is the municipal waste .
one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ kilometre coastal S@@ tro@@ om has eight large w@@ ol@@ f sein@@ ers , which need to be du@@ mped three times a week .
so much will come of rub@@ b@@ ish .
however , the cold summer weather has meant that the waste is by a fifth less than otherwise .
the third species comprise abandoned things .
in most cases , these are cargo flights .
as a beneficiary , the U@@ so@@ v sand has du@@ mped ten metres out of the slu@@ mp .
they are waiting for owners to go down the route leading to timber .
&apos;@@ normally , they come out more , but that is normal harves@@ ts &apos; ; U@@ so@@ v already knows that she will soon find them in the sand again .
children come to ran@@ k and take toys in order to re@@ pu@@ mp them into the sand .
&quot; Prüm &quot; is being broken
Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler , the administrative service representative , admitted that the work of the tra@@ ctor was disrup@@ ted at local level .
noise lasting from night to night is ham@@ per@@ ing the sou@@ ls of the people living in the neighbourhood .
however , this work is impossible on a day .
in one month , the rand will have to go through twice .
&quot; if we do not do that , we will be fined in the city of Sch@@ ol@@ ler . &quot;
however , like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ar and Peru , the aim is also to get S@@ tro@@ om rand to the quality mark of the international s@@ ini@@ a flag .
&quot; there is much more work in Estonia than Europe to keep be@@ aches in place , says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ence , more bul@@ lets and a harder war of sand .
however , our be@@ aches are less rub@@ ble than anywhere else in Europe .
when you hear that there is talk of rub@@ b@@ ish on the be@@ ach , a vibran@@ t circle of journalists and cor@@ al workers near S@@ tro@@ om , highlighting the current bottlenecks .
Hom@@ o is a picture everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is with birds and w@@ oo@@ den sla@@ ves who have pul@@ led the rub@@ b@@ ish bags in the first place &apos; , Martin says .
although it is hard to assume that people can change their habits so far , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the waste s@@ log@@ ans and put them on the ca@@ ve , for example , to prevent birds at least getting af@@ oo@@ t there .
in general , however , Mr S@@ tro@@ om &apos;s sta@@ r is satisfied with developments .
we can see that the city is taking care of this .
it has become more pleasant with children &apos;s fin@@ s , enligh@@ tened and newly as@@ ph@@ oned roads .
it used to be the case that only one route was allowed to travel on the site , &quot; says Martin .
bread in S@@ tro@@ om : coins , only coins
the ten @-@ year @-@ old Dimit@@ ri , who , as an island village , is stran@@ g@@ ling the coast@@ line with a me@@ tal dete@@ ctor , has had to be exploited .
it does not believe that something price will be found today or in the future .
marine je@@ wel@@ s are not generous enough to do so .
&quot; I have been working on this for a year and have so far found nothing valuable , &quot; says D@@ mit@@ ry .
as a crude village , D@@ mit@@ ry &apos;s arch@@ i@@ pe@@ la@@ go is a few euro coins , pu@@ mps and also a dangerous p@@ ound which later du@@ mp into the b@@ in .
normally there are coins .
&quot; culture , finger @-@ pointing and so on are usually not , &quot; says the village of the island .
Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level , as weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have cus@@ hi@@ oned speculation in relation to the increase .
Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain a l@@ ot@@ tery as household incomes have been driven by interest rates .
policy makers in the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MP@@ C ) voted 6 : 2 for 0.@@ 25 % retention and fewer Members demand an increase this month as slow growth has weakened support for growth .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the bank cut its 2017 growth forecast from 1.7 % to 1.6 % in 2018 and 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes remained , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in the rate will be necessary to contain inflation due to Bre@@ x@@ tis over the next few years , and the expected increase in lending costs on the financial markets may be necessary .
Members also voted a year ago in favour of partial withdrawal of the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package on the economy which is being launched as a result of Bre@@ x@@ t .
the Bank will end in February with a fixed @-@ term financing scheme providing banks with cheap financing , even though it said that now , under this scheme , it would be expected to make a 15 billion bigger offer , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the judgment on the rate , the bank says : &apos; in the mid @-@ term forecast of the MP@@ C , gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain power@@ less in the near future , as the difficult situation of real household incomes continues to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
as regards the rates , it was repeated that , in order to mitigate inflation , some tightening up of the &apos; financial policy &apos; was necessary , to the extent that the markets were expected to do so .
Mr rs is now predi@@ cting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any form of hy@@ per@@ tension is gradual and limited .
Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
the forecast of 1.8 % growth in 2018 remained .
after this new , the p@@ ound fell against the dollar and the euro .
a drop of 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 dollars and 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have mu@@ ted the growing expectations of the increase in retail GDP in the second quarter of the previous three months to 0.@@ 3 % .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will start to boost slightly .
the Bank &apos;s most recent inflation report gave little reason for re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing rising inflation and ab@@ ject wage @-@ raising households , saying that the situation will go a little worse before improvements were made .
it was added that monetary policy could not prevent an income @-@ hit shock over the next few years , but wages are expected to recover significantly towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
the p@@ ound &apos;s p@@ ound also encourages the economy to grow demand for British production , partly compensa@@ ting for lower costs for consumers .
the decision comes one year after the 0.@@ 25 % rates were taken last August after the shocking EU referendum , which caused a sudden weakening of the p@@ ound .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to brea@@ the into full benefits for prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision , there was a growing demand for higher rates , as inflation had increased pressure on hard households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth , compared to the 2 % target , was due to a completely weak p@@ ound .
Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , President of Co@@ rec@@ o hypo@@ the@@ tical bro@@ kers , said : &apos; in view of the recent downturn in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive once again , as creditors are losing their jobs and hoping to end the year positively .
Eurosta@@ rs seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as re@@ financing , often without service and at a low rate , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS launches 10 000 HIV @-@ related drugs
patients will have access , from September onwards , to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tional &apos; HIV preventive treatment after the battle against the Supreme Court over whether the N@@ HS should finance the medicine .
N@@ England stated that public health now made available , during the initial three @-@ year clinical trials , an estimated 10 000 people , pre @-@ arran@@ ged contact pro@@ phy@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) , a ta@@ ble@@ t man@@ age@@ able before the incident , showing a reduction of approximately 86 % in the risk of infected people .
the N@@ HS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported last year &apos;s ruling by the Supreme Court , according to which the N@@ HS is able to pay for Pr@@ EP , despite its own claims that the medicine should instead be financed by local authorities .
Simon Ste@@ bankers , Executive Director of N@@ HS , welcomed the launch unve@@ iled on Thursday as &apos; new , far @-@ reaching intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &apos; pivotal moment &apos; .
Can@@ al health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ righ@@ ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ polis and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to register people , and in October there will be further trials before the programme is introduced everywhere in England by April 2018 .
C@@ ine@@ ma pre @-@ disability pro@@ phy@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) is a hot@@ line for HIV drugs , which will be taken before the interim period in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
clinical trials show that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces transmission of HIV among people with a risk of infection .
taking Pr@@ EP before the mid @-@ term review means that there are sufficient amounts of medicines in the body that prevent HIV from being infected .
such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the interim period .
among the opportun@@ e candidates are L@@ GB@@ T men , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot receive treatment .
clinical people who agree to be involved in clinical trials , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partners cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate at a local sexual health clinical in the participating programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and N@@ HS England signed the contract to receive medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the aim of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in large cloud .
Ste@@ Lithu@@ anians said : &apos; this new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and intensify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
this is another milestone in the fight against one of humanity &apos;s biggest health problems in more than three decades . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , CE@@ O of NA@@ T , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted correctly at those in need and in the middle of risk , provides an opportunity to change the UK &apos;s HIV epidemic .
since September , people at high risk of HIV in England , through this clinical trial funded by the N@@ HS , have access to powerful new tools that are individually managed and do not depend on negotiating with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
the CE@@ O of the Bon@@ rence Higgins Foundation , Mr Green , said : &apos; now it is essential to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is swiftly launched and that none of the members of the HIV risk group are left behind .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been acquired , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister for Public Health , said : &apos; the start of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delay and the le@@ ase of government sho@@ es .
evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to stopping the spread of HIV prevention and life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will bring us a step closer to full understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
it is now important that the clinical trial is introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people with exposure to HIV and to bring us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices increased by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
in July , the difference in electricity prices between Estonian and Latvian and Lithuanian prices fell to 1.@@ 94 , compared to € 7.@@ 71 in June this year , announced Ele@@ ring .
the main reason for the price difference is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , the average electricity price was set at € 34.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour last month and increased by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania the price fell by five percent to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 34.@@ 17 and the cost of the electricity exchanges on the Nord side was EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour .
prices rose by 12 and seven percent respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , 75 % of last month &apos;s hours went to Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine per cent of the hours between the two countries did not happen next day .
between Estonia and Latvia , 99 % of the time taken from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the time spent all transmission capacity .
according to the operations of the last July trading day in the Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X market , the wholesale price of electricity in August could be approximately 34 and 37 euros per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour .
the carbon price of electricity production increased last month and transactions were between € 5.@@ 04 and € 5.@@ 47 per tonne .
living a great deal of life - half @-@ time and smart de@@ sig@@ ners have made it the house of the small Ear@@ ls Court of Justice .
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker , a passion@@ ate property ref@@ e@@ ree , replaced her large K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge home in 2014 against the Ear@@ ls Court Cor@@ ter .
it is located at the first order of Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ Stream , and the fact that Jo@@ anne has not pac@@ ked her bags and sold her flat on is an honour for the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived together with my former colleague in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge on far greater ground , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I looked for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered .
I was aler@@ ted to this par@@ ade from the Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high marks .
I took it and made an offer on the same day . &quot;
since the first visit , this 93 square me@@ tre has passed through a complete innova@@ tor .
at the beginning , it was a cor@@ b with a single s@@ lee@@ ping room and a complex place : to get to the s@@ lee@@ ping powder , it had to walk through the kit@@ chen ; the Jo@@ anne wanted to add savings and half order to take advantage of the high disco@@ veries .
&quot; I wanted high @-@ profile , big win@@ dows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he called Er@@ fan Az@@ adi N@@ ot@@ ting hill and hill from the architecture and design session Du@@ ck &amp; Cairo to take advantage of 3.@@ 8 metres of de@@ ser@@ t and to create a home that is not just a development object but a place where Jo@@ anne can live .
as a whole , it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so it was a archite@@ ctural challenge to create half @-@ order in which to stand .
Er@@ fan had to take a creative approach .
&quot; Me@@ tal@@ design is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise facilities so that they were located on each other without having to bo@@ w .
it was not just about building a platform , but about using steel construction so that the peak of both upper and lower spaces would be right . &quot;
this imposition allowed Er@@ fan@@ l to create two full @-@ blo@@ wn slots in the room with a number of dramatic elements .
the semi @-@ star@@ k light of the old @-@ age R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us window is emerging from a g@@ all@@ ot@@ h housing window .
the gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture with a flav@@ our , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ k@@ ol@@ gic Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille &apos;s light highlight space style .
the use of shel@@ ves plays a role in adding theat@@ ra@@ bility , space and lighting .
spot mir@@ rors have been added to both sides of the short corridor so that they appear longer .
in K@@ ong , the beet beet beet beet is the second @-@ hand window .
during the course of the move , the meter provides savings for all the feed gi@@ ants and glass requirements of Jo@@ anne .
the possibility of closing down vegetables , if it is not used , adds to housing , creating a more gla@@ zing space .
Ac@@ cor@@ ding kit@@ chen is nothing new .
however , this kit@@ chen is a unique fact that it is an u@@ prising of the type of gar@@ age .
&quot; there was some design effort in it , &quot; &quot; explained the credentials of Er@@ fan D@@ F , who was spo@@ ilt by the strengthened M@@ D@@ F .
&quot; it has a counter@@ balance , which is why it is very simple to roll it out . &quot;
Jo@@ anne now has 16 additional capacity metres , an additional s@@ lee@@ ping room and a better fla@@ me plan thanks to the smart use of space and savings .
&quot; after all , the flo@@ oring rooms are what you sell - or what gives value to property &apos; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; the anch@@ ov@@ y stock k@@ ler takes an outdated form of tu@@ m@@ our and makes calculations based on the surface area . &quot;
here they have been able to increase the floor , while using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to space .
&quot; materials are the ones you touched upon and thus help to create emotional ties with your homes , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not hide into the existing electricity cable .
it is important , but it does not give heart to languages . &quot;
this shows that good design and an enlarged area are helping to make something ama@@ zing out of a rather normal flat .
in fact , they may even give rise to a desire not to leave , as happened with Jo@@ anne .
Under@@ stan@@ da@@ bly Jen@@ sen , the main figure , is Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s th@@ or@@ ny oil in the photo@@ graph@@ ics of Ch@@ ic@@ ago , who is competing with a colleague for professional relief .
nothing but the amount of money earned , aside from which any ethics is forgotten , counts .
my wife and three children can only see the man in the early morning and late night .
in the first half of the film , I find myself in the idea that this is a version of the business world of the &apos; Ka@@ ar@@ di@@ house &apos; - even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s speech .
the further the film , the less cha@@ mpa@@ g@@ ne , remains , and the mor@@ alising intention of film@@ makers is increasingly beginning to appear .
a life @-@ changing experience will involve a bo@@ ge@@ y@@ man with cancer .
a choice must now be made between work and family life .
the ar@@ tic@@ ula@@ te po@@ et is making the father &apos;s wal@@ king visits to the big buildings of Ch@@ ic@@ ago think about really important things such as belief , well @-@ being , love ... , without tou@@ ching even the twin @-@ tow@@ ers disaster .
after the third semester where a son &apos;s father opens his eyes , it is surely a feeling that film@@ makers are guided by the aim of having a public eye , because even the most pri@@ est @-@ hear@@ ted specta@@ tor is unable to hold back te@@ ars when she sees the suffering of the ar@@ m@@ ole@@ cu@@ ous cancer @-@ sick bo@@ y .
when the son falls into the home and his situation seems hope@@ less , the father will ultimately understand the mor@@ ality of his work and will do a good job to the old man who is looking for good work .
now I am taking a bet from my own point of view - if a film has a grid , I reward my generosity after a film coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , the st@@ int may be rewarded for at least one surprise .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that there will be no shortage of coff@@ ee - when a hus@@ band calls a sick person and a man stor@@ ms down the slow po@@ t to a corridor pal@@ t .
after all , however , the mother has gone aw@@ k@@ ward and , although his father has just lost his job , it is also proving to be a positive thing , because now there is time to deal with the family .
I can also feel well - I can already predict the end of the American dra@@ ma quite well !
in truth , film is well structured , all the necessary elements exist .
you can pick up , you can s@@ mile , you can see actors are a good and moral beau@@ ty : money is not the most important thing in life .
the film will come in well .
the new Staff College of the T@@ ru@@ m plans to limit President media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps Mr F@@ . Kelly can actually do that .
he would then be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new chief of staff in the White House plans to limit the flow of information reaching President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope that it will balance the gap .
here , a full report from Mr Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ i is available :
&quot; when the new College of White House &apos;s staff , John F@@ . Kelly , met high officials on his first day of work , he pointed out the key problem of President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ ges in the Ma@@ lis , which he plans to solve by reaching out to the President a lack of information from Brazil .
Mr Kelly told the officials that information had to go through him , whether on paper or in meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . &quot;
Mr diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have also tried to do so and have failed to tame Mr T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i by monitoring his media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades and , even now that he is in the White House , his television viewing habits have not gone away .
&quot; when candidate T@@ ru@@ mp was a sca@@ pe@@ goat for dis@@ honest media coverage , he was told that he was also honestly reflected in the publications he affects , &quot; said S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , former campaig@@ ning Ad@@ vis@@ er , in February , to Poli@@ ti@@ co .
Poli@@ tic@@ o tara Pal@@ Sea wrote at the time that &apos; T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , according to the six former campaig@@ ners , is the key to controlling Twitter &apos;s habits by ensuring that his personal media consumption also includes a stable gl@@ ory &apos; .
OK .
however , the idea that the habits of using T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter have ever been &apos; under control &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps these campaig@@ ners know something that the rest of us do not know would have been even more hear@@ tening without these interventions .
we will probably never know about the charges that the T@@ ru@@ mp did not post .
if she could save her a few times , either , from bat@@ teries , their efforts were worth doing so .
no one , however , has been able to prevent T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i from continually po@@ lem@@ ics .
part of the problem is that in Val@@ ges Ma@@ las , which consists of competing ca@@ ts , people exclusively seek to promote their own interests by passing on material to T@@ ru@@ el which supports their global views but may not always be credible .
Poli@@ tic@@ o , which reflects the entire gold of the story , wrote in May from the advis@@ ers &apos; tendency to feed the President strategically questionable information .
one of the examples of a repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is :
&quot; the current and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i sub@@ mits that T@@ ru@@ m can react to negative press pressure , particularly disrup@@ ting le@@ af@@ lets , by taking an explo@@ sive approach to identifying their source of source .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone happily gave a copy of the photo@@ copy printed to the President , Charles C. On the Internet provocation website of G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com , a website belonging to Joh@@ n@@ son , accus@@ ing the de@@ pu@@ tising officer , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , of being the white house of &apos; a source of information &apos; .
it does not matter that Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of his mo@@ cking , or that he did not provide any specific evidence , or that he has also made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them .
the band has read the article and started to ask about the subordin@@ ate Wales . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , then head of Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us , and then head of the White House , had attempted to establish a system for managing and documentation the documents reaching T@@ ru@@ mp@@ ini . &apos;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be the leader of Pri@@ eb@@ us@@ s more effective , but the T@@ ru@@ mp remains an impul@@ se and continues to compete for influence .
these changing factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans who have come from foreign capital will not be allowed to obtain permission to speak .
there are many foreigners in the city of Tallinn .
those with whom the le@@ af@@ let came to light acknowledged that they were playing in the old city without the permission of the urban government .
the first came from Vir@@ u gates close to the three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who had taken with them just as much .
it was clear to see that mus@@ ici@@ ans with ri@@ gs and sc@@ at@@ tered ri@@ vals were the co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il sla@@ ves to whom a du@@ ch@@ ch would be spent .
despite the mad@@ ness , the only woman in the company , a@@ cor@@ di@@ on@@ al , played a straightforward r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , while one man , along with her , was in the j@@ on and called the men closer .
the third man had sat along with them on one side of the House and smo@@ ked a cor@@ n @-@ hear@@ ted self @-@ prepared far@@ ce .
these three cha@@ mbers did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the people that passed .
Bo@@ b , who played the A@@ kor@@ di@@ on with the No@@ emi and the Pal@@ ace , said that he was s@@ ounding up on the streets for both fu@@ n and money .
the aim of the event was to collect the ticket price on a ship travelling to Finland on the same day evening .
on the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for extremism , No@@ emi and Bo@@ b shoo@@ k their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never be in one town for more than a day or a few , and mostly for a month or something like that .
there is no point in paying for this &apos; , Mr Bo@@ b explained .
when we returned to the gates of Vir@@ u about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in the hands of mus@@ ici@@ ans and are getting away from them .
the task force co@@ wed to the cross @-@ face of the Vir@@ u Centre with bags and bags .
on the streets of Vir@@ u , there were also three Polish young men , one of whom played the fifth , the other was ch@@ ari@@ ed , and the third had even been driven by electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people a sense of enter@@ tainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living , &quot; explained tri@@ o pi@@ pe M@@ iv@@ h .
according to M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there must be permission from the city government to speak .
&quot; of course we do not have it , &quot; he said jo@@ kes .
but we hope that when people enjoy our music there is no problem .
of course , when the police come , we go elsewhere , but we have to try , &apos; he added .
the Estonian Central Bank purchased bonds worth € 149 million under the euro area &apos;s public asset buying programme for Central banks , with a total increase of € 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
the Governor of the Estonian Bank , Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , has made it clear in the past that the purchase plan for the central banks of the Euro@@ system involves three different purchasing programmes : bonds covered by the financial sector ( Washington ) , early bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public bonds ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage bonds @-@ selling investors to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases will fall on the production of lower @-@ risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks .
as a rule , in the public debt buying programme , each Central Bank will buy its government bonds , other countries will not be able to buy bonds .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank will make so @-@ called substitu@@ tion purchases within the amount allocated to them .
Central banks also shop in those countries where there are limited bond offers to the purchase scheme .
the Estonian bank , confirmed by Mr H@@ ans@@ son , generally purchases bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and EIB bonds .
the Estonian bank will purchase bonds from March 2015 as part of its asset buying programme .
meanwhile , bonds were also obtained from Ele@@ round , but the Estonian bank will no longer buy bonds from June 2016 .
on behalf of euro area central banks , both Ele@@ round and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds will be bought by the Finnish Central Bank from June onwards .
migrants ignore their degrees and return to the &apos; millions of business base &apos;
some of the most prosperous home owners of the West Mid@@ lands have once again found themselves in a fier@@ ce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine degrees of the Council in order to win back the nur@@ ser@@ y sl@@ ope away from their cotton .
migrants have par@@ ked their 20 tra@@ ilers on the back of the streets of the bar@@ n So@@ ly@@ ul@@ l , a gang of &apos; millions of businesses &apos; .
they have returned , together with the army of hor@@ ses , children and trucks , after they were only pul@@ led out there in May , without letting themselves be confused with the dit@@ ches that were being ba@@ iled out by a council to block their invasion .
the working group found a weakness in the protection limits by turning its vehicles into an un@@ hindered part left to a wal@@ ker .
M@@ ici@@ dal people have been touched by the So@@ ly@@ ul@@ l Council saying that the Council is &apos; un@@ helpful in dealing with the problem &apos; .
a anon@@ ymous resident said : &apos; they dan@@ ced there on Monday evening after being excluded from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ is , where they were st@@ oring fur@@ ni@@ ters .
the Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were driven away and now they are back .
more came yesterday evening , probably today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Burma lob@@ g@@ ha@@ m council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect its par@@ ks .
I live on the street s@@ bro@@ o@@ k and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay the mandate if the Council is not even able to block such a thing . &quot;
a local resident who also wanted to remain anon@@ ymous said , &apos; It is ridiculous ; we saw the latter left those migrants , and a new on@@ s@@ lau@@ ght is already taking place .
this time , the number has increased and the gras@@ s @-@ land has even been seen as a horse in ru@@ min@@ ant . &apos;
the representative of the So@@ ung@@ ul@@ li Council said : &apos; we are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the area close to the roads of street s@@ bro@@ o@@ k , and we are working with the So@@ ung@@ ul@@ l police ; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
the gathering of evidence helps enormously when as many local people as possible report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling for a figure of 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
We@@ ek@@ y F@@ esti@@ val will also visit , among others , the Minister for Culture , In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is pleased that Estonia has managed to bring real world excellence .
to ask why We@@ ek@@ y is so important for the festi@@ val Est@@ oni@@ ans , Sa@@ ar says that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the full front of the festi@@ val for three days .
he says , however , that the Per@@ sian E@@ stu@@ rias site has come from real players .
&apos;@@ W@@ hile looking at the level of artists that has been brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this mus@@ ical gesture are being brought home - often not in our k@@ ings &apos; , the Minister for Culture talks .
which festi@@ vals will be held by artists , however , most of all by Sa@@ art himself ?
I consider myself to be relatively old @-@ fashi@@ oned and , for the elderly , one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ renegoti@@ re@@ n , who stood up last night , is certainly one of the most recent speakers .
after all , at some point , all of us have also been compli@@ cating our own feet , &apos; he says .
however , he still identifies a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ reau , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ Gros@@ ch .
of course , our own Estonian players too : starting with NO@@ Markets P and they can be read in a whole series .
in practice , this concentration of well @-@ known names is very large &apos; , he says .

the car manufacturers will renew their cars in the midst of criticism of up to 850 000 diesel vehicles
the day before the Au@@ di announcement , B@@ M@@ W said it had software applications for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of B@@ M@@ W , the company believes that &apos; there are smarter alternatives than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the city of B@@ M@@ W , Munich , which has considered banning or limiting diesel vehicles .
on Tuesday , Da@@ im@@ ler announced that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be renewing diesel engines to reduce emissions .
no company described these procedures as a call for withdrawal .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and could cause as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , the cost of the equipment installed to neutr@@ alise exha@@ ust emissions from diesel vehicles for automotive companies is increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of br@@ anding up powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to prevent Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen from repeating the mistakes of the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , which was silent about the use of so @-@ called &apos; hidden devices &apos; , which made it possible to adapt the exhibition of exha@@ ust gases to the regulations when the car was tested , but with@@ drew in normal driving conditions .
several head of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen have been charged in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , a former head of the Au@@ di engine Development department was arrested in Germany .
former President Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be prosecuted in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , the Au@@ di German criminal investigation concerning Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen was drawn up when the authorities accused the installation of the Audit System in order to circum@@ vent the requirements for European emissions of gas , thereby expanding the investigation that had previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the prize in research may be a major blow for Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen manufacturers of X @-@ lock cars , generating a disproportionate share of the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen profits .
Estonian schools will be awarded European Union flags for EUR 20 000 .
the Ministry of Education intends to purchase EU flags to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency .
in total , the measure will be set at 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 cent of the European Union &apos;s flag of 5@@ 70 education institutions .
flags are intended to be in@@ duc@@ ed in in@@ door spaces ; they must also be carried out in high @-@ quality printing techniques with at@@ testa@@ tion , an ER@@ R news@@ portal .
the text reads on the label : &apos; Re@@ gre@@ gation to Estonian schools to mark Estonia &apos;s first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags is € 20@@ ,000 at the cost of the Ministry of Education , or a single flag costs € 35 .
journalist murders underline growing danger in Mexico
N@@ oc@@ re Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers usually gather on Wednesday in order to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Blue oa , so@@ wn by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ stop@@ p@@ able drug wars .
but today they have gathered in the shadow of their personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their rou@@ tine .
two elderly wri@@ ters are discussing which sounds safer : either to bring the children to their office , which was the target of a subsidy attack in 2009 , or to leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the leader of the room : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutral &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking repor@@ ters to give every quarter of the water names without any need for liquidity , enough impres@@ sions and an internal feeling .
in the presence of a government or car@@ tels , a list of drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists is suspected of making it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
violence has no b@@ reat@@ h and the more bodies are accumu@@ lating across the country , the greater the number of journalists made up of them , according to the Committee on Civil Protection of journalists , since the appointment of President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Kalin@@ to in December 2012 , at least 25 , 5@@ 89 journalists have died in seven states after attacks and threats , and this year at least seven journalists have been killed .
the latter include their edit@@ or and source of inspiration , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den , co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on drug @-@ related violence .
his absence gives a deep feeling , even though his presence can be felt all along the front pages of the Sah@@ ra@@ wi Bu@@ il@@ do@@ ce building , a big picture of the Val@@ de@@ z@@ i , showing an average finger with the slogan &apos; Justice &apos; and the two 30 @-@ year @-@ old repor@@ ters , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , carries T @-@ shir@@ ts , which have a face or a flav@@ our character@@ ising flav@@ our .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death , and Re@@ por@@ ters will discuss common trau@@ mas , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , their dream of une@@ ase , their paran@@ o@@ ia .
although a separate public prosecution service was created in 2010 to address the cases of journalists , only two cases have been brought to justice by the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
as with most annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime , the number of which amounts to thousands , the killing of journalists is rarely brought to justice .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s performance continues to reflect the violence in Blue al@@ o , even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without murde@@ rers &apos; data and justice , the meeting on security , I@@ bar@@ ra said , will not do much .
&apos;@@ It is very stu@@ pid to waste your time in this meeting &apos; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , you will dis@@ trust everyone . &apos;
Val@@ dez left the State capital , Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , from the office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on 15 May .
he managed to travel just a few quarters before two men stopped the role of the red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ rol@@ la , who were forced to leave the car and were shot 12 times , supposedly because of the name of the newspaper , which trans@@ lates into the &apos; twel@@ f@@ th river &apos; .
an armed man travelled in Val@@ dez &apos;s car and made an accident close to it .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adults .
the floods are spreading freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
however , there is , principally , silence on the subject of Val@@ dez .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition of January to the United States of America , one of the bloo@@ di@@ est bat@@ tle@@ fields of the country has been Blue oa , as ri@@ val ri@@ vals are fighting to fill a power vacuum .
it does not matter that , on the streets of Blue oa , a few people , or even several , are being shot every day , or that the dead are s@@ tun@@ ned with double @-@ hul@@ l drug ban@@ ners , which are greater than many lives .
let us remember for a moment that the time of peace indicates how precious ports and drug routes to the United States are headed by a car@@ tel .
despite all this , and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s co @-@ foun@@ der and president , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , feels immense responsibility for not being able to defend his friend .
he believes that two errors contributed to the killing .
the first was the publication in February of an interview with D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z@@ zi , a car@@ tel competing with the son of Gu@@ z@@ mann and on a military basis .
this piece of paper could be allu@@ ded to by the supposedly suspect members of gan@@ gs who bought all the cop@@ ies of the publication as soon as they reached their time@@ share .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security after the w@@ ound took place in one of the newspapers that reported the same story in another .
Val@@ dez was a leg@@ end both in Mexico and abroad and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues had assumed that he would always exist .
he worked as a ve@@ ter@@ an@@ repor@@ ter at No@@ ro@@ u in 2003 when she joined five colleagues to create a Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling 50 dollar shares .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said , &apos; It was impossible to deal with the press without tou@@ ching the drug problem &apos; .
the newspaper ran a long time with its courageous and honest refle@@ ctions , and sales and advertising grew .
they were keen to publish vigorous studies without fear of censorship and s@@ now read@@ ers in a book from which they could read stories that no one else da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspaper won the pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot Award for her Latin American accounts .
in the same year , Val@@ dez &apos;s Committee for the Protection of journalists ( AK@@ K ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow the Mexic@@ an drug creat@@ or wherever it leads .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said when she received the AK@@ K Prize .
in an interview given to the television channel Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV last October , she said that drug trafficking was a way of life in Blue al@@ o@@ as .
&quot; mayors face up to the challenge that the journalist profession has of being able to play .
I do not want to ask what I did in the face of so many deaths , or why I did not say what is happening . &apos;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s colle@@ ctives lon@@ ged Val@@ dez , a jo@@ ke who ro@@ p@@ ounded like a mad@@ ness , a friend who had kind@@ ly shared embry@@ os and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they supported his rou@@ tine .
he always k@@ ic@@ ked his bar@@ rel@@ s .
he went from the office to the head of El Guatem@@ y@@ ab@@ o bar and was always sitting on the same table .
now they are asking whether his rou@@ tine love was fatal to him .
his death has also prompted them to question how best to do their work and to stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the sla@@ ck@@ ening of these women , their children , their legitimate businesses , with their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result , even in the best times , is strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ sufficiency .
confidence in your in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
when it comes to suspi@@ ci@@ ously , it goes away .
the problem , according to the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ ali , is that &apos; the fra@@ gran@@ ce can be dece@@ ived ... and so was the case with J@@ ah@@ er@@ er &apos; .
he and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Blue al@@ o@@ as , just as they do not apply to the toxic composition of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ s , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ iro or other states that are home to profitable trafficking routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is changing all the time .
in the space in which Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only the sugar assets sold to governments had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists .
in front of the house , two poli@@ ce@@ men sought shelter from 40 ° C months .
they appointed a stronger Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office in a four @-@ pack building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s middle @-@ class neighbourhood .
some repor@@ ters won@@ dered half @-@ hear@@ ted if these police officers were to be among the 50 % police officers who have themselves been blo@@ wn up un@@ trus@@ t@@ worthy .
several months have passed since reports have moved to mountain areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gan@@ gs .
Mr Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edition this week dealt with three main lines .
one of them was the murder of the former po@@ xing leg@@ ist Ju@@ li@@ o Grabo@@ ar Cha@@ vez bro@@ na in Blue al@@ o@@ as .
in addition , they had a reve@@ aling story of the spending of government funds on the town of govern@@ or .
and a group of people were kidna@@ pped from one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , from the office of the Prosecutor , from the quarter .
there was no official announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how it happened , so caution had to be taken when it was time to write what everyone in the city of Fland@@ ers knows is a fav@@ ou@@ rite place for drug dealers and authorities alike .
the edit@@ orial found out in public documents that a restaur@@ ant was registered to the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institu@@ tional Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
recently , several IR@@ P Governor has been accused of corruption within the framework of widespread coverage of court cases .
Vil@@ lar@@ li asked repor@@ ter to write previous incidents in the same place , including the way in which the son of Gu@@ z@@ man , we@@ aring the name El Chap@@ o , esca@@ ped from military re@@ ins .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have been looking to Val@@ dez &apos;s co@@ lu@@ mb to get information on kid@@ napp@@ ings from the best sources .
&quot; in the past , we would have known what happened , &quot; said a 46 @-@ year @-@ old Vil@@ lar@@ real , the body construction of whose bro@@ kers have earned him the slogan El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all communication channels with our sources have broken up . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has become a reser@@ vo@@ ir to the bridges and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the workers of edit@@ orial activity have become something they could never have expected in the name of the Sah@@ ra@@ wi press .
Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez seized a few eyes and returned next morning to a local Prosecutor &apos;s c@@ abinet for yet another journalist .
in the western state of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an , we echo the chaos three days after the killing of Val@@ dez .
a bur@@ nt body has been found and , according to officials , it belongs to it on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists from all over the country have become more vo@@ cal and , as an organised protest , highlight the phrase &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; on the roads and buildings .
on that day , President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez will be in Washington , trying to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
the day after the death of Val@@ dez in meetings with the Y@@ al@@ oa Governor , the Ra@@ mi@@ rez authorities accused journalists of lying and killing them for telling the truth .
since then , he asked that he be diver@@ ted from reflecting the government &apos;s actions , concerned that hatred had affected objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had said on several occasions that Mexic@@ an journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , compli@@ cit state officials and a indifferent society .
in her latest book on the &apos; drugs press &apos; , he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killing drug gan@@ gs but are also being killed on the orders of politicians and security forces , which are at the mer@@ cy of organised crime .
last year , the media monitoring group Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 awarded more than half of the attacks on the police and public officials .
&quot; in Mexico , you are kets because you want to keep quiet , &quot; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
the murder obviously has a bloody effect .
no one will forget the death of blo@@ gg@@ er Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ s six years ago .
she was found dead with a letter , which was probably signed by the car@@ tel L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my reporting . &apos;
alongside his cap@@ tured head , computer glass and head@@ phones were le@@ ak@@ ed .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , following the killing in March of their cor@@ respondents , civil@@ sla@@ va B@@ etan@@ h .
others will pass on as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do did in 2004 , following their assassination .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z openly spoke to the front line &apos; What do you want ? &apos;
some journalists have fled from national states , or even from the country .
it is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
in theory , it is difficult to find work and they still need to be on the streets in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes behind them , as was probably the case with the photo@@ graph@@ i Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered , along with four women , in a series of Mexico in 2015 , three months after par@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
those who remain in place and continue to work must be reset@@ tled every day by risky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to po@@ p up , recognises that it is intimi@@ dated by reporting the drug trade .
&quot; Mexico is on the way to hell , and that is why I will report , &quot; she said .
one of the last Friday &apos;s mid@@ night , when the latest number had already been sho@@ ved down , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce ed@@ itors were wal@@ king down to the office and pl@@ undering them when all phones suddenly started to be hi@@ jac@@ ked .
in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ i , a poor European town of Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ i , 19 people were confirmed to have died in the fire exchanges between ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces .
the war continued to es@@ c@@ ala@@ ted , as did several of the messages left by the car@@ tels found in the region .
on top of the same line , repor@@ ters pic@@ ked up the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website using a mobile phone .
a change was needed in the front of the next day .
the upgra@@ des were marked by a further migration of water in the Cari@@ forum .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pi@@ il@@ ding poli@@ ce@@ men on the ground to see if they are vigilant .
when they fea@@ red , they did not at least show that .
under a massive portfolio of the falling owner of a newspaper , with his average finger on the whole of the Sin@@ al@@ o , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers carried in his foot@@ steps .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w could one think of closing down at all , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; whereas on the same day Javier murdered , a tra@@ ine@@ e asked me to send him to report back to the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ partial pressure used the colour of protection to avoid enemies
at first g@@ lance , this sounds like a form , albeit rather frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now made the first findings public concerning the incredible presence of the Mac@@ a@@ o figure found by the Canadian min@@ er , which is so well retained that the experts have described it as &apos; din@@ osa@@ urs Mon@@ a Lis@@ at &apos; .
it has been so well maintained that it was even possible to establish that the sk@@ in covered by his soya was the colour of red bo@@ xes and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the latest Bi@@ ology report , published in the magaz@@ ine magaz@@ ine , describes it as &apos; the best preserved bi@@ om@@ al@@ ho@@ sis that has ever been found &apos; and &apos; one of the best din@@ osa@@ urs in the world &apos; .
in the case of fossil cars , this is a new type of no@@ do@@ sa@@ mic pressure that lived in the middle of the cri@@ cket season , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
its incredibly good survival was ra@@ ped by scientists who describe it as &apos; really remarkable &apos; .
this her@@ bal restaur@@ ant covered by soya has , according to the magaz@@ ines National Ge@@ o@@ guay , best preserved this type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus that has ever been found .
this was found on 21 March 2011 in the Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he extra@@ cted the Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near North Alber@@ ta in Canada .
it suffered something that did not remind the surrounding fibres and decided to look more closely .
the newly discovered ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus was sent to the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology M@@ use@@ um .
the next six years were working to remove the animal from the land section of 2 500 women ( 1 100 @-@ kilometres ) .
after all this hard struggle , the end result is now finally ready to bring the public forward .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you pre@@ ach a little eyes , you can almost believe that he s@@ lee@@ ping , &apos; said Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , the leading author , a theat@@ re in the muse@@ um of Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell , where the pro@@ position is evi@@ cted .
&quot; it goes down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osa@@ ur - din@@ osa@@ ur Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &quot;
when she studied sk@@ in , she found that this vege@@ tarian worker , who is covered by soya and is re@@ minis@@ cent of a tab@@ oo tan@@ k , was likely to be significantly threatened by the food din@@ osa@@ urs of meat .
this din@@ osa@@ ur with many so@@ cks used red and white defence in order to hide himself from pre@@ da@@ tors , and applied sha@@ do@@ wing techniques , which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many of today &apos;s animals .
this enabled the din@@ osa@@ ur , according to experts , to be better around and to avoid enemies , as more din@@ osa@@ urs were likely to have hun@@ t .
the presence of the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old family of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ ts first entered news in May and is now on the way to the Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology of Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell .
the theat@@ res have now studied the present state of existence and named Boeing &apos;s Mar@@ mit@@ chel@@ l muse@@ um laboratory , mark Mitchell , a famous team that spent more than 7 000 hours trying hard to reveal .
thanks to the ama@@ zing survival of the father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the so@@ om@@ inees .
they found out dis@@ shelter - the concept of protection in the country of origin , which means that the pro@@ ver@@ b of existence was a dead port as a bottom .
although objections are widespread , bread comes as a surprise , as Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta is much greater than today &apos;s live with anti@@ do@@ te animals .
it suggests that din@@ osa@@ urs were sufficiently actively hun@@ ted by other mus@@ cle din@@ osa@@ urs , that evolution preferred to be refu@@ ted instead of confrontation as a ta@@ ctic of survival .
however , most of the animals using modern shelter - such as fears , s@@ wine b@@ ars or sc@@ ars - are much smaller and more vulnerable as yields , which suggests that no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ ry was really struggling to survive .
&quot; the strong hunting of din@@ osa@@ urs covered by enormous and large amounts of soya shows just how dangerous animals may have been from the din@@ osa@@ urs of the cri@@ cket era , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds in So@@ om@@ ens also revealed that the din@@ osa@@ ur sk@@ in was a red ca@@ ke .
researchers will continue to create an investigation to obtain indications of this life , including the content perpetu@@ ated by this warm style , in order to find out what the animal was saying for its last term .
they believe that din@@ osa@@ ur@@ red failed rivers , thereby sli@@ ding into the sea with a stream in which it needed its back to the bottom of the ocean .
at the time , Mr Albertini was as warm as he was today in southern Flor@@ ence and rivers and oceans were likely to go far beyond inland land than they are today .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ mic pressure is truly remarkable , as it is fully covered by so@@ om@@ us@@ tic sk@@ in , but it is also three @-@ dimensional while maintaining its original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , today , the animal sees almost the same as in the era of cri@@ cket .
there is not much imagination to be used to recon@@ stru@@ ct this - it is enough simply to pre@@ ach our eyes and it seems like s@@ lee@@ ping . &apos;
the crisis era was a time when the earth was floo@@ ded with g@@ igan@@ tic din@@ osa@@ urs - the tero@@ shops - circu@@ lating on two leg@@ s .
although the King Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x of all of them lived many millions years later than Bo@@ diam@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , it could be hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tened predecess@@ ors .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ th@@ ur@@ us , 38 leg@@ s ( 1@@ 1.5 metres ) long and six @-@ tonne @-@ weigh@@ ted mon@@ ster .
scientists whose recent findings are published in the magaz@@ ine mad Bi@@ ology believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta was u@@ hu@@ ed into the sea after death , and this mu@@ z@@ iz@@ ed slu@@ dge .
on 21 March 2011 , Mr Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k was discovered when he extra@@ cted For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near the Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine in Northern Albertini in Canada .
according to the muse@@ um , it is best preserved in the world , including sk@@ in and soya , and it is a complete collection right up to bot@@ tles .
these divergences were on average at 18 leg@@ s ( five metres ) , and were between GBP 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .
two 20 customs @-@ length ora emerged from this shoulders .
scientists believe that this soya @-@ covered bio@@ ta was se@@ ar@@ ched through the current Western Canada until the river was in@@ un@@ dated into the sea .
however , the sea @-@ based bur@@ ying place of din@@ osa@@ ur contributed to maintaining its Fin@@ ns in an excellent detail .
the rem@@ nan@@ ts of this particular father , coal , have been so well preserved that the my@@ gar@@ lic so@@ om@@ pos@@ ters of the din@@ osa@@ ur continue to cover sk@@ in ice .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote in the magaz@@ ine National Ge@@ o@@ reau : &apos; such pre@@ da@@ bility is as rare as a l@@ ot@@ tery .
the more I look at it , the more incredible it seems .
bur@@ nt sk@@ in residues continue to cover my@@ ste@@ rious so@@ om@@ ic pla@@ tes located on the y@@ el@@ low .
a better front @-@ run@@ ners will be@@ at him , and five of them will be sc@@ at@@ tered up@@ wards .
I will be able to read the celeb@@ rations on his farm . &quot;
how did one activist find a response to the question &apos; W@@ ho thanks ? &apos;
Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll received a complete shock on 9 August 2014 .
just a day after the trip to New York , it was on the back of the village of St@@ . Lou@@ ise resident , on the flight of Airbus , on a mobile phone on Facebook .
he got on top of her former student &apos;s post .
it said : &apos; the police killed just 18 @-@ year @-@ old youn@@ g@@ sters and he is still on the street &apos; .
he was confused why no one else had postal this information on his stream , which is why he closed down Facebook and opened Twitter .
the postal services of the P@@ ide@@ ga @ The@@ e@@ P@@ aro@@ ah user were repeatedly distributed on his line .
Mr St@@ . Sy@@ p@@ par from the Lou@@ ise region , in real time , passed on to the death of Mr Michael Brown , an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black @-@ old black @-@ man murdered by a white police officer in Fer@@ gus@@ on Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is .
he gave a picture of the Ha@@ ve survi@@ ved body in the streets , staying there for four hours .
&apos;@@ It is cra@@ zy , &apos; thought the Ferreira bro@@ thers .
however , death was nothing new for him or his community .
he set up his phone but later later this evening saw again the sh@@ ale announced this time at Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
there were photo@@ graph@@ s of the police and sh@@ ell@@ fish and of a man who claimed to be the father of Brown and kept the label &apos; the Fer@@ gus@@ oni police killed my un@@ armed son &apos; .
he watched a real @-@ time stream in which a poli@@ ce@@ man stood up to a protest group with a hat@@ ching dog .
in the second video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... &apos; .
Fer@@ ber will remember how he struck himself with thought : &apos; this is unusual &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is not a murder of this kind with which we are ac@@ custo@@ med and which we could describe as typical &apos; .
I felt horri@@ fied at that time .
I was ang@@ ry and I said . &apos;
he boo@@ ked a return flight and went home the following day .
having bu@@ ried at 23 : 00 , she went to her father for her six @-@ year @-@ old da@@ u@@ ghter and decided that they would travel next morning to two @-@ year Fer@@ gus@@ oni .
what happened with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ gus@@ on over the next three years will be at the heart of the new docu@@ mentary &apos; W@@ ho@@ se Stre@@ ets ? &apos; ( &apos; whose thanks ? &apos; ) , which will be presented in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who were thanking for their answers .
when Mrs Ferreira , together with her da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a faul@@ ty bro@@ ker and be@@ at a suitable ch@@ at with it - was driving to Fer@@ gus@@ oni , they were talking again about the black experience and living conditions that they had been talking to them several times before this morning .
&apos;@@ D@@ o you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; he is re@@ minis@@ cent of asking himself .
&quot; we are now travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ oni because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys , and that is not true . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him along with him , &quot; said Pa@@ ll later .
&quot; what is happening now is the cul@@ mination of what happened in the past ...
it needs to know and see this and to grow in the middle .
it must learn about the organisation and organisation of the activist and , at the same time , recognise the different la@@ yers of experience and living conditions of the black tan@@ kers , and what we must do to free ourselves and free ourselves .
even if I succeed in bringing him up in such a way that he does not personally experience cruel racism , he does not differ from any other black girls .
I feel I would be doing him a dis@@ service if I were to protect him from this world . &quot;
the first stop they did in the Fer@@ gus@@ on gan@@ gs was on the way to South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ ti - from the police to the wall , which had become a sort of camp in which activists were awaiting news about the police officer Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was ultimately not charged .
there , Mrs Ferreira and her da@@ u@@ ghter joined forces with a local commercial owner who produced southern farms .
they brought together food homes and helped to share them with the prote@@ sters .
a new type of activist began slowly for Fer@@ rel@@ li .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said that , when she was a Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . at Lou@@ ise University , she was President of the Union of minority teachers and focused on food justice and health inequalities in poor communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organising .
all of this simply la@@ cked . &apos;
after weeks , Mrs Ferreira met one of the co @-@ director of a film , Mrs Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ i , during an evening demonstration .
the Fo@@ lay@@ an said that he and film operator Lucas Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r simply wanted to document what is happening .
in the face of Fer@@ rel@@ li , the question was : &apos; are you trying to document what is happening or to find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases in which people - often painful - come to the community and try to reap the benefits of its pain and resilience .
the Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born and grew in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Mr D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ i , a fellow @-@ director of the site , had already struck his hands with an artificial city known as a well @-@ known activist in relation to the sentenced prisoners .
his involvement made the project attractive to Fer@@ rell and another six local communities that were watched for years after the shooting of the W@@ ho@@ se street ?
&quot; in this docu@@ mentary nobody speaks for us or for us , but we speak for ourselves , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; it was important to me how these people are portra@@ yed , as that is how I am perceived . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on Fer@@ rell &apos;s experience - it was wanted to show that the movement was not about &apos; the head of the ran@@ so@@ m , but about bringing the community together &apos; , as Mr Fo@@ lay@@ an said - it formed the most open player in the film .
as a result , the &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street strikes ? &apos; is a surprise to personal aspects of Fer@@ rell &apos;s life , such as be@@ ating and mar@@ ried with their wife .
&quot; I felt as if I was na@@ ked , &quot; Mr Ferreira said , laugh@@ ing over the first time he was prepared to see the urban act .
&quot; but I realised that this work and the humane treatment of black people must be accompanied by a certain amount of vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the Fer@@ rel@@ li story emphasises and puts at the centre the role of the black homo@@ sexual woman in the wider Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three initi@@ ators of the movement who thought of the black teen@@ ag@@ er Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , in the social media in 2012 , after the killing of the black teen@@ ag@@ er , # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter , are gay .
&quot; in leading role , the black homo@@ sexual women have maintained movement across the board , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll , &quot; and this is precisely because we have to continuously fight on several fronts .
Roma homo@@ sexual women must bear the full burden . &quot;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed to state that &apos; mobility really is kept alive by black women and many of them are black homo@@ sexual women &apos; .
he says , however , that &apos; this is no type of equal opportunities &apos; - Fer@@ rell was not chosen to be the focus of a film because of his identity .
&quot; he was a man of whom the right energy was evening , &quot; he said .
&quot; but it is no coincidence that he was directly on the r@@ inde@@ xes , because there is much at stake as a black homo@@ sexual woman living in such hu@@ bs .
his energy can be felt through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news camer@@ as Fer@@ gus@@ ong have long gone , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the conditional sentence imposed on Fer@@ ber during the demonstration to block the road will last for another 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in a region he calls home simply as a &apos; huge free threat &apos; .
however , it still attaches importance to the man@@ tra it has been eating since the time when it spent on the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ oni as a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our responsibility to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
7 @-@ 7 pieces on how to overcome We@@ ek@@ enda pi@@ du po@@ h@@ mel@@ t
some of the most stu@@ b@@ born me@@ als find , after a scarce stick , that they are suffering from , hence aid .
or on the basis of the saying &apos; avoid a po@@ k@@ bo@@ t , a py@@ le cra@@ ck &apos; .
however , this is just an unavoidable postponement and a good ble@@ s@@ sing for health .
what can you do to get a better feeling in the morning after today and tomorrow &apos;s We@@ ek@@ side tr@@ all - or whatever else - and to overcome the po@@ tas@@ y as pain@@ lessly as possible ?
Jo@@ o Water .
Al@@ cu@@ lean down and beyond , after a great deal in the morning ... or possibly even alcohol .
as a body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it must somehow be recovered .
with water , miner@@ als and s@@ wine are also being thrown out of the body , and it is good for ha@@ ir mineral water .
as the soil is often irri@@ tated after drinking , it is particularly good if it is soil @-@ free or just ligh@@ tly constra@@ ined .
let us walk .
surely it would not cost the grand@@ mother to go to a bo@@ y - it might prove fatal to be a false decision .
however , an easy process helps the body to remember once again what it is like to be alive .
S@@ lee@@ ping in T@@ el@@ g and playing out po@@ k@@ ma@@ x is a more time @-@ consuming way of getting healthy .
give little energy back to the body , slowly and pru@@ dently .
if you are already on the ver@@ ge of over@@ drinking yesterday , it will certainly not be worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
to begin with , there is , for example , a fresh b@@ read@@ th containing fruit gra@@ des qui@@ et@@ ly on the shoulders .
if the South is already suffering from health , the w@@ ed@@ ding could be tried , for example .
and a little later on , it was clear .
there was no exclusion .
this di@@ u@@ Friday will rid the body of the last water .
as has already been said , water and volumes have your friends .
make a contribution to pain@@ kil@@ lers .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler on night to prevent po@@ k@@ bo@@ t , you have to deal not only with alcohol but also with par@@ at@@ se@@ ta@@ mo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ phe@@ cy , and so you lose performance .
so many more of our pay streams and , in the future , boys will be worse off .
moreover , the pain@@ kil@@ ler does not stand in the past for a long time .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler this morning , you will do it with empty noise - it will irri@@ tate the already tor@@ n w@@ ool .
or if you do not have a partner , you can go well with you .
it is about the same as wal@@ king , but wal@@ king is not going to be enough .
however , there was no too active a pace and an ab@@ ject shop : in a bo@@ xing period , physical effort should be moderate .
go a jo@@ ke .
the words of the friends of the time with their fellow suff@@ e@@ rers , the easy do@@ ses of the road and the na@@ era am@@ ic@@ ably over itself and others ( suffering ) .
the Lady and the wife may not be driven out of po@@ lem@@ ics , but they are certainly the result of the disco@@ very of a more la@@ x .
once again , the po@@ k@@ me@@ try goes through anyway !
North@@ w@@ ester@@ n professor and staff at Ox@@ ford University are sought for suspicion of murder
according to the police , a professor at the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and a staff at the University of Ox@@ ford , who have become suspi@@ cious after having been killed by the w@@ ester@@ n@@ ese people &apos;s w@@ ester@@ ns , is being sought out of a single Ch@@ ic@@ ago luxury cor@@ ps .
according to the judicial documents of the C@@ oo@@ k Coun@@ ty , on Monday , an arrest warrant was issued for 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i , accused of being arrested on the grounds of their alleged aff@@ inity with T@@ ren@@ ton H. James Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ cy .
according to the documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ cy died after repeated cy@@ cling .
according to a warning issued to the community by Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s police station , the body was found dead on 27 July .
the police received telephone calls and found the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ rand for the arrival of a victim whose body had several tor@@ bo@@ xes .
according to officials , Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ cy was recognised as the scene and researchers are treating cy@@ cling as murder , while the police actively seek two suspects .
Mrs La@@ anda has been working as co @-@ profes@@ sors of micro@@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at North@@ w@@ ester@@ n University since 2007 .
C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , Vice @-@ President of University of Public Relations , said in a statement sent as e @-@ mail that La@@ â@@ ria has now been temporarily removed from work and has been prohibited from entering the towns of the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n .
&quot; this is now a criminal act to be investigated by competent authorities , and the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n is cooperating with researchers , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ arre@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant in the finance area of Ox@@ ford University .
the representative of the University of Som@@ er@@ ville College said in a statement delivered as e @-@ publis@@ her : &apos; we have been in touch with the British police and ready to assist the US investigation authorities in every possible way &apos; .
moreover , the statement stated that the War@@ ren@@ i colleagues were shocked and would like him to ex@@ tradi@@ ted .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , Head of the Police Department of Ch@@ ic@@ ago , urges , on suspicion , to call on the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are , but we are increasingly busy in defining the exact where@@ ab@@ outs , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , suspects can be sought by local , regional and national authorities .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that the police had received telephone calls from the hal@@ du@@ ri@@ val of the Grand Pla@@ za Kor@@ ter@@ house , which had just received a ch@@ ry@@ p@@ tic hin@@ t that something had happened in the cor@@ ps No 10@@ 08 .
according to the police , this was a specta@@ cular specta@@ cle .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July .
he said that the security camer@@ as confirmed the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ ka and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the management of the Grand Pla@@ za sent a letter to the population : &apos; the police are currently working on the identification of the qu@@ ron@@ ology and victim background of events and are looking into different mo@@ tives , including the possibility of being a family dispute &apos; .
I@@ du@@ firms that help your company avoid becoming next U@@ G
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e@@ Commerce start @-@ ups , but the surveys were fu@@ tile .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , the company that sel@@ ls ha@@ ir maintenance products with 75 employees in San Franc@@ is@@ co , Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed .
so he called ou@@ tsi@@ ders .
start @-@ ups dealing with new types of human resources are starting to help businesses find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software with the firm aim of measuring the involvement of workers , they will enable companies to conduct quar@@ terly surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , provide workers with anon@@ y@@ mity and a hot line for complaints and , in some cases , allow them to by@@ pass the heads of the C level and address directly to the Bureau .
&quot; now there are tools such as Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ bi , but where is F@@ it@@ bi for your business ? &apos; asked Jim Bar@@ net , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up , G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics are used by companies to measure worker involvement .
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , he has had a much better idea of what his staff think and know for three years when he has used G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the investigations and the surveys targeted at certain teams , it provides a company &apos;s insu@@ lation card , which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , enabling them to identify the causes .
companies have begun to realise that they have to stay informed about their working culture so that they do not change to the next U@@ b@@ hur , which has been emb@@ ro@@ iled in scandals since the former worker published a blo@@ gg@@ ery which described a har@@ as@@ sing environment in which those who da@@ red to speak were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , the wish to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity .
the global area of governance , regulation and conformity could be worth more than USD 118@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the L@@ et Veld data on financial ethics statistics .
this year , in the face of the dubious reputation of U@@ ber , CAR@@ cent , a company operating in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , noted an increase in interest and activity .
Tajikistan has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber recently registered himself as a customer .
like G@@ lin@@ gi , ops cent companies will be able to send adjusted impul@@ ses , collect real @-@ time confidential answers and look at the problem areas of heat cards .
it also provides a anon@@ ymous message paper that allows workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has been for@@ given by regulatory authorities , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the foun@@ der and CE@@ O of EUROSUR .
I happen to say that if a company is found to mis@@ treat its employees or behave une@@ th@@ ically , it could face serious consequences such as consumer boycot@@ ts , the departure of workers and court cases , even if regulators do not intervene .
Ru@@ by cable restaur@@ ant , with more than 2@@ 5,000 employees in 500 places of operation , has been used by DE@@ cen@@ t for more than a year to ensure employee awareness of rules and procedures and to provide a simple way of communicating with the corpor@@ ation headquarters .
when a worker wanted to report a problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address at the headquarters of a corpor@@ ation , make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously .
it was often a da@@ un@@ ting and un@@ comfortable process , Mr Vit@@ ran@@ o , the Ru@@ by Satellite Coun@@ sell@@ or , said that there was no good way to monitor staff complaints .
however , now that a company uses IAC@@ cen@@ t , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices can be identified and dealt with more quickly by managers in other cities or state offices .
&quot; I can get to gri@@ ps with the Hol@@ y 3@@ 60 degree experience of workers , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who heads the Ru@@ by Regulators Group .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders against legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies started taking ethical behaviour , values and the involvement of workers more seriously in 2002 , in other words , after the failure of the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Andersson due to ethical irregularities in relation to the En@@ r@@ oni scandal .
however , only when the &apos; social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they cannot prevent their black was@@ hing on the web openly .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and grid cent offer their software as services , with companies receiving perio@@ dic fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors , who have been supporting both start @-@ ups .
EUROSUR financed USD 10 million in February by firms such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and customs Capital , thereby raising the value of the capital collected to USD 47 million .
in November , the G@@ lin@@ ti invested USD 10 million in B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners by increasing the total company funding to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise , given the inter@@ connectivity of businesses , culture and venture capital .
more and more studies show that modern workers expect more jobs than they did in the past .
in more competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are mere contributions on the table .
the workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy with the company , they feel they are being listened to and satisfied with the work they do , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President of the Global Department for profit and staff experience in L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , who uses both cycli@@ c@@ t and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors will earn money if companies within their portfolio do well ; businesses will do well when workers are committed and involved .
if analytical tools on the third party allow for an increase in workers &apos; commitment and involvement , it is no wonder that they will receive support .
having data on worker involvement is , according to professionals , important .
however , these data will be useless if the company &apos;s success@@ ors do nothing with them .
in fact , when a company asks for feedback from its employees , it can generate expectations of change .
and if changes do not happen quickly enough or at all , this could cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; when you ask for 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; said R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of the Con@@ sul@@ tative and Business Management Company , K@@ ot@@ ter International , who has seen companies making a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&apos;@@ For if things do not end up , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Mad@@ ison Re@@ e@@ al , who is now organising monthly surveys among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day that the problem has been reported through the G@@ lin@@ t .
and after receiving feedback from disappointed workers about the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communications , he was able to re@@ organise several company teams and provide communication training to tackle problems .
however , heading 1a will gather new data on workers and it is expected that , in the long term , it will result in a longer @-@ term commitment of workers to an industry known for its high turnover of labour .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you are not committed to transparency , you will lose people , &apos; Vit@@ ran@@ o said .
and if you lose people you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you lose businesses . &apos;
euro area sh@@ ining sta@@ r : Bal@@ tics high incomes
although the crisis of 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , B@@ reat@@ berg is writing a report from the European Central Bank .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
the success is due to low debt , fast @-@ growing institutions and business and non @-@ market @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where the EU average has been significantly closer to the buying power of the triple @-@ GDP per capita . &quot; said the Central Bank .
although the objective is for the total economic output per capita to be equal to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 the total production of the Baltic economies per capita represented only 2 / 3 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement .
low wages have led the C@@ ub@@ ans to seek better wages abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , less than half thought about their economies .
N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel the two @-@ day trends changing the long days of Bru@@ in@@ si
it is almost 23 : 00 when the football club U@@ C@@ L@@ A is stopped to talk at the edge of a new venture in the team &apos;s university city .
some of them have been sad@@ dled by the company , reve@@ aling their efforts in the first day of the week of the training camp .
for a large part of the team , these minutes of prosperity offer pa@@ per@@ work from mid@@ day .
after a three @-@ hour trend , the participants in the courses will go back to learn to the final stages of a common life before returning to W@@ bilisi at 6.@@ 30 next morning .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mor@@ a , the Bru@@ in@@ si train@@ er , shortly before Monday became Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel the trends taking place twice a day to reduce the burden of players has in fact made their days longer - at least until they get to one side of the game on Friday .
for this reason , the first three rounds of U@@ C@@ L@@ A were ti@@ med to start at 19.@@ 15 in order to fit into the already tight times@@ c@@ ale of players .
moving from two strikes a day to another day means more one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ all days - the start of the Bru@@ in@@ si training camp was raised almost a week before the last season , and for the first time during the Mor@@ a six W@@ es@@ tw@@ ood season , there are trips during summer &apos;s cere@@ monies .
they will have 18 trends until 20 August before formal preparations begin for the September opening play against T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M .
according to Mor@@ a , he is in favour of a change in the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , although it adds another item to the close schedu@@ les of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden three or four days and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they break through this challenge ; they are wonderful young people .
I believe that when the Saturday comes and we have more time , it is really nice . &quot;
once the camp is over , U@@ C@@ L@@ A &apos;s train@@ ings will be closed down , however , which is not an easy task , given the clear view of the par@@ king pla@@ te close to their fields and the depar@@ ting from the L@@ us@@ kin@@ i centre , the high @-@ class hotel that has already esca@@ ped from the protective network around the gates with football .
since this weekend , the players in the hotel Bru@@ in@@ si are occupying , but Mor@@ a acknowledged that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&apos;@@ We are implementing security measures &apos; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real concern and it is no exagg@@ eration to think that people can rent a che@@ que and fil@@ ter there .
if you have a record of a train , you can deal quite well with it .
but we are using a security team there and on the 8@@ th par@@ king site .
we will do our best by using our existing tools .
I will try not to be very concerned about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the election union of Sa@@ rem@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , a government that has been born for the centre , a government that has been expelled from the Reform Party from Chris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ and and has been forced to leave the ECB , would seem to have at least as much faith in the local elections as political parties in the local elections set up by the Com@@ mon@@ wealth of the forces of Kal@@ j@@ ese .
however , buses are considered in the autumn , and the key question will be whether they all have sufficiently disappointed voters .
who will remain with the Sahel ?
how small the support team of Ed@@ gar Sa@@ 176 are has been reduced , he can foresee events organised to honour his electoral union .
a member of the Assembly of State , some former and current partis@@ an parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and why , for reasons of candida@@ cy in Tallinn , is some of Sa@@ ten@@ are &apos;s honest sympath@@ is@@ ers and sis@@ ters sitting aside , finding that the &apos; Sa@@ stal@@ are list &apos; of the entrepreneurs , led by corruption practices and suspected of corruption , is becoming a reality ?
the popular mus@@ ici@@ des u@@ tte@@ red on the part of the city &apos;s government to the Russian @-@ speaking po@@ em , with the participation of the oldest city of the Las@@ na@@ mä@@ e ; and in every sense the original computer game in which Prime Minister J@@ ü@@ ri Ra@@ tas , the chief figure , when he travel@@ s on the ra@@ da@@ u@@ ta , has to avoid the dead and sla@@ ves that are on the way - is it the first time that the CC@@ P is trying to secure the votes of 16 and 17 @-@ year @-@ old elec@@ tors ?
we look forward to the views of the other political parties on the youth election campaign .
if Kan@@ al 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 look against black spots instead of enter@@ tainment at the beginning of August , two options will remain : to accept that in future , only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn &apos;s TV and English @-@ language Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels or give up ten @-@ month tele@@ communication operators .
there are probably also those who openly re@@ jo@@ ice at first about free television experiences , but ultimately - albeit reluc@@ tantly - pay for television and advertise@@ ments .
the de@@ af@@ ening music , the l@@ ung@@ s of the people and the rub@@ ble left on the streets are almost every major music fan .
however , if a man does not want to be part of her own , it is worth going home rather than having to pain home to discover - and leaving the room for s@@ lee@@ ping for the Cop@@ tic sum of the festi@@ vals .
Washington changes the green card rules
media publications are quoted by President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year of 50 000 people , stricter rules for the acquisition of temporary employment visas and restrictions on family orientation visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Re@@ public@@ s and supported by the President .
the draft legislation will be discussed in two houses of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , as it will change the way in which the US hand@@ les green cards to the citizens of other countries .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process is an advantage for candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economies , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp in the US media ou@@ tle@@ ts .

the still preserved archa@@ ic culture of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ de will also have an impact on home @-@ se@@ als , because it is simply so shocking that Pi@@ ho M@@ are , in the most detailed terms , thinks of the far@@ m@@ ble@@ ts studied .
his first trip to Si@@ beria this year is 30 years since .
during that time he has been there four@@ teen times and lived there for a year .
how much did Si@@ beria still emig@@ rate at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I calculated it on the basis of the talks of Si@@ beria &apos;s se@@ to men , who have themselves thought about it .
it is hard to say precisely because at that time , up to 30 people could come in one group , but only a man was given a passport .
only one passport was issued , but had children , sis@@ ters , etc .
look at the size of this territory here !
it was many times greater than the historic S@@ et@@ oma@@ ch .
it was , after all , necessary to educate , manage it in some way .
the sites came here as farmers , but their lives changed because they came to areas that were not only agricultural but also river ( pal@@ gi@@ par@@ king ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New Pet@@ ser@@ is , many se@@ dozens later employed in the secret city of K@@ ras@@ no@@ billion @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power built the uranium @-@ enrichment plant - J. P@@ . ) when it was formed .
did pigs then represent the majority of the population in this region ?
yes , they lived in tan@@ de@@ m .
in addition , the tradition of marriage and multi @-@ child clarity maintained for a long time .
seven or eight children were in their families .
how much did Si@@ beria &apos;s se@@ to@@ de culture differ and different from that of the mother tongue ?
they are different , although what was brought here was once the same .
they brought with them a great deal of calm .
they did so by themselves ( ideas for peace ) , but they always made a distinction between what had been brought about and what had been done here .
climate change has had a strong impact on the traditional ri@@ ce of se@@ als , because it is a cold .
the proposed changes were made .
S@@ et@@ oma@@ al meat , for example , was favoured , but was simply frozen here .
where are the villages of Si@@ beria and what life is living there ? / graph@@ ics : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ends ?
the ties with the mother country were spiri@@ tually strong , it was considered to be very important .
it seems to me that now that country is starting to give back to the ground , is beginning to affect them .
those girls who have lived here in families have listened to ama@@ zing stories .
Pi@@ ho is thinking of the people of the Estonian se@@ to@@ de delegation , who came to the day of the H@@ ai@@ da village Se@@ to , at the beginning of July , and lived four days in homes - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is very easy to come and go , because the city has an excellent location : railway shoulder and road ris@@ king place , &quot; says Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m from T@@ ap@@ hen .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a great deal of nature , sport and culture , and we have a car@@ rot in every corner .
T@@ ap@@ a is the ti@@ p of the city !
there are small islands on the ver@@ ge of the River Car@@ in@@ ine , where the f@@ ab@@ ric@@ s are rou@@ tin@@ ely engaged in hunting .
&quot; this beautiful place on the train screen does not appear , fa@@ mously Re@@ ig@@ o .
those who are not afraid of cold water can flood in this river , as the river is full of resources .
I have been there , you can do it !
the waters of the river can keep a distance and simply make a ro@@ man@@ tics : the flow of the river can look at it and think about life before and behind .
I have also been to my friends there .
apart from anything else , Mrs Tampere has visited the river arch@@ i@@ pe@@ la@@ go between her three bridges : &apos; as this place is close to the city , no one can come back when their stories were u@@ tte@@ red &apos; .
&quot; a wonderful view of T@@ ap@@ ale is emerging from the ma@@ gic moun@@ tains , but there are also health professionals where you can drink , you can pick the winter and you can now play the game , for example , of a dis@@ c@@ gol@@ f - gol@@ f has been done , you can borrow from sporting pride . &quot;
the old professionals are , of course , going there with their ke@@ y@@ note , but I have not yet been able to play there .
obviously , my colleague , Mrs T@@ ap@@ ale , must be invited , because she has experienced a dis@@ po@@ ser and has a he@@ ck@@ ta@@ g .
perhaps he len@@ ds me !
Re@@ ig@@ o and M@@ än@@ ni@@ ku@@ p were in@@ separ@@ able from the current oper@@ a period of childhood .
at least during the summer hours .
there are many te@@ ars left to this memory , many frustra@@ tions and you can see in my sporting life .
not to mention the sha@@ tte@@ red bo@@ xes and s@@ qua@@ res .
&quot; the entire city of Re@@ ig@@ o is now full of construction works , all of which is changing to mad@@ ness . &quot;
however , the old and ti@@ red wall building is a very attractive place where ski disco@@ veries are played .
I am pleased that in 2012 , the head of R@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ M adopted my idea by noting in Me@@ os , and had to make a ta@@ cit summer theat@@ re with his theat@@ re .
even though this year &apos;s communication season &apos; Ale@@ prises i K@@ aren@@ in &apos; has just passed , on 11 August , the railway station is in the &apos; El@@ lu@@ är@@ m &apos; , when the old Muslim building is moving around the 1980s .
&quot; between 11 and 13 August , the city of T@@ ap@@ a is the city of T@@ ap@@ a , which has seen the opening house of silence and ri@@ val cultural events , including the popular t@@ reas@@ ure , &quot; says Re@@ ig@@ o , who recommends to visit the city of 9 years in the no@@ days .
in the mini @-@ col@@ ony of 1 May on the bot@@ tle , the muse@@ um dates back to 1994 .
&quot; the house is small , but the pon@@ ders are well and the information enormously &apos; , pra@@ ises Re@@ ig@@ o &apos;s place , full of the history of the city of T@@ ap@@ a , most of which focuses on rail and war .
Re@@ ig@@ o mu@@ tes that , if you go through all the recommended sites in T@@ ap@@ al , you will go a long way but , fortunately , your young town will be filled with coff@@ ee .
&quot; we have such good eating places and sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad when you sit in ca@@ f@@ és . &quot;
educated and young soldiers coming to T@@ ap@@ ale spend a great deal of time in pu@@ mps , a wall when they sit there is a g@@ igan@@ tic feeling that you are in Estonia and your own town , but around there is such an international company together .
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans .
we have a lot of troops , yes !
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal ten@@ dering in Greece
television channel b@@ TV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , which reported that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ dering .
in the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of un@@ lawfully commissioned people on the island of Si@@ th@@ onia , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the television channel b@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were subsequently released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free ten@@ dering and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone who is caught in a clean @-@ up place , which is not intended for that .
the checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
the w@@ ol@@ ves taught by the no@@ vel@@ ty are breaking the sheep .
the farmers of the shel@@ f land will have to give the w@@ ol@@ ves their &apos; learning material &apos; after a year - apparently pu@@ p@@ pet @-@ trained w@@ ol@@ ves have already broken a number of sheep .
this year sheep in the Hi@@ i@@ u Coun@@ ty have broken the sheep three times , 23 sheep and 8 have been injured , writing the Hi@@ i@@ u site .
soil was the corresponding number only three , a year before 124 .
there is also data from the Environment Agency in syn@@ chron@@ y that the w@@ ol@@ f was@@ hing machines of soil in Hi@@ shel@@ f land were not born and that the Hi@@ sun@@ k Council had information that this year two w@@ ol@@ f was@@ hing lines have been fixed on the island .
Mr Ö@@ ö@@ l opposed Monday , the junta Em@@ dows opened up 15 sheep in K@@ abu@@ l and injured 18 survi@@ v@@ ors .
in the morning &apos;s early morning of the morning , the w@@ ol@@ ves broke a sheep on the pas@@ ture of the village of Re@@ he@@ din and badly injured another , to whom an emergency kil@@ ler had to be made .
rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Department of Rural Affairs sent a coordination front on the draft legislation on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment ( GMOs ) and on the amendment of plant protection legislation .
the amendment to the law remo@@ ves the creation of a separate collection of data for both genetically modified ( GM ) crop sites and operators , which will henceforth be used as a plant health register .
in addition , the obligation of the GM crop manager to have prior agreement with the designated person dealing with beekeeping will be modified .
although currently no GM crops are grown in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified crops and non @-@ modified crops .
this is at least as long as it is not up to Estonia to declare GM @-@ free , &quot; said S@@ ig@@ mar mouth , Head of the plant Health Department of the World Department .
&quot; at the same time , it has to be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors , &quot; added the mouth .
the draft law repe@@ als the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of genetically modified crop sites and handling facilities , sets out requirements for the handling of GM crops and for starting economic activities .
specifically with regard to beekeeping , the current obligation of GM crop growers to notify bee@@ keepers of the start @-@ up of GM crops is replaced by an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeeping before farming begins .
the draft law has been sent to the Minis@@ tries for coordination .
all interested parties have the opportunity to famili@@ arise themselves with the draft information system and , if they so wish , to give their opinion to the World Department .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , those active in the field of plant farming , bee@@ keepers and the farming profession .
in the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize 8@@ 10 - is allowed to be grown .
hitherto , however , none of the Estonian farmers are interested in the cultivation of GM crops .
the reason for this is that Estonia does not have a ma@@ m@@ our@@ ty gre@@ edy , a European media cor@@ n with a maize line of 8@@ 10 resistant .
it has also been tram@@ pled on the southern regions and is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
in order to secure this , the Department of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various su@@ ici@@ des , maize and soya @-@ type grown in Estonia .
the analysis of the sam@@ ples carried out showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soya vari@@ eties in Estonia did not include genetically modified organisms .
in turn , it could be concluded that in Estonia , genetically modified crops were not grown consci@@ ously , and it was also confirmed that there had not been any random contamination .

white house electronics cost taxpayers thousands
according to the military documents published in the magaz@@ ine magaz@@ ines , the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicop@@ ter last month for an event involving the production of America was to cost the southern taxpayer as much as USD 24 000 .
the Green and White colour S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , referred to as Marine One during the President &apos;s par@@ ity , was at the heart of the event presenting American construction programmes in Val@@ ges Ma@@ ks on 17 July .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , senior officials of Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence and White House reported on industrial products from all 50 states on their t@@ our .
the helicop@@ ter built in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ tis was driven together with the leader from the repu@@ te , the fire @-@ fighting car from W@@ is@@ con@@ sa and the pal@@ lia@@ tive but@@ ton produced in Mis@@ sis@@ z@@ in@@ si@@ p .
according to the documents of the Ma@@ H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) , the presence of the White House &apos;s military c@@ abinet , or F@@ AR@@ G@@ O , sk@@ et@@ ched 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter s@@ cor@@ ned on the southern hor@@ ror for the &apos; extraordinary &apos; event .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 com@@ man@@ der a day before the event in an e @-@ mail , an officer in charge of the na@@ vy to Deputy aviation .
it was stated in the message that the helicop@@ ter arrived at the southern hor@@ ror at around 7 : 7 : 15 : 00 in the morning and stays there until the Christmas night between 18 and 21 is cleared .
added was the fact that , if the departure from V@@ alg@@ est Maj@@ lis were to take place , a second @-@ class flight is needed due to the restrictions on working time .
the initial flight crew was at the helicop@@ ter during the event and the I@@ ca@@ andin@@ avian security team remained close to the aircraft for the entire time it was on the ground .
it was not possible to read out from the documents given to the magaz@@ ine magaz@@ ine whether or not it was eventually necessary to have a second par@@ cel .
the H@@ at@@ ch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political ends .
the documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 examined whether this attempt could infringe this provision .
&quot; we asked if it infring@@ es H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law , and we were told that it would not breach , &quot; wrote com@@ man@@ der .
&apos;@@ You seem to have no choice , &apos; repli@@ ed to the Deputy chief officer .
the White House project was announced as a &apos; made in America &apos; official event and the H@@ at@@ ch law would not have covered it .
but even official events have political under@@ ton@@ es .
the event was supported by the President &apos;s efforts to reform health at the time in the Senate and praised attempts to keep government regulation at risk .
the use of a aircraft known as Marine One or Air Task Force for political profit is no new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them purely as a photo@@ graph is unusual .
the band drew attention in February to the first campaign event in Mauri@@ idas Mel@@ bour@@ ne , a President &apos;s plane in water background , and he will be s@@ lee@@ ping from Twitter &apos;s accounts messages complaining about how the President of his predecessor used the plane .
&apos;@@ White Ma@@ l is very pleased with the display &apos; made in America &apos; , where products were represented in all the 50 states produced by American workers from American materials &apos; , &apos; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the spokes@@ man of the White House .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often carry out experi@@ ments around Washington and the southern hor@@ ror in order to get used to putting the white house of the President of the United States down with a single cent me@@ ters .
when the T@@ ru@@ mp was in Germany at the start of July at the G20 summit , 58 attempts were made in the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House &apos;s care .
according to the official , the event &apos; made in America &apos; was considered to be the norm for the flight crew at that time of month .
helicop@@ ters from Es@@ ka@@ r then l@@ ent an additional 11 hours &apos; for non @-@ President @-@ related support missions &apos; .
according to the White House , none of the other branches of this event burden the taxpayers &apos; purse .
according to the S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky representative , the company was not involved in the operation of evi@@ ction on the southern hor@@ ror of the helicop@@ ter .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 will not preserve the budgetary documents for President flights and the precise costs of the event will be difficult to identify .
however , the V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D reimbursement rate is 24 to 380 per hour , according to the calendar of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017 .
the Es@@ ka@@ r documents set the flight long from its basic naval base , the Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o airport , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , for 30 minutes .
the White House says that the real cost of using helicop@@ ter is well below its amount .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; costs on the basis of estimated compensa@@ tions is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates of reimbursement include staff , maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account for annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the rand survey of 2015 , the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation levels for personnel costs , while they cover the costs of fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an S@@ ima@@ er , defended the use of the helicop@@ ter at the time .
&quot; the idea is to show things made in America this week , &quot; said S@@ nap@@ er .
&quot; and I know that the State of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ ti is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are presu@@ ma@@ bly hundreds , if not thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly on .
so it is , of course , right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not T@@ ru@@ mp was in touch with helicop@@ ter in the southern hor@@ ror as part of the event was taking place , but he was hiding behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
within the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky addressed representatives by pul@@ ling off media ou@@ tle@@ ts about the products of his company in his own aircraft park .
&apos;@@ I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ ská very well , &apos; said , Mr President , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .
G@@ rit Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o - through te@@ ars peace and joy

just before that , he had got a zero leap from the University of In@@ ter @-@ Dis@@ tri@@ ct in China .

the Moscow M@@ una of 2013 became a remote fan of the Estonian record after its launch day .
two years later , he became the 15@@ th place of the Beijing M@@ il and held Olympic an@@ sla@@ m , but it was also a disappointment to the interested ath@@ le@@ te .
S@@ ik@@ o passed through H@@ eb@@ ade@@ ik@@ o when the Amsterdam Pact did not first receive the result of a bail @-@ out letter .
I would simply like to put together a proper multi@@ contest once and for all .
once , &apos; spra@@ yed Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
worse still : a month later , his Olympic contest in Ri@@ os broke out of the first barrier because of the re@@ van@@ ity .
time had to be taken down - will you go ahead with 7 ?
is it all worth two days of effort ?
N@@ ei@@ u thought at length but found peace itself .
I could think about it soon .
it is quite difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time to cure ourselves and think about it .
&quot; I knew I did not yet put my fin@@ gers on the picture , &quot; is talking about S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o &apos;s self @-@ cle@@ ans@@ ing .
I was able to turn a clean page and go ahead with a new impetus .
according to T@@ re@@ en@@ er Anne hill , it was very difficult to watch the suffering of care , but she realised that , above all , the ath@@ le@@ te himself had to get clear .
after all , he was so bu@@ ried by everyone .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; however , G@@ rit said that he would not give up and he would like to prove to himself what he was worth . &quot;
now you have some sort of peace .
he will do so to his deli@@ ght .
the contest came back in May , when Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o set 6@@ 280 points in the new Estonian record at the G@@ öt@@ z@@ ise multi@@ contest .
in a high @-@ level competition , she improved her personal peak mes@@ h with nearly one me@@ tre ( 13.@@ 89 ) and ran a record near @-@ peak barrier .
then the multi @-@ competi@@ tor felt that it was not at all a ceiling of capabilities , but only the first hunger of the contest was ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
he has been guided for years by a phrase that S@@ ik@@ o is a black student .
he is ready to be a spor@@ ts@@ man , he is well trained .
if something goes wrong or is wrong , he says so immediately .
it feels its own body and trus@@ ts its sense .
that is what we have to do .
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we will follow it .
the new approach has also been found in Sh@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
&apos;@@ I am not the one who makes the cur@@ ve to the maximum &apos; , he says and says that the most important thing is to get the hour right , because it also ensures a good result .

the good emo@@ tion has also been offered to the Sha@@ ade@@ i@@ k by friends .
both his former sis@@ ter in the field of training , Mar@@ is hill and sis@@ ter Gre@@ te , recently became parents , and he has received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;@@ It has been quite interesting &apos; , it says S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
a alcohol with a drinking is sy@@ non@@ ymous with &apos; training &apos; .
Li@@ ves@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is such a great wine fan that he believes that wine can be trained better than any other thing in the world .
She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist at Y@@ ale University .
his message is not about alcohol , or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine gra@@ zing process .
W@@ oo@@ king up the sheep , cha@@ tting up the wine , enjoying it and feeling the after@@ taste , we are putting our taste into work to create a taste for wine .
according to She@@ per@@ di , the presence of alga@@ e does not actually include taste , but taste is born of the way in which wine stimu@@ lates the brain .
he brings a comparison to how brain &apos; sees &apos; colour &apos; .
&quot; taste is not wine , taste wine is a deli@@ ct , &quot; says She@@ per@@ d .
the things that are still affecting the taste of wine are , for example , the amount of our age , gender and even coal that man produces .
She@@ per@@ d , of course , is man@@ ned that wine is not full of ha@@ ir .
&apos;@@ There must be more in action &apos; , he says .
if you are too fat , the system has over@@ grown .
excessive drinking can harm brain use instead of profit - according to a 2004 study , people who drink three glass with wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity risk .
10 % of Estonian ICT workers pay less than colleagues
the data from the staff search company , Fon@@ tes , reveal that 10 % of Estonian ICT workers receive less pay than colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , the portal Ge@@ eni@@ us wri@@ tes .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector &apos;s salary survey .
a total of 8 5@@ 77 posts were examined .
63 % of the posts were male .
&quot; although only 3 companies said that the pay gap was in favour of men and that there is no pay gap between the remaining companies , in reality , the basic pay of men per month is on average 10 % higher than that of women and an average of 8 % higher than that of women in the year of men , &quot; the analysis of the Fund , Il@@ mar Karas , said .

UN says Afgh@@ ans &apos; democracy depends on the role of women in politics
the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
the head of the UN assistance mission , Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , said that hundreds of women were standing in local Soviet elections , three women are standing as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; by underlining the importance of women &apos;s role , he said in a statement made on Wednesday .
elections can truly represent the people and can only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
for its part , the Taliban have threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with a transition period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections will mark the first time that power is handed over cal@@ mly from one democratically elected government to the next .
according to the ys@@ ms , women &apos;s strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan is increasing .
according to the In@@ dependent Ele@@ ction Commission in Afghanistan , 1.2 million registered voters are women .
the joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both large and small .
there is always too little time in common , but tr@@ en@@ n with words is a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , clo@@ sen@@ ess and burdens .
and what convenient solution - wherever you go in summer , live pigs are always with you and you will remember with your fine @-@ handed vote : &apos; let us now also make a tra@@ il ! &apos;
without insu@@ lation , it is very good to have a normal gold game or a kno@@ ck @-@ down of the coastal state .

it is wonderful to use children instead of can@@ na@@ bis !
first of all , it is secure and convenient , with the difficulty gradually increasing at the same pace as the training team .
mature children can also be accommo@@ dated with quite large children .
the child is training the balance , counts the records and feels la@@ x about the possibility of high be@@ ating and being important .
at the same time , larger children can ask themselves .
the extent of the movement will put the land in place and you will roll out .

a child can read the records and feel like a mo@@ ver .

in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much more la@@ x , to do when , in the meantime , you can give your hand to a friend .
in order to add the burden , there can be a plant , a te@@ ar tur@@ f , and there is also something to walk around .
there may be a minor parent planting for the hip , but this exercise offers a sla@@ p to all children .
while cra@@ bs are joining the si@@ b@@ li@@ p , the tri@@ ci@@ pe , ash and k@@ aero@@ meat will be burdened as they were infected .
the child is going to go on their feet in such a way that his or her body is distributed in an equal way and in advance .

it is possible to fly , rela@@ x , strike a balance and be difficult .
a little girl &apos;s life is an ex@@ hor@@ tation if he gets small things in coming up .
there is an additional burden on clearing feet .

children themselves have a lot fre@@ el@@ ance to do with th@@ ick and pla@@ te .

follow the child &apos;s safety , their kne@@ es , and keep their backs in a neutral position .
the fav@@ ou@@ rite and the big sla@@ p of all children !
at the same time , parents have a truly effective whole body trend .

Philippines at the heart of mo@@ ef@@ les - Tar@@ l@@ g@@ ko@@ t in the wider world
red bags in the newspapers are a summer class which in recent years has become a self @-@ employed product , one of the right ski@@ pp@@ ers must even han@@ g their hand and which , despite its modest origin , has been pic@@ ked up by traders to use a price label appropriate to their h@@ ives .
the red tape of the b@@ ars is probably one such thing that has existed in the life of the age of justice and that has not aro@@ used any particular emo@@ tion .
it is simply there , and if it does not exist , there will be no overla@@ p .
now , however , be@@ er bags are making a real victory , and mo@@ ef@@ ers have swit@@ ched their mus@@ ical design bags for summer months instead of simple red co@@ ws .
it is not only a coast@@ line , but today it is also just as popular as a street chamber , and it is even more courageous women who walk into the office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear , before it is over @-@ the @-@ top , whether this summer &apos;s temperature is sitting , or whether it is worth noting and lap@@ top@@ ping the lap@@ top@@ s are still slightly more formal .
however , the wealth of religion has made be@@ er bags a real summer love for women .
when you read foreign mo@@ il@@ ters , for example , the first thing is that the mo@@ e@@ gh@@ ur@@ ts will prove to be the first thing to be on the local market when they travel on holiday , and they will acquire some be@@ er to which there is a tru@@ ce for a whole holiday , and which will be accompanied by be@@ aches , the market , as well as friend when they are lying on the town .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are so generous that they buy their homes on the market and sell or give them away to their loyal read@@ ers .
it is worth noting , however , that there is such a demand among read@@ ers that women ( and men ! ) apparently go to each other in the real world in order to become a happy owner for some homes .
in some ways , this mad@@ ness is also understandable , as it is rare to have these regimes when you can buy some of the things that have risen into collective redress yesterday for just a few euros .
it is true that the cha@@ mbers of shops have also found a simple way of making money here , and so sel@@ fish @-@ rich luxury @-@ br@@ ands sell their bags for a few hours and a few thousand euros .
obviously , still so that the richer customers do not have to feel easy to die , who are trying around with some cheap bags .
for example , D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a will be able to buy a be@@ er of over EUR 1 000 .
however , the interpretation of the Chan@@ cel@@ le@@ ry be@@ er can be found in the circle of EUR 6 000 .
however , unlike most mo@@ tives , be@@ er bags do not come from a few big Cape Verde , but they were born in a much more distant way .
in fact , be@@ er bags supposedly come from far from the Philippines , where they have been we@@ aring them wide .
there is , first and foremost , a red co@@ ver@@ t of newspapers and very often no trace of the export trade and the local circle .
it has been said that mining technology origin@@ ates from the 14@@ th century and is quite a sar@@ d@@ ine with the usual cor@@ al .
however , as be@@ er do@@ gs do not have to be as red as cor@@ n , they can inter@@ cep@@ t mus@@ cles and other materials that make the dog more individu@@ alised and , by extension , more ac@@ tra@@ te .
recently , for example , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y bags where col@@ our@@ less pa@@ ints or sk@@ in bo@@ xes have been squ@@ ee@@ zed in .
however , the letter of directors can first of all be sent to the Kor@@ an J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ kin@@ i , the largest red @-@ red bre@@ w@@ l of which was not seen before .
indeed , he mat@@ ched the shoulder to all sorts of clothing sets and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
however , the popul@@ arity of the applicants nowadays also does not play a lesser role in ensuring that they are looked after and , unlike every other ski , they do not have to be ca@@ red for by special means , but also by the water and w@@ et .
as in the case of tr@@ end@@ y pre@@ da@@ tors , apart from classi@@ cal stra@@ its , br@@ ands have emerged with all possible interpretations .
for example , if you wish , you can buy a red @-@ red ri@@ ders or a little nur@@ ser@@ y .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classic be@@ er will never go from fashion to be@@ er .
but what is the classic be@@ er ?
for centuries , a red copy of be@@ er has been considered classi@@ cal , which rese@@ mb@@ les a flat from its style , is on the side@@ lines and is short , as well as from its ben@@ ches .

G@@ M@@ B is concerned about investment in the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e plant
the trade union expects leaders in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to confirm long @-@ term plans for production at the G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has remained silent on the subject of the future of the investment .
more than 500 people work in a theat@@ re producing H@@ ob@@ no@@ s and rich know @-@ how and other products .
the owner of Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e in Pla@@ dis said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in an object in the last few years .
more staff and trade union chair@@ men were employed there , &apos; are the first to hear &apos; when something changes in the operation of the factory .
in a letter to the head of the company , the G@@ M@@ B Scotland company , Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e , called for &apos; concerns about the lack of funding for modernising production lines &apos; .
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ ator D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the seat on the business needs and the future investment plan for customs purposes is a source of deep concern for our Members .
several generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is largely made up of local communities and people around G@@ las@@ go@@ w , a vital pillar for decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social insecurity .
therefore , in the context of jobs , wages and prosperity in the eastern part of G@@ las@@ go@@ w , Bre@@ x@@ t , the rise in living costs and the chronic fall in production costs , a thri@@ ving manufacturing company in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e is so@@ rely needed . &quot;
the Pla@@ dis@@ e representative said : &apos; only yesterday , the head of customs services received a letter from the G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ ju , and the company replies directly to him , as we value an active relationship with the representatives of workers and trade unions .
two months ago , a regular meeting took place at customs level between workers and representatives of the G@@ M@@ B , which openly discussed a number of issues .
we discussed with the workers then that , like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are reviewing our activities from the current point of view - and this applies to all our businesses and all our objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
he added , &apos; In recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million in customs roaming , most of which has gone into production lines and improvements in operations .
we fully understand customs tariffs as a source of heritage and , if there were any change in the operation of the site , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago against Ney@@ mari@@ i &apos;s approach ?
la li regrets its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tt
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not give up in its efforts to attract Ney@@ mar in its ranks by offering him an offer of GBP 18@@ 9 million to buy him , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record con@@ so@@ lation ?
this ver@@ bal approach has opened summer as a transitional window , and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the current world record of buying more than double that set at the previous time by Paul Po@@ g@@ ba &apos;s return to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ de for GBP 89 million .
once the transition has been completed , Ney@@ ra will as a result be the world &apos;s most expensive player and also the highest paid professional ath@@ le@@ te in the world , which will pay more than GBP 500 000 a week after payment from the PS@@ G .
Barcelona is , of course , a hin@@ t both because of the approach and because of the break @-@ down of Ney@@ ra , although the source close to the chair of the Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ i confirms that the club has always looked after the football camp since its arrival in San@@ to@@ i in 2013 .
but did the PS@@ G President warn the football world of this opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City showed interest in the conclusion of the Bla@@ ise Ma@@ tu@@ ga Agreement in 2014 , N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all clubs thinking about the recruitment of some of the best players in the PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that , when they concern some of our players , we will accommodate them and contact those players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but when they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appears to have gone beyond this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the PS@@ G central player Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow them to leave their ita@@ n , under any circumstances , and that Barcelona could be a set@@ back as a result of this interest by removing one of their precious assets in the form of Ney@@ ra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t .
&quot; Bre@@ x@@ it is seriously threatened with a w@@ edge between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r on his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&apos;@@ I cannot imagine who would benefit from this &apos; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; he emphasised .
he said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as it cannot , to remain part of the European single market .
this would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
another way of making British opt @-@ outs smoo@@ ther would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said : &apos; surely we could have that with Britain &apos; .
the alternative to this would be to return to customs items that would declare historical divisions and political failure .
&quot; raise trade , prosperity and peace , &quot; said the Prime Minister of Ireland .
he called Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t &apos; A challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when he visited Bel@@ fast .
Av@@ ja , the first and a half @-@ long tri@@ ath@@ on , is a sign of I@@ ron@@ man &apos;s ability to go through everyone .
today , the greatest Tri@@ at@@ lon@@ if@@ ers of the Baltic States were held in the capital of the winter , when nearly a thousand tri@@ cks were brought to the competition of half @-@ long I@@ ron@@ man from over thirty countries .
7@@ 0.@@ 3 miles of design consis@@ ted of 1.9 km of sw@@ im@@ ming , 90 km of cy@@ cling and 2@@ 1.1 km of cy@@ cling .
among others , the first Tri@@ at@@ l@@ on of his life has also been successfully closed down by a note of Av@@ ences .
&quot; I thought that it would be difficult and , in the end , it was difficult to do so , &quot; said Av@@ ja &apos;s fin@@ ch .
despite the complexity of Av@@ ences , in fact , the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ on is fit for nearly everyone .
&quot; not dis@@ dance kills but the pace kills , &quot; he said , suggesting that , at an affordable rate , everyone will reach the fin@@ alist .
except O@@ tt Se@@ pp : &apos; everything is fine , but unfortunately it cannot sw@@ allow &apos; .
Av@@ ences had already made a very strong move since February .
initially 4 @-@ 5 hours per week , but 10 hours a week later .

John Mol@@ dan , a German with 3 : 58 : 27 , Est@@ oni@@ ans with the best I@@ vo G@@ rea@@ r 04 : 14 : 09 , the overall winner of the O@@ te@@ pä@@ ä phase .
among women , the Danish Lady Hel@@ le Fre@@ der@@ ik@@ sen won 04 in time : 24 : 01 , Est@@ oni@@ ans , Maria J@@ än@@ ese , who lost Fre@@ der@@ ik@@ sen almost half a hour and received 04 : 58 : 58 .
Av@@ ences went from 1.9 km to 42 minutes and 14 seconds .
he came out of 4@@ 10 positions .
