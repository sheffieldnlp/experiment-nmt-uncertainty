Gulevich was arrested in the Court of Gulevich in Spain .
yesterday , the Court also adopted three suspected arrest in Estonia .
according to cases , the so @-@ called &apos; Cape rovo criminal members aged between 27 and 57 of 57 who commit themselves mainly to drug crimes .
in Spain , in the province of Mijam , the head of the criminal community was held in the Malaga region .
in Estonia three men were detained , one has been collected according to the data collected according to the criminal community figures , and two of them are members of the criminal community .
the data that has been collected indicates that in the criminal community , there were clearly divided tasks and roles .
the purpose of the crime of the illegal Community was to set up drug crimes and , therefore , to serve the use of criminal benefits , the head of the court procedure , the Head of State Public Prosecutor , the Head of Verte .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected pirates will increase in the name , added to the Prosecutor .
this is the people who have been found in the law enforcement interest in the past , and some of them have suffered a penalty against drug crimes .
the Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been crucial throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become commonplace for us , and the operation of this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; commented Verte &apos; .
ago , as a leader of the central criminal police service , Lithuania said that there were almost half years of prior examination of the detention period .
in the first half of the first half of the year , the privatisation of long @-@ term work and , at the same time , we have been suspected of crimes in Estonia and Spain . &quot;
it was added that officials of the central criminal police officers were helping in Spain .
for many years , we have a good contact and understanding of the Spanish police and civil card .
these arrests are another message to criminals that we will also be able to get them from another European search &apos; , &apos; said Lei .
the information that has been collected so far indicates that there can be a suspicion of men in freedom in the presence of the new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office has requested the arrest and court of the prosecution .
the person arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
in the context of this criminal issue , the seizure of property , vehicles and cash has been seized .
the Court &apos;s pre @-@ trial procedure leads to a centre of criminal police organised by organised crime and led the public Prosecutor &apos;s office .
the Latvian court in Tallinn , Studies , sentenced to blackmail in 2005 , and punished by a five @-@ year imprisonment .
in the middle of last decade , Gulevich Tarankov , Mr Nikolai Tarankov , was held in the light of the second most important thing in the European world .
Cape rovol , Gulevich , rose by Estonia in the beginning of the 1990s when he started to address blackmail at the beginning of the winter .
Admittedly , she has acted on the various hotels , and he called for a return to a monthly tax on the business men .
international joint operations , confiscation of criminal profits and the entry into force of the courts confirm that the fight for organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest Court rulings , for example , the eight accused of the criminal issue allocated by the criminal acquis of the so @-@ called Dikyev Community of EUR 80 000 , or a judgment against nine individuals in that case , that Mr Igor Alexynikov set up a criminal Community in 2006 , aimed at Igor Aleynikov in the illegal trade and trafficking of crime in East Viruland and South Estonia .
there is a total of EUR 71 500 in criminal revenue .
it has ensured progress in these criminal matters that police officers are changing the information every day with foreign counterparts and prosecutors , and if necessary , the operations carried out by any country in the European Union .
civil rights groups warn Mrs Paliadeli for travelling .
the Advaner of Coloid of National Association for the People ( NAACP ) has warned the Misrisker travelling by the state of a Misrisker travelling by the state of a Misrisker travelling by the State of the state .
in the statement of the Rühle , the State of the State of the Extravel Act issued by the &apos; Misouri State &apos; , which applies until 28 August 2017 , all the African passengers , visitors and sourians , will have to be in the state of the entire state of affairs in the country , as well as the most careful and extremely cautious racial racial occurrence , which has been made over the last state and here . &quot;
according to NAPs , the group encouraged a passenger warning law to be issued by the recent Missouri Act , which will make discrimination against cases of cases that are more difficult than the fact that the state of state corps is unequally in the case .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are violated .
they are being drawn up because of their skin colour , they are being beaten or killed , &apos; said the &apos; NAGouri branch of NAPs &apos; , Mr Rod Chapel , the newspaper of the Kansas of the Chadian , The Kansa City .
&quot; we have never been able to hear complaints in the past . &quot;
this is the first warning that the organisation has issued on the State state of the US .
Mrs Rühle referred to the events such as racist insults for Misourtic students in Missouri to Missai University , and in Tennessing , the age of 28 @-@ year @-@ old Sandersi .
the winners died in the first half of this year , since it became the case by the State of the state of benches and the Misouri police carried out in custody , he took in custody , without having been accused of a crime .
in addition , note of a report by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri refers to the recent report by the Prosecutor of Missourn , which shows that the car drivers of the state will be suspended by 75 % in the state of car drivers more likely than to be wrong .
&quot; note is intended to be aware that people are aware and warned of their families , friends and working partners , which may happen in the Apel . &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people will have to be prepared , whether it will be remote from inclusion or informing themselves that they are going through the State . &quot;
on the basis of the latest data on the report by FBI hate crimes , an Mistaneous crime in 2015 was documented by an Mistaneous crime in 2015 .
your warning is also in response to a new law on the Misouri , which makes it difficult for a company to prosecute housing or work in search of employment .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( ACLU ) was issued previously by the American Civil Liberties Association ( ACLU ) , in the case of Texas and Arizona , after those states adopted immigration laws that oblige local authorities to be arrested for violations of the immigration law , because according to ACTA , it will increase racial profiling .
there is usually a foreign Ministry of Foreign warnings on foreign countries , but at the last time it has started to use this measure in response to the laws of certain US laws and trends .

although the proviser of the recently proclamation of competitors from fourteen @-@ old Olympic winners , 34 @-@ year @-@ old Farah took place in the light of 34 @-@ year @-@ old Farah , and won the time of 26.49.51 .
Farah did not wonder long after the finiler , after the finiler , his wife &apos;s Tania and children .
that was a particular moment for me .
I am very much keen on your family .
it was a wonderful &apos; , &quot; said Farah journalists .
Farah in London is looking at the fifth edition of the title of the inaugural title of 5 000 and 10 000 metres .
all of it is possible to do so .
despite the title of Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Constandard , Mrs Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Constandard , &apos; Daam gold &apos; in Gustav Klimm , Aac&apos;s Bloch @-@ Baudes , Adele Bloch @-@ Baudes , the extraordinary story of an art works in the age of 19 to the end of the 19th century and in Vienna on 20 century cultural activities .
but even more in the history .
the inflammatory leaflet as a result of the infancy of gold , more than a narrow issue would have had been put in place in the title of a &apos; no &apos; to a greater effect on the basis of the preaching of the athletes .
at the moment , there are two books at the same time , between the two books : Gustav Klimti and his country &apos; Daam gold @-@ in &quot; Bloch @-@ Baudes , and much more ambitious and more comprehensive and ambitious time @-@ wing families and the German occupation of the German occupation , with this follow @-@ up to Austria .
the first third of the book will lead in the middle of the wool Violence Viin Culture and who , in the Austrian capital , is expected to imagine how more than one hundred years ago , the Ringstale went to Ringstot , or how in the Centrali , when the climate was introduced .
the concentration of cultural figures was in one of the richest cities of Europe and , when seeing the name of a high @-@ speed city , the call for a more more than a gram of culture .
at the same time , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in the city where the inviophine blame and was the highest in European self @-@ killing and was the highest suicide rate in Europe .
or perhaps , however - every couple of couples will add a colour of anti @-@ cultural life in Vienna in the 20th century .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna has been an explosion in Vienna , changing the biggest Jewish communities in Western Europe .
the exchange of the Sajdic was almost one of the 10 people in Vienna .
the Adele parents were also in Vienna , but by then , if the Adele aid is to be opening up two times in the Czech sugar magant , Mr Ferdinand Blochevery and Klimm , he had already received a bank from Habsburg in the seventh largest bank in Habsburg &apos;s empire .
but Mr Adelet all all of this point of view , which he was famous , did not draw up .
if you look at the &apos; Daam gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the age of life in the end of this kind is a very much socialist socialism and dreaming up the Soviet Union .
by 2010 , when the Ferdinand Bloch decided on a climate from his husband &apos;s visit to a customer , was the last moment of a six @-@ hour period in Vienna .
the climate was paid by 4 000 kroonons at that time , a quarter of the cost of a good location to the land of the land .
in order for some of a few sports to a modell on a modell on the modell of a modell , the sugar magnawas did not discourage .
as far as it is concerned , the only firm fact is that in the course of work close to the modell and the artist close the way to the end .
Mrs O &apos;Connor - &apos; Daam gold .
Ms Gustav Klimti , the extraordinary story of the Plense , Adele Bloch @-@ Baueri story &apos; , Varrak 2016 , English interpretation of the Aldo Randland .
in the wake of the start of the work immediately before the work of the Adelega , the Klimt went to San Vitas , and the investigators believe that it is where the breadth of the mosate of mossadorest species is the slogan , Theodorn , gave the idea to make a golden platform for the mosable of the slogan .
the Klimm presented its &quot; Vienna report 1908 in 1908 and around the &quot; One of the golden &apos; in the region ( 1907 / 1908 ) .
the historical time of the arts did not have to be seen not by the similarity of a woman .
how is Hitler involved ?
&quot; I think that my friend Klimm , I am indebted to the memory of him , that he has made it available to the public in his work , &quot; wrote to Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer , a couple of years after the departure of artists ( in February 1918 ) , and wished to ask the Museum of the Museum from the Directorate @-@ General for the museum .
the six years before the climate was completed , the thirst of the climate had been killed .
in its minds , too , in February 1925 , he asked for the husband to deprive her of its two Portuguese and four Gustav Klimm in Austria &apos;s Galmm landscape .
in its authentication , he has done a sister of his sisters , Mariale and Lug .
the year after the Klimt was an annex to the &quot; Austrian Mona &apos;s annex &apos; , it has tried to get the Sagons of Vienna @-@ year @-@ old Advisde Akadef , Hitler , but failed by the German .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s anti @-@ Semitism because the anti @-@ Semitism is due to the fact that the professor of professors did not have accepted him , none of his depictions was actually in July .
in any case , the role referred to in the Austrian GalSpecii task , which has changed considerably since 1939 , has become a significant example of the wealth of artistic work to be found in Vienna .
some of Hitler &apos;s personal artistic assets have been working at home , but not about the climate .
Sixty years after the nail of art , it started a 10 @-@ year @-@ old dispute between the Austrian Government and Bloch @-@ Baukers .
at this point , however , it is only noted that , if &apos; Sluke &apos; sees a Belvedere loophole in Vienna , the &apos; Daam Bloch @-@ Bauer image &apos; , the &apos; Daami @-@ Bauer &apos; is &apos; need to travel to New York in New York .
and before you read in Vienna , the book also has been mentioned .
even if you look at the climate to go to the plan , because at least my emotions were made following the closure of the book , and the issue of 135 million dollars , and the bll Adele Bloch @-@ Mrs Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer .
so it is not so much a kind of refuge , rather than a fatal life , and a very much move .
in the event , it facilitated the presentation of the Bausons &apos; relatives in the beginning of the exhibition at the beginning of the paper .
17 @-@ year @-@ old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonia
there was gold in the past 200 more than 200 more than a personal recorning house in 2.1662 .
the mark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ annual piles when Canada became a 2.16.58 Championship when it became a 2.16,58 Championship , the Private APope &apos;s blog .
the fact that , in this way , the tenth A finalist .
she will be distanced at 2.15,76 76 and reached a good seventh seat in a new top priority .
the Estonian recorps from the Estonian Leendzig ( 2.15.13 ) remained a little over half of the second .
Estonia all at all times rose by the end of gold , and its fresh personal mark is the fifth result of all the time in Estonia .
the hope of the future is Canada on the top 100 m , 200 m , 200 m and 400 , and 200 and 400 m , and 200 and 400 more complex .
last week , in Toronto , there took place in Turin Champions in Canada and the gold has done a successful start there .
he won 200 m wooping in balls in 2.03.22 .
so quickly , this distance was last side by the last year in 2008 .
the Golf more quickly is not only a record of Estonia from Partrka Partrka in Estonia .
as a guardian of Canada , there has still been a joblessness in the bridary of 100 metres in the baltuous speech in Canada , and the new EU season 56.66 of the new EU season .
for example , the old Kertu person from Alnek to Alnek is this distance only by one hundredth one century .
in a personal margin , she reached a letter of early 1.03.69 to be replaced by the opening up of EUR 100 m .
half a longer @-@ term distance has only reached the seventh seat when the finest came in 2.17.31 .
the gold is currently leading to the age of Estonia in four different distance sessions .
President Trug goes on holiday , critics of a tooth
the holiday time is in the hands - that means that the US President Donald Truthe .
however , since the Trug has been one of the most most of the holiday days , the critics have already taken up a tooth .
in the US , the United States and CNN have been scheduled for 17 @-@ day leave in the end of the President , in Bedminster clubs , which is located in New Jerseys .
although the President began yesterday , there has already been a few days in the case of Trumpi on holiday .
they will be too frequent in Trug on the Olympic Games .
it is the case that the President is the right time for a week in his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey in New Jersey .
by the way , Trug is not the most cleaned by President , Trug in his 196 authorities .
for example , Mr W. Bush arrived at the time of a holiday time , Mr Obama , as Mr Obama , is less than half of the Trug , but 21 days .
however , the Olympic Games tend to be unwise .
a few days after receiving the President , Trug said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , so that the longest holiday in his father will not survive , because there is a great deal of need to be done .
he also published three years ago on the leave of Barack Obama .
on Twitter at the time , the President signed on Twitter : &apos; at the time Obama is on holiday , golf , the brakes and the jigns of golf , will go on the brakes and the jigns of the jigns of the law . &quot;
the White House officials have not received 17 @-@ day golf visits to a study .
it is being formally called on a working holiday , during which there is no time for the Olympic Games to read or amend .
in addition , it had to be the second reason for holiday .
namely , the White House on the western stock of the western stock of the white house , and therefore , had to leave the staff where it has to leave .
the West is also located in the West and others are in the working space of the President .
&quot; I do not believe that one of you would like to be in August in the West , if there is 38 degrees , and there is no state of office , the White House said a person in Lindsay , Mr Walters , who stressed that the President will continue to work during the time .
where the President Trug will follow 17 days , the use of videos .
blocking of the critics &apos; Facebook page , do not apply to public office when you are not going to vote on the voters &apos; criticism
the father of our country is in a great deal of media coverage .
the Americans loved Mr George Washington , but the newspapers did not have had long enough to start up the tyranny of the internal politics of the political principles .
of course , it was annoyed to him .
but he did not forced its criticism .
because in 1783 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression can be taken away from us , and in silence and silent on sheep , we may be in the wake of the massacres . &quot;
this brings me to Mr Honer Larry , Mr Hogan , who worked hard to be able to be more in Washington .
it has been blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the week of the week of a complaint by the Union for freedom of freedom of American citizens ( ACLU ) is therefore a court .
Sberner officials led to an act of empty and web comment filed by a counter @-@ style &apos; party &apos; interest ? &apos; .
&quot; this is just Facebook , &apos; many &apos; said .
but what counts .
and this is a great deal , in particular , if it is in the Hogan .
it is amazed by an overwhelming majority in the national republico nerb in a democratic state .
his approval of his waiver is a better position among the 50 countries in the country .
it is not an unthinkable response to the foresight .
he has led to a firm firm in the state of its own principles .
in addition , it has used the main tool to communicate with its voters on Facebook , for example , after the first time in the chemical system , for example , after the use of chemical uses for the first time .
there is therefore a bricner cow , which is a formal indication of a public forum managed by the staff of taxpayers &apos; dollaris , which is being managed by the workers who have been able to visit the taxpayers &apos; dollaris unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
the Minsk press representative in The Washington Prosecutor &apos;s interview in The Hague , claiming that the blocking of comments was not something else as modestly .
it is too simple , however , to get the picture online across the Internet border controls , spam or hatred full of the population .
the post has been blocked by several other people whose Hogan was blocked .
and that is what they are in the same way , who interact with their elected leaders , with a teacher , the owner of the company and pastor , not on the internet .
they all have said that their comments were respectful , thought and not the Roma .
Mr Sversiquoted from his postal services , by underlining the Catholic car of Hogan .
Marylant Bowie Bowie Bowie a lawyer , Sarma Rama Raman Sarma Raman , did not instil hatred , but on the quite angry of crime .
&quot; I welcomed the courtesy that I am disappointed , because it has not reacted to hate crimes or other recent news , &apos; he wrote the &apos; mail news &apos; with the comments of the report .
&quot; nor do I do not like the idea that , if there are many people who comment on the same subject , some of it will be an indifference to collective efforts , rather than recognising that this is a great deal of concern with citizens . &quot;
what the Governor of the janer officials called &apos; A &apos; spam attack &apos; , would probably call for other words &apos; public support &apos; .
the message of Facebook era allows the messages to be easily adapted , simply blocking the criticism or deletion of a negative comment .
it is a lot of cleaner than the old when it had to be sent out by workers , so that they collect the newspapers in the newspapers , and to burn them or arrest those protesting and forced them to remain silent .
but this is exactly what is happening now , simply digitally .
it is not the first official , who is criticised on Facebook and other social media with tooth .
President Trumpi has complained to court Twitter by users who have been blocked by Twitter by users .
one of the first signs of court decisions on this subject was the previous week Virginias .
the US circular judge , James C. Cacheri decided , in Alexandria , decided that Loudouni was represented by the Committee on the Constitution for the first revision of the Constitution , if he blocked the election on Facebook page .
in Koocky , ACTA visited Facebook and Twitter as well as by Governor Matt Bevintis ( R ) .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , there was a cost of affordable services than the Internet .
between 1776 to 1800 , the number of newspapers and the anonymous letters were quadrupled in the newspaper and the anonymous letters were made by his leadership .
and even then , Washington was supposed to have to live with the anonymous border .
people wrote letters from a pseudo @-@ pack like God , Mr Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , in Washington &apos;s decisions .
in the framework of the collection of the website by George Washington , a series of historic documents will be carried out according to the cabinet to petition , which was criticised by a British friendship , trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain .
but he did not forced them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , special opinions and debates are the foundations of our country .
and the right management means acceptance .

he wants to give the Jokowl to make sure that , in addition to the threat posed by people in Paniai , they are suffering from the poor in education and health due to the threat of the army .
according to Gobai , the people of Paniai must , as others , have been given the voice of the Paniai , as well as the voice of Mr Jokowi , which he has to pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &apos; says he .
despite fears and intimidation , families who have been shot in Paniai , families of the last symbolic of the victims were made by a police force of one victim to the military and the military in the country .

if you have ended , a common masses of the protein was lost in the middle of the city .
we are creating a Troy gallery where , together with all images , what our photographs have tried during the Weeko three days .
you certainly have some of them , you are looking for themselves !
for the first time , Mr Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet , the first time will be discussed .
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mory Garcia , who should have a collision track to face the most sowning boys in the near future to 66.7 kg of the longest in the coming term , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in LOS Angelein the Office in LOS Angelec , until the Garcia , the winner of the World Boacon Councili , has thrown out a corridor to the second running of a corridor , in order to welcome Lomachenk , the World Boac&apos;s , the World Boacon .
following the unanimous decision of the Garcia consensus , the victory of the former Aen Broner Adrien Brondifferent , both militants Aen Brondifferent , both militants , and both militants , are being considered to be considered .
Mr Garcia gave a better hand and said : &apos; how does it go , the champion ?
I would like to take progress . &quot;
Mr Lomachenko is protected by Mr Miguel Marriv on Saturday evening of the ESPN @-@ EU .
if a couple of photographs were present , Lomachenko pointed out by Mrs Eg Klimas , that it would be possible for the opposition to the opposition to the opposition . &quot;
&quot; I have a former dense , &apos; one of the Garcia .
&quot; for the Member States , I have received &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so large .
I am low for 63.5 kg .
I want to move below .
and he has to move towards a lighter approach &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the games have wished it .
let us tell them that . &quot;
Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
what raised the question , whether looking at it should be paid . it is part of its strategy that he wants to allow the Lomachenl to be put to the end of this year &apos;s debate , to make a period of 61.2 kg of this year , in order to make a meeting possible for the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 novans ) who are also interested in combating Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbell &apos; .
&quot; looking at this battle could be a return , because fans have wanted it , &apos; said Garcia , saying later that he is open to the fight against any channel that offers the best financial package .
&quot; we are key players .
none of the other name is unable to receive so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &apos;
Mr Garcia said that he has to call &apos; troops &apos; in Lomachenkot &apos; and may go to a look at his Saturday .
however , Lomachenko was modest in approving Garcia , saying that he believes that three diets from the Riverter have seen a very slow @-@ term initiative ; sorry , Mr Mme wanted it to &apos; .
according to Garcia , the aim was to show strength and then to go down .
both confirmed that they feel that they are growing to the strength of the tension .
&quot; this is the fight for the realisation of the realisation .
none of the other confrontation is not so much attention and the summer .
I am more than prepared to work on this , &apos; Mr Garcia .
Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters and the Mesiy .
this is a good fight . &quot;
what world is moving on Estonia to move ?
the soil extended and issued a record of the police and border guards ( PPA ) in a record of 13 000 third @-@ country nationals who , mostly in Estonia have travelled to work , learn to study or family .
for example , when the soil has been decided on fixed @-@ term residence permits to be issued 6702 foreigners , the figure was 4928 .
the authorities do not know how much immigrants finally remain in Estonia , but this analysis will be drawn up by the Ministry of Internal Affairs .
the figure of nearly 500 Ukrainians per year ago in Estonia , when almost 500 Ukrainians per year ago , will start to reach a number of 2000 .
the number of authorisation for authorisation has increased exponentially in the wake of the Ukrainian crisis , in 2014 , in a period of 10 @-@ year @-@ term residence permits , a year ago .
in Estonia , we will increase the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia , the fact that the number of Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than 850 Ukraine &apos;s citizens arrived in Estonia .
the Ukrainian community has had a great deal of time in Estonia , and in the face of difficult circumstances , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are being sought in a country where the community and many of the family are already facing a country where the community and many of the families are already facing .
the large number of Ukrainians who have received fixed residence permits and the island was an open @-@ term residence permit even though , over 10 years , the most recent days of residence permits have been issued .
if the Ukrainians come here to work , Russia &apos;s citizens from family migration .
&quot; in view of this historic Russian community , they are more likely to have the most likely family ties with people living in Russia , &apos; said the Internal Protection of the Interior , Mrs Helina in Helina .
&quot; if you look at where the Russian citizens who have been able to live in the residence permit , then the East Viruland is immediately , after all of the East Virsland , is in the Annex he , and pointed out that around 40 % of them have been helpless in the European Union .
the Multi @-@ term residence permit received a fixed @-@ term residence permit , which is also a record of a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians did not want to extend the number of Russians .
&quot; Hype is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , the new permit for residence permit permanent authorisation has been adopted , explained by the Ministry of the Interior Representative , Ramon , which says , the Russian citizen &apos;s interest in Estonia has remained stable for many years .
in Estonia , at least three years , there will be at least three years of foreign access to a permanent permit for residence permit .
it is aimed at encouraging the emergence of people to adapt to it .
however , a long @-@ term resident permit requires five years .
the new residence permit has also been reduced by the old extension of the old residence permit .
for example , it was granted a residence permit for an 146 Ukrainians who have been working here at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to switch to the work and the Estonian state will no longer be the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit became popular - applicants for the soil in the event of a bad passport ( 1029 ) , the Russians ( 487 ) , individuals ( 54 ) and niges ( 36 ) .
in the end of Estonia living in Estonia to live on the basis of a residence permit for 1968 , there are still 23 mayors , 12 Egyptians , 18 gEgypties and the same many Chinese people .
this year , the total number of applicants for such applicants will already be 1269 .
in the 10 years , there has been a surprise in Nigeria , which citizens are among the more active applicants for the Estonian residence permit .
if three residence permits were issued in 2007 , there are 200 200 .
in Nigeria , there is a lesson to be learned in the universities in the university .
Estonia is more popular , for example , for Georgians , the Chinese and the Turks , the Chinese and the Turks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has largely increased thanks to the students .
for them , too , the rule applies to where there is a community that has arisen , more easily to other words , in the Annex .
in ten years , there are two people who have moved in Estonia , for example , for example from North Korea , as much as Laos and Madagascar .
ten people have come here in Cuba , 231 South Korea , 40 in Indonesia and four Uruguay .
if a living permit can be around 6 000 citizens per year , it is about 0.46 % of the total population .
even if the citizens of the European Union , the citizens of the European Union , will remain about a percentage of the &apos; , &apos; , in fact , that the figures are , in fact , the figures .
according to the statistics agency , according to Estonia , there were 14 822 people in Estonia , with 13 792 .
this means that immigration has exceeded the second year for emigration .
most of the age and contributors are Estonian citizens , but more are those who are leaving them .
it was therefore a bubble for the citizens of Estonia &apos;s migration secrecy 2000 .
Ukrainians , particularly with the exception of Finland and Estonia .
Couture printing ssimmage of Couture has been lumped in a few cases , tigers and ttop .
the North @-@ West Bank , however , is the history of Maria Tammeoru , the old ones and defendants : &apos; I can dream of hours somewhere at the museum and the old theft of the past .
if there is nothing to go with you , you will study and learn about it every day .
this is a joy .
the world of Coukons , the world of Couture , can appear to some of some lives , but the designer does not think .
you yourself , if you have a great deal of your life .
I have a friend , who has been able to have a bottle of the habit of those who have been created in my way , which has been created .
because , and this is not his fault , that he does not live in the Netherlands and does not go into red days every day , he wants them to carry out the most beautiful vars and who is suffering .
you themselves live in their own life .
the artist does not recognise the gap between the events and hall of the events .
this is the reasoning that led to a plan to lead the plan in Estonia to land places in Estonia , forests and fields , the people , the people , the people who often do not get .
Mlong collects , for example , was presented for example by comparison , Jidvis and Castile , where 45 modell was held with the King of 45 modelles .
in Tallinn , there is often a pob in the face of a dignity , but elsewhere , emotions are more emotion , slogvo , rise , want to be thanked .
a large part of the audience had to be just as news , but now they are Mouture fans at Couture .
if you are over the expectations of people , they are spirited !
and I like this feeling that I am in my motto as if the summer .
on the occasions , we had a red @-@ metre of 50 metres , a whole modern distance with you , seemed that they did not end .
Maria Maria does not recognise the motive so that the creation of the creation must be presented by a super super supermoll , he will have good ordinary women .
I often call on our own customers - they have always been happy .
this is , after all , the experience , the harvest in the Laval stage in a fine way .
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen its play , always behind it , and I am not always behind it in order to give things a final piece of things as a father .
my nervous would not allow us to look at calmly .
Maria is this kind of moelty and who do not want only the role played by representative role , but in everything else it had to be involved .
I have had my admiration , for most of the collections , by the majority of collections .
I like the whole process where you play the details with the details .
I will never be able to do with our animal , and I am not afraid .
it is not limited to any matter , as well as intelligent , logistics , organisation , organisation - all of us need to be able to go away from one stamp in the same way .
they are still enormously in a way of working hours for fanatics .
I will not be able to say when my working day ends , for me it is simply full of joy .
I have been very lucky - that is as an unstoppless fortune : I am doing something fine , a man can be something fine and again , in turn .
several times have been said that my broker is in the countryside - they make it felt .
the sensitimatic jewelles , which Mrs Maria talent has done overnight to hear , is a signal of Couture to date .
Martin Myrsep U18 pos : sleeping turnout for children has now been turned away with us .
the damage , the mud , was running out .
it was the first thing that we did not get in the hands of my desk .
and if there is a major difference in the table , there is nothing to do with &apos; , &apos; no comment , &apos; , with the exception of 61 from the UK to Britain : 75 bearable Britain , the only NBSBA has played a repetition of the first NBSBA , BC Kalev / Cramo State Martin Myrseg .
opponents took an attack on 28 people , with a lot more attacks on this basis .
we were not prepared to protect them as aggressive , and it was created .
many of the children &apos;s attacks ended up by three to five seconds , we were not able to create protection .
however , they have been defended , however , every side between them , we could not combine .
it created a team from his feet .
the anti @-@ domestic work has been better done .
the Myrkapa estimates that the Estonian levy is expected to do more tactical errors in order to make the battle against eos .
the last quarter of the last quarter - we had a mistake , but there were already many quick corners .
Inducing and close our close silence , which was a weapon in our weaponry , now , all of us , addressed all of us .
today we have no power against them .
Myrlap remained negligible and Kaleves , Matthias Tass .
in general , the security transplant can be said to have good words to date , a single blow to this day .
it is a pity that , in the past , we have already met with an aggressive response .
the whole time has been in self @-@ confident and playing today , but it seemed that he had been tired - he has suffered a very large burden .
but he made a fine leap in some of you , which I have seen in the past half of what I have seen in the past .
the terrible number of the terrible figures : neo @-@ minated cors of EM EM to three waters less than 10 points ...
in the 1818 age class , only a pension scheme B is not just about B B @-@ divisir Tallinn , Mr Maystadt , started in Dublin in Dublin .
and Estonia play , unfortunately , in the area of anti @-@ missile corners .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but after a third quarter , there was 9 : 49 of the last few minutes against gas pedab , and it was a period left in a number of 16 : 16 .
for the first instance , both in the second quarter of Estonia , the third point ...
however , at the beginning of the Estonians hit at the beginning of two minutes , two pieces of first tense have been made , but there is a figure of 25 pieces , one of the trialogues , and then 21 .
perhaps , in an almost half hour , 47 celebrations were at a taboo .
in addition , 2 points had to be referred to in 4 .
the number of losses was a sensible number of this time , 12 .
Poland was in the end of the game of 33 and Estonia for 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , opening on day , to recognise Portugal &apos;s 83 : 56 better .
NATO vessels took up in Tallinn to supplement their stocks
today , from 1 May , NATO was a permanent mine group for a week in Tallinn , on a visit to the port of Tallinn in order to supplement the stocks of ships and prepare for the available habits .
in the event of smoking , ships are preparing for the seabed and provide a team for the possibility of paarial holiday .
after the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of habits and to be ready for operations for future historical remnants .
&quot; the participation of children in NATO in local waters , and the interoperability of their activities in local waters , is a good illustration of our integration with the forces of the international forces , &quot; said the fleet crossing of the military and planning of the operations and planning fleet crossing the tasks of the Sea .
since from 29 June , NATO @-@ 1 Captenant General Gvido Laudupe Gvido Laudupe , who took place in Riia at a ceremony in Riga in the ceremony on the government of Estonia &apos;s naval officers in a ceremony that took place in Riga in a ceremony .
the group &apos;s flag vessels have been appointed to LVNS Virsata and LVNS , which will also act as a group &apos;s stap .
in this semester , Estonia is also part of the coastal state of the Sea , which is a minefield in Estonia .
the EU @-@ wide naval group of vessels in the four countries of NATO &apos;s naval management group is a permanent mine @-@ response group , which is a permanent mine @-@ response group , which can be sent out in five days in different parts of the world .
4 . - On 13 August , Pirita will become the Pirir muptery in Pirita once again , where 13 years ago , the Tuler Kans have been called up to Birgitta Festival .
this year , the Festival , the Festival of Birgitta , will be a leader of the artistic leadership of Tallinn ( 36 ) , according to a fine , powerful and unprecedented one .
Boost Joost : Cuba will end up with a &quot; Traviata &quot; and &apos; Tosca &apos; , &apos; Traviata &apos; and &apos; Tosca &apos; , &apos; balls &apos; answers to the &apos; Bolerok &apos; , &apos; Bolerok &apos; , and also does not lack the scheme , which is , if Joseph Hayddn is a wonderful oraissance of Mr Haydn , &apos; Aastaad &apos; , which has been the case with Mr Haydn &apos;s mourner , the &apos; Eastadays &apos; , in 2015 , which led to Pirita Haydn &apos;s Haydn &apos; Haydn &apos; .
there is much more than the Festival of Burma if the concerns and theatre answers .
this is greater than any music in any form .
this is the festival , which will take power and never be completely distracted .
because experience , which can be heard and in a cross @-@ border environment , makes human soul , and it concerns the human side in a way which is not possible to describe it .
for the first year , there are the art leader of the arts at Burma for the first year .
is it not a little bit of btro Etre Khark , who has not seen a little bit .
of course , as I had a very personal relationship , however , as I had a very personal relationship , it has been helpful .
it has been carried out by my student career and also supported a career in the early career .
perhaps it is very much easier for me to continue his work .
in the various Klas , the Festival team in Birgitta Festival has done so much and , of course , it is all about to me .
it was excellent to join teams who know exactly how things go .
it has also been a great coal by Mrs Kharme , who also gave me the strength to go with the Festival in Tallinn in a good way to Burma .
and here I am now and I can start .
what could be drawn up by the audience in the Festival , which you have in particular to offer ?
what we have with artists from the country , Latvia , Lithuania , and surprisingly , as a museer , the first piece of balles , written by Mrs Lindgreni .
it is &apos; Karlsson lent &apos; .
and one of the criminal sanss of this House is that the balleauthor has been held in Latvia &apos;s composer , Juris , Karlsons , who had its desire to sign it .
he has already lived in the Carlsson of the Carlnes potato .
how do you know what you know about everything ?
thanks to my support , I certainly will certainly be able to support .
this work needs a good idea and a lot of love , and I am thankfully with the accumulation of it .
and I have noticed that my personal emotions have not been dependent on the other people , as I am perhaps going to do with any new day , if I am not going to go against any new day .
and I am well aware of the tone of the tone , the preservation of the positive nature and , in fact , the self @-@ employed of ourselves in the morning , raised significantly my percentage of my happiness .
in particular , this week , when the most important tests are , I have been very keen to exercise this , and it works .
self @-@ privatisations of the activist , and it will increase the tone .
that is not just a word .
I think that people do not yet know the things that the universe offers to them , but everyone itself will slowly be able to do it .
as soon as it is concerned , it is a moment .
it is also a case of a rivalry before a digeny before the digeny ?
there is still a rivalry to switch to more comfort .
this is a small moment of selfishness .
however , in general , yes , I am not the opportunity to do so , before there is a great deal of infony .
in fact , I even like to actively communicate with the people , even before the diatric took place .
but get everything on the Festival here , which has also been discovered , not particularly for the great oe and balleep .
see a moderate video on the front @-@ to Joova .
new results of the Evaluation tests published by Swedish applicants were published
among the applicants in Sweden , it was carried out among the applicants in which the latest results were assessed by the most innovative approach in medical . the latest results show that more than 80 % of the two @-@ ten per parent were assessed by parents than 18 , but not all do not believe any clarification .
the Swedish Institute of Justice ( RCAN ) , the Swedish Institute of Justice , started the test of the beginning of this year .
the tests were set up during the application of an age @-@ based application period after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Migration ) Agency ( Migration / verging ) , which has not succeeded in criticising the age of many allegations of minors .
as far as the migration process has now been carried out by migration , 6880 cases , and the Institute of CT , have issued a total of 24 81 cases from mid @-@ March to 31 July by the middle of March 2017 .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) , 18 @-@ year @-@ old or more than 25 cases were assessed in the case of the age of 18 and 25 cases , so that the test &quot; may be 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older . &quot;
in the 432 case , the fact was that the person is &apos; probably more young &apos; .
the tests are used only if the person &apos;s age is a question mark .
at the same time , Johan Göransson &apos;s Institut , which worked in the case of medicine , is consistent with those of the previous months .
&quot; we do not see a major difference between the statistics in previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &apos; he said he said &apos; The Local .
the fact that the vast majority of cases were assessed by parents in the 18 , no necessarily mean that applicants have failed to choose their age .
the Institute was issued in May by the results of 581 tests and said that there are references to the fact that the person being investigated is 18 @-@ year @-@ old or age . &quot;
however , if the author of the Svensson Group examined the results of their 581 tests , the results of these 581 tests , the fact that there was a person in 243 in the case of 18 .
the medical age assessment method , in which wisdom has been made , is carried out by MRos and fields by MRV by MRL , and then they will be used to analyse the tooth doctors and radiologists , have been criticised in some circles .
one of the sceptics is the Institute of Aklinska Institute , Mr Marcus , whose tasks include the evaluation of human activities in order to identify whether they were able to negotiate with the audiences in the past or later on .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this , and I do not think that the method used now should be used .
the designation of biological age is very uncertain .
if we do not firmly have to say , we should not be able to do , &apos; he said that we can , &apos; he said &apos; the Metro .
however , in Johan Göransson &apos;s Institute of CT , we defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; generally can say that the inaccuracies of the child &apos;s inaccurate adult risk is a small risk .
the most perhaps about 10 % , if a person is a little less than 18 . &quot;
9 signs that you were deceived to a more forgiant talent .
a more expensive return on the blue and water by someone else .
the Sul is wrong , because you have a great deal of good times and recall .
they would forgive him , but will it be the time ...
Mr Your Tango lists of nine signs , which show that you have a little bit more than their own , and could give it to him .
a more expensive situation seems to understand the seriousness of the situation , and it has worked hard to resolve it .
a more expensive one is dealing with a problem which , in other words , a stream of flows .
you are no longer in a position of defence .
he regrets , sincerely and will take responsibility for their actions .
he is not trying to blame for your behaviour .
he agrees that it has made a serious mistake and , sincerely , trying to improve the situation .
he is attentive and trying to communicate with you .
at the same time , he was rushed to get on the matter .
they do not deny what has happened and will not be trying to make it unnoticed .
the fact that you have a more expensive understanding of the fact why you have been faithful to your question .
you are talking about this and how to avoid this in the future .
better communication and evaluation of each other needs .
in the cost of more expensive attitudes and actions , it has helped to develop its condolences against its misconception .
our commitment and behaviour has created a basis for your proximity and the behaviour that you are going to have .
you have made progress in order to believe again in your unity and relations .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old response , Anna Maria Orel , made the London MMil , the London MMil has made a good debate , with 67.37377 .
Mr Orel was the MM nom , and a pro @-@ woman was rejoice in the future , that it hopes to fight for meddling in the future .
the contest was well and I received a good experience .
with the first test ( 64.80 ) , I did not turn the average result immediately , in the second ( 62.80 ) , too much and the third ( 67.37 ) I have been able to see clear &apos; , &apos; said Orel , after the competition .
I had my own emissions and I am very pleased that I found it .
Mrs Oreli MM came to an end to a good 18 @-@ time debate .
Mr Orelit has not been confused , because he will carry out the TTSs in the winter .
&quot; I am afraid &apos; , he said , he said small mud .
in London &apos;s Olympic Games , there was almost a full house of the people , whether the Orel of the people of Orel , or who was able to switch itself off ?
I was in a positive sense , but in a positive sense .
everyone is saying that this will give it , so that it is .
if itself , then , it can be experienced .
Mr Orel assured that the MM dispute and it is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here 32nd of the season , which was an end in 18 last year .
this is a very proper result .
I am 20 years and MMil - this is the only one that counts .
I take a good experience and , on some day , I want to compete with the medals .
Western Virgina @-@ Governor announced by party exchanges
the Governor of the West Virginia , the Governor of the West Virginia , on a Thursday evening , together with President Trumper , that he will change the party .
&quot; this or not , but democrats walking away from my July , &apos; said the Governor of the Justice .
&quot; I say to you , having done a great deal of ball and thought ... today I say to you , in the West , that I cannot help you in a democratic fashion . &apos;
the plantations in the name of the joy of blends .
&quot; it will therefore be possible for me to be republicised tomorrow .
&quot; I would like to say to you that it is time to play a second game . &quot;
in the past , it has pledged a great deal of announcement in the meeting of the West Virginia .
the Trug won 42 points in the West Virginias , and Justice did not support the appointment of the Alliance of Democrats for the Alliance of Democrats in the Alliance .
the right to justice , which is the Forder of the State state , proved to be elected in 2016 .
in the Ford , it notes that it belongs in five countries in the fifth of the coal @-@ mining , and it is pretty much on its own .
his value is around USD 1.59 billion .
at the same time , the republics of the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) , on a Thursday evening , that the party exchange of &apos; Governor of Justice Justice &apos; is another blow to the democratic improvement of the country , rather than would like to make it possible to make it easier for the country to work . &quot;
&quot; just 15 months , and control over the countries of the lowest number - Governor of the state of Justice in the history of the &apos; Justice &apos; statement is simply the most recent word of saying what is the case to you , which is the case to the end of the end , and that the message that combines the message &apos; said RNC McDaniel Daniel Daniel Daniel Daniel BS &apos; said , Mr McDaniel Daniel Daniel Daniel KBS , &apos; McDaniel Daniel Daniel KBS &apos; .
there is no surprise that where there is a lot of people , there are also many injured .
the Weekle of Weeky medical teline has said yesterday , saying that there has been a record of the posters in order to have a poster to have the posters .
azks and marches are fundamental , sulphur and easy fall .
of course , too , it also - and foot - and foot .
according to Urmewas , the visitors will come to the festival with false footwear and the problems come from .
the media have also had to assist people in a couple of injuries - there have been some of the panic and also one of the feet .
we have also done a sister if someone has done a hand or the finger at the hands of the person .
we are going to get smaller traffic here , greater we are sending a hospital .
see whether solemn media would be asking for irrigation of pathogens in the media .
Mr Coe has approved an honest apology for the Russians in doping .
international rallies in the Sebastoeffect Sebastian Coe , with the Sebastian Coe Coe , has been accepted by the father of Russia &apos;s Thursday , but repeated that it is not time to allow the country to return sport .
Russia &apos;s lightlation of Dmitry Shycehtin , Shycehtin Shycehtin , has said that it has taken place on the basis of the IAC Congress , that the ban on the competition imposed by his country is the right and it is determined to fight doping .
he apologised on all the lights of the &apos; every class &apos; , who has missed the golden and silver medals in competition . &apos;
despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of leaving the ban on the entry into force , which was introduced in November 2015 , following the report by the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) report by the state @-@ sponsored doping in Russia .
&quot; I believe that this was a very fair response today , a very fair presentation , &apos; the President of the IAAF &apos; , the President of the IAEA .
&quot; the whole Council and the Congress were satisfied that Russia was also recognised by Russia itself , so that they have had quite complicated times and they do all of the Union &apos;s restructuring . &quot;
it was also pleased that it was accepted by Russia to accept the criterion of anticipating the criterion .
&quot; I believe that today , a very constructive day and progress is taking place , but Congress supports the proposal for a working group that is not the right time to re @-@ withdraw Russia , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; we need to do everything possible in the next few months to normalise the situation .
we have always met the principle that we want to be able to obtain a breach of the system , &apos; added it &apos; in Annex .
in the light of the small @-@ Russian population , who will meet the strict criteria of the IAEA , on Friday , in London , the global championship of neutral athletes will compete with neutrality .
the Head of the Rune Andersen , Rune Andersen , on Monday , said that Russia does not comply with a number of predictions .
following a presentation by the IAEA to the Council , in London , he said to journalists in London that doping is still insufficient and has still been operating freely .
the electric car Revolution makes a significant contribution to the demand .
who is the winners and losers ?
the fact that the electric car Revolution makes a significant difference to the fuel market up to infrastructure , it will also create a new winners and losers .
although the horrors like Gleno can say that in one place they will win and lose , then the smaller ones will not help .
at the moment , Glencore coal and oil , but in the era of electricity cars , there is growing cobalt , copper , aluminium and nikis .
this year , the decisions of the electricity cars have increased the decisions of the UK , France and Norway , who allow for a ban on the sale of fossil fuels to new cars in the coming decades .
we have therefore already informed the Volvo aware that they intend to abandon the inland combustion engine and the Tesla will bring the market on the market with a cheaper state of electricity .
Banimal berg , according to New Energy Finance forecasts , is already sold over two decades to electric cars , more than cars produced in electricity .
&quot; some of the parts of metals make it all &apos; , the Capital Policy , Simona Gambranini Banimal @-@ berg Bfauna .
we have already seen a major impact on such metals , such as cobalt and lilium , which is a demand for years .
the electricity car is about three times more than more than usual cars , the Glencore .
moreover , there is a need for recharging stations , which is why the Exquer BNP Paris will increase demand for around five per cent by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional litres , cobalt , graphite and man @-@ in @-@ man .
the main profits of electric cars in the world can increase the price of electric cars , and that there is the world &apos;s largest cobalt , the forecast producer in Jeffently .
it concludes that it is estimated that there is a shift in the victorious car car race to the McMoMoRan and First @-@ European Minerth Minerms .
the market will respond to changing trends .
this year , there has been 70 per cent of 70 % in London .
the price increase was 37 per cent .
there has also been 14 % of this year &apos;s calendar , mainly because of economic growth .
Glencore shares in London rose by 20 per cent , having exceeded the price rise by rival Rio Tinto Group , BHP Bilonon and Anglo , as well as .
on the part of the manufacturers , companies are engaged in lead , such as Recyclex and Campine , who must adapt to the new era .
the ultimate use of the Pliar @-@ end @-@ use of petrol and diesel engines is equipped with batteries .

&quot; this is a serious risk for lead to lead requirements when it finds itself intended to overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said the Bank of the Bank of America as well as by Michael Widmer Lynchi , the Bank of the Bank of America .
in the form of price migration , it is not yet a way of roll @-@ out on the impact of the fallout .
the Plii is 17 % this year , while this is the best metamed by the main industrial metals in London .
investors see problems from metal only far from the future .
&quot; I am not sure that lead is a bad thing , because cheap oil will keep ordinary cars in competition &apos; , said Herwig &apos;s company in Triland Metals , Mr Herwig .
if demand falls , it will slowly take place .
it can be the case for around 10 years .
in the meantime , stricter emissions of exhaust gases mean that the demand for hybrid and more frequent engines will be increased by the demand for advanced engines , the international lead and an organisation of research .
Kergmetalgraphs like aluminium substitutes , because let us get a car to go beyond the less electricity .
this has already been explained by 2013 @-@ 2016 , an additional 1.6 million tonnes of demand until 2013 .
this represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s product of aluminium .
this trend is expected to deepen , Widmer said .
Aluminium is 13 per cent of this year , since the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to the market deficit .
the steel producers do not .

there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also lead to the suffering .

this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will become the 15 years .
Saatinators believe continued demand for a diesel hybrid good .
Marc Grynberg , head of prime head , said that the 2025 will continue to be sold in 2025 , more than more hybrid cars .
the great hope of the production manufacturers in 10 years is Toyota Motors , and Mr Motosi have developed cars based on hydrogen @-@ based cars , which are dependent on possessing in order to produce hydrogen .
however , this technology , however , has not yet been justified by the technology .
&quot; DiA seems to have a clear chaos on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Expo BNP Paris in Brunen .
German car manufacturers had a major setback in July , because the Stuttgart Court was banned in the printing city of diesel , Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche .
how football will affect the transition from Neymari to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the invent of European football clubs are not stopping Somo World record transition from Spain from the French football clubs in the Paris club in the French club of the Barcelona Paris @-@ Saint main .
any consequences as UEFA , the governing body , which is within the European game and in which teams are able to prohibit the participation of the Chaprestier Meister Measures , the Paris KSaint Germatis will still be able to be banned .
the financial rules laid down by UEFA in 2011 ( FFP ) mean that the PSG will have to demonstrate that the transition from Neymari was funded without a huge loss .
EUR 222 million ( EUR 262 million ) were paid for , so that the Brazilians were buying up , and Mr Neymari &apos;s pay is beginning to go to tens of millions of dollars per year .
there are some financial aspects of the presence of Neymari French clubs .
the PSG is undoubtedly possible to take advantage of the money to go to Somder , and to add such money to the top of their stars , given that the team finances the family in Katar .
in Klubidel , there are plenty of spent spending on players , but they need to balance the legal sources of income that allow them to come up with a football shirt .
Mr Platini , following the appointment of UEFA as President of the UEFA Presidency in 2007 .
this former French player , so that clubs who are going to take progress in large debts in the search for a major debt , in fact , when banks or owners should renounce .
since 2011 , the FFP club club will focus on their losses to be monitored .
this amendment means that the business model that Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 - to buy a club with the potential , and then to make huge costs to make the team better and to create a global brand - it is harder to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period , which runs until 2018 , the club will be able to transfer the club up to EUR 30 million .
and in spite of the fact that the Platini was discredited in 2015 , the presidential office is a disgrace , in his successor , UEFA &apos;s successor , UEFA will continue to commit itself to excessive costs .
&quot; FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly continue to strengthen these rules , &apos; said the previous week on the coup Mr Andrea Traverso , who is UEFA &apos;s FFP with the spectator of FFP .
although the PSG bup for the transfer clause of one of the full disbursement clause , they will be able to distribute the amount of the total contract for the purposes of the contract .
Mr Neymar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it is possible to show the transition from the next five years of EUR 44.4 million .
in the case of the first wave of sanctions for FFP , the PSG , together with Abu Dhab , was the most severe sanctions in Manchester Cityga .
the PSG was appointed by EUR 60 million ( at the moment , at 82 million dollar ) , which were reduced later than 20 million to EUR 20 million , and a club of Measures in the League of Sport for the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of 25 players .
UEFA is looking at the club , who can try to regulate over @-@ regulatory financial institutions , blowing up their income through companies .
this company may have the PSG sponsor , but if sponsorship value is considered to be standard market rates overruns , UEFA would not allow UEFA &apos;s income to take into account .
this happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Qatar tourism is the value of the value of the support of the G20 .
it has been said that some of Mrs Neymari &apos;s PSG can come from the management committee of the ACT by 2022 for payments by the GCT .
however , the PSG and the Katar 2022 would deny that Somder could become a world leader since the World Cmpionship and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities can easily identify such manoeuvres .
the penalties imposed before the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
the people are familiar with the word on Thursday , that UEFA has not discussed the transition by UEFA to Someli .
they spoke about the inclusion of the coup , provided that it is guaranteed by anonymity , because they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG .
the latest reports show that the PSG will lead to more than EUR 10 million in 2015 @-@ 2016 as a profit of around € 542.4 million .
the data for the last financial year has not yet been published .
the PSG hopes that the arrival of Somzer arrivals is well @-@ sponsored transactions , freight transport and a label sale .
it looks forward to the conclusion of the agreement with a minimum increase in the amount of a percentage of 30 % .
it is too far too , with a clear irritated from the departure from one of the largest football marks , trying to prevent the transition from Mrs Neymari , claiming that the PSG is in breach of the FP .
&quot; this is a clear case of the &apos; financial doping &apos; case with a club and a country , &quot; said the La List President Javier Tebas , said , by President of Spain , by referring to the fact that the PSG is mainly of the Catatariats .
Arsent Wenger , whose club belongs to the American magnaadi , with a club of American sport , shares the attitude that the country will fund a club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights , and it has completely changed the whole football landscape in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger Thursday .
&quot; if a club belongs to a country , all can be possible .
it is very difficult for the financial rules to be respected , since the country may be other ways or other interests to represent a large player . &quot;

one of the more jobs in Estonia has been calibrated for marine waste , the adhings of the devil .
for example , there must be 400 000 tonnes of coastline , for example , in the course of the coastline .
&quot; this is unbelievable , &quot; notes the Usov .
the second large category of municipal waste is , perhaps , all of which people leave behind .
eight of the secondary kilometres in Stroga &apos;s coasts are eight of the total rubbons , which is needed for three times a week .
so much will arise .
however , there has meant that it has meant that it has a fifth of the rubbish less than otherwise .

the Bank of England will keep an interest rate of 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to see that interest rates remain in the former level , since economic growth and inflation are unmitigated speculation on the rise .
the Bank of England has warned that growth persists , since households have made interest interest rates .
policy @-@ makers of the Bank &apos;s financial policy committee ( MPC ) , the policy @-@ makers of the Bank of 6 : 0.25 % in favour and less members require a rise in this month because the slow growth has weakened the rise in growth .
in its Quartet report , the Bank will cut the forecast of 1.7 % in 2017 and in 2018 , in addition , and warned that household incomes remain , since the autumn is still expected to rise to inflation in 3 % .
at the same time , the Bank also signalled that the increase in inflation in the next few years is the necessary and necessary for the financial markets to curb inflation in the light of the Brexitfrom , which may be necessary in the next few years .
Members voted a year ago , as a result of the Brexti , the part of the partial readmission plan that has been launched as a result of the Brex Package .
the Bank will end up @-@ term finance in February , which provides for the banks cheap money , even though it has now said that GBP 15 billion under this scheme will be expected to be made by GBP 15 billion .
with regard to the decision on the record , the bank is saying : &quot; the main forecast forecast in EPAs remains to remain powerless in the near future , since the difficult situation of households will have a difficult situation in households . &quot;
rates were repeated that there is a need for some efforts to mitigate inflation in order to mitigate inflation &apos; and &apos; somewhat larger &apos; if the markets have been expected .
Mr Börs will forecast the first quarter of the second quarter of the year 2020 and 2020 .
however , the bank stressed that any hythick and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for the next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % of the forecast in May .
the forecast of 1.8 % in 2018 has remained .
it fell by GBP 1 cucumbers to the dollar and the euro .
Nael decreased by 0.5 % of USD 1.31 and 0.4 % of EUR 1.11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointment of the sowers in the recent disappointment , which has raised the increase in the increase in GDP , in the second quarter of 0.2 % of the previous three months , from 0.2 % of the previous three months .
the bank is saying that growth remains at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of this year , it will be a slightly boost .
the latest inflation report by the Bank gave a little reason to rejoice up inflation and wretched wage increases , saying that the situation goes slightly worse before a further improvement .
it was added that the monetary policy cannot be avoided in the coming few years , but the end of the three @-@ year forecast is expected to pay a significant return to wages .
as a result of the sines , the economy will also encourage a growing demand for British production , which will be reimbursed in part of the cost of consumers .
the decision must be taken since the rates were passed in August by 0.25 % after the shock of the EU @-@ i referendum , which caused GBP sudden weakened .
the Bank estimates that there will probably be four years in order to recover prices and to the economy fully .
before the latter last decision was felt by increasing demand for raising the rate , since inflation has increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers have made an increase in 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month compared to the June 2.9 % , although the Bank &apos;s message was expected to be a rise in the coming months .
the bank said that excessive growth compared to 2 % , with a view to the high level of pounds .

you pre @-@ emptency ( PrEP ) are a lethal of HIV medicines , which is taken before the interim order to reduce the risk of HIV @-@ related infections .
the results of clinical trials show that PrEP reduces the risk of HIV transmission rates among people who are affected by the threat of HIV .
the PrEP &apos;s adoption before the interim procedure means a sufficient number of medicinal products that hinder HIV @-@ related infections .
these medicines can be taken every day , or two hours at the latest .
it would include LGBT men , people of LGBans , transgender people and people whose partners are living with HIV to be treated with HIV .

people who live in England and have chosen their family doctor will also be able to participate in the local sex health clinical trials that participate in the programme .
the programme will pay 10 million GBP 10 million and NHS is signed by the Treaty in order to get the medicines this week after international procurement procedures .
the pilot attempt is to assess the actual potential of the PrEP , by gathering clinical evidence to whom the medicine is used and how it will be used in a large scale .
Stevens said : &apos; this new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and boost the fight against the proliferation of HIV .
this is another milestone in the long @-@ term fight for mankind on one of the largest health issues in the world . &quot;
Debord gold , NAT Executive Board , said : &apos; this is a turning moment in the fight against HIV .
the PrEP , if this was correctly taken to those who need and are at risk of risk , offers an opportunity to make England HIV epidemics .
since September , people in England have access to a powerful new tool , through a clinical attempt to have access to a powerful new tool which is individually managed and depends on the negotiations with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian CEO of the Terrence I said : &apos; I am first of a priority to ensure that the clinical test is postponed and that no HIV group should be postponed and that no HIV group should be excluded .
now , when the PrEP Platform &apos;s clinical test is to be carried out , we are on the way we will be able to protect more than 10 000 people who are experiencing a risk to HIV .
the Minister for Public Health , Sharon Hodgson , said : &apos; PrEP @-@ i clinic tests are very welcome and a great deal of late delays and invention of the government &apos;s shoes .
evidence shows how big changes can be brought to an end to the spread of prevention of HIV prevention and the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will lead to a step closer to the PrEP advantages of the PrEP advantages .
it is important now that the clinical test should be introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV , and to bring us a step closer to the stopping of HIV spreading in society . &quot;

in fact , they can actually create a desire not to leave , as happened in Joanne .
the Jensen is a great deal of Arabic chvellkull in Chicago , which is going to compete with a fellow Member in the wake of the Sicago .
no other than the amount of money that has been sourced to be forgotten by any kind of ethics .
in my wife and three children , man only see man @-@ owned and late evening .
in the first half of the film , I think that it is &apos; the &apos; business world &apos;s version &apos; , even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler , is similar to .
however , what the film is going on , however , as an element of a little less fearful houses , and the moralising intention of film @-@ makers remains and more than ever .
life @-@ changing experience can be seen at a pocket @-@ ill @-@ disease phenomenon .
there is now a choice between working and family life .
the pog of executive office puts a father from his feet in Chicago on the big buildings to think of the very important buildings , as religion , love , love ... , non @-@ empt of the disaster even is not the case .
after the third , where the son &apos;s father is opening up , there is a feeling that the film @-@ makers have certainly been able to obtain the objective of the audience , because even the most of the heart of the view is unable to keep the suffering of a doctor in cancer , with a view to preventing the suffering of the baby cancer .
if the pog is falling into and his situation , the father will be able to understand the father , and he will be able to understand his work , and it is doing a good thing to do so .
I now come in a sense of self @-@ betting , if it is in the form of a filter , then you will reward his cutency after the film , when I am wrong , then at least one surprises would be applauded .
there will be a suspicion for a moment that the residual coffee should be met without the use of the spouse and a man in a lethne corridor in a motorway .
however , the Poeg is perfectly healthy , and although his father has lost its father , it will prove a positive thing because it is now time to deal with family .
I can also feel well - I can end up with the end of the American drama .
in fact , the film is well designed , all the elements that are necessary for this .
there can be a baby , an actor is good and morality : the money is not the most important in life .
this film is very well added .
the new &apos; new staff &apos; of staff will be able to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can also start .
it would be the first .
Politico writes , the policy of political tico , that the new staff of the White House will be able to limit President Trumpin , including news , in the hope that it will keep the gap in the stock .
there are reports here from Josh Dawsel :
&quot; if the new staff of the White House in John Füle , Mr Kelly , on the first day , he received high @-@ level officials , he pointed out the key issue Donald Trumpi Valty Maneeded , which he intends to resolve in the hands of the President , in the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly said that the information must move through , whether on paper or meetings , because the President would make better decisions if it is shared with good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly , it seems perfectly logical , but others have tried , and they have been trying to shoot the Trumpi in his media control .
the ratio of the President Trumpi &apos;s relationship with television amounts to decades and now , when he is in Valo Maneeded , his TV watch has not gone off .
&quot; if the applicant was in Trug in the media following the unfair media record , it was shown to show him that he was involved in the declaration of the impact that he was concerned , &quot; the former campaign called Nunberg Sam Nunberg in February .
Politico tara Palmas wrote at the time that &apos; six @-@ former campaigns &apos; , according to the &apos; six @-@ former campaign &apos; , is a key to the management of the Trumpi Twitter as a key to ensuring that he has a personal media consumption in a stable manner . &quot;
it is good .
however , the idea that Trumpi &apos;s use habits have never been under &apos; control &apos; , is ridiculous .
perhaps they are aware of the campaigns that the rest of us are not aware of the fact that Trumpi would not be aware of the birth of the Trumpi , without their intervention .
we will probably not have to be aware of the utter charges that did not have issued a bundle .
if he was able to save whether or a couple of bankers who were able to save them , they were worth doing so .
however , no one has been able to obstruct Trumpi consistently from creating controversy .
part of the problem is that , in the Valty Main Main , who has been in competition , people are not only trying to promote their own interests , by sending out the walls of Truthe , which will support the Olympic interests of their world &apos;s views , but perhaps not always credible .
as a whole , policy @-@ tico wrote a adviser to the President in May of the tendency to provide a strategic approach to the President in May .
one of the examples described by Mrs Shane artificially is the next :
&quot; the current and former Trug will say that Trug can respond to the negative press , particularly with the adverse impact on information , explosive information , explosive , taking off the source of their source of origin .
this has also happened at the end of February , when someone gave a loss to a copy of the copies of the Internet provocation by Charles C. Johnson , a website belonging to the GotNews.com article , which blamed the staff of the staff of Mrs Wallis , that he was a White House for a series of information about the White House . &quot;
there is no distinction that in Johnson , as a result , Twitter was blocked or that he did not provide any concrete evidence or that he has made a mistake in the past and withdrawn them .
in Trug luges , Article and took place in Wales . &quot;
Goldmarcher added that the latter will be the case for the Reports and the White House of the White House in Rob Porter , Rob Porter , has tried to establish a system for managing and documentation of Trumpin . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same .
perhaps it will be a privilege of more efficient leadership , but the Trug is still an impulse and that it continues to have an impact on his own competition .
these changing factors make it very difficult by Mr Kelly .
elderly musicians have been able to obtain their musicians from today &apos;s capital .
there is a lot of foreigners in the middle of Tallinn .
those with whom the fire will become , acknowledged that there is a presence in the elderly , without the permission of the city government .
the first we found in the middle of the Viru &apos;s gateer , who were in the same way , who were the same as they have done with them .
it was clearly shown that the musicians of rings and riches were dispersed by musicians in colleges , who were one of the duchch of the chch of the chch of one .
despite the fact , in spite of the only woman played by the apartment group , the only woman played by scors , while one man in his side of his Christmas and admittedly called for in the trialogue .
the third man had sat on the side of their homes , and smokers have been ready to stand up with a warmest one .
these three homes did not allow itself to upset the richness of the people .
in writing . - ( PT ) We have played a gesture in Bob on the Noemi and palliations in Bob , that Christianity in the streets , as well as money after .
the aim of this task was to collect the ticket money from Finland to the same day this evening .
apart from the question of whether they were allowed to wear a black town to the age of age , Noemi , Noemi and Bob , Noemi .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never hold more than a day or a few in the city of a day or a few and most of the promised permits for a time or something such .
it makes no sense to pay for it , Mr Bob .
if we were going to get around 20 minutes at the gates of Viru , we saw that two women are among musicians and timeliness .
it will be a good omen for the cross @-@ accumulation of plastic carrier bags and bags in the middle of Viru .
Mr Viru was also represented by three people in Polish young men , one of which played a fifth , second klaring , and the third was , in the name of electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to provide people with entertainment to be able to spread music and joy and so that the money for fuel and residence for fuel and living is explained by Mivosh from Mivosh .
according to Mivoshi , they are aware that there must be the authorisation of the municipal authorities to take place .
&quot; of course , we do not have this &apos; , he has said it .
but we hope that if people enjoy our musicians , there is no problem .
of course , if the police must be , we are going to go elsewhere , but we will have to try , in Annex he .
the Estonian Bank bought the euro area in the framework of the public sector of central banks in the euro area in July 149 million bonds , the flag bond bonds portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion .
more detailed information on purchases will not be in detail .
President Hardo Hansson , President Hardo Hansson , has made clear that the euro system will be made by the central banks of the euro system in order to cover three different purchasing plans : bonds from the financial sector ( in the form of a set of reference ) , assets guaranteed ( ABS ) and public bonds ( PSPP ) .
the Central Bank purchase bonds from the market in order to encourage bonds by investors to invest in money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases will fall into a low @-@ risk asset , and it will motivate investors to take greater risks .
within the framework of the public bond programme , the central bank is buying its national government bonds , with other national bonds .
as Estonia has issued bonds issued by Estonia , the Bank of Estonia will make it available to them within the limits of the so @-@ called replacement .
the central banks will also make purchases in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian Bank buy Hansson &apos;s assurances , for example , European financial stability fund and European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian bank purchase bonds as part of the year in March 2015 .
in the meantime , Election bonds , and Estonia &apos;s June 2016 , have also purchased bonds , but a bank of Estonia in June 2016 .
on behalf of the euro area , the central banks of the euro will buy and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds since June , as well as Estonia .
migratory movements are ignoring degrees and return to millions of business . &quot;
some of the West Midlands , the most of the homes of the West , have been re @-@ owned by a disgusting confrontation , which has ignored the fools of the Council , which has ignored their cotton .
the speculators have been hijacked by the tracks of their 20 trailers , &quot; with a view to the &apos; risked Solihull &apos; in the street .
they have returned to the horse , along with the horses , children and trucks , the army of the child and lorry , when they only come out of it in May , without being thrown out of a myth , untenable to prevent their invasion of Council .
the group considered a weak position by means of a defence limit , turning a blind eye to the vehicles that were left to do .
the people who are angry are angry from the Solihull Council , saying that &apos; the problem is useless in dealing with the &apos; problem &apos; .
one anonymous person said : &apos; they are home there , on a Monday night after the Benady Heathfrom , where they were elected by stoning .
it must be a disgrace that they should act , because they are in a way to deal with the problem .
speculators were there in May , they were time to go and now they are once again .
they had to be done yesterday evening , most probably today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Burma is aware of how to deal with such things , by obtaining a long barrier to protect their parks .
I live on the road to strike , and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay the payment of a total tax if the Council is not even able to prevent such things . &quot;
one local person , who also wanted to be anonymous , said : &apos; this is a ludicrous one : the latter have been left up , and we have already seen a new offensive .
this time , the number has increased and the grassland have even been a horse to remember . &quot;
the representative representative of the Solihull Council said : &apos; we are aware that the route of the road to a war near the land is unacceptable , and we are working together in Solihull police . we are implementing the necessary legal measures to move them as quickly as possible .
in the collection of evidence , it is very helpful when many local residents of any kind of antisocial or criminal behaviour in the police , call the number of 101 or criminal behaviour are very helpful .
this will help to establish a picture of the situation for the Court if we are presenting the case . &quot;
the Weestival in the Festival will also visit all of the other among others , Minister of Culture Indrek Saar , who is pleased that Estonia has succeeded in bringing the top names of the world &apos;s top names .
on the question of the Weeky festival &apos;s Estonians , the Saar , that this should be asked to ask all those who enjoy three days in the festival in the festival .
it says , however , that the crisis has come to the real players in its area .
&quot; looking at the level of artists , which has been achieved in Estonia , then it will be to be placed on the top top names of its music , often in the light of the absolute names of us , who will speak , Minister for Culture .
however , what are the festivals in the festival of Saart themselves in the first place ?
I have to be a relatively old human and one of the old people , and for the old people , it is certainly one of the most experienced artist , Armin van Bren , who took place yesterday evening .
after all of us , all of us have now made a grip on their own language . &quot; he has made a word &apos; .
however , it will also bring about a number of names , such as Chainlis , Deaderu5 , Knifer .
of course , our Estonian players : starting from the Fo P and they can read a whole series of .
in reality , this well @-@ known concentration of names is very high . &quot; says he .
look at the start of a video !
the awards will be renewed in the middle of the criticism by the car manufacturers in the middle of 850 000 diesel vehicles .
the day before the Aud has said , BMW , in order to provide software modernisation more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chair of the BMW , the company believes that &apos; there is a more intelligent option as driving restrictions &apos; , referring to the European cities , including BMW homes , which have considered a ban or restriction of diesel vehicles .
the Daimler announced the fact that , on Tuesday , to reduce gas emissions from diesel engines , the three million of Mercedes auctions in Europe .
no company did not describe these procedures as a recall .
European car manufacturers have made an advertisement of the use of diesel in Europe and in the United States , in order to assist the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen oxide of nitrogen oxide in diesel is considered to be carcinogenic , and that may cause asthma .
the cost of waste emissions from diesel for car companies will also increase , by changing the cost of waste emissions from diesel , by making cars at competitive prices .
at the same time , while German car manufacturers are under @-@ thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused by Chancellor Merkel &apos;s government in the blending of powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the problem .
businesses are trying to prevent the Volkswagen to avoid the errors of the mistakes of the Volkswagen who made it to be able to be able to make the use of exhaust emissions from the time of testing a car that allowed the car to be adapted to the test of the car .
a number of Volkswagen will be prosecuted in the United States and others are under the investigation of the Atlantic .
last month Germany was arrested as a former president of the engine development unit in Germany .
the former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio Giovanni Pamio are Italians and is therefore protected from extradition , and may go to the Court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , the Audi prize was drawn up in Germany with Volkswagen if the authorities blamed the installation of the Audit system in order to evade the emissions from Europe &apos;s emissions requirements , by extending this investigation , which was focused on the United States in the past .
the inclusion of the awards can be the Volkswagen to be a great blow to the Volkswagen manufacturer , a disproportionately large proportion of the Volkswagen profit .
Estonia &apos;s schools receive the flags of EU flags of EUR 20 000 .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy the EU flag for the schools in September on 1 September .
in total , measurements 105158 per cent of the EU flag of the European Union &apos;s flag of 570 education .
lists have been set up in the form of false ponds , which have to be carried out in the quality printed techniques which have been carried out in the quality printed techniques , brokered news news from the ERR news .
the flag has a text : &apos; Kinkens Estonia &apos;s schools in the Council of the European Union for the first Presidency of the European Union of Estonia .
the estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education , or one of the flag will cost EUR 35 .
the murder of journalists stresses the growing situation in Mexico
the week &apos;s week , the workers of Riodoce , are usually gathering on Wednesday , to review plans for the most recent chaos in the state of origin , which sow organised crime , corrupt officials and ceunted drug wars .
but today they have gathered to discuss their own security in the shadow of the personal tragedy .
they are told that it is important to change its routine .
two parents will be discussing , either safer : to bring children with office in 2009 , which was a target of grants in 2009 , or to leave them home .
the security experts have written room at the forefront of three words : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; the neutrality of the &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking reports for the names of all forms of error , it is enough to make the impressions and internal interfaces .
the presence of the government or cartels is suspected of drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists in the position of a whole list of evil who are doing in Mexico as dangerous .
the violence is not dispersed , and more than more manners of the dead body are accumulating in the country , more than journalists are reported by journalists , according to the protection of journalists from the Committee on the Committee on the Protection of journalists , as they have been at least 25 years after the attacks and threats of national protection , and this year , at least seven journalists have been attacked and threatened by at least seven journalists in the state of national protection .
the latest deaths include their editor and inspiration for their editor and inspiration , Rioce co @-@ founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &apos; wrote in Valdez @-@ in @-@ Valdez one of its many drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though its presence may perceive the high picture of a façade on the head of the Riodoce building building a façade on a fazd building , with a letter to the &quot; Justice &apos; , and two 30 reports , Aar, Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , will bear in T @-@ shirts , which have seen his wife @-@ helliant face or their characteristic contribution .
the meeting will take place in less than two months after his death .
while in 2010 , it was set up in a separate state Prosecutor &apos;s Office to address cases of journalists , the protection of journalists , which is only two cases of the Court of Justice .
as in the case of the murder of most of every year , the number of drug trafficking and organised crime , which amounts to thousands , the killing of journalists is rarely brought to justice .
the editorial in Riodoce is continuing to reflect violence on the beauty of the world , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without murder , there is no security for the meetings of the Ibarra , according to the data and justice .
&quot; it is very long to waste your time here at the meeting , &apos; he says .
&quot; until now , as long as it is not known , mistrust is known . &quot;
Mr Culice in Riodoce in Riodoce in Riodoce in Riodoce &apos;s office in Riodoce in the state of Valdez .
he has managed to travel only a couple of quarters before the two men made red Toyota Coroles , who were forced by cars and was shot at 12 times , which is expected to be the name of the newspaper , which means the twelfth river . &quot;
Wdez threw the car of Valdez , who took the car to go and did in the vicinity of an accident .
in Valdez , 50 years old .
it remained behind the woman and two adults .
the Culiacus will freely spread in the Culier .
however , there is essentially only silence on the subject of the Valdez .
since the arrest of Guzman &apos;s arrest last year and the United States in January , you have been one of the most bloody battlefields , because rivalry by rivalry in power in a vacuum of power has been one of the most bloody battlets .
there is no distinction between you in the streets of a person in the streets of a person or even a number of them , or even a number of people who spans to death in the guise of the twogy of drugs , which are more than a lot of the homes of many living with many living .
we forget , for a moment , that the peace time refers to the European State of drug routes when values of value @-@ friendly ports and the United States are leading only one of the cartel .
in spite of everything that and the fact that the Valdez @-@ dez @-@ of @-@ of @-@ his job , the dangers of their work , have been aware of the dangers of his work , feels the co @-@ founder of Riodoce and the President , Mr President , in Bojorquez ( 60 ) , that he was unable to defend its war .
he believes that there were two error in favour of slaughter .
the first was Guzman son &apos;s pogas of competing and war @-@ in @-@ war cartel . Damash interviews on interviews in February .
this piece of correspondence could perhaps be discernible members of the people who bought all the talent by the buck , if they have reached the time of time @-@ injections .
the second mistake was that the Valdez was not forced to leave a country on behalf of his own security following the fact that there was a hair in one another of the same story .
Valdez , in Mexico , as well as abroad , and his slaughter is seen as a turning point for violence in Mexico .
it was so long to be alive , so that his friends and colleagues were expected to have a permanent one .
he worked at the heart of the newspaper in 2003 , in the Noroveller , when he joined the five Member States to create a Rioce , sale of 50 dollars .
Mr Bojorquez said that it was impossible to address the issue of the press without preventing the problem of the drug . &quot;
the total amount of time has been a time for his courageous and fair reflection and sale and advertising .
in writing . - ( DE ) I enjoyed strong research on Portuguese , without censorship and readers without censorship , and readers who were able to read the stories that anyone else did not dare to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Rioce , the newspaper won the award of its Latin American reports for the prestige of Maria Moors , Maria Moors .
in the same year , the Valdez journalists are won by the Committee on International Freedom of Freedom of the International Prize for the press for their courage to follow Mexico &apos;s drug creation .
he recognised the fact that it was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &apos; he said &apos; he &apos; had the winner of the Act .
last October , he said TV channel Rompeviento Rompeviento the television channel , so that drug trafficking is a blue @-@ life way of life .
&quot; the head of the head of the task , which is accompanied by a journalist office , will be accompanied by another option .
I do not want me to ask me that what I did in the face of so many deaths , and why I did not say what is happening . &apos;
Riodoce collectives for the Valdez , a joke man , who was a srty like , a joke , a friend who divided embryos and advice , teachers who know how to survive .
they are their stupid in the first place .
he always made his barrels .
she went on the basis of the El Doryabr bar , and the father has always gone on the same table .
now they ask whether he had his stupid love to send him .
the death of him has also put themselves into doubt about how best to do its work and stay in life .
&quot; they do not like those women , their children , their children , their illegal land , their secret landing posters , which are used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been treated , &quot; said Bojorquez .
the result , even in the best times , is a strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ censorship .
confidence in its instincs .
if it comes to suspicious , hoia .
Ms Andres Villarrez said , according to Riodoce editor @-@ her , the problem is that &apos; fragrances can be deceived ... and this is the case in Jternity .
his and other say that you do not apply any more old rules , just as they do not apply in Thailand , Veracruzis , Guerreros or other states which have a cost @-@ profitable route to smugglers , weak institutions and corrupt public officials .
the environment is constantly changing .
in a room where workers in Riohce workers collapsed , suddenly they were not allowed to mobile phones ; some days before it was revealed that only at a crossroads of the governments of the governments had been used in Mexico for journalists and activists .
there are two police officers in front of the House two policemen to mitigate the heat of 40 tails .
they set out a more painful government in Rioce &apos;s office , which is located in the Culiacani building in Culiacani .
some reporters were wondering whether these police officers are among their 50 % of their police officers whose cane has been unreliable .
several months have passed since the reporter has travelled to the memory of the countryside where controls are de facto drug gangs .
Riodoce in this week dealt with three main words .
one of them was the Julioas of the Kaloas of the former son , the Yaloa of the former son , Mr Chavez .
in addition , they were revealing the spending of the government of the government of the home to the poultry .
a quarter of the Culiacani &apos;s cabinets from the Culiacani to the most expensive restaurant groups were kidnapped by Culiacani .
there was no official announcement of those who were kidnapped or how this happened , so it had to be a cautious time when it was the time to write what everyone knows in the city of the restaurant , both drug traffickers and the authorities of the authorities .
porter became public documents to know that the restaurant is registered as a politician who belongs in power to an institution of an Institutional Revolutionary Revolutionary League ( IRP ) , which was dominated by all levels of politics in the whole of the last century .
at the last time , several IRP has been accused of widespread reporting on corruption in the context of cases .
in Villara , asked reporters have asked to write to previous incidents in place , including how the pog of the Guzman pog of the Guzman pog , the Guzman pova , is rescued from the military record .
in just a few months before the readers would be the reading of Valdez to obtain information on the best sources of human robs .
&apos;earlier we would have known what happened , the 46 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old Villark , who has made the construction of a body , he has earned him a slogan of the name of Mr El Flame .
&quot; it is now all the channels of communication that have occurred with our sources . &quot;
the Bureau has received savings on the bridges and stickers which protest against the killing of journalists , and there has become something they could never expect to wait for activists to press on behalf of the press .
Reporter Miriam Ramitrez , a couple of eyes and guidance next morning to the public Prosecutor &apos;s cabinet to a demonstration of another journalist .
Mr President , we will be doing the two days after the Cabinet &apos;s State in the western half of Michoacan .
it has been found in contempt for the death and officials of the DNA on the basis of the DNA tests .
journalists have become more than the voice of the country , as well as an organised protest in the roads and the phrase &apos; SOS press &apos; .
on this day , Mr Bojorquez , in Washington , trying to collect an international support for justice in Valdez .
the day after the death of the White Court of Justice , Mr Valdez &apos;s death , was accused by a Ramirez authorities for journalists to speak out and killing the truth because of the truth .
after this , he asked that it should be channelled from the government of the government , with concern that it has affected hatred in the form of objectivity .
in Valdez , there had been several times that the journalists in Mexico have been organised by organised crime , their deculprits and the indifference of civil servants in the form of an organised crime . &quot;
in its last paper , the &apos; drug media &apos; wrote that rereporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also by politicians and security forces , who have been organised crime in the case of organised crime .
the Articulo 19 attach more than half of the attacks on media surveillance by the media , Articulo 19 to the police and civil servants .
&quot; in Mexico , it is because you want to keep quiet , &apos; said Ramirez .
it is obvious that the verges of a bloody impact is obvious .
nobody will forget the death of bloggers and Maria Elizabeth Macias to the death of a bloggler in the country in Thailand , six years ago .
he was found to death with a letter , which was probably written to the cartel in LOS Zetas : &apos; I am in my reporter &apos; .
in addition , alongside him , the head of the computer slogans have been leep by computer glass and devage .
some publications have decided to close their doors , for example in the newspaper El Norte in the country in the country of Chihuav , after their correspondence in the case of Monslava Bash by Chihuar in March .
other words , such as the newspaper El Manana de Nodo , the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the murder of their President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad calls for a banner in Ciudad Juarez to the cartel . &quot; What you want to have ? &apos; .
some journalists have fled from the state of affairs or even the country .
it is a nervous decision .
it is difficult to find a job in exile , and they still need to be thanked in order to avoid the dangers .
and sometimes it is behind them , as was probably the case with photographi Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered , together with the four people in 2015 , three months after the Verachzist pageg .
those who remain in place and will continue to work , every day in every day , to retritanate decisions .
Ibarra who wanted a pocket who wanted a pocket , recognises that the issue of drug trafficking is intimidated .
&quot; Mexico is on the road to hell and because I am reporter , &apos; said he .
at one of the recent midnight , when the latest figure has already been in front of the last number , the editor of the editor of Riodoce , the editor of Riodoce , the editor of the Riodoce , the editor to jump when suddenly started to override all the phone .
according to the reexchange of rivalry in Mazatlanis , there was 19 people who have died in the pipeline between rivalry in Mazatlanis and the security forces of the security forces .
the war continues to continue , as has been promised by several of the messages left in the region .
in the same way , reportters in Riodoce &apos;s website in Riodoce &apos;s website was launched by the Saster mobile phone .
in the next day , we needed changes to the next day .
the deployment of a humgatic in the region has been passed by another region .
the police officers in Bojorquez stick to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not see it at least .
the collapse of the head of the boardroy , under the mass scale , with its average fingers , has been seen as a whole Yaloh , editorial staff in Riodoce workers in his footsteps .
&quot; how can you look at the closure of the Bojorquez , &apos; said Bojorquez , &apos; whereas at the same day when Javier massacred , it asked for the practice that I would report to this report ? &apos;
Dinosaur used anti @-@ defence colours to avoid enemies
at first sight , it seems like the form , although rather intimidation .
scientists have now unveiled the first findings in relation to the unbelievable eviction of the Canadian mine , which is so well done so that experts have described this as the &apos; dinosay of the Mona &apos; .
it has been so well done so that it was even possible to identify that it was covered by a number of skygen and his past had been somewhat &apos; complex &apos; .
the report published in Biology , published in Biology , described as &quot; The best preserved Spanish treasures which have ever been found &apos; and if &apos; one best of the best at the world &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new type of nodosable excess , which lived by the middle of 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
it is incredibly good for this unbelievable announcement of the &apos; truly significant &apos; . &quot;
it is covered by plant @-@ feeding crops , according to the National Geoiselis National , the best preserved of this type of phosphorus which has ever been found .
on 21 March 2011 , the &quot; Forty @-@ ray of &quot; Fort McMurray of the mining Suncor Millenium mines close to northern Alberta of Canada .
it has been hit by something that has not been remembered , and decided to examine more closely .
the phosphorus identified in Royal Tyrarl were sent to Royal Tyrarl .
the next six years were designed to be an animal @-@ friendly one of the 2 500 nages ( 11.100 kilometres ) .
after all this hard work , the final result is now to be prepared to bring about the public .
&quot; if there is a little bit to quote , almost believe that he sleep , &apos; the author of Caleb Brown has been saying &apos; a leading author &apos; said Royal Tyrarl , in the museum , where the demand is being made .
&quot; this will go down in the history of one of the most beautiful and most of the most beautiful , and most of the main ones , the Mona Mona , in addition to Mona , in addition . &quot;
he has found that it was known that it has been covered by sorely and reminds you that it is likely to be covered by sorely and reminiscent of meat , which is likely to be at risk .
in writing . - ( PT ) Some sops used in a red way in the red and white defence colour , in order to deny itself for the dayers , and implemented obscure techniques , which are called &apos; no &apos; , and who are also using many of today &apos;s animals .
this enabled the experts &apos; say to be better surroundings , and to avoid enemies of the enemy , as the major surrenders were likely to be hunt .
this 110 million the family of the old nodosature of the age of the age of nodosails reached the first time for news in May and is now a visit to Royal Tyrerli , which is now visiting Royal Tyrer .
the figures have now been investigated and awarded the name of Boeing in Borealm , the mark of the Marmitlund laboratory , according to the Mitchell mark , which was spent by a team that spent up to create more than 7000 hours .
as Dr Mitchell and the team of scientists have been able to record the form and size of the team of Researchers and the International Researchers &apos; team .
they discovered the responsibility of the defendant - a standard defence method which means that the title of tolerance was a half @-@ lower one .
although there is widespread responsibility , there will be a surprise , because it is a surprise because Boeing is much greater than those who live in the face of their lives today .
this hinders the fact that the latter are actively sufficiently active in other muscles , so that the evolution preferred rather than overshadogs rather than the opposite of the survival tactics .
however , the majority of animals who are in charge of modern responsibility - such as the fear , mixture or archaes - is a lot smaller and more vulnerable , which refers to the fact that nodosaver pressure had to be seen to be really working hard to survive .
&quot; there is a huge amount of great and high @-@ level soya beats , which shows how dangerous could have been treated by animals who could have been kidnapped by animals at a risk . &quot; said Brown .
the chemical element of organic compounds has also revealed the fact that the leather of the number of organic compounds was a red boke .
scientists continue to create an investigation in order to get the hotspots in order to make its life , including the slashing of content , in order to identify what the animal is to be last elephant .
they believe that at the time of the risk of a dead river , it is powerless to have the river , thereby gaining a stream of flows to the sea , where it came up with the wool over the ocean .
at this time , Mr Albertini was at the same time , and the rivers and oceans are likely to go far beyond the internal land than at the moment .
&quot; this nodosate is a very significant one , because it is fully covered by a sober leak , while it has remained a triple @-@ dimensional leag , while maintaining the original form , President Brown .
&quot; this is a result of almost the same as a result of almost the same as a lobbyist .
there is not a great deal of imagination to be used in order to reconstruct this redesign - simply is enough to see a label and it seems that he would be sleeping . &quot;
the age of the crisis was the time when there are huge two pieces of movements in the land , by musicians .
while the King of all the King in the Tyrannosate rex , millions of many years later than the Borealn , could have been discharged with some of his horrible sins .
these include Acrocano pressure , 38 shoes ( 11.5 metres ) , a long and six tonnes of weight .
researchers , whose latest findings have been published in a magazine Biology , believe that Boeing was killed after death in the Baltic Sea and that it did not duplicate the mud .
on the table on 21 March 2011 Shawn FAs from Fort McMurray in the North East of Northern Alberta McMurray were discovered .

scientists believe that this is covered by the current vegetation and seafles through the current Western Canadian , until the floodgates in the sea .
however , the trapped of the sea in the sea , however , helped to maintain an excellent basis in detail .
it has not been so well done in stone that has been in coal , so that noise @-@ garlic sops are still covered by the roll @-@ out of the mygarment of noise .
as has been signed by Michael Greshko , Mr Greshko &apos;s magazine , &apos; such continuity is just as rare as a locturer .
what is more than I look at this , the unbelievable that seems to be .
there is still a series of mygarous locations in the Kivus , which will continue to cover the mygarment of a troika .
it is better placed alongside him , and the way in which it is stolen .
I will be able to put his back on his winter . &quot;
how does the Act found a response to the question of which today ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferreill became full shock .
just a day after the travel of New York in New York , this St. one of the day @-@ by @-@ Louven @-@ resident Airbus will be made through a return on Facebook .
he has entered its own language after schooling .
there was a letter : &apos; the police killed just 18 @-@ year @-@ old adolescents and who are now bars to date . &quot;
he was in the turmoil , why no one has been informed of this information , which is why he was closed on Facebook and opened Twitter .
in the meantime @ TheePsucah user postal applications were repeatedly shared by his magazine .
Mr Loukas &apos;s region transmitted in real time to the death of Michael Brown , a weapon of unarmed 18 @-@ year @-@ old young men , who killed the White police officer in the Ferguson Missouri Missouri .
he gave a picture of the life of the Browl , which was born in the age of four hours .
&quot; this is a crazy , &apos; wondered by Mrs Ferreira .
the death of his or her community was not a new one .
he filed his phone , but it was subsequently refinite , which said this time , this time for people &apos;s assembly of the people of the Canfield Drive Drive .
there were photographs of the police in the police , and the fear of people , and a man who claimed himself to have the father of Browl , the &apos; Ferguson &apos; police to kill the police of the Ferguson . &quot;
it examined in real time a stream , where the police officer stood for the graves of protests by the police officer .
the second video @-@ inspired by the other police officer , according to his statement , has said , and shining : &apos; I will kill you all ... &apos; .
on the Ferrelle , how he has hit itself from thinking : &apos; it is unusual . &quot;
&quot; it is not a murder of this kind , which we are used to and what we could mention typical . &quot;
I felt that at this moment , I felt very scathed .
I was in the rain . &quot;
he booked the flight and travelled at the next day .
at 23 o &apos;clock , he went to the father of his six @-@ year daughter , and decided that they travel the next morning with Ferguson Ferguson .
what the Ferrelle and Fergusoniga will have done in the next three years , the central issue in the new documentary &apos; Whos street &apos; ? &apos; ( whose street is today ? &quot; ) , which will take place in cinemas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protesters , a love and defeat , a love and defeat , strength and resilience , from the perspective of those who live in this community and who have met the answer by calling for the streets .
if , together with the tyranny , who had a distilling sticker , and a spot , the Ferguson side , who has moved on the floor , who spoke again on the subject , which had been the case before this morning - from the mood of people who have repeatedly come from the past - and the living conditions .
&quot; can you remember how I taught me how the black community had to fight for their rights ? &apos; recalls itself to question &apos; .
&quot; we are talking about the Ferguson , because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and it is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him , &apos; he said he said later .
&quot; what happens now is the culmination of what has happened in the past .
it must be aware and see it , and it will grow in the middle .
it must learn to learn about activists and organise and feel different from the different sections of the experience and living conditions , and what we need to do so that we have to be free and free .
even if I manage to increase him so that he does not have a cruelty of racism , it does not differ from some of the other musicians of the other .
I feel that I would like to make it a disservice if I defend him for this world . &quot;
the first suspension of which they did , in the south of the Ferguson , was on the path of South Flopia , in the place of the police community , which was in place in place , which was a certain kind of camp where activists waiting news for the police officer , Darren Wilson , who did not put an accusation at last .
Mrs Ferreira and his daughter joined the forces of local business owners who prepared the south .
they put together food bags and helped to share these protests .
for the Ferrelle , we slowly started to take shape of a new type of activist .
&quot; my activist change completely after 9 August , &apos; said it notes that , if he was an Misouri @-@ St. he was a student student , he was President of the Union of Väheans , the President of the Union , and focused on the security of food justice and health @-@ related communities .
&quot; I did not have any experience of organising .
that is all just a way . &quot;
the week later in the week , Ferreira is a co @-@ spontrigue Sabhail Folayanevery .
the Folayan , his and film operator , Mr Alstado , wanted to be able to file a document .
the Ferrelli question arose : &apos; is you trying to document what is happening or to find a story that can be used ? &apos;
such scepticism was an unacceptably a number of cases where people - often dismissal - come to a community and try to benefit from the benefits and resilience of it .
the Folayan explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard the Ferguson and the people of the Ferguson who have not been heard and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
the Folayan Damis has already been a blow to the Damat Damis , the region &apos;s artificial example , who was well known in terms of death row in activists .
his involvement made the project attractive in the Ferrelle and the two other local communities , who are the film &apos; Whoy street &apos; , a &apos; team &apos; following the shoot of Browts for years .
&quot; this documentary does not speak for us , and we ourselves , the &apos; Davis &apos; said we , but we are talking about us .
&quot; for me , it was important for us to represent these people , as it is also portrayed by me . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the Ferrelle experience - the intention was to show that the movement is not about the &apos; point of departure , but in the coming out of the community &apos; , as said Folayan , it was the most open to a film .
as a result , the &apos; Whot street &apos; is documented , &apos; Whos street &apos; , as a result of the family of the Ferrelle , as the charity and his wife .
&quot; I felt , as I would be myself , &apos; said , by Mrs Ferreira , Mr Ferreira , when he was prepared to see the city .
&quot; however , I realised that the work of this work and the human exploitation of human beings must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the Ferrelle story underlines and reprioritises the role of LGBT women in the wider Black Limist Matter movement .
two of the three winners of the movement of the movement of the social media , who thought , following the murder of the social media in 2012 , was # BlackLiese Matter Matter , is homosexuality .
&quot; women in the vanguard &apos; role in the lead role are the movement of women in general over the overall area , &apos; said Ferreira , &apos; said , &apos; and it is precisely because we need to fight on several fronts .
the women of the Mustanks have to bear the burden on the whole of all . &quot;
the Folayan agreed , noting that &apos; movement of movement is indeed women in life , and many of them are black homosexuals . &quot;
he claims that &apos; this is not any kind of equal opportunity &apos; - Ferrell was not elected to be the focus of his identity as a result of his identity .
&quot; he was a man , of whom the right energy , he said .
&quot; however , it is not a coincidence that he directly consisted in the footwear , because the musicians of LGBT women in such an end , as a result of a lot at stake .
his energy is possible through the screens . &quot;
at the same time , the news cameras of the Fergusonist , long ago , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
as a result of the demonstrations in the Ferrelle , a sentence for blocking the road to blocking the road is still a result of 2.5 years .
he describes the social policy in the region , which he calls on home , simply &apos; the vast threat &apos; .
nevertheless , it still needs to be an important mantra that has destroyed the memory of the coal since the three years ago in the Ferguson street .
&quot; our commitment is to fight for our freedom .
our duty is to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we do not have anything apart from our chain . &quot;
7 % , how &quot; Weeky Weeky du boys &quot;
some of the glevers of meposers will find that , after a scarce number , that the misery , this also of aid .
or on the basis of a phrase &apos; sayy &apos; is &apos; meltdown &apos; .
however , it is only inevitable to postpone and to health to health .
what will you do to do so that after today and tomorrow &apos;s Weekown trend - or other parts - or other parts , this morning , it can be better felt and to overcome the pain of the boys ?
Joo water .
in addition , when there is a great deal in the morning ... or as soon as possible , or even alcohol .
since the use of alcohol consumption in a lot of liquids , it will have to be rejected in any way .
together with water , minerals and minerals are also a good thing , with minerals and a seasp is a good mineral water .
since it is often irritated in the post @-@ fire , it is particularly good if it comes to soil free or just a lighter .
the way to take place .
it would certainly not be paid to the age of boys , which would be a puzzle - that may prove to be a fatal wrong decision .
however , it is easy to remember , however , that the feeling is alive once again .
it is a time @-@ consuming way of sleeping and sleeping to sleeping to sleeping .
giving poor energy slowly and cautiously .
if you are already running from yesterday , we will certainly not be able to try to charge a lot of difficulty .
for example , it is fresh , with a fresh volume of nursery , which contains a lack of silence in the health of the markets .
when the world is already suffering around the South , it could be tried , for example , to the woness .
and a little later .
to avoid coffee .
it will release the infighting of this deprivation from the poor .
as has already been said : water and volume are friends .
contribute to pain @-@ sisits .
if you were to prevent pain @-@ silenced in this evening , you need to address , in addition to alcohol , in addition to alcohol parattamos or ifprofeat and will lose the way out .
both rivals , and will continue to be in a way , and will continue to have a bogus worse .
in addition , there is no room for silence anyway , even though there is a long time .
if you were painting this morning , then the way to do so - this annoying our already dirty haven .
or if a partner is not to take , it can be done well .
around the same way , as evidenced , but it cannot be followed by a footwear .
however , there should be a physical effort to prevent and paid out too active at the time , during a pohler , during the pohler .
joke .
the people of the friends of the friends of the friends of the friends , the way for simple tons and a nail @-@ class friendly way in both themselves and other ( suffering ) .
Nali and laugher may not be done by a pot , but it is certainly up to them to tolerate the same phenomenon .
once again , the shop will go on .
the staff of the professor of the professors and Oxford University are looking for a murder of a suspect
according to the police , the authorities are looking at the same level of professors in the University of Northwood and Oxford and Oxford , which have become a suspect of the people of the University of Kzicago , which have become a suspect for the death of a male people from a Chicago luxury .
according to the Cook Country documents , on Monday , on Monday , on Monday , there were 42 @-@ year @-@ old arrest warrants for arrest warrants for the arrest of 42 @-@ year Wyndham Lathemi and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni and 56 @-@ year @-@ olds Andrew Warrenton H. James Cornell @-@ Durantagu .
according to documents , 26 @-@ year Cornell @-@ Durantagu died after repeated action .
the warning , according to which the Chicago police commission issued the community , was discovered to death on 27 July .
the police in the police were telephone phones and found the Grand Plaza korterhouse for the victims whose body was a number of storms .
according to officials , Cornell @-@ Durantau was admitted to death and investigators in Cornell , while the police are actively looking to two suspects .
it has been working as a microbiology in Northwesn in Northwester at the University of Northwood and the immunology and immunology .
Vice @-@ President of the University of K.T. Cubbage , the University of Cubbage , said , in a statement sent by the University , that Lail has now been removed from the work temporarily and has been banned from the University of Northwester .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter in the investigation carried out by the competent authorities , and the University of Northwester will work with researchers , &quot; said Cubbage .
Mr Warren is a senior assistant in the University of Oxford .
the representative of the university and Sommer College said in the statement made by the University of e @-@ publishing : &apos; we have been in the Community with the British police and ready to help the US research authorities in any way possible . &quot;
in addition , in the statement , there was a statement that Warreni colleagues are shocked and willing to propose itself .
Anthony Guglielm , President Anthony Guglielm , the President of the Sthony Guglielm , urges themselves to give themselves to the authorities .
the police have an idea where they are staying , but we are working more intensively with the definition of a precise location , &apos; said Guglielm .
according to the Guglielm , the suspects of the local , regional and national authorities will help to seek suspects .
the Guglielm said that the police had received a phone from the Grand Plaza of the Grand Plaza Canterhouse , who had just had a raft of rapidic rain , that there has been something that has happened .
according to the police description , it was a miracle one .
it is not clear whether the event took place on 27 July .
he said that the security cameras will confirm Lathemi and Warreni .
&quot; we believe that Professor Lathail and the victim was a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
the Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to the people : &quot; the police are currently working at the time of events and the background of the victim , and the various motives , including the possibility of a family dispute . &quot;
Idufirms , which will help to prevent your business in the next Upwould .
Amy Errett wanted to measure its own e @-@ commerce start @-@ up to workers &apos; satisfaction , but polls were made .
the answers were often vague , useless or , even worse , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anonymity , some employees did not trust this process .
&quot; this system simply was not consistent and objective , &quot; said Errett , who will lead 75 employees to the e @-@ commerce company in the Netherlands to sell the e @-@ commerce company in the Netherlands .
it therefore called for non @-@ persons .
there is a new type of human resources that will help businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software aimed at measuring the involvement of workers , they will allow companies to make a dedicated team and the demographic groups , to provide the workers &apos; anonymity and the hot line of complaints , and in some cases , in some cases , to go beyond C @-@ level leaders and to return directly to the Bureau .
&quot; there is now a tool such as the Strait and Fitbi , which is designed to monitor health , but where the Fitbi of your company has asked Jim Barnett , co @-@ founder and CEO of Reding , Glint , the founder and CEO of Vice @-@ President Reding in Glint , whose wisdom is used by companies to measure the involvement of workers .
according to Erretti , he has received three years when he has used the Glins , a much better overview of what he has to think and feel .
in addition , the poll and a firmer team for teams will offer a company &apos;s heat card , which provides an overview of what components are most of the complaints and which drivers have the lowest support , allowing it to identify the reasons .
companies have started to understand that they have to live up to their culture of work , so that not to become the next Ubwould , which has been insurmounted scandals , since the former employee published a blogger , which was described by the attack on the environment in which it was punished by those who have been dared to speak .
for example , for example , for example , the Gliner is a desire for their own choice of business .
the global management , regulation and conformity area may be , according to the statistics on financial statistics , the website of Let &apos;s , the website of the TLet , more than 1 118,7 billion by 2020 .
the convergence rate of Denveris between Mr Colorados , which will help businesses to prevent and detect unwanted behaviour in the light of the Uberian people in the context of the Ubber reputation , in this year .
the convergence is almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
Uber registration has been registered by the Commission recently .
as the Gliner , the convergence percentage companies will allow an adapted impulses to be made , to collect a real @-@ time confidential response and review of heat from the problems of heat .
it also offers anonymous messages that will allow workers to be unsuitable for the behaviour of workers to know .
and if it is concerned , complaints will go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion is encouraged by the regulatory authorities , &apos; the establishment of a censeant and CEO Patrick Quinn .
Mr Quinlan said that , if a company is found to treat its workers badly or ethically , a company can face serious consequences , such as the boycott of the consumer , the departure of workers and the courts , even if regulators do not interfere .
Mr Ruby , a restaurant , which has more than 25 000 employees , has used the convergence of convergence as a year in order to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and to offer easy ways to communicate with the company &apos;s headquarters .
if the worker wanted to report the problem earlier , he had to find a company &apos;s telephone number or interview addressed , submit a formal appeal and hope that it will be taken seriously .
this often was discouraging and inconvenience , the Rude a general adviser , Mr Vitilio , who said it was not a good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , at a time when a company is using the convergence cengram , it is possible to have problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices which did not have reached leadership in other cities or states in offices in other cities , more quickly to identify and address them .
&quot; I will be able to get closer to the people of the people of the free 360 degree of 360 degrees , &apos; said Vitrano , who is headed by Mr Ruby .
&quot; and we defend our shareholders for the courts . &quot;
Mr Quinlan said that companies started with ethics , the values and the involvement of employees more seriously in 2002 , in other words , after the auditor of the Bank of Arthur Andersen failed , as a result of the scandals of the Enroni scandal .
however , only if the &apos; social media were mature &apos; , companies , the companies , that they are not able to prevent their wasteful wasteful use in public online .
&quot; in order to monitor the use of the technology , people used a strategy as a strategy to monitor the use of the technology .
both Glint , as well as convergence , will provide their software as a service , given the companies &apos; periodic fees for using their products .
this is a model of business and the opportunity that has a venture capital investors who have been based on the approval of both start @-@ ups .
the convergence programme was funded in February 10 of USD 10 million , such as Sapphire Ventures and the Capital of Customs Capital , by increasing USD 47 million .
in November , USD 10 million of the Bessemer Venture partners , by increasing the total funding of a company from 60 million dollars .
such investments will not come as a surprise when taking into account the link between companies , culture and venture capital .
more research shows that modern workers are waiting for more than before .
in the competition markets , as Silicis Valley , it is high salaries and interest projects are merely on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and values and that they will devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to know that they are being heard and that the work they are doing , they are more committed , they are more committed to ensuring the success of a company , &apos; said Nina McQueen , who is the general benefit of the general benefit and the group of the Glint , Mr McQueen , who is using this convergence as a cencenti as the Gliner .
investors earn revenue if companies belonging to their portfolio will go well ; businesses are doing well , if the workers are committed and involved .
if the third party analysts the tools allow to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , then we do not believe that these support .
there is an important issue for the involvement of the data on the involvement of workers in the field of worker .
however , these data are useless if you are not going to follow up with the company .
in fact , if the company is asking for feedback from their staff , the expectations we expect to face .
and if there is not enough change , or not , it may cause disappointment and to reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask 4 000 proposals , you have to be prepared for 4 000 interviews , &quot; said in consultation and business management in Kotter International President Rusrore International President Rusrows , who have seen how companies are making a mistake to rely on too many data collection .
&apos; because if things do not go to the end , the workers think : &apos; does you really hear me heard ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why I should care ? &apos;
according to Erretti , the Netherlands , which is now organising six studies , has been possible to implement measures at the same day when the problem has been reported by Glins .
as well as the quality of the decision @-@ making and communication of decision makers , it was possible to reorganise several teams from the company in the enterprise and to provide problems to tackle communication training .
however , the presence of the Rude a new data on workers is collected , and it is hoped that in the long term , it will lead to the longer @-@ term commitment of workers in the industry , which is well known in terms of their large labour flows .
&quot; if you do not have a commitment to ensuring transparency , you will lose the people , &apos; Mr Vitrano .
&quot; and if you lose the people , you will lose the customer .
and if you lose the customer , you will lose the hands of companies . &quot;
the staggering mark of the euro area is the Baltic Sea : income increases rapidly
while the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic region , three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the Western Europe , writes , in referring to the European Central Bank &apos;s report .
according to the ECB since 1999 , production of the economy has exceeded the expectations of the population in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
there is a low debt burden , a rapid improvement in the institutions and business and free @-@ market policy .
&quot; the Baltic States , in one of Slovakia , have a few of the countries in the euro area , where there has been a significant convergence of the EU &apos;s focus on the world , the Central Bank announced .
although the aim is that the economy is to be treated with an equal footing with the West Europe , in 2015 , in the Baltic economy , the total product of the Baltic economy was just 2 / 3 15 of the average of 15 / 3 countries , who were in the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle .
low wages have led to the baltlas to seek a better wage from abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light , and the economy is growing this year , local residents are not enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer , only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies will be very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it thought that it was slightly less than those questioned by the economies of their countries .
NCAA decision to repeal two times a trend in the event of a long @-@ term trend in Bruinsi days
it is almost 23 at the moment when throg funds for the footballs of the JLA football club will come to talk to the middle of a team university in the middle of a new haven .
some of them have made a burden on the swake , revealing its work on the first day of the efforts of his camp .
for a large part of the team , they will provide a close to a minute from one day .
the players involved in the course of the Kurds are going to go back to a joint living end after a three @-@ hour trend , prior to the return of the Wac&apos;s , at 6.30 meetings at the next morning at 6.30 meetings .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Bruinmes Jim Mora , Jim Mora , before the Monday after Monday .
NCAA decision to abolish the burden of players in order to reduce the burden of players two days is , in fact , a long @-@ term delay - at least until the end of an end @-@ up to one half of Friday .
for the first time , the UCLA was the first time to start at 19.15 , so that they fit for the already dense of players .
the transition to a question of trepidation a day means more than one trend - the beginning of the Bruinmes raised the start of the last season , compared to the previous season , almost a half of the Mora &apos;estwsy season , and for the first time the Mora Mora &apos;estwsy season will take place during the first time .
they have until 20 August plan to 18 trends , before the official preparatory start will start in September to be adopted by Texas A &amp; M in September .
he says that he is in favour of the rules of change in NCAA , although it adds one item to the closer players in the schedules .
&quot; they have a huge burden on these three or four days , and it is a serious challenge , &apos; Mora .
&quot; and they break themselves through this challenge ; they are trying to get young people .
I believe that if you arrive on Saturday and we have more time , it is really a few . &apos;
if the camp is closed , UCLA will be closed down , which is not an easy task , given the clear view of their publications and by the middle of the Luskini Centre , a higher @-@ class hotels , which have already been the gateway to bypass a football sag in the middle of a football .
since the weekend , the hotels played by the Bruinsi playing field , but Mora admitted that problems can arise during the time of free tobacco .
&quot; we implement security measures , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; this is a real concern , and it has not been exaggerated to think that people can rent and trained to filry .
if a record has been recorded , it may be a good deal to do so .
but we use there and on 8 parking lines for the security team .
we will do our utmost by using the best .
I will try not to worry about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
at the end of the VAT union , the Association of Avanova @-@ Ivanova , the USSR , the militia party , Mrs Ojuland and the ECB , have to leave in the hands of the Our Tallinn and party , which will be forced to sign up to Mrs Kaljts , the establishment of an Our , Tallinn , which has been created at the initiative of the European elections on the initiative , in Tallinn , in the course of the working parties in party politics , at least as much as parties in party politics .
however , it is considered to be considered in the autumn , and the key issue can be , whether it is not sufficiently disappointed to all of them .
who will remain with SavD ?
if a small drop has been reduced by Edgar Sawaare , the support of his election can be seen in the event of his election .
one member of the whole of the country , some former and the current central party and a lot of unknown faces - whether this is the composition of the electoral union ?
and is the reason why , in Tallinn , in Tallinn , some Savare faithful to proventing some of the Saoare and a friend , can look at the list of manufacturers &apos; Saofare , which is headed by corruption and the suspicion of corruption , is becoming a reality ?
in the city of the Swiss Government , the Swiss Government &apos;s film @-@ owned musicio Eckery , which participates in the town of Syrimäe , who participates in the age of children , and in every sense computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas has to take place in horse driving , in order to prevent the first time in the day @-@ to @-@ wing and orchyman , whether it seeks the first time to return to the 16th edition of the elections to the middle of the day .
we look forward to what is the vision of the political parties in the youth campaign .
if the second part of the channel 2 or TV3 look at the case of August , there are two options : to accept that , in future , there will be only the ETV , the ETV + , ETV + , Tallinn TV and English France24 France24 channels or surrender every month to television operators .
it is probably also that those who openly welcome the free television experience at the beginning , but finally , even though the reluctance of the television and advertisements pay .
the concentration of music , the people and those who have been deprived of the rhythm , who have left the people and who have been left to the streets , have a need for more musicious practices .
however , if you do not want to become a part of the nature , it is worth going to go at home rather than being painted at home instead - and to sleep for the amount of the Coptic figure for the sleep .
Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
media quotation quotes by President Donald Trumpi , saying that the new US immigration plan , which makes the Green Card rules .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year to 50 000 people a year , more stringent rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have proposed the republics and the President will support them .
the draft legislation goes to debate in the two chamber of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increases the salaries and save billions of taxpayers &apos; money , as it makes the way the US citizens issuing green maps for the citizens of other countries .
the law will reduce the chain and replace the current programme .
the new application process will give the candidates who speak English and who have the funds to support their own economy and skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Trug with the media publications of the United States .
Siberian young people move the city of cities , pensioners .
Anayyev Anayyev , it was continuing to hear the famous Maana of the River Maana of the river .
he works in 140 kilometres away from the Maana Kuek Kuwait gold driver .
this is a tough job : two months of increasing rest days , and then only 10 days at home , and once again , only ten days ago .
in three years , Anatel has been working for just one once .
&quot; there is a lot of checks at the time : in passing , it will be thoroughly checked that , as a reference , it would not lead to , and going to take place in order to do not , the Anatols will speak .
Mare Piho is coming from the Haida village in the village of Jaik , who has talked a great deal of memory of the memory of the family in Siberia .
there has also been a staggering articic culture of a dozen armiic culture , as it will also affect the home , because it is simply a shambing , thinks the most of the paragraphs investigated the Piho Mare in the most important way .
his first study in Siberia is passed this year by 30 years .
during this time , it has been there for 14 times and lived there .
how much has been brought up by Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century in order to get land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 80,000 .
I have taken note of the rumours of the Siberian opto , who have also thought about it .
it is very difficult to say , because at that time , one group could have to come up to 30 people , but the passport was only received .
the passport was only given one , but they were children , sisters .
look at how much it was a territory here .
this was a number of times greater historical , Setomy .
after all , it was necessary to be able to manage , in any way .
it has come here as a farmer , but the change of their lives , because there was a change in the regions that were not only involved in agriculture , but also in rivers , the gold mining , industry .
for example , in New York , many sedogs went to work in the town of Krasnojsk in Krasdier @-@ 45 ( construction of the Soviet power plant - J. P.) , when it was formed .
is there a majority of the population here in the region at the time ?
yes , they lived in a commuting way .
in addition , a long tradition of aid is maintained , and the great nature of a child .
seven @-@ eight children were commonplace .
how much culture of Siberia is different and that is different from that country ?
they are different , although what was brought here was never the same .
they led to a great deal of money .
they also made themselves ( shadow ideas ) , but they always make a distinction between what was made and what was done here .
climate change was strongly affected by the traditional rivalry , because here is a cold one .
the return has been made .
for example , Setomaal meat , but here , it was simply frozen .
where is the villages of Siberian villages and which live there ? / graphics : Alari Palun
the link with the mother to the mother was very strong , it was considered very important .
it seems to me that it is now beginning to come back there .
these girls who have lived in the family here have listened to the amazing stories .
Piho must mean the people of Estonia &apos;s delegation who came to Haida at the beginning of July , and had four days in homes in the Kingdom of Haida , J. P .
what is happening here is a brave one .
&quot; it is very easy to come to a call for , and also to go , because the city has an excellent location : the rail divide and road traffic at the crossroads of the roads , says Tapn from Reigo Tamm , Reigo Tamm .
the city is no longer just a long way for a military capital , we have a lot of creativity , sports and cultural areas , and the ball can be at every time .
the ball is a city of motorway !
the current white river on the ground is a small island of an island where the ordinary hunt can be considered .
&quot; this beautiful train does not seem to be in the wake of the Reigo .
who is not afraid of the cold water , it can be flooded in the river , because the river is full of sources .
I have been flooding there , and I am going to do .
the river on water then can be considered and simply to do a romant - can be flowing through the river , and to think about the lives of the river .
I am also there in my own foot .
Ooperister , in Tampere , has been the most of the three varieties of the river , in addition to the three varieties of the river , and that it is a place at the city of the city , no one may come from any objection to the stories of the saying &apos; .
&quot; Männia will open an eye on the TD , but there is also a health of health , where there can be a drink , a summer , and now , for example , to play a golf path - the golf path has been done , the borrowers can be borrowed from sport . &apos; .
the old professional activities there are , of course , of course , of course , but I have not yet play there .
we must obviously call on Mr Tapt Tapda guests , because he has experienced the presence of cooter games and , and he has , there is a chain .
he is lending to me .
Reigo and Mänder were inseparable from the current oults of childhood .
at least a few hundred hours .
there is a lot of tears to this memory , disappointment and rest of my sports life .
not to mention the collapse of the fire and the summer .
&quot; the whole centre is now full of building works , all of this will become the case , endorses Reigo .
however , it is a very attractive place for the old and tired world , however , where there is a tendency to play in oral discoveries .
I am pleased that in 2012 R.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.M , the head of my idea was adopted by Mrs Meos , and in his communications , the summer communications had to be done .
although this year &apos;s communications season &apos; Karenning Karenin &apos; , it has just been carried out , on 11 August , &quot; Eliärm &apos; , when the age of the ancient Union is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; 11 @-@ 13 August and &quot; 11 @-@ 13 August is the day of the city of Tapa , which has been wrought by open building sites , and will take place events in rivals , among other things , as well as the winners of the Reigo , the Reigo , who recommends just a revisit of the city in the days of 9 years .
by 1 May , on 1 May , the museum has already been in 1994 .
&quot; the house is a small , but a great deal is well and information is very much , and the fact that the Reigo holds the history of TD full of the city of Tapa of the city , which is a larger proportion of the focus on the rail and war .
Reigo fairs , if there are all the proposed sites to be carried out by the TD , the long distance empty , but fortunately the city of young children is full .
&quot; we have a good number of feed and cavis when we sit sitting in the cavis , that there is sometimes a feeling that you are going abroad .
well @-@ educated and young people , who have come to TSale , spend a lot of time in woods to bind in TSs , which has a feeling of rubber , that there is a feeling that in Estonia and its homes in Estonia , but the transformation of the international community together .
I believe that it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans .
the authors , yes , we will move a lot !
in Greece , two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tracing .
Telekanal bTV quoted a Ministry of Foreign Affairs who announced that two Bulgarians were taken in place in Greece for the arrest of the illegal axis .

the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on the free axis and are already imposing severe fines for all those who are not in place in order to do so .

the wolars teach the wolars of sheep .
the farmers &apos; farmers have to give their herds once again since this year , in addition to the wolaration of the junta , who apparently taught the wolars of the junta that have already fallen a number of sheep .
this year , the junta has broken the lamb of sheep from three times , together 23 sheep and injured over eight , writes , Hiiu &apos;s visit .
the soil was only three years earlier , a year before .
the birth of Murdult is also the environmental Agency &apos;s data in order to wash the junta on the lamb of Hifin and Hiiuland for information that this year has been fixed on the island of the junta .
on the eve of Monday , the junta broke up on Emsenta to Kabul , as Emthetic Kabm , and was injured from 18 to 18 survivors .
in the wake of three days , the junta collapsed in the village of Reangles , one of the others who had been hard to have to be done , which had to be made in an emergency .
rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Department of the Health of the world sent out a Code of Conduct on the environment of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and the draft law amending law on plant protection products .
the change of law is being abandoned both for the locations of genetically modified ( GM ) , for the cultivation of GM ( GM ) , in a separate basis for the use of plant health registers .
in addition , the GM crops will be changed to have the obligation to have a prior agreement with the radio apiculture sector .
although at present , GM crops are not grown in Estonia , we need to see the existence of clear rules on the coexistence of GM and non @-@ crops .
this at least once again , as long as there is no decision @-@ free to declare Estonia &apos;s GMO @-@ free , the President of the Department of the Ministry of Economics , Sigmar .
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , into account both private and public sector costs and the administrative burden , added to mouth .
the draft law repeals the provisions of GM crops for GM crops and the handling of the data management of GM crops , establishes the management of GM crops and the requirements for starting economic activity .
in terms of specific apiculture , the cultivation of GM crops is being replaced by the EU &apos;s current obligation to inform beekeepers in the process of increasing the cultivation of GM crops before the cultivation of beekeepers to produce an appropriate agreement .
the draft law has been sent to the Ministry of coordination .
all interested parties have the opportunity to see this in the draft information system and , if they want , to submit their opinion on the world Department .
the proposed changes will , in particular , affect persons operating in the area of plant farming , beekeepers and agriculture .
in the European Union , including Estonia , it is permitted to increase only one of the GM crops , Mr mon 810 .
however , no Estonian farmer &apos;s interest is not expected to grow GM farmers .
the reason is that , in Estonia , it does not occur in a machine , the European system of media , on which mon 810 resistance .
it is also the case for the southern regions and that , in May , it is not an appropriate basis for the southern regions and in May .
in order to obtain confidence in the world , the Ministry of the world has commissioned an investigation in the event of a possible GM @-@ GM organisms in Estonia and 2016 , the seeds of maize and boxes .
the results of the samples have shown that seeds are not included in seeds and a study concluded that Estonia has grown in Estonia , maize and boxes , the seeds of maize and boxes .
the latter may , in turn , conclude that in Estonia , it knowingly not cultivated to genetically modified crops , as well as confirmed that there has been no accident .

&apos;she needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genian thinking - he has a football despair , &apos; said Mourinho .
&quot; we will help him to achieve a form as soon as possible . &quot;

the ponal of the White House went to cost taxpayers thousands of
in accordance with the letter of military documents , the decision of the White House went to air shipping with the last month of the World Bank for the European taxpayer , with a view to the adoption of a &quot; helicopter &quot; of EUR 24 000 for the European taxpayer .
the Green and White Projects of Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , which is referred to as Mrs One of the World of Madesti , was presented at the time of 17 July Valty Maneeded Projects of an event which has taken place on 17 July , Valo .
the President Donald Trug , Vice @-@ President Mike Pence and the White House higher than the Commission had been on the basis of a shift in the industrial products of 50 states .
Connecticutis , a helicopter built on helicopters , has been built together with a reputation of hunt , Wisconsina and Mistakein .
Helicopcopter Squadron Ms Helicopter Squadris Squadris Squadris , according to the one ( HMX @-@ 1 ) documents called for the presence of the White House on helicopters , perhaps FARGO @-@ ga 36 hours prior to the &apos; unusual &apos; event for the south of the South .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is unusual for a great deal of events , &apos; said HMX @-@ 1 komandör Day before the event of e @-@ mail in the event of e @-@ mail in the field of e @-@ mail in the field of aviation .
the message was stated that helicopter arrives in the south of 17 at 7 : at 15 o &apos;clock in the morning of 17 January , and remains to be held until the same evening , on the same evening , between 18 and 21 .
the added thing was the fact that , if Vincest departure should be the case , it is necessary for a second edition of the restrictions on working hours .
the original air crew had been held at helicopter during the event , and the escater champion of the security team near aircraft is close to the rest of this surface .
it was not possible to read the documents given to this document , if you were at the end of the elephpail in the end .
the Hatch law prohibits the use of federal workers to use the government &apos;s assets for political purposes .
the documents show that HMX @-@ 1 examined whether this event can be breached .
&quot; we asked whether this is a breach of the Hatch law , and we were told that there is no rice , &apos; he wrote &apos; commander &apos; .
&quot; it seems that you have no choice , &apos; with a leading sacrifice .
the White House declared the event &apos; in America &apos;s &apos; official event &apos; in America , and the Hatch Act was not covered .
but even official events are political zones .
the event has supported the efforts of the health reform in the Senate at the time when we discuss health reform and approved the government &apos;s regulations to keep the government &apos;s regulations .
the name of One or Air Task Force under the one @-@ out aircraft of one @-@ owned aircraft is not a matter of a new one , a new phenomenon .

&quot; the White Maon has a very good pleasure &apos; in America &apos;s &apos; prepared &apos; in America , where products from all 50 states which have been represented by American American American American workers , &quot; said the White House of America , the call for the press release of Walters .
HMX @-@ 1 crews are often in the Washington region and the south @-@ east of the south , so that the American President of the United States has been able to try to carg a cent of the white house of the President .
if , at the beginning of the G20 summit in Germany at the G20 summit in Germany , HMX @-@ 1 was organised by the HMX @-@ 1 White House .
according to an agreement , the flight from the flight to the flight of &apos; aircraft crew &apos; was considered to be the norm in America . &quot;
the Eskar helicopters fly at the time , in addition to 11 hours , &apos; non @-@ promotional support missions &apos; .
the White House said that no other of the other events have failed to burden the wallets of taxpayers .
the Sikorsky representative , according to the Sikorsky representative , was not in a company with helicopter management .
HMX @-@ 1 does not maintain the precise costs of the President &apos;s flights , and the precise costs are difficult to find out .
however , at the hour of the Ministry of Defence in 2017 , VH @-@ 3$ in charge of compensation for reimbursement of € 24 380 dollars on air .
the Eskar &apos;s documents were pointed out in the course of the distance &apos;s basic base from the Quantico airport from Kinia , on both sides of 30 minutes .
the White House states that the actual cost of using helicopters is a great deal of money .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; costs , on the basis of the estimated compensation rates , are very misleading , &quot; said Walters .
&quot; these estimated compensation rates contain staff , maintenance and many other irreversible costs , which will be taken into account for each year &apos;s annual appropriations . &quot;
the 2015 departure from the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation rates for personnel costs , but they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former press representative of the White House Sean Sluer was defended at the time in the event of helicopter use at the time .
&quot; the idea is to show things that this week in America , &apos; said Spicer .
&quot; and I know that Sikorsky and Connecticuti State state is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are still hundreds of thousands of people whose work depends on this .
and I believe that exactly as the majority of the Americans , we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment on which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether the disability of Trug in the south of the event in the south of the event is a helicopter , or not , but the fire car was anchored by it .
in the White Maneeded , Trug Sikorsky , representatives of Trug Sikorsky , spends a joke in the personal aircraft of the company in his personal aircraft .
&quot; I feel very well in Sikorská , &apos; said President , &apos; I have three products . &quot;
Good Šadeiko - tearate arrivals for peace and joy
the 2011 MMs Daek hit Šadedes in the last area of Zadedes , 800 m drinks , and a stadium was transferred from the stadium .
immediately before it was , it has received a long @-@ distance leap in China in China .
the early 2012 Helsinki formula for low @-@ cost injuries , but in London , it received 60 @-@ 13 points on 23 seats .
however , it continued .
the 2013 Moscow MMdel received an open day after the opening day of Estonia , which had been a champion of injury in the wake of Estonia &apos;s time .
two years later he received the Beijing MMs 15 seat and played an Olympic chm , but it was a disappointment of sportspeople .
in the strongest terms , Sadeiko , Sadeiko has only been carried out , if not at the beginning the Amsterdam EEMIS had not received a letter .
I would just like to put together a proper multitest competition .
once again , Mr Šadeiko .
worse , there was still a month later : a month later on which his Olympic contest has already been a first barrier due to its Olympic Games .
the time had to be taken - is there to continue with the seven competition ?
is it worth all the two days in the effort ?
there was long time , but there was a peace .
I have been able to think about it .
this experience is relatively difficult to describe , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympic Games were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , it was time that itself can be treated as a whole , and it is worth thinking .
&quot; I am aware that I am not going to speak on the slogan , Mr Šadeiko will talk about his self @-@ determination .
I received a clean smile , and to move forward with a new season .
you have said that , according to Mrs Anne hill , negligence was very difficult to look at the suffering , but he understood that , above all , the athletes themselves must be able to make it clear .
he was in favour of all the breadings of this .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&apos;Good but he said that he does not give up and it wants to prove what it deserves to be .
there is now some kind of peace .
he is doing this in joy .
the right to conduct came back in May , when the Cadeiko set a new Estonian revelation in the Götzjan multi @-@ competitive new Estonian record .
at a high level competition , she improved personal excellence in the heat of nearly metre ( 13.89 ) , and spent a record of an obstacle to a record of time .
then there was a multi @-@ competitive and , that it is not at all the ability of the capacity , but only the primary contest was removed .
for many years , I have pointed out that Mrs Kadeo is a black student .
he is ready for athletes , it is good to go .
if nothing is done or is wrong , then he says it now .
he feels self @-@ owned and trust in its own .
that is what we must .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we follow it .
the new approach has also been established by Šadec .
&quot; I do not have one who is going to make maximum use of the trend , he will speak and say that the most important thing is the right to be reprised , because it also ensures a good result .
Cordkeylow babies will be rejoice
the good emotions have also been offered to the saybley of the Šadekole .
both his former nurturing Maram Maris commemorated by Grete has recently received infanticide , and have received support from weather citizens .
&quot; quite interesting &apos; , it has been a word , Mr Šadedes .
one alcohol , which is the equivalent of &apos; nursery &apos; is equivalent . &quot;
Mr Livastrong writes that Dr Gordon perd Gordon me is so high in wine , so that it believes - on wine , can be better trained than any other in the world .
Yale is a neuroscientist in Ya &apos;i .
his message is not a matter not about alcohol or how it is influenced by our feelings and ideas , but instead of &apos; very active &apos; , the cleansing of wine .
trusting it by the Kase nuk , in the complexity of wine , with the enjoyment of it , and we perceive our aiding work in order to create a taste in wine .
there is no fact , according to Sheperdi , does not actually provide taste for a taste , but a taste of taste , how wine is stimulated .
he will lead to a reference to the way &apos; sees &apos; colour &apos; .
&apos;Main is not in wine , taste for wine , &quot; says Sheperd .
it is , for example , that of the meat that is being affected by wine is , for example , our vanus , let us , and even coal , which the person produces .
there is , of course , that wine is not , of course , that the wine is full .
&quot; there must be more &apos; activities &apos; , says he .
if you have too much , the system is overcrowded .
excessive drinking in wine can be done , rather than the time , that the 2004 study will risk people who drink over three sites to wine , the loss of the balance , and reduced mental capacities .
10 % of Estonian ICT workers receive fewer than colleagues from colleagues

according to the UN , the role of Afghans depends on the role of Afghans in politics
the head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play their role .
Mr Haysom head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , Nicholas Haysom said that hundreds of women are nominated for the local Soviet elections , three women are nominated as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of the newly registered voters .
&quot; women &apos;s role in underlining the importance of the role of women cannot be exaggerated , &apos; he said on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women are fully and involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the Afghan local elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections are taking place on 5 April .
the Taliban have been threatened by the Taliban , which coincides with a transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes a adviser .
the election of this year will mark the first time when the power will be given calm over the one democratically elected government .
according to the fact , the strong role of women will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the Afghan independent electoral Commission , 3.6 million women have registered a sample of EUR 3.6 million .
it is a pleasure to make every case , both in large and small and small .
there is always too few of the common time , but the trend will give a good opportunity to combine meeting , a game , proximity and burden .
and what inconvenient solution - wherever you dared in the summer , live living in the fool , is always accompanied by a reminder of their fine vote : &apos; we are now doing a trend ! &apos;
it is a normal game , a very good piece of gold , or bypass the flag of the coast .
this is the foundation of a permanent foundation in the form of shoes and tracks , who , then , would like to take shape over the past from the summer ?
it is good to use children instead of their children .
firstly , it is a secure and convenient , fat is growing at the same pace as nurturing and forces .
it will also be able to do with large numbers of large children .
the child will strike a balance , things are repeating and feel the possibility of a high @-@ profile and important thing .
higher children can , at the same time , make it up .
the scale of the movement in place is put in place , and you are going to hold a sickle .
the fingers directly , the mini @-@ abfully to keep the mini @-@ abfully .
the child can read the koruna and feel self @-@ trained .
the planet is a very high , but a hopeless exercise for a child .
however , it is easy to do this .
take the game : take a long planted coloni , a long @-@ planh of which has been carried out .
in fact , more difficult , but much more than a lot to do if , in the meantime , there can be a friend , in the meantime .
the burden of the burden may be plants to be prevented , tearing , tears , and in this respect .
in addition , it may be a child to sit back to the child , but this exercise offers an end to all children .
at the same time , while the cracks in the sand will get the burden of trival , ash and air meat , such as infection .
the child will pass on the hands that his body is equally committed and behind .
the market can be kept in place .
all walking and sickles directly .
I will be able to fly , to be able to fly , to try to balance the balance and the difficulty .
small nurturing life is an equivalent way if he will be able to come with a small scale .
the additional burden will give the shoes up to the shoes .
control in order to ensure that it is a permanent neutrality .
children themselves have a great deal of air meat , with a number of uprising meat .
the work of the village and the batteries of the wool .
follow the security of the child , the situation of contempt , and a reg of neutrality in a neutral manner .
all children &apos;s favourite and large numbers of all children !
at the same time , a truly effective trend in the entire body .
sports funds were Oatty ( 10 ) , Säde ( 8 ) , congratulations ( 4 ) .
in the Philippines a wide range of the world , i.e. a journey of moefs to the heart of the motto
in the light of these sites , there are also the summer classroom , which has become in its own way in recent years , which has to be in the right way to the end of the day , which has , at the right time , has been at hand in the way , and which has managed to seize the price label in the shops in spite of its modest origin , regardless of its modest origin .
the red lines have apparently been one of the things that have been in place in a position of time , which has not been in place and that has not had a particular emotion .
it is simply there , and if there is no , there is nothing to see .
now , however , there is a real victory for a real victory , and the motive bullets have been in their own house during the summer ballot box against the fringes in the summer season .
however , this is not only at all of the coastline , but today it is as popular as a jobless street , and more courageous women are doing it even in the office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear whether such a summer , which is still being held in the summer , or it is worth noting and spans in a more official way .
there is a wealth of credit , but the real summer love of women has done .
for example , reading for foreign moiles , for example , the first thing is that the motto will be in the first place , that the motto is the first thing to bring about the first thing to the local market and acquire themselves with a number of beds to which you have a long period of time , and which will be accompanied by the ground , and as a friend in the city , on the market and as a friend .
some bloggers are even so generous that they buy homes from the market to a large junta and sell them with their loyalty to their loyal reading .
it is worth pointing out that there is a demand for bickbags among readers , so that women in the world are likely to include women ( and men in the world - probably to include one each other &apos;s fishing area , so that some homes were happy to receive their property .
in some ways , it is also understandable , because it is the case that they are repeated when it is possible to buy a lot of money from one of the few euros in the fashion yesterday .
it is true that the cabinet shops have discovered a simple currency , and so as to sell away from the luxury of a brands of luxury bags and EUR 1 000 .
obviously , in order to do so , that the richer customers should not feel easy to know who are going to proment the low @-@ cost .
for example , it is possible to buy the Dolce &amp; Gabbang to shoulder with the payment of a thousand euro .
however , the interpretation of the Chanty @-@ begkow is the case with 6 000 .
however , unlike most of the motto , there will not be no cots to shoulder with some of the high motives of Cape Verde , but it was the beginning of the day .
it is , in fact , come from the beans of the Philippines , which are very far removed from the Philippines , from which they have received a broad range of .
the sites were coded in particular , in particular , the export business and the local people are very often not able to see .
Admittedly , the 14th century of mails come from a noble technology and is quite a series of normal flames .
however , since it does not need to be in red tape , as well as a repetition , they can be found on the ground and other materials that are being made more personal and by a more personal nature .
in recent times , for example , it is particularly trendous on the colours of coloured coloured pains or leather coloured .
however , the letter can be paid in particular to the acuatar , Jane Burma , the largest red befans had not been expected before .
it agreed to shoulder all possible musleries , and did not even have to go along with the Cannes Film Festival .
however , with the popular popularity today , it does not play a lower role , but also that caring for them is that they are behaving and , unlike all other other items , there will be no need to care about special means , but also the water and the tyranny .
as in the case of the trend , there has been a classical interpretation of the brands , as is still a classic case , in addition to a classic case .
for example , there can be a red rockery in the event , for example , in the event of a drop in a tiny garden .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classic beer is not going to go on a mockery , on beage .
but what is the classic thing ?
for centuries , there has been a classic set of shoes , which resembles from a classic case , which resembles my style , is open and it is short , as well as to shoulder , sancably .

GMB concerns investment in the McVitiw factory in Glasgow
the unions are waiting for a mature production and McVitie from the leadership of the long @-@ term plans of the company Glasgow .
Mr GMB Scotland , saying it is a company to remain silent on the future of the investment in the point of the customs .
there are more than 500 people produced in Hobnobsi and rich , and other products , work more than 500 people .
the McVitie owner , Plain , said , that they have invested GBP 5 million over the last few years .
the workers and trade union chairmen who have been employed are the first to hear about a plant in the activities of the plant .
in the letter sent to the company &apos;s objects , GMB Scotland called McVitie , the McVitie side , called McVitie &apos;s concerns as regards the lack of use of production routes . &quot;
GMB senior organiso Drew Duffy Duffy said : &apos; the fact that we cannot clarity from the head of the name from the case of the Customs needs and the future investment plan for the future investment plan puts our members deeply concerned .
several generations have been working here , and the workforce is made up of a large number of local community and Glasgow , as an essential pillar in order to ensure decent employment in the region where unemployment is high and there is a social regression .
so , the Glasgow , the job of the East , needs to be in terms of jobs , pay and well @-@ being , and in the context of chronic damage to the production of production in the light of the chronic damage of the production of the Brexwas , and the chronic damage of production in the context of production . &quot;
the representative of the Plae representative said : &apos; the leader of the &apos; Customs &apos; project became a letter from GMB Scott only yesterday , and a company complies with him directly , as we appreciate an active relationship with the workers and the trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the representatives of workers and GMB representatives , which discussed open a number of problems .
we discussed the workers , as all the companies operating in the extremely competitive climate in the most extreme climate , look at their activities - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure that their competitiveness is in place .
he added : &apos; in recent years we have invested GBP 5 million in the customs plan , a majority of this has gone in the production lines and the improvement of operations .
we fully understand the customs agreement as a production of production sites and if there should be any changes , the workers and trade union representatives are the first to hear about this . &quot;
would the PSG warned from Barcelona for three years ago on the approach ?
the sitting can regret its interest in Marco Verratti .
the Paris Saint @-@ Mmain does not give up in its quest to attract Somd to their ranks by making GBP 189 million to provide GBP 9 million , but were they warned from Barcelona for three years ago ?
this bubble approach has opened up to the transitional window , and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break up more than double buying from the current world record , which was set last season by Paul Pogba for the return of Paul Pogba for Manchester Uniteba .
if the transition is completed , Somelfrom can result in the world &apos;s most expensive player and , at the same time , the highest @-@ paid professional athletes in the world who will get GBP 500 000 per week after taxes .
the Barcelona has said such a way of outrage , as a result of the liberation of Mrs Neymarz &apos;s free fraction , even though Catalansi is a source of football , so that the club is a club of football since its Santoz arrivals in 2013 .
however , does the PSG President warned that three years ago , for such an opportunity ?
if in Manchester , a Blaise of Matutis in 2014 has shown an interest in concluding an agreement , warned Mr Nasser Al @-@ Khelaif severely all clubs who think about the best players in the name of a couple of the PSG .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that if they affect some of our players , then we are taking them against them and take contact with players , &apos; said Al @-@ Khelaif .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they must face the consequences . &quot;
the Barcelona seems to have taken over from this limit , since Spain &apos;s club showed an interest in the position of the PG of the G20 in the summer and the Marco Verratti .
the PSG made it clear that they do not allow them to leave and that the Barcelona can result in a setback as a result of its interest , by abolishing one of its more expensive assets .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges and not borders .
&quot; Brexit is seriously threatened between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Britain and Ireland , warned Varadkar in the first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who can benefit from this . &quot;
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made possible , and the free movement of goods , has been made possible by Varadkar .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : to build bridges , not borders , it emphasised .
according to early cari , he would prefer Britain to be part of the European Union , and because it is not the inability to stay part of the European common market .
this would be retained between the Irish Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
the second option to make Britain more semore @-@ off would be the creation of the Union and the United Kingdom &apos;s customs union , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
while noting that such an agreement with Turkey , the Varadkar , the Varadkar , he said that we could have such a British one . &quot;
the alternative to this would be a return to customs points that would be a historic division and political failure .
&quot; show trade , prosperity and peace , &apos; said Irish Prime Minister .
he mentioned the challenge of our generation of Brixitit , &quot; and warned that the result may affect the daily lives of Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met Belfast in visiting the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland .
