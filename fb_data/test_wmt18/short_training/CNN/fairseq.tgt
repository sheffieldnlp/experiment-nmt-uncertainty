four members of the K@@ ase ro@@ vo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to a postal newspaper , in Spain , the so @-@ called K@@ ho@@ ro@@ vo leader , S@@ lava Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch , who is known as S@@ lava K@@ enn@@ ro@@ v@@ ski , who is known in the criminal world under S@@ pin@@ ro@@ v@@ ski .
the Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ y@@ ch arrested in Spain was arrested on the Court &apos;s list .
yesterday , the court also seized three suspi@@ cious arrests in Estonia .
according to suspicion , these are so @-@ called &apos; K@@ ho@@ ro@@ vo &apos; members of the Community for the age of 27 to 57 years of age , committing mainly to drug crimes .
in the Spanish province of M@@ etro@@ province , the alleged leader of the criminal community was arrested .
in Estonia three men were detained as a suspect , one of which is a criminal figure for criminal data collected , and two are criminal members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicates that organised tasks and roles were clearly identified in the criminal community .
the objective of the actual Community action was to commit to drug crime and thus to generate criminal benefits , &quot; commented the head of the criminal proceedings , the head of the pre @-@ trial procedure , the Public Prosecutor .
&quot; we do not rule out that there is an increase in the number of suspects involved in this criminal offence . &quot;
these are people who have been involved in the interests of law enforcement authorities in the past , and some of them have been punished for drug offences .
Mrs underlined that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high on the whole duration of the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become the norm for us and the operation of this week shows the success of the cooperation , &quot; commented the Public Prosecutor .
the head of the criminal police department , Mr Le@@ is , said that the detention was preceded by an ongoing investigation of nearly one and a half years .
&quot; a long time ago in the first half of this week , a great deal of success was realised and we observed the &apos; , said , in parallel with Estonia and Spain .
in Le@@ is , the officers of the central criminal police were helpful in detention in Spain .
for years now we have a good contact and understanding between the Spanish police and the civilian Guard .
these arrests are yet another message to criminals that we can also get them from another European Swe@@ de , &quot; said Le@@ is .
the information that has been collected so far is clear that , when there is a free stay , men can continue to carry out new crimes , which is why the prosecution and the court of the prosecution has also been approved by the court .
a man arrested in Spain is waiting for his release to Estonia .
under this criminal law , property , vehicles and cash cash have been seized in order to ensure confiscation .
the pre @-@ trial procedure in the criminal case is conducted through a central criminal police organised crime office and leads the Public prosecution Service .
the Mun@@ ici@@ pality of Tallinn in S@@ lava Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch found guilty of blackmail in 2005 and punished him with five years &apos; imprisonment .
in the middle of last decade , Mr Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch was considered the second me@@ tre of the world &apos;s most important place in the criminal world .
the Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ y@@ ch from Cape Verde rose from the beginning of the 1990s when he started to engage in the tor@@ tures in Tallinn .
he has allegedly taxed tax@@ i leaders and prostitu@@ tes in the various ho@@ tels and called for a monthly ro@@ ck tax on business men .
international joint operations , confiscation of proceeds of criminal assets and court rulings confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest judgments , the so @-@ called criminal prosecution of the so @-@ called criminal community , confis@@ cating EUR 80 000 in criminal assets , or a judgment against nine individuals in that the Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v established a criminal community in 2006 aimed at smuggling illegal cigarette smuggling and trafficking in crime in the East Vir@@ u@@ land and South Estonia .
there are nearly EUR 71 500 in the form of a secret criminal income .
in these criminal matters , it has ensured that police officers exchange information with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and that the public Prosecutor will prove evidence and , if necessary , to carry out actions in any country of the European Union .
the Citizens &apos; Group war@@ ns the mission for travelling to the scene .
the organisation of the Ad@@ ath of Ad@@ van@@ red People of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ S ) has warned about a discriminatory policy and racist attacks against the State of the State of O@@ ver@@ a .
the non @-@ scri@@ pt statement states : &apos; the State of the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i State , issued in the State of NA@@ S@@ our@@ i , which applies until 28 August 2017 , calls on all the American travellers , visitors and mis@@ fortune , to be particularly attentive and extremely careful in moving around the entire state , given the whole wave of suspi@@ cious racial events , which have taken place over recent times , as well as pointed out .
according to NA@@ S , the group issued a warning to the &apos; travel warning &apos; , so recent Mis@@ tral law , which makes discrimination more difficult to win cases when it comes to the fact that the country &apos;s repeated targets for law enforcement are unequal in large respects .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being infringed .
they are pul@@ led because of their sk@@ in colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said R@@ od Cha@@ pel newspaper R@@ od Cha@@ pel newspaper R@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&quot; we have never had so many complaints before . &quot;
this is the first such warning that the US has issued on the state of US state .
the group was referring to events such as racist offence in the school of black students at school University University and T@@ en@@ nes@@ se &apos;s death of 28 @-@ year @-@ old black tanks in S@@ and@@ er@@ si .
the S@@ and@@ ers died on the basis of the beginning of this year , under which he had been subjected to war in the run @-@ up to the police and the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police arrested , without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the comment refers to a report compiled recently by the Chief Prosecutor General , which shows that in the State of the State , the cars of black car drivers are being stopped by 75 % more than those of white gu@@ hal@@ ts .
&quot; the comment is intended to make people aware and warn their families , friends and com@@ mu@@ ans of what could happen in the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people must be prepared , so long as making money involved or informing the relatives that they are going through the state . &quot;
on the basis of the latest information on the F@@ B@@ I hate crime programme , a crime of 100 hate crime in 2015 , which places the state of the country &apos;s cross @-@ cutting number of similar offences .
the travel warning is also a response to the new law of the Mis@@ tral s@@ our@@ der , which makes it harder for a company to be taken to court for discrimination on grounds of nationality or employment .
the American Civil Liberties Committee ( the American Civil Liberties Association , AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued an earlier trip to the T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona after these states adopted immigration laws obli@@ ging the local authorities to arrest people from immigration infringements , as ACTA L@@ U claims that it will increase racial profiling .
as a rule , travel warnings are issued on other countries , but recently interest groups have begun to use this measure as a response to certain US laws and trends .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what can everyone know about the various forms of this serious disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , li@@ ver , can be caused by five different - A , B , C , D and E he@@ pati@@ tis virus .
all these vir@@ uses are provoked by the li@@ ver of the li@@ ver burning .
the worst cost is chronic B and he@@ pati@@ tis , which can develop into a li@@ p @-@ up to the li@@ p of the li@@ ver , the cost of the li@@ ver and the li@@ ver .
the rapporteur , Ku@@ ul@@ gi@@ o@@ vis@@ er Ku@@ ul@@ o Ku@@ tsa@@ r , says that the acute he@@ pati@@ tis disease is the same for all the types of in@@ wage , f@@ ever fa@@ ti@@ gue , fa@@ ti@@ gue , mad@@ ness , o@@ ks@@ ero@@ t , f@@ ric@@ et emissions , ble@@ m , meat , meat and lea@@ k pain and lea@@ ther s@@ mas@@ ping .
the last si@@ ck@@ ness also comes from the li@@ ver @-@ burning name of the burning profession .
children can get he@@ pati@@ tis with sick @-@ free diseases .
the different types of land inc@@ in@@ eration can only be determined on the basis of data from a laboratory study .
a extreme he@@ pati@@ tis can be swit@@ ched into a chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and run for decades without si@@ ck@@ less diseases , which means that a person may not know anything about a dangerous li@@ p @-@ causing illness .
the Ku@@ ul@@ o Ku@@ tsa@@ r sets out different forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their depth .
a he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spread from a sick person and infec@@ t us in eating food or drinking water , se@@ x@@ ement , infected human emissions and direct food , soil , objects , sug@@ aran@@ ces and drugs .
a he@@ pati@@ tis infection of he@@ pati@@ tis infection , in other words , family members and carers , people suffering from chronic diseases , people who are infected with infection , sex men , drug addi@@ cts , the high spread of the A he@@ pati@@ tis .
it is possible to pre @-@ emp@@ t the infection , in particular , the vaccination of a large number of people travelling by the travelling and A he@@ pati@@ tis .
in addition , it is important to comply with the daily hygiene requirements : to dis@@ infec@@ te or dis@@ infec@@ t their hands before using food for all fruit and vegetables .
the vir@@ uses of he@@ pati@@ tis suff@@ e@@ rers spread sick blood in contact with blood , injec@@ tion of drugs , bul@@ l , honour , blood @-@ contaminated shar@@ ks ( too@@ th@@ a , means of pregnancy ) , the use of blood blood , a he@@ pati@@ er of he@@ pati@@ tis and he@@ pati@@ tis sick .
a group of he@@ pati@@ tis infected by he@@ pati@@ tis are drug users , infected man sex partners , male sex sex men , infected mother @-@ born babies , sick family members and carers , blood and other body medical , rescu@@ ers and poli@@ ce@@ men and he@@ pati@@ tis travellers .
it is possible to vacc@@ in@@ ate people to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis ; in particular , it is recommended to vacc@@ in@@ ate people from the risk group , as well as people suffering from chronic diseases , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
the he@@ pati@@ tis is prevention measures : ref@@ ra@@ ining from non @-@ food and man@@ tic devices , other th@@ era@@ tic means and need@@ les of need@@ les , in@@ ten@@ sive and au@@ tism and the use of con@@ d@@ oms , and the use of con@@ d@@ oms in cases of dangerous sex or avoidance of sexual risk .
vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis is part of the National immun@@ isation Plan in Estonia and free of charge for children .
C he@@ pati@@ tis suff@@ e@@ rers spread sick blood in contact with blood , injec@@ tion of drugs , spiri@@ tion , honour , blood pollution , blood contamination , blood blood , he@@ pati@@ tis , he@@ pati@@ tis sex and he@@ pati@@ tis sick .
the group of &quot; he@@ pati@@ tis C &quot; is drug users , infected man sex partners , male sex sex men , infected mother @-@ born babies , sick family members and carers , blood and other medical liquids , health care , rescue staff and poli@@ ce@@ men , HIV infections and men and C he@@ pati@@ tis .
the he@@ pati@@ tis C prevention measure is : ref@@ ra@@ ining from non @-@ food and man@@ tic devices , other th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic means and sy@@ stal@@ les , in@@ accurate and au@@ tism and the use of con@@ d@@ oms in cases of dangerous sex .
there is no reference to he@@ pati@@ tis C .
the he@@ pati@@ tis is caused by a D he@@ pati@@ tis virus , which is much more than the presence of the he@@ pati@@ tis B .
as a result , D he@@ pati@@ tis B , combined with he@@ pati@@ tis B he@@ pati@@ tis B he@@ pati@@ tis A@@ pati@@ tis hospital .
the virus of he@@ pati@@ tis is conta@@ cted by exposure to blood and other body flu@@ ids , contaminated by need@@ les , sexu@@ ally and rarely infected .
the he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis is chronic B he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses and B he@@ pati@@ tis against non @-@ human beings .
an effective preventive action is a vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis B vaccines , which also protects people against the infection of D he@@ pati@@ tis .
the vir@@ uses of he@@ pati@@ tis are dissemin@@ ated by fe@@ e@@ mon@@ al drinking water and food , including low @-@ heat beef , fish and se@@ af@@ aring , blood blood , joint used need@@ les and infected animals .
passengers may be infected by E @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis in the countries of high illness .
the prevention measures for he@@ pati@@ tis are the implementation of hygiene requirements : to dis@@ infec@@ te or dis@@ infec@@ t the hands of the ro@@ of , prior to the preparation and eating of the food , after the care of the sick .
fruit and vegetables will be deter@@ red before consumption , avoiding the use of low @-@ cost beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , drinking only safe drinking water and avoid consumption of drugs .

I very much appreciate my family .

but even more so in history .
the le@@ th@@ al le@@ af@@ let infection could have been cut off , a harder cut in s@@ na@@ il sur@@ ger@@ y , in the title of the subject , it would have been possible to get more influence on this portfolio .
there would now be two books : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti and his pain@@ ting , &apos; Da@@ am gold las &apos; , would be a different story , and a much larger and more comprehensive history of history and the German occupation , with its aftermath in Austria .
the first third of the book is taking place in the middle of a w@@ ed@@ ding Vi@@ in culture and who himself got the capital of Austria , can imagine how more than one hundred years ago , over one hundred years ago , the coff@@ ee of the R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ se , or how all the heads of the Cen@@ tr@@ al coff@@ ee all dro@@ ps when the Kli@@ m@@ our pul@@ led .
the concentration of cultural figures in one of the rich@@ est parts of Europe was known in a rich city , and the familiar name of the name , which is known as &apos; mag@@ nific@@ ent cultural &apos; .
at the same time , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a city where there is an un@@ th@@ era@@ pi@@ able ar@@ son in the capital , and it was the highest level of suicide in Europe , does not give development as if it does nothing .
or , perhaps , every couple of couples , we add a colour to the cultural life of the 20th century .
dream of the Soviet Union
in the last decade of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had explo@@ ded in Vienna , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
the S@@ aj@@ an@@ di@@ g debate had almost one in ten people in Vienna .
the elderly were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time when A@@ dele hel@@ ple@@ lus opened up two times to open the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ na@@ adi Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch@@ l@@ and , and to the climate of his famous pa@@ int@@ ings , his father had already become the fourth largest bank in the H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg E@@ mp@@ ire E@@ mp@@ ire .
but A@@ de@@ let &apos;s whole life , where he belon@@ ged , has not pul@@ led .
if you look at the &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; , it is hard to believe that a life @-@ ending infection of this great person , a mega @-@ socialist and a dream of travel to the Soviet Union .
in 19@@ 33 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s portfolio to order a climate of a s@@ no@@ b , it was the last minute of six mo@@ ther@@ land in Vienna .
a contract was paid at 4 000 k@@ ron@@ ns , a quarter of a good seat on the rural house .
the fact that , for some of the portfolio , he was suspected of mo@@ del@@ ling , the sugar mag@@ na@@ at has not been intimi@@ dated .
as far as dele@@ tion is concerned , the only certainty is that the close relationship between the mo@@ del@@ l and the ar@@ tist that has emerged during the course of their work .

the climate was presented in his &quot; Da@@ ami gold &quot; in 19@@ 08 and around the same time ( 19@@ 07 @-@ 19@@ 08 ) was born in a gol@@ den land .

how are the Hitler @-@ related Hitler ?
&quot; I think that as a friend of my friend , I am obliged to be ow@@ ed to him to make his work available to the public &apos; , A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer a couple of years after the departure of the ar@@ tist ( in February 19@@ 18 ) , the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere muse@@ um Director and the desire for their family of the family to go to the muse@@ um .
six years before the death , the climate was completed at A@@ dele@@ st &apos;s portfolio .
in his wil@@ ls ( A@@ dele left in February 19@@ 25 ) , he asked her two portra@@ its and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t &apos;s Austrian Gal@@ eri@@ er .
in his article , he inh@@ eri@@ ted her words to Mari@@ ana and Lu@@ tz .
one year later , when the Kli@@ m@@ t had finished the &quot; Austrian Mon@@ a annex , &quot; it had attempted to escape the 17 @-@ year @-@ old Ad@@ ol@@ f @-@ A@@ ka@@ de@@ my .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s late anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is being held as a result of the fact that the Jewish profes@@ sors did not accept him , no one was actually ha@@ ir of his exa@@ min@@ ations .
in any case , the task of the Austrian Gal@@ tain , referred to in Maria Re@@ testa@@ ment , was notic@@ e@@ ably important , as was the case in the case of the most recent Jewish colle@@ ctions of the art of Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal art of art , including some at home , have been working , but not a climate .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the Nazi art of art , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute broke out between the Austrian Government and B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ kers .
let me just mention here that , when &apos; S@@ no@@ lus &apos; sees Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere in Vienna , A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ er , &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; , needs to be looked at in New York &apos;s Ne@@ ue Gal@@ tle .
and the aforementioned book was read before the Vienna war .
even when you were going to look at the work , you did not plan to go ahead , because at least my emo@@ tions were tor@@ n after the closure of the book more Nazi and Jewish than 135 million dollars were sold in B@@ allo@@ ch @-@ ch .
so not so much as a portfolio , if rather a family of a family - and a very moving tale .
a significant facilitation of the progress of the events at the beginning of the paper will facilitate the sexu@@ ality of the Bau@@ dis .
17 @-@ year @-@ old sw@@ im@@ ming in Canada was very close to Estonia .
in housing , 200 m more se@@ li@@ ting on their own lives was very close to 2.@@ 16.@@ 6@@ 62 .
the winning mark dates from 17 @-@ year @-@ olds from one week &apos;s time when the Canadian ju@@ mp champi@@ ons gained 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 at the time , the Pri@@ vate Pri@@ vate A@@ av@@ ik U@@ ju@@ mis@@ g .
last but not least , a decade of A @-@ fin@@ ality .
in the fin@@ hal@@ h he distan@@ ced himself from 2.@@ 15 p.m. and achieved a good seventh site with a new powerful crow@@ d .
in the case of Estonian re@@ ba@@ te ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) , Estonian re@@ ba@@ te ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) left a little over half a second .
for all the times in Estonia , the Scoreboard went up with the third , and its recent personal peak is the fifth result of all Estonian people .
a young hope for the future will be the start @-@ up of Canadian adults &apos; champi@@ on@@ ships , 200 m and 400 m@@ m@@ ours , and 200 m@@ - and 400 k@@ m@@ ours .
last week in Tor@@ onto , Canadian God champi@@ ons were taking place and the successful start @-@ up is also available there .
he won 200 m in w@@ ool sil@@ ver in the sil@@ ver al of 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
this distance was thus rapidly sw@@ am@@ ped by the leader in the last year in 2008 .
in Estonia this distance has been distan@@ ced only by the Estonian record E@@ lina Par@@ authentic@@ ka in Estonia .
in Canada , a child in Canada still won a great deal of personal record in the de@@ mise of the bac@@ ks@@ ania , and the new Estonian season with a peak of 5@@ 6.@@ 66 .
for example , Al@@ ne@@ k , the old Ker@@ tu Al@@ ne@@ k , is just one hundre@@ d@@ th of one hundre@@ d@@ th .
in a personal top , he reached a further 100 m sw@@ im@@ ming in the opening of a notice of a letter of 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 .
over a long distance , he only gained the seventh place when it took 2.@@ 17@@ ,@@ 31 in the fin@@ est .
in the meantime , Estonia is currently leading the ranking of the Estonian season from four different distances .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics of critical teet@@ h
the holiday time has come - that is to say , a la@@ x of the US President , Donald T@@ ru@@ mpi@@ le .
however , since the T@@ ru@@ mp has still been one of the most deprived days , the critics are already ham@@ pered .
on the basis of the US and CN@@ N reports , 17 @-@ day @-@ long leave in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster@@ h in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster@@ is , which is based in New Jer@@ sey .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , the opponents of T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i have taken the floor for weeks .
they complain too much about the T@@ ru@@ p .
indeed , the President has taken the time for a short stay in his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey .
by the way , the T@@ ru@@ mp has not cleared his President for the most in the course of 19@@ 6 .
for example , George W@@ . Bush had already reached 67 days in this period , and Barack Obama left less than T@@ ru@@ mp , but 21 days .
but , on the other hand , the T@@ ru@@ p is ten@@ ding to s@@ le@@ ep .
the few days later , T@@ ru@@ mp said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , that the long holidays will not be lost over a long period of time , because a great deal needs to be done .
he also expressed his indig@@ nation three years ago about Barack Obama &apos;s leave .
the current President wrote on Twitter : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , gol@@ f , applies on the brak@@ es and on the j@@ ung@@ le group , the journalists in the T@@ reasury are s@@ log@@ ing . &quot;
the white house officers &apos; reports do not have a 17 @-@ day gol@@ f &apos;s visit to a sort of la@@ ck@@ ery .
it is officially referred to as working holidays , during which the T@@ ru@@ mpi@@ l has no time to read or become pro @-@ active .
in addition , there was another reason for the working holidays .
in particular , the White House will be replaced by a system of de@@ ception for the west of the White House , and therefore the entire staff had to leave it .
the West Bank also takes part in the O@@ val@@ ka@@ bin@@ t and other President &apos;s offices .
&quot; I do not believe that someone of you would like to be in the west in August , when 38 degrees are there and there is no con@@ dom &apos; , said the White House speech L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , who stressed that the President would continue to work during the holidays .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp will follow 17 days &apos; water , you will know about the video .
blocking critics from Facebook do not apply to the public office if you do not tolerate the voters &apos; criticism .
our country &apos;s father knew about the unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but the newspapers did not last long to start to f@@ ool him for everything from internal policy to political principles .
the criticism , of course , has upset him .
but he did not make his critics silent .
because , in 17@@ 83 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of speech can be taken away from us and that we may be able to take the lead in the dark and quiet . &quot;
this brings me to Mr Mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s Governor , Mr K@@ han@@ er , who is struggling to be more in Washington .
the Ho@@ gan has blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their official Facebook page .
and earlier this week , the United States of America ( the American Civil Service Association , AC@@ L@@ U ) , was therefore taken to court .
the hearing of the Governor of Si@@ beria , who pul@@ led the actions empty and web comment was s@@ ounding in response to the reactions of the reactions &apos; who is interested ? &apos;
&quot; this is only a Facebook , &apos; said many .
but that is what counts .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like K@@ gan .
this is aston@@ ishing in the vast majority of the popular re@@ public@@ s in the democratic state .
his approval is the second highest in the 50 months of the country &apos;s 50 seats .
I do not think we are thinking of a reac@@ tive wind of thought .
he has been firm on the state stage and strictly as@@ certain@@ ed to his principles .
in addition , he has used as a major tool to communicate with his constituents in a rather un@@ skilled way , presenting , for example , the first time of che@@ mis@@ try for the first time in his kit@@ chen head .
it is therefore the case that the Governor of the govern@@ or &apos;s Governor is a public forum with a public forum managed by taxpayers &apos; dollar staff to block the people who visit their visitors , is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
the spokes@@ man of the press officer , Ame@@ lia , defended the conduct of the Governor of Washington in an interview with the Governor , arguing that the blocking of comments was nothing other than a re@@ orientation .
it is too easy , however , to pa@@ int a picture of online che@@ f@@ les , jun@@ k mail or people with anger .
the post has been discussed with a number of quite people whose Ho@@ gan blocked .
and that is what they are the people who communicate with their chosen leaders , the owner , the owner of the company and the passport , not internet controls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thou@@ gh@@ tful and not ro@@ cky .
Pas@@ tor quoted its postal office Bi@@ b@@ li@@ cal , with emphasis on the traffic of the Ho@@ gan .
Ms L@@ ak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ wi@@ e , a lawyer from the Mar@@ y@@ lan@@ d Bo@@ wi@@ e , did not inci@@ te hatred but rather hate crimes .
&quot; I was poli@@ tely advised that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &apos; he wrote The post @-@ mail news story in the country .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , when many people comment on the same subject , some of it is immediately in@@ sensitive to collective effort instead of recognising that it is a great deal of concern to citizens . &apos;
what the Governor of the govern@@ ors called &apos; towards an attack on &apos; targeted jun@@ k &apos; , others would probably call &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era allows the text to be easily accommo@@ dated , simply blocking a critical or dele@@ tion of negative comment .
it is much cleaner than the elderly when workers were to be sent out to do the same , so that they collect critical edit@@ orial edit@@ orial newspapers and bur@@ n them or ar@@ resting protest@@ ors and forcing them to keep silent .
but that is exactly what is happening today , just digital .
I am not the first national official who is being criticised for the too@@ th@@ lessness of Facebook and other social media .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has been taken to court by users who are blocked by Twitter .
one of the first w@@ ool@@ ly judgments on this subject was made last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
the US Dis@@ tri@@ ct judge , James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is , ruled in Alexand@@ ria that the first revision of the Constitution by the board of Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i Coun@@ ty , when he blocked a constitu@@ ent on her television .
in Ken@@ tu@@ ck@@ y , AC@@ L@@ U visited the use of Facebook and Twitter as well as the Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ ink ( R ) .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar effect than the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 1 800 qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ pled newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters da@@ m@@ med her way of leadership .
and even then , Washington had to deal with anon@@ ymous trol@@ le@@ ry .
people wrote letters on the newspapers from pseu@@ do @-@ te@@ ms such as Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , making Washington judgments ground .
under the draft collection project for the collection of the collection of the website of the website of George Washington , he bu@@ ried his office under the petitions that criticised his views on the British friendship , trade and shipping agreements .
but he did not make them silent .
freedom of expression , dis@@ agreements and debates are the very foundations of our country .
and proper management means accepting it .

the poorest province of Indonesia is the poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and the inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one of Asia &apos;s worst .
but it is also an example of the gold la@@ d@@ der in Indonesia .
just 100 km from the P@@ ani@@ a@@ ist , which is a memory of approximately New Jer@@ sey with a population of 153 000 , is the world &apos;s largest and most profitable gold mine , which belongs to F@@ ree@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an , a P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x@@ is player .
in 2015 alone , around 3.@@ 1 billion of the USD 3.@@ 1 billion of gold in the mining industry in 2015 alone .
in addition to this , it will be possible to de@@ part in consumer timber reserves , with an estimated annual value estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are a source of pa@@ wn suffering , as they result in the suff@@ oc@@ ating presence of a powerful Indon@@ esi@@ an army .
the New York Times survey revealed that F@@ ree@@ stream paid over USD 1998 to 2004 for military and military units , including USD 150 000 to one of the officers .
the sa@@ va@@ ge aspirations to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den and ru@@ th@@ less around .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 69 and there have been many thousands of troops ra@@ ging , tortured and imprisoned by the army .
according to the Asian Committee on Human Rights , the mass killing of the massac@@ res in the 1970s in the 1970s was a measure of genocide .
last year alone , over 3@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ors were arrested in the area of the Indon@@ esi@@ an police .

&quot; the number of victims is difficult to read , as such incidents are taking place every week , &apos; Human Rights Watch Watch &apos; is being said by the Human Rights Watch .
reserves have been tightened up more strongly , as natural reserves have caused the influx of new set@@ tle@@ rs from outside Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graphy is changing because of the massive , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , the Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ es are coming from the islands of the islands .

&quot; indigenous people on the pa@@ wn of the pa@@ wn will lose their market share due to their market share .
the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , who is well known as Jo@@ ko@@ w among their people , pledged to deal with their inequalities and human rights abuses in the P@@ len@@ a .
the former w@@ oo@@ k won her road on the front of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta in the 29 constitu@@ encies of 29 , including the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
but there has been very little change in the pu@@ rity and the local feeling dece@@ ived .
&quot; our hearts have been broken because , in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w in waiting for our hopes of restoring justice &apos; says &apos; .
in fact , only two months after the arrival of Jo@@ ko@@ w in Jo@@ ko@@ w .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children s@@ ounded a Christmas bel@@ l on 11 December 2014 , when the dar@@ k@@ ness of the blind motor@@ way has two Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers .
the children of Koh@@ l told them that they should switch the lights .
the fate of the local passport , Y@@ a@@ ve@@ i Y@@ a@@ ve@@ i , is an insult to one of the soldiers on their tone and then returned to four soldiers .
according to the victims and witnesses , soldiers in the drink are driving behind their children and can@@ ing them with their gun@@ s .
one soldi@@ er was shot in the ranks of the soldiers .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , beaten so cruel that he fell to the House .
a few hours later , a close @-@ to @-@ close electoral commission was installed in the Commission and the scen@@ es of the next day .
around 1 000 young men , women and children experienced football at the local police station and the military leadership centre in the co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il .
they were we@@ aring ref@@ urb@@ sal hun@@ ts and fi@@ fi@@ led the pa@@ wn clo@@ thes of a s@@ log@@ ing tan@@ ker with a drink @-@ and @-@ s@@ ounding poultry s@@ ong .
some protest@@ ors began to le@@ cture the police and the military mili@@ tants .
in the case of a hand@@ ful of anger , a soldi@@ er was sent to soldiers , &apos; when the crow@@ d shows more than three times the resistance , shot them down , &apos; said under the official document , which has been seen by a magaz@@ ine but not issued by local media reports .
the majority of the majority of the Roma city , Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , in the oldest Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ ame ( 56 ) and called for peace to be kept , asking for the public to go home .
no one had any intention to listen .
&quot; during the turn , I was suddenly shot into the left , &apos; he said to the magaz@@ ine in his er@@ red col@@ ours on the blood of the t@@ ree .
we still do not know who the gun@@ s were , but says that soldiers from the soldiers gathered in the month came out .
&quot; the people had a lot , a kno@@ ck of a great deal , &apos; adds him .
a local man , Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , got his w@@ ool on the eye three times .
&quot; I would like to stick to him and he looked at her body to make sure that it is with him , &apos; said at the time of the magaz@@ ine , Mr Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who is using only one name in many indicators .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... S@@ no@@ le@@ my was he . &apos;
the chief police officer , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ win@@ said , said to repor@@ ters that his sub@@ servi@@ ent guaranteed only the security of their sections , as this was attacked .
&quot; we need to defend ourselves if we are threatened with killing , &apos; said in 2015 by the High Representative of the police , Mr P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo .
&quot; this is a question of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ors were killed and there were many injured .
the news of the killings reached the next day in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ w .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ras considered a passion@@ ate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses that took place in P@@ ann@@ a .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future . &quot;
in October 2016 , the Minister of Security , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , said in October 2016 that he will introduce an ADR mechanism to deal with human rights .
however , almost immediately , the ex@@ cus@@ es .
&quot; most crimes happened a long time ago .
some of them were taking place in the 1990s and in the early 200@@ 0s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; said .
speaking at the time of the magaz@@ ine on 5 June in J@@ ak@@ ano , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to sum@@ med his words , saying that he had no intention whatsoever to set up a mechanism for dealing with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything will be resolved by law &apos; .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been indi@@ cted by the United Nations in relation to human rights against more than 1 000 human deaths in East Timor in the bloody independence referendum of 1999 , said that 11 human rights crime has been resolved in P@@ ug@@ a , including in the P@@ ania .
the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i victims adopted such statements with dis@@ gust .
&quot; I have been listening to four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , &apos; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &apos;
he says that he is still living in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid he says .
&quot; I am afraid that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I will be shot . &apos;
his bro@@ ther Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed the view that the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i people are afraid of this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after he had helped bu@@ ried four victims .
&quot; after the bu@@ ried of the bodies of death , the army had to look to me , &apos; he says .
the killings have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the residents of the Indon@@ esi@@ an police in the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i neighbouring in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ is , the village of Indonesia .
one person died and 17 injured , including children , when it came to a war between the village people and the head of the construction company who refused to transport an un@@ conscious man .
this male , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ ad@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ w@@ ned fish in a ne@@ ar@@ by , died on the way to hospital .
the residents of the village were protesting against a company office in the construction site .
according to the police , the inhabitants of the villages were told by police officers , with the latter aler@@ ted to aler@@ ts .
but , according to the local forces , mobile Bri@@ gade ( the military es@@ cor@@ ted police ) began to shoo@@ t , killing one person .
&quot; we were in a big s@@ care@@ mon@@ gering , we were afraid of re@@ tali@@ ation , &apos; said a magaz@@ ine of 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ long Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives on a hospital and had been injured in in@@ fu@@ tas@@ y .
&quot; I have been beaten by two days in my house . &apos;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i Parliament has called for the prosecution of police officers and the withdrawal of the police from the police from the region .
the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i is always a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development is fuelled by the dis@@ satisfaction of the man , m@@ oni , dan@@ i and da@@ m@@ mal tri@@ bes .
many of them have joined the Liber@@ ation movement ( V@@ PL ) with the re@@ bels &apos; army , which protects the rights of their boats , by carrying out random attacks and kid@@ napp@@ ings of kid@@ napp@@ ings .
some V@@ PL leaders come from P@@ ani@@ a , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , under the pretext of &apos; protecting the sovereignty of the country &apos; , the army has arrested the P@@ ani@@ a@@ is and arbitrarily detained by thousands of people .
some of them will never appear again .
among the people , there are known P@@ ani@@ ies as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty is fuelled by dis@@ content .
the low ri@@ ce sold by the majority is too expensive for the local .
the same is un@@ at@@ tain@@ able .
people are increasing their own food themselves , mainly from the ba@@ seline , as well as some fruit and hard@@ qu@@ itable vegetables .
it is a job for women who can care for four or five ba@@ ths .
they usually keep the majority of the harves@@ ted families , the rest in the local market .
only 10 000 Indon@@ esi@@ ans ( 75 cents ) pay a 10 @-@ year @-@ old site .
over time , there has been a deepening of economic inequalities between flo@@ ate boats and the new migrants , who have been brought to a large extent since the opening of new airlines at the N@@ ab@@ ire airport .
these few jobs , which are available , will be better educated and more prosperous migrants .
the pu@@ mps themselves often do not have a competitive business to drive up a competitive business or acquire the necessary skills .
&quot; young people are not interested in having a village , because there is no jobs or money here , &apos; says John G@@ ba@@ i , Chairman of the Council of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from its eyes .
in addition , there are tight restrictions on foreign media .
later this year , French journalists were sent out of Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp , as &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they had been given a rare film authorisation .
according to Human Rights Watch , the President of the Asian department , Mr K@@ ine , has not put into practice the electoral promises of Jo@@ ko@@ w to abolish transparency and development restrictions .
&quot; in Indonesia , some of the most eastern provinces of the East and of the West P@@ as@@ pu@@ a report are threatening new threats to the rejection of the visa and black@@ listing of the black list , &apos; said in a statement .
a lack of journ@@ alism in the press means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esi@@ an Government is largely limited to the near neighbours .
in March , six of the Pacific countries of the Pacific , T@@ on@@ ga , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ pain , Mar@@ shall Islands and Sol@@ om@@ on Islands , and the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the &apos; various wide @-@ ranging crimes &apos; in P@@ abi@@ a , including the P@@ anias .
the same countries have also supported historically V@@ PL .
the accusations level@@ led by the foreign Secretary of the Indon@@ esi@@ an Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , to put his accusations aside , by saying to Mr journalists : &apos; in Indonesia , there is still democratic order and freedom of the press , so that the evidence of human rights cases would be bu@@ ried .
the local people want more foreign governments to take notice .
when a Dutch official delegation led the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , K@@ ees Van B@@ a@@ pu@@ pu@@ ra on 4 May , the local people interrupted the meeting , but &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , new presidential elections will take place in 2019 , but boats do not believe that they will vote again for Jo@@ ko@@ w .
Jo@@ o@@ w is a well @-@ meaning man , but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , &apos; says the Chairman of the Council of tri@@ bes .
he wants to make it clear to Mr Jo@@ ko@@ w that , apart from being persecuted by the people of the P@@ anias under the threat of constantly pre@@ da@@ tory military threats , they are struggling with poor education and health services .
in the words of Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , like other boats , will have to pay their voice to the debt that it has to pay .
&quot; they do not need money ; they want justice &apos; , &apos; he says .
despite the theft and intimidation of alarm , the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i were still able to cope with the most symbolic revol@@ t of the death of one of the victims of the victim &apos;s body and the military .
knowing that justice may never be put on their feet , they will not allow at least those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &apos; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us fel@@ led .
&quot; what can we do ? &quot;
last year &apos;s Tor@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch pic@@ k@@ ings and , for the second time itself .
last Friday , one of the world &apos;s worst residential Du@@ ba@@ t , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to fle@@ e the 3 37 metres and to fle@@ e their homes in 79 .
this is the second fire that has been ra@@ va@@ ged by the high h@@ all that has been ra@@ va@@ ged in two years , which is called the Tu@@ ch@@ v@@ or T@@ fragile tor@@ tu@@ tor .
there was no mention of any direct fire in the building , and no direct cause of fire was reported .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and we wo@@ ke fire on fire and the fear of the people .
we would come under the sta@@ irs , and it took us around 10 minutes to reach the floor , &apos; said Re@@ u@@ ter@@ rand one resident who called himself George .
according to civil protection officers of Du@@ ba@@ i , fire fighters were ext@@ ingu@@ ished at around 4 a.m. at a local time ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and ja@@ hu@@ led the building .
the government said that they were working to ensure shelter .
this incident may once again raise questions about the safety of the materials used on the world &apos;s highest foreign surface .
in the follow @-@ up to the Tu@@ chi Management Board in 2015 , it was found that the worst damage suffered the appointment and isolation of fa@@ sa@@ ds .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London G@@ ren@@ portfolio T@@ ow@@ er &apos;s isola@@ tion@@ ist and the power panel could have contributed to the rapid deployment of fire in June , killing around 80 people .
see : in the autumn , they will be available in the autumn
in writing . - ( FR ) Tho@@ se and autumn is a ma@@ gic time for techniques , as the public will public@@ ise their new models of excellence .
in the spring , the Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peri@@ a X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um will also be expected in the autumn .
according to the journalist of the Tele@@ 2 marketing and sale director , the &apos; Innovation Union &apos; is characterised by an innovative design , an eye by the Confederal Group of the T@@ reasury , the ser@@ le @-@ servan@@ i 4@@ K resolution screen and the ultra @-@ fast process .
a major e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant in the world of technology was Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , which has also reached the top of Estonia &apos;s smar@@ t@@ phones .
in the autumn , a more astu@@ te high @-@ air , more durable , more quality camer@@ as and greater water and dust security .
he added that , on the basis of the rum@@ ours , you can already make assumptions and forecast the four main models that will probably con@@ qu@@ er the s@@ wa@@ thes of sales .
these four smar@@ t@@ phone models will be available to the shops in the autumn of this year .
8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 are expected to reach shops in mid @-@ September .
the rum@@ ours of the new Apple model , however , and what can be done can be done .
if i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not bring significant differences between i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , the tenth anniversary of Apple &apos;s tenth birth@@ day is expected that the new model is completely different from previous ones .
four col@@ ours have been talked about : black , white , rosé and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one of the elements of the new design is obviously the screen covering the whole of the phone , lost the do@@ p and the fingerprints and built on the screen .
Apple &apos;s design leader J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve demands that the new i@@ P@@ hone model would look like a glass .
there has also been mention of the i@@ P@@ hone version of i@@ P@@ hone .
in addition to the eyes of the fast @-@ track s@@ nu@@ ner , the charge for free charging and a further high @-@ quality camer@@ as can be expected to be faster in A@@ 11 .
this is certainly one of the most anticipated smart phones in the year .
the launch of the new model G@@ ala@@ x@@ y will start on 23 August .
although there are many rum@@ ours that the new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y will start to see 8 .
it is estimated that even more business users and the S pen will allow even greater fun@@ ction@@ ality .
the telecom should have two camer@@ as , one of which is a wave of waves , and the other is the same vision of television .
at the moment , no one knows what the two camps are capable of , but in any case this Sam@@ sun@@ gi is the first attempt , which is certainly comparable to the i@@ P@@ hone 8 .
however , we are eag@@ er@@ ly awaiting the 23 August .
although Nokia has been selling three smart phones with Nokia 6 in this year , it is still missing their flag , Nokia 8 , which is already being presented on 16 August .
we look forward to the roll @-@ out of the 5.@@ 3 @-@ pollin@@ ated screen and the ultra @-@ fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ nap@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and a more sta@@ tic one .
in the case of Nokia , there is also talk of alu@@ mini@@ um Cor@@ ps and significant water and dust @-@ proof .
like the Sam@@ su@@ g , the new model of Nokia will have two ta@@ m@@ ours , an op@@ a@@ que of a company Z@@ e@@ a .
if the S@@ ony &apos;s sound flagship vessel has been X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um until now , the manufacturer has confirmed that there will be at least two smart phones in the near future , with even more innovative functions .
we are waiting for a smart phone that is slightly more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least the same good or better camer@@ as .
on the new model of S@@ ony , it has been specu@@ lated that the screen is at least hot .
what the reality will be , we can see from the very beginning , as traditionally , the S@@ ony has unve@@ iled the International Technology F@@ air Financial Technology F@@ air , which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year .
on the basis of trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts le@@ ak@@ ers le@@ ak@@ ed , T@@ ru@@ mp Mexico on the border wall
the Washington post unve@@ iled the President of the United States of America , Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , Mexico and Austr@@ alian leaders .
on 27 January , Mr En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ on , the Mexic@@ an President , went on saying that it would stop public membership not to re@@ pay the proposed border wall .
the President of America , with his wall of condemnation of the wall , said : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ mp e@@ rec@@ ted his presidential campaign to build the long @-@ distance wall of the United States of America and the age of Mexico to pay Mexico for this project .
there were also trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts from his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Mr Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l , which ex@@ poses an intense debate .
T@@ ru@@ mp said to the Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l that the agreement that the United States will take on their own refugees to Australia &apos; is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ ve &apos; and &apos; fo@@ ol@@ ish &apos; ; he claimed that the agreement that was made under the Obama Administration would leave him a &apos; guide &apos; , since he has proposed the resettlement of refugees from the United States .
the T@@ ru@@ mp closed speech by announcing the Tur@@ k that &apos; this was the most un@@ pleasant speech . &quot;
the Supreme Court failed to discuss the complaint in the city of O@@ C MR@@ P in a case where the Tar@@ tu city rejected the procurement of the bus and coach transport for the period from July 2019 to 20@@ 29 .
this is a letter with which the city of O@@ C MR@@ P ( O@@ C@@ S ) was refused a bus or coach bus because the ten@@ dering did not meet the requirements , explained the transport service for the city of Tar@@ tu , An@@ neli A@@ clean@@ tin .
this is a period of transport for the transport of passengers with the transport of the city of Tar@@ tu in the period 0@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
in the case of MR@@ P , Li@@ beria compla@@ ined to take the decision of the National Court of Justice .
it was not taken by the Supreme Court .
although there are many in the social media that it is anno@@ ying that the We@@ b is anno@@ ying their night and the whole of the city is full of brak@@ es , there are many of those who do not have a single word on the festi@@ val .
I am even positively surprised that the shop was both cour@@ tes@@ y .
I have not seen any dis@@ gust or dis@@ cour@@ tes@@ y .
even the left I saw , the wave bo@@ as@@ ting a wave .
&quot; it is all well and good that it is coming to an end , and there is a joy of joy , which is a farm like winter , it will gla@@ dly add .
a wave of stra@@ ins in the name of R@@ ann@@ lia is not a ha@@ ir .
if , in the middle town of the centre , he still survi@@ ved that music is playing a music , then music is not yet at the end of his home country .
&quot; but I hope that I hear &apos; I am happy to say &apos; .
the discussion with the hea@@ da@@ r will also say that the great festi@@ val is a good thing for the sake of the great festi@@ val , it will greatly contribute to the VAT of local trade@@ spe@@ ople .
in addition , he welcomes that the summer capital has come so much out of the village .

Pe@@ ar@@ son is cutting 3 000 jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revive their business .
the British educational company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that another 3 000 jobs are being cut and that the number of their dividen@@ ds will be reduced by 72 per cent , thereby launching another restructuring programme to tackle the threat of business .
the jobs that will be put in place , which will , according to the executive director John F@@ all@@ on , are likely to take place at the end of 2018 and in the beginning of 2019 , will be added to the 4 000 posts lost in the previous restructuring process .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced in May the plan to cut the costs of a further GBP 300 million under the third cost reduction programme ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) to try and revive the business that has been hit by the rapid digital swit@@ ch@@ over .
the company , which agreed to sell in a company in the company Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House , Mr Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , said that their expectation in relation to the year has not changed since announced sales sales of 1 % to 2.@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year .

attack in K@@ abu@@ l : suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed NATO soldiers
the suicide bom@@ b@@ ers , according to officials in the capital con@@ vo@@ ys in K@@ abu@@ l , killing one NATO soldi@@ er and w@@ ounded several other .
the NATO statement stated that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to reports of un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in the town of the town of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi .
this bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ment is the latest act of violence which has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people died on the Her@@ k attack on Tuesday .
two people were killed on Monday in K@@ abu@@ l , a suicide bom@@ ber in K@@ abu@@ l .
the NATO statement said that a four @-@ day explosion took place when the joint pat@@ ro@@ l of the joint pat@@ ro@@ l was attacked and attacked by the &apos; man @-@ made explo@@ sive body &apos; .
the statement states that all the injured in a stable position and are being treated in the US military hospital in Bag@@ ra@@ mi .
according to the Cor@@ ps , the Taliban and the group , known as the &apos; Islamic &apos; country ( in the country ) , is an increasing source of concern for the forces in the Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi NATO in Bag@@ h@@ dad .
according to the United Nations , in the first half of 2017 , at least 1 6@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan , around 20 % of the capital .
at the end of July , a car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l was killed at least 30 people in K@@ abu@@ l .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
a major bomb attack in the centre of the bomb in the centre of 31 May killed more than 150 people - the military attack on the military attack since the US @-@ led military forces in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the President of the United States , Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , is considering whether to increase the military and police forces in the country .
according to the Cor@@ ps , suicide attacks in recent weeks have also led to public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
the EPA annul@@ led the decision of def@@ er@@ ral following the postponement of the oral regulation
the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( I@@ MS ) annul@@ led the decision to delay the adoption of the Obama @-@ modern regulation obli@@ ging states to limit emissions caused by smo@@ g emissions , one day after 15 states referred the agency to court because of this progress .
the decision was announced by the decision to proceed with the &quot; 2015 ozone @-@ alcohol designation procedures &quot; late on Wednesday , saying that it shows the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we need to keep dialogue with our state partners and listen to them , &apos; said the President of the EPA , Mr P@@ ru@@ it@@ t .
the P@@ ru@@ it@@ t had announced the intention of June to reject the ozone content levels , which measure pollution from different parts of the country in order to determine where its level of minimum air quality standards should be reduced by one year to the 2018 year .
the 15 mainly democratic states jointly submitted an action against C@@ olum@@ bia on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has tried to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , and , as Mr T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i said , this part is part of a broader growth agenda .
these aspirations , however , have provoked reactions between the democrats and the natural groups who are concerned about the effects of increased pollutants on human health .
it is available on the website that brea@@ the brea@@ thing brea@@ our of ozone can reduce the ability of the Cop@@ g and increase the risk to diseases of res@@ pira@@ tory diseases , such as as@@ th@@ ma .

there was a cold ban which was replaced in June by the heat waves .

there is a clear demonstration there that black , white and grey con@@ te@@ stan@@ ts , if they are supplemented by the wood ton@@ es and to@@ tho@@ s , can be very desperate .
there will be some good ideas for a week to come , because the F@@ air will last until 13 August .

Ms M@@ oo@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko will meet for the first time ,
V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ set@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should be on a col@@ lisi@@ on course to go to the most attractive boys in the near future to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg in a weigh@@ ted category , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in An@@ ge@@ le@@ at in the ES@@ P@@ N office in An@@ ge@@ le@@ les , to Gar@@ cia , the winning World Bo@@ ce@@ Coun@@ c@@ il Coun@@ ty Coun@@ ch@@ po@@ pi@@ pi@@ l , wal@@ ked off the corridor to the second run in order to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko , World Bo@@ use@@ as@@ z@@ use@@ i sul@@ g@@ weigh@@ ch .
following the victory of the unanimous decision of the Gar@@ cia unanimously , the former four @-@ fold world champi@@ ons , the B@@ ron@@ er on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ late , both comb@@ at@@ ants are part of the top @-@ ranking .
Sh@@ cia got his better hand and said : &apos; how is it going , the champion ?
I wish you success . &quot;
in the case of L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko , your bel@@ ts in Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 ES@@ P@@ N .
when a few photo@@ graph@@ s were to be covered , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko pointed out in the E@@ g Kli@@ mas that a &apos; perfect moder@@ ation &apos; could be possible between the opposing mili@@ tias .
&quot; I am a former closing point , &apos; recalled Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I have been nominated for the B@@ ron@@ er &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg , but I am not so great .
I am a small per cent of 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move down@@ wards weight .
and it must go up@@ wards weight &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the F@@ än@@ s have called for this .
let us offer them that . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
finally , the question was raised as to whether this consideration should be worthwhile , it is part of his strategy under which he wants to allow the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ l to put an end to this year in the 6@@ 1.2 kg class , in order to make the next summer possible meeting in Gar@@ ci@@ aga ( 37 to 0 , 30 no@@ ci@@ ti ) , which also has an interest in combating Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ li , after their 23 September , in For@@ li@@ ture For@@ s@@ ala For@@ s@@ ala .
&quot; this struggle could be cost @-@ effective , as f@@ ans have called for this confrontation , &apos; said Gar@@ cia , later saying that he was open to combating any of the channels offering the best financial packages .
&quot; we are the main players .
no other name will be able to attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Mrs cia said that he considered L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t to be the &apos; driving force &apos; , and he could take a look at her Saturday .
but L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was modest in pra@@ ising the Gar@@ cia by saying that he thought that the three di@@ vis@@ es from the Ri@@ ver@@ side went out of three di@@ vis@@ es &apos; very slow ; excuse , M@@ set@@ y ... you wanted it to be no@@ ted &apos; .
in the words of Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show the strength and then the bo@@ xing .
both assured that they feel the tension is increasing to reach the tension .
&quot; this is a fight that awa@@ its realisation .
no other confrontation gives rise to so much attention and a great deal .
I am more than willing to work for this , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been on the waiting lists of the best comb@@ at@@ ants and the M@@ oo@@ y .
this is a good struggle . &quot;
what is going to happen from the world &apos;s eyes to Estonia ?
the extension of the soil and issuing a police and border agency ( PP@@ A ) record over 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have been travelling to Estonia for work , study or family .
if , for example , a fixed @-@ term residence permit was decided to issue 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreign , the impression was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the agencies cannot say how many immigrants are permanently left to Estonia , but such an analysis will be drawn up in the Ministry of the Interior .
if , a decade ago , nearly 500 Ukrainians died in the home , in recent years this figure will start to close to 2 000 .
the number of applicants for residence permits was so@@ aring at the time of the Ukrainian crisis - 1 6@@ 87 people had acquired fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 .
the statistical agency gives us the highest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia - the Ukrainian citizen who arrived in the soil in Estonia is more than a se@@ cession .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been a great community in Estonia and , due to complicated circumstances , it is natural that work and opportunities for learning are being sought from a country where the community and many of the family are already facing themselves &apos; , the internal Ministry of Interior in the Interior , Kris@@ tin Ram@@ mus .
the soil and the bub@@ ble , the number of open @-@ ended Ukrainians was even higher than the number of Russian citizens , although in ten years , the highest number of fixed @-@ term residence permits have been awarded .
if the Ukrainians come here predominantly , the citizens of Russia will have their family migration .
&quot; given the historic Russian community here , they are also more likely to have the largest family contacts with the people living in Russia , &quot; said the Internal Protection Ad@@ visor of the Interior , Hel@@ ina Mo@@ ina .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you look at where the citizens of Russia who have received Estonian residence have moved to life , after the land of Har@@ pre@@ iland , he immediately found East Vir@@ u@@ maa , added and pointed out that around 40 % of these have been mar@@ ried by the citizens of the European Union .
in the same way , 16@@ 96 Russian citizens received a fixed @-@ term residence permit , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the Russians &apos; permission to extend the residence permit decreased dramatically .
&quot; the compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , the new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence , &quot; explained the High Representative &apos;s press officer , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years .
there will be at least three years of foreign access from last year for a new residence permit to be established permanently .
its aim is to facilitate the si@@ ck@@ ness of people who have adapted to it .
a long @-@ term residence permit requires five years , for example .
after the new residence permit , the extension of the old residence permit has obviously been reduced .
for example , this residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians , who have been working for at least three years here .
now the Ukrainians will be able to change their work , and the country in Estonia is no longer pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit became popular - applicants &apos; holders of a grey passport ( 10@@ 29 ) , Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , individuals ( 54 ) and Nig@@ er@@ e@@ er@@ ers ( 36 ) .
in total , 19@@ 68 people were authorised to live in the Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and as many Chinese .
the first half of this year is already set at 12.@@ 69 .
in ten years , a country with a surpris@@ ingly poor country whose citizens are among the most active Estonian residence applicants .
when three residence permits were issued to the children of the age of 2007 , the bub@@ ble was 200 .
from Nigeria , you come to learn in these great universities .
in addition , the Estonian high education institutions are popular , for example among the Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
the number of Indian , Bangladeshi and Nig@@ erian citizens has increased predominantly thanks to the lessons learned .
in these cases , too , the rule applies that there is a need for the community to come up with more simply others , &quot; said Ram@@ mus .
over the course of 10 years , two people in Estonia have also moved from North Korea , for example , from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 from South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals obtain residence permits per year , around 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if you think about the citizens of the European Union , migration remains around a percentage , &quot; said : &apos; the numbers are actually small .
in total , 14 8@@ 22 people were reported by the statistical office in Estonia , while 13 7@@ 92 .
this means that immigration exceeded the second year from emigration .
most of the ex@@ o@@ dus and entry @-@ out are Estonian citizens , but there are more among those who leave them .
that is why the migration of Estonian citizens in the soil fell from 2 000 to 2 000 .

O@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture Pr@@ inc@@ ess is ma@@ gic with sa@@ us@@ a , chic@@ ken and dis@@ gus@@ ting .
in the nor@@ ther@@ land of the North , Maria Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u still has history - old pa@@ int@@ ings and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream of a muse@@ um somewhere in the muse@@ um , and the old st@@ es@@ ts and cra@@ b .
if you look at the road , you will study and learn on this every day .
it is a joy !
the long world of C@@ ou@@ ture may seem to be some kind of alien example , but de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourself decide how much you can be in your lives !
as a friend I have a friend who has been full of the w@@ ounds of the ha@@ ir that I have created .
for it is not his fault that he does not live in the Hol@@ ly@@ wood and does not go on a red al every day , he also wants to wear the most beautiful stic@@ kers and it is suffering !
you can live for your own life !
the Mo@@ e@@ artificial ar@@ tist does not recognise the gap between bri@@ lli@@ ant events and the grey day of the grey .
it is this reasoning that put the rolling stock on the ground to the places in the countryside , between forests and fields , to the people , who are often not reaching their m@@ ood .
the M@@ long colle@@ c@@ ti@@ lation was presented , for example , by a comparison , J@@ a@@ w and the Per@@ mo@@ e@@ alle@@ el , where 45 mo@@ del@@ l of 45 mo@@ del@@ l filled his entire street .
in a very often half @-@ ba@@ ked , young people are taken in a dignified way , but there are more emo@@ tions in other parts of the world - sh@@ ou@@ ting &apos; vo , you stand up , you want to thank you .
a great deal of the audience had to be news , but they are now long f@@ itted by C@@ ou@@ ture .
if you over@@ ride the expectations of the people , they are enthusiastic !
and I like this feeling that I am like to have my motto as summer &apos;s time .
we had a 50 @-@ me@@ tre @-@ red car@@ pet , a whole of today &apos;s rub@@ b@@ ish full of stic@@ ks , seemed to have no end !
neither do I recognise the motto that the creation of a super@@ &apos; super@@ ficial &apos; body must be presented , with the usual usual women .
I often call on the own clients - they have always gla@@ dly come .
this is the kind of experience , the sa@@ ga of the spar@@ k in the wonderful room !
I am so sorry that I have never seen my performance , but I am always behind the fact that , as a result , I am hope@@ less to give hope@@ less per@@ se@@ less as a last piece of meat .
my ner@@ v@@ ous will not allow cal@@ mly to watch the Chamber .
this is the kind of mo@@ el@@ d who does not just want to play a part in the role of the representative , but in everything it was supposed to be .
I have got my sis@@ ter in my sis@@ ter , the majority of the colle@@ ctions .
I like the whole process where you play with details , you discover .
I am never a long way away from our creation and I do not fear it .
it is not just a matter of in@@ fin@@ ement , of logistics , of organisation , of organisation - all of which must ju@@ mp the day of one of the sta@@ mps .
there is a great deal of praise for these working hours .
I am not able to say when my working day stops , for me it is just a day of pleasure .
I have been very lu@@ cky about this - it is like an un@@ stop@@ p@@ able chain of luck : I am doing something fine , you get something fine and , in turn , compli@@ ments .
it has been said several times that my bro@@ kers are a ma@@ gic one : they make themselves a pr@@ ine s@@ ong .
the abundan@@ t list of the gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ lic cir@@ cus , which was made famous overnight by Maria talent , M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture sign@@ alling to date .
Mr M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ pp U@@ 18 boys : the weapon of the custody of Est@@ oni@@ ans is now turned against us .
the damage , the fa@@ iry tale is running out .
the first thing is that we did not get our des@@ k .
and if there is such a difference in the table , there is nothing to be done &apos; , the Estonian U@@ 18 cor@@ ners of the Pal@@ ace : 75 out of the UK , our only milestone , Mr Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ er Martin M@@ and@@ r@@ se@@ pp .
opponents were attacked by 28 bal@@ ls and received so many more attacks .
we were not prepared either to defend them aggressive and to attack it , it created it .
many of the British attacks ended in three to five seconds , we were not able to build protection .
however , when it came to the protection , they reached every side of the hands , we could not combine it .
it created a team on its feet .
the work of the opponents was better done .
the M@@ üh@@ r@@ se@@ pa estimates that Estonia would have to make more tac@@ tical mistakes in order to get the opponents down in the b@@ ud .
the last quarter of the water - we had a zero error , but opponents have already been quick to repeat .
A@@ tle@@ eth@@ ness and close insistence , which was a sla@@ p @-@ up to our arms , has now turned to all of us .
today we had no strength against their aggressive attitude .
the M@@ üh@@ r@@ se@@ k remained at the heart of his neg@@ ligence , in Kal@@ ev@@ is , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s .
overall , there is good words for a whole team in general , to say to the team , to date there was a single blow in the strike .
it is a pity that this aggressive oppon@@ ent was already for@@ ged in the past .
the whole time has been self @-@ confident and played off the streets , but seemed to have been ti@@ red of - he has borne a huge burden .
but he made some very positive moves that I have seen in the past in the trends . &quot;
terrible figures : the re@@ has@@ ing of ne@@ re@@ ts in the &apos; E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ iri@@ l &apos; with less than 10 points ...
in the latest age class , it is not only young men &apos; formula B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on bas@@ ket@@ ball in Tallinn , which started in Dublin yesterday .
and the Estonian game in Poland , unfortunately , is in the area of qu@@ aran@@ ces .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 but , even after the third water anda@@ let , the situation was 9 : 49 , in the last ten minutes only 16 : 16 .
both in the first and second quarters , Estonian 4 , 3rd 1 ( ... )
in so doing , at the beginning of two minutes , two pieces were thrown out of the first two minutes , and 25 have been caught by 25 , then one of the three has been retained and then 21 more dismissed ...
perhaps for almost half an hour , 47 vis@@ es are caught .
in addition , 2 points came from four free chains .
the many losses were a sensible figure in this time , 12 .
by the end of the game , Poland was stag@@ na@@ ted with 33 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has begun two losses , with the exception of the Portuguese 83 : 56 black black .
NATO vessels in Tallinn to complement Tallinn
today , 1 weeks ago , a permanent anti @-@ dumping group from NATO came to Tallinn for a port port visit to complement the stocks of vessels and prepare for the pre @-@ presu@@ med exercise .
ships in the course of the visit are preparing to na@@ il the sea and give cre@@ ws a chance of a few days &apos; leave .
following a visit , ships from NATO will remain in the waters of Estonia to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future historic rem@@ nan@@ ts for bur@@ sting .
&quot; the involvement of Est@@ oni@@ ans in NATO units and their activities in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the mer@@ ging forces &apos; , said the overseas fleet &apos;s over @-@ capacity for Operation Operation Ar@@ to Rein@@ land .
since 29 June , a team of the 1 June of NATO &apos;s 1 permanent mines in the Latvian Na@@ vy ten@@ nis cap@@ tain G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , who took over the responsibilities of the Estonian naval officer from the cap@@ tain of the Estonian Sea .
the flag of the Group is designated by the Latvian naval vessel L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , which also has a group leader .
during this semester , the International Force is also part of the Estonian naval area and the area of a@@ eron@@ au@@ tics .
as one of the four NATO naval comm@@ and@@ ers , the NATO 1 permanent anti @-@ missile group on the basis of a team of four NATO naval comm@@ ands , which can be sent to various parts of the world in five days .
4 . - 13 August , the mo@@ irs of the P@@ iri@@ ta mon@@ as@@ tery will become once again a site where 13 years ago 13 years ago the Ma@@ ri K@@ ans are being called on to F@@ esti@@ val F@@ esti@@ val .
this year &apos;s Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val will be the risk of a beautiful , powerful and unprecedented risk , according to the F@@ esti@@ val of F@@ esti@@ val .
the risk to the J@@ oo@@ st : &apos; the la@@ yers reach the &apos; Tra@@ vi@@ ata &apos; and the &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; , the bal@@ le &apos;s disco@@ lu@@ m@@ ma@@ va &quot; B@@ ole@@ ro@@ st , &quot; a la@@ d@@ ni &apos;s &apos; Kar@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ ini &apos; , and neither does it lack its own production , which is this time Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ni admi@@ or@@ or@@ ama &apos; A@@ asta@@ times &apos; la@@ ching the same international lo@@ ving team in 2015 and neither does it lack its own production , which is this time Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ni admi@@ lise A@@ asta@@ times .
Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val is much more than just concer@@ t and theat@@ re responses .
this is greater than any music theat@@ re in its normal form .
it is a festi@@ val that is gaining ground and is never going to get off the ground .
because the experience that can be heard and can be found in this sup@@ erior and my@@ ste@@ rious environment , human mind sounds b@@ righ@@ ter and it concerns human tragedies in a way that is not possible .
risk to the first year of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val &apos;s artistic leader .
did the Ma@@ as@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ ans not felt a little bit like this ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with E@@ ry Klaus , it has been a great deal of help .
he went through a career of a whole of mine and also supported a career in the early stages of a di@@ visi@@ ve career .
perhaps it is thanks to which I will be easier to continue his work .
in the different camps , the F@@ esti@@ val team has so much ch@@ arity and , of course , it is passed on to me .
it was excellent to join a team who knows how things are going .
it is the great courage of the E@@ ri K@@ ee@@ a who gave me the strength to move ahead with F@@ esti@@ lou@@ i F@@ esti@@ val@@ i in harmony in Tallinn .
and here I am , and I can do it .
what would be the audience for the audience in the street , which is what are you offering ?
we have the land of artists , Latvia , Lithuania and , as a surprise , a first C@@ abinet , written to Mrs L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i .
to do so , &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson f@@ ights &apos; .
and one of the no@@ torious nu@@ ances at this is that it was written by the author of Latvia in Kar@@ noise and J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ bia , who himself expressed a desire to write this act .
he has probably had the fear of the Car@@ l@@ sson flo@@ ak@@ er who had lived in the b@@ ud .
to what extent do you hun@@ t all this ?
thanks to my support , my fellow Member will certainly .
this work needs a system of support and much love , and I am fortuna@@ te enough to do so .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tions are not dependent on so many other people , as I am perhaps going to be going against every new day .
and such an informed tone , keeping a positive spirit and actually s@@ mile itself in the morning , significantly raised my happy percentage .
especially now this week , when the most important test is , I have been very keen to practise it and it is working .
turning yourself into a s@@ mile is a s@@ ounding and raises tone .
it is not just a word of words .
I think people do not yet know the boys about their own body , which the univer@@ se is offering them , but everybody himself is little comfortable .
immediately , this is an important moment .
is there some ri@@ tual before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ d w@@ ounded ?
it is time that the clo@@ thes need to be replaced by more convenient .
it is a small moment for itself .
but , in general , I do not have the opportunity to make a pu@@ mp or a little s@@ nap@@ ping before a great deal of time .
in fact , I even like to be very keen to communicate with the people , even before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ant were taken .
but come to all Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val@@ i , what is detected here , not particularly for the great oper@@ atives and the cy@@ cl@@ one .

new findings of the evaluation of the age of Swedish asylum applicants :
in Sweden , there were some of the asylum applicants , in which the old approach to their old approach was medic@@ ally assessed , and the latest results of the test show that more than 80 % of the texts were judged to be older than 18 , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of results .
the Swedish National Institute for Public Health ( R@@ ash@@ ts@@ ici@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ k ) started the tests for the beginning of this year .
the tests were set up in the period of application for a more accurate evaluation of age , following Swedish Mig@@ ra@@ ti@@ an ( I@@ Mig@@ s@@ ver@@ ket ) , in particular for failing to correctly define the age of many allegedly under@@ age minors .
to date , the I@@ ver@@ s@@ ver@@ ket test has been sent of 80 cases and the Institute of For@@ en@@ si@@ c in March 2017 , up to 31 July , the results of 24 81 tests .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) was assessed at 18 years old or older and a further 25 cases were assessed by the Institute of medicine to test the test &quot; may be 18 years old or older . &quot;
in the 4@@ 32 cases , it has been concluded that a person is &apos; perhaps younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if a person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to the Joh@@ an Institute of medicine , Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son , the results are consistent with those of the past months .
&quot; we do not see the big difference compared with the previous statistics , the numbers are quite consistent , &apos; he said in the newspaper .
the fact that a large proportion of the cases were deemed to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum applicants have shed their age .
the Institute issued the results of the May test and said that , in 4@@ 42 cases , there are indications that the person studying is 18 or old or older . &quot;
however , when the newspaper was able to see the results of these 581 tests in the Northern Dimension , it emerged that 2@@ 43 people had directly claimed that it would be 18 this year .
this method of medical age assessment being conducted by th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic r@@ ö@@ n@@ t@@ gen@@ i@@ ic@@ i@@ ic and s@@ cor@@ n @-@ blood MR@@ T , which could be analysed on den@@ tists and radi@@ ology , have been criticised in some quarters .
one of the sceptics is the C@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute endo@@ k@@ rin@@ g Claude Mar@@ cus , whose working tasks include an assessment of the biological maturity of people to find out whether they passed a teen@@ ag@@ er in the normal sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about it , and I do not think that the measure used now should be used .
the appointment of biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say for sure , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he said to the newspaper Met@@ ro &apos; .
but in Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son &apos;s doctor , the doctor &apos;s medical Institute , defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; overall , it can be said that a child &apos;s in@@ accurate risk of adul@@ tera@@ tion is small .
perhaps the biggest perhaps around 10 % are at risk of just under 18 . &quot;

it seems more expensive to understand the seriousness of the situation and is working hard to deal with it .
a more expensive deal deals with a problem that led to another by @-@ product .
more expensive is no longer defen@@ sive .

he is not trying to blame you for his behaviour .
he agrees that it has made a serious mistake and is genuinely trying to remedy the situation .
he is attentive and is trying to communicate with you in a pleasant way .
at the same time , he will put his blue in a hur@@ ry .
they do not deny what has happened and are not trying to make it un@@ noticed .
you have a better understanding of the cost of being attentive to you .
you are talking about it and about how to avoid it in the future .
you are better placed to communicate and assess each other &apos;s needs .
a more expensive attitude and action has helped to develop the sympathy against his error .
your commitment and behaviour have created the basis for your proximity to recovery .

20 years old and Anna Maria O@@ rel gave a beautiful debate in M@@ M@@ il , receiving 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7@@ ga a good 18 .
after all , M@@ M no@@ or@@ m was a woman &apos;s waste and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for med@@ als in the future .
the contest went well and I got a good experience .
with the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) I immediately did my average result , the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) , I went too much , and third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) , I had been able to keep it clear , &quot; said O@@ rel after the contest .
I went to my own emissions and I am very pleased that I found it .
Ms Maria O@@ re@@ l M@@ M &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 .
the O@@ reli@@ it did not obs@@ cure , because it is mar@@ ching on the basis of a sta@@ tic phase in the phase .
&quot; I am afraid , he said a little mu@@ ti@@ gue .
the London Olympic Tor@@ ch@@ on was almost a full house for the people , was it the people of O@@ rel himself around himself or turned himself off ?
I have seen it , but in a positive sense .
everyone is saying that it gives us - that is !
if you go down the road , you can experience it .
it was confirmed that M@@ M &apos;s debate is satisfactory , and he is still waiting for a great deal of good contest : &apos; I came here to 3@@ 2nd , the latest result , I finished on 18 .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and the M@@ M@@ C - that is the only thing that matters .
I am taking a good experience , and on some day I would like to compete on behalf of med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina ku@@ ber@@ ner declared party exchange
in his inaugu@@ ral meeting with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , the Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a Democrat , reported on Thursday evening with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ y that he breaks parties .
&quot; we want it or not , but democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &apos; said the Governor of the govern@@ or .
&quot; today I say to you , having been afraid of the pra@@ st and I have thought ... today I say to you , the West Bank , that I cannot help you any more as democratic govern@@ or . &apos;
O@@ ver@@ ting in the do@@ or@@ step was grati@@ fying .
&quot; so I will be the Re@@ publi@@ can tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a T@@ re@@ er , I would say to you that it is time to play a second game . &quot;
the T@@ ru@@ mp had promised a great deal of announcement in the Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
the T@@ ru@@ mp w@@ ins a 42 point in the Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and the candida@@ cy of H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton was not supported by the democrats .

at the same time , the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) published on Thursday evening that the &apos; govern@@ or Justice &apos; party party is yet another blow to the democratic party , which would rather prevent the country from making a better change than to work for it &apos; .
&quot; a mere 15 months , and control over all the lowest number of states in history - the Governor of the govern@@ or of govern@@ or , is simply the most recent one of the most recent , which is the search for a positive and un@@ iting message , &apos; said R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ Daniel statement C@@ B@@ S New@@ si .
it is no surprise that there are many people , there are many injured .

according to the Ur@@ me@@ ti , visitors will come to the festi@@ val with the wrong foot@@ wear , and so the problems come .
the media have also had to help a couple of more injured visitors - there have been some s@@ care@@ mon@@ gering and also one of the foot@@ wear .

Mr Co@@ e approved Russians &apos; fair apolo@@ gy for the D@@ em@@ it channel
Mr S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , the international r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of Ker@@ ge@@ ate , applau@@ ded his words &apos; Russia &apos;s four@@ day &apos;s honest excuse for the D@@ oping scandal , but reiterated that now is not the time to promise the country back to sport .
D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin , Russia &apos;s ligh@@ ter effect , said that the ban on the International C@@ up of the ath@@ le@@ tin World C@@ up in the eve of the eve of the World C@@ up , that the ban on the competition imposed on his country is right and that it has a firm objective of combating doping .
he apolog@@ ised &apos; from all the ath@@ le@@ tes who have lost their gol@@ den gol@@ den gold and sil@@ ver s@@ wine . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of a ban on the entry into force of a ban on the entry into force of a ban on the entry into force of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) in Russia .
&quot; I think it was a very honest answer today , a very honest presentation , &apos; said IA@@ AF @-@ i President Co@@ e .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian al@@ ali@@ an also acknowledged that they had had quite difficult times and that they would do their utmost to restructure the permanent alliance . &quot;
in the words of Co@@ e , he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criterion of self @-@ forecas@@ ting .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and there is progress , but the Congress supports the working group &apos;s proposal that this is not the time to take Russia back , &apos; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we need to do everything possible over the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want to dis@@ soci@@ ate pure sporting ath@@ le@@ tes from the system &apos; .
one of the other Russian ath@@ le@@ tes who comply with the stringent criteria of IA@@ AF will compete on Friday in London as neutral ath@@ le@@ tes in the World C@@ up .
Mr R@@ une Ander@@ sen , the head of the IA@@ AF working group , said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet a number of forecas@@ ted criteria .
following a presentation by the IAEA to the Council , in London , he told the London press that the anti @-@ doping controls are still inadequate , and that the travel engineers were still operating freely .
the electric car revolution makes a significant difference in demand for metals .
who are the winners and the losers ?
the fact that the electric car revolution will substantially change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure , it will also create new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although mines like G@@ len@@ ge can say that one place they win and lose , smaller mining firms will not help .
at the moment , the G@@ len@@ core coal and oil will continue to be built , but co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ kel will continue to grow .
this year , the UK , France and Norway governments &apos; decisions have contributed to the spread of electric cars , allowing decades to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the near future .
it is already Vol@@ vo who knew that they are planning to abandon their internal combustion engine and T@@ es@@ la will bring the market a cheaper one in the market for the cheap@@ est electric car .
B@@ animal berg &apos;s New Energy Finance predi@@ ctions are already expected to sell more electric cars than cars produced from oil over the next two decades .
&quot; for some parts it amends everything , &quot; said Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ ini B@@ animal ber@@ g , according to the analysis of the raw materials of Capital . &quot;
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as co@@ balt and li@@ thi@@ um , which demand has grown for years .
in electric cars , there are about three times more cop@@ per than in the ordinary car , G@@ len@@ tures .
there is a need for re@@ charging stations , which is why the &apos; B@@ N@@ P Paris Paris &apos; estimates that it will increase demand for 2025 of around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means an additional li@@ p , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ gan@@ demand .
the G@@ len@@ ds can grow from the rising price of electric cars and that it is the world &apos;s largest co@@ balt in the world , forecast the J@@ eff@@ arly Group .
this country &apos;s bro@@ ker estimates that F@@ ree@@ port @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ tum Min@@ er@@ als are winners of the winning power of electric cars .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of the London me@@ tal code has been fished .
the increase in the price of the Mul@@ ti years was 37 % .
the answer is 14 per cent of this year , mainly due to economic growth .
the G@@ len@@ ge stock in London rose by 20 % , having sur@@ passed on the ri@@ val in Rio T@@ heu@@ Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ li@@ on and Ang@@ lo .
on the front of the losers , companies such as Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine , will be required to adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ use of the ball is the seed of petrol and diesel engines with a stream of flow@@ ers .
electric cars use li@@ thi@@ um @-@ free win@@ dows .
&quot; this is a serious risk of lead demand unless any other purpose can be found , which could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael W@@ id@@ mer , head of analysis of the market in the Bank of England .
with regard to the price of the P@@ li@@ i price , there is not yet any effect of a sc@@ at@@ tering trend .
P@@ li@@ i is 17 % of this year , which is the best meta@@ me@@ tal in London , among the main industrial metals .
investors see problems in the me@@ tal in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure that the lead is so bad , as cheap oil is holding un@@ conventional competition , &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Z@@ wi@@ g , a me@@ tal in me@@ tal .
if the lead demand falls , it will be slow .
this may be the case for around ten years .
in the meantime , however , stricter emission standards mean that hybrid demand for hybrid cars is increasing , which is more dependent on the lead @-@ based bat@@ teries in the launch of these engines .
Car@@ g@@ me@@ ro@@ les such as alu@@ mini@@ um replace steel , as let us get the car going to drive off the electric .
this will be explained by a minimum of 1.6 million tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish between 2013 and 2016 .
it accounts for 2.7 % of the world &apos;s total .
this trend is likely to grow , said W@@ id@@ mer .
the A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um is 13 per cent of this year , as the increasing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
the steel producers are not .
on the subject of ak , General Motors will work with General Motors to use nano@@ technologies for the production of so @-@ called car chains .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and the de@@ ser@@ t Europe are trying to develop a ligh@@ ter th@@ read steel to stand up to the minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris &apos;s analysis of Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
there is some success in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to the pla@@ te .
it took around half of this precious me@@ tal diesel engine for car cataly@@ sts , reported me@@ tal fin@@ gers and Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ si .
&quot; many of the high @-@ demand raw materials such as oil and pos@@ ters may not have a major demand in the future , &quot; said Na@@ ti@@ x@@ ise raw materials analysis , Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
Pla@@ at@@ in@@ de producers continue to believe in the continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Mr Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , the head of the Un@@ sta@@ r , said that , in 2025 , more hybrid cars will continue to be sold to hybrid cars .
the great hope of planned producers in the 10 years is To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Mot@@ ori and Hy@@ f Mo@@ to@@ si @-@ developed hydrogen cells based on the pla@@ te to produce a hydrogen electricity .
until now , however , this technology has not yet proved to be legitimate .
&quot; the latter appears to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P from Paris to Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers received a major set@@ back in July , as S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art &apos;s court abolished the use of diesel in the town of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how the financial rules on football will affect the transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the un@@ bri@@ dled spending of European football clubs are not ham@@ pered by the global record transition from the Spanish football club to the French club of Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences from UEFA , the governing body that govern@@ s the European game and has the potential to ban cre@@ ws in the presence of the pres@@ ti@@ gious March of the media , waiting for the Paris Saint Ger@@ mention .
the rules of fair play introduced by UEFA in 2011 ( F@@ F@@ P ) mean that the PS@@ G must prove that the transition to the transition to Ney@@ March was funded without huge loss .
a total of EUR 2@@ 22 million was paid out to Barcelona ( 2@@ 62 million dollars ) for having been able to buy his contract , and the salary of Mr Ney@@ s will reach up to tens of millions of dollars a year .
there are some aspects of the transfer of transplants to the French club .
the G @-@ l will undoubtedly be able to recruit a de@@ sig@@ ner in the recruitment of a number of mar@@ ches , given that the team finances the family of the Q@@ a@@ tar .
clubs are allowed to spend a great deal to recruit players , but they must balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out of the football business .
Mr F@@ F@@ P has laid the foundation for Michel Pla@@ tini following his election as President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs who fall in search of their search in large debt are actually dealing with fraud and risk shopping when banks or owners should give up their support .
since 2011 F@@ F@@ P will focus on monitoring their losses instead of F@@ F@@ P clubs .
this change means that the business model used by Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch was first used in C@@ hel@@ sea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then to make huge costs to make it easier for the team to be improved and that the global trade mark is harder to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of F@@ F@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can carry up up to EUR 30 million .
and , despite the fact that Mr Pla@@ tini was dis@@ repu@@ ted in 2015 by the presidential office , his UEFA &apos;s success@@ ors and Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in are still committed to ob@@ struc@@ ting excessive spending .
F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules , &apos; said last week &apos;s F@@ press le Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is UEFA &apos;s F@@ F@@ P concessions .
although the PS@@ G is one of the integrated payment clauses for a single whole payment clause , they will be able to distribute this sum for the purposes of the entire contract for the period of validity of the Treaty .
a five @-@ year contract was signed by Mr Ney@@ mar , which makes it possible to show a sum of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
with the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G became the most severe punish@@ ments on the Abu D@@ ic@@ bi in Abu C@@ it@@ y@@ ga .
for the G @-@ G , a fine of EUR 60 million was set at EUR 82 million , which was reduced to EUR 20 million later , and a club was required to limit the implementation of the March @-@ 2015 season for the 21 @-@ 2015 season .
UEFA is looking for clubs who can try to control financial institutions , blow@@ ing their incomes through companies linked to clubs .
while a subscri@@ ber company may spon@@ sor the PS@@ G , but if the value of spon@@ sorship is deemed to be standard market rates , UEFA will not allow this official income to count .
this was the case in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the quality of the support for the Q@@ a@@ tar has been inf@@ lated .
it has been said that a certain part of the PS@@ D PS@@ G may come from the World C@@ up Management Committee for the period of 20 22 years through the S@@ C@@ C .
however , the PS@@ G and the Q@@ a@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that it would be possible to become a World C@@ up and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulators can easily un@@ cover such a manoeuvre .
the penalties imposed on the G of the G mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant when it comes to any attempt to fl@@ out the rules .
the familiar people of the situation have echo@@ ed on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition of the PS@@ G to preventive discussions .
they talked to the P@@ press on condition that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PS@@ G .
the latest reports show that , in the period 2015 @-@ 2016 , more than EUR 10 million will be profitable at around EUR 2.4 million .
the latest financial year has not yet been published .
the PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of the Ney@@ s will be good for spon@@ sorship deals , commodity processing and seal sales .
a minimum of 30 per cent growth is expected in the context of the agreement .
Spain too , having clearly upset the departure of one of the biggest football sta@@ rs , trying to prevent the transition of a mar@@ tary , arguing that the PS@@ G is in breach of F@@ F@@ P .
&quot; this is clear the case of the &apos; financial doping &apos; with a club and a country , &apos; said Javier T@@ eb@@ as , President of the La T@@ eb@@ as , referring to the fact that the PS@@ G belongs mainly to Q@@ a@@ le .
Ar@@ ried W@@ en@@ ger , a member of the Ar@@ sen@@ al memory of the Ar@@ sen@@ ger , whose club belongs to the American sporting mag@@ na@@ ge , shares the English approach that the country funds the club .
&quot; this is a consequence of property rights , and it has changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to the country , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as others can have other ways or other interests so that such a large player is represented . &apos;

Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to hear that interest rates remain at the same level as weak growth and the easing of inflation have cus@@ hi@@ oned speculation on the increase .
Bank of England has warned that growth is stag@@ na@@ ting because household incomes have put interest rates on stand@@ by .
the policy makers of the Bank &apos;s Committee on Monetary Policy ( MP@@ C ) have voted for a period of 6 : 2 to 0.@@ 25 % for retention and less Members will be demanding an increase in this month , as slow growth has weakened support .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the bank is s@@ las@@ hing at 1.7 % in the 2017 growth forecast and a 1.6 % increase in 2018 , and warned that pressure on households &apos; incomes persists , as inflation is expected to return to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the bank also sign@@ alled that the growth rate will be necessary to curb inflation caused by Bre@@ x@@ it@@ k over the next few years , and on financial markets it may be necessary to have a higher increase in the cost of borrowing .
the Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the economic stimulus package , which was launched a year ago by Bre@@ x@@ t .
it will put an end to a fixed @-@ term finance scheme in February , offering banks cheap money , although he said that it is now expected to wait for an increase of 15 billion , which is GBP 115 billion .
on the basis of the decision on the rate , the bank is saying : &quot; GDP remains the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the near future , as the difficult situation of households &apos; real income will continue to have an effect on consumption . &quot;
on the level of inflation , it was reiterated that there is a need to tighten the monetary policy to some extent &apos; and this &apos; somewhat greater &apos; than expected in the markets .
the Böge programme is now predi@@ cting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the bank emphasised that any anthem is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to May .
the projected growth forecast of 1.8 % in 2018 remained stable .
after that news , the p@@ ounds fell against the dollar and the euro .
in Naples , there were 0.5 % of USD 1.@@ 31 and 0.@@ 4 % to EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make any changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have raised rising hopes in relation to rising GDP rose by 0.@@ 3 % in the second quarter of the previous quarter .
the bank says that growth is likely to reach 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will start collecting slightly .
the latest inflation report in the bank provided little reason to re@@ jo@@ ice with rising inflation and w@@ ret@@ ched wage increases , saying that the situation would get slightly worse before the recovery is made .
it was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent incoming incomes in the next few years , but a three @-@ year forecast is expected to bring about a marked recovery of wages .
as a result of this fine GBP , the economy is stimu@@ lated by the growing demand for British produce , which partially compensa@@ tes the lower costs of consumers .
the decision comes one year after the rates were taken in August by 0.@@ 25 % following the shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the price .
the bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to brea@@ the prices and economies .
before the last decision of the bank , increasing demand for raising the demand was felt , as inflation increased pressure on stra@@ its households ; three policy makers called for an increase from 0.5 % in July .
inflation fell at 2.6 % last month , compared with 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected to rise again over the next few months .
the bank said that excessive growth compared to 2 % was completely down to weak .
in the light of the recent decline in the spre@@ ads of the Co@@ rec@@ o mortgage , Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , said that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive , as the lending companies are losing their jobs and hoping to complete their positive hope for the year .
the latter seem to be particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to a close , since re@@ financing , often serving and low @-@ rate , have become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS is writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV medicines
patients have had access to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; HIV treatment following the battle of the Supreme Court on whether the N@@ HS should finance the medicine .
the N@@ HS reported that public health now makes an initial clinical attempt to make it possible for an estimated 10 000 people to be exposed to exposure to pre @-@ pre ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t that is being man@@ age@@ ated before the mid @-@ term and which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection by around 86 % for people with high risk .
the N@@ HS agreed to finance the clinical test after an appeal court supported the ruling of the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS is able to pay for the EP , despite the claims made by the agency itself that the medicinal product should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Simon Ste@@ vens , President of the N@@ HS Eng@@ land , welcomed this Thursday &apos;s public release as &apos; new extensive intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &apos; land@@ mark moment &apos; .
the sexual health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ righ@@ ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ bo@@ oli@@ s and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to register people in October and will be accompanied by even more clin@@ ics in October , before the programme is introduced by April 2018 .
there is also a pre @-@ professional pro@@ phy@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) is an HIV medicine cu@@ ur that is to be taken before the mid @-@ term to minimise the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that the Pr@@ EP will significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission among people who are infected .
the introduction of the Pr@@ EP before the mid @-@ term means that a person &apos;s body has sufficient numbers of medicines that prevent HIV infections from being infected .
these medicines can be taken on a daily basis or two hours before the mid @-@ term .
one of the most suitable candidates will include les@@ bian or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are HIV @-@ infected and unable to receive treatment .
appropriate people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV as an inter@@ dependent partner cannot receive anti @-@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen to have a family doctor will be able to register their participation in the local health clin@@ ic in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and the N@@ HS has signed an agreement to obtain medicines this week following an international procurement procedure .
the clinical test is intended to assess the real potential of Pr@@ EP by collecting clinical evidence of who is treated and implemented in a large cloud .
Ste@@ ary said : &apos; this new extensive intervention should complement and enhance the widespread and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
this is yet another milestone in the struggle for one of the biggest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , NA@@ T @-@ i Executive , said : &quot; this is a land@@ mark moment in the fight against HIV .
the Pr@@ EP , if it is correctly targeted at those who need it and belong to the risk group , is an opportunity to transform the HIV epidemic in the United Kingdom .
since September , people with a high risk of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool , which is individually managed and dependent on negotiating with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
the CE@@ O of the Ter@@ rence Fund , CE@@ ian Green , said : &apos; the priority now is to ensure that the clinical trial should be pushed out swiftly and that none of the members of the HIV risk group are excluded and excluded .
now that the clinical test of Pr@@ EP clin@@ ic has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are in danger of being infected with HIV .
Ms K@@ d@@ g@@ son said : &apos; the start of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is very welcome and very much delayed following the months of delays and the leg@@ alisation of the government .
evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to HIV prevention and the non @-@ proliferation of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt takes us one step closer to the full understanding of the benefits of the Pr@@ EP .
it is now important that the clinical trial be introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people with exposure to HIV , and take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the cost of electricity rose by 12 % in Estonia , while in Latvia and Lithuania .
in July , the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to EUR 1.@@ 94 , compared with EUR 7.@@ 71 in June this year .
the main reason for the price differences is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , the price of the electricity centre in Estonia was estimated at 3@@ 4.@@ 33 euro per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour and the price rose to 12 per cent compared to 12 % .
in Latvia and Lithuania the price fell by five per cent to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 17 and the electricity exchange on the Nord half of the system was 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour .
prices rose by 12 and seven per cent respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity inter@@ vie@@ ted from 75 % last month to Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine per cent between two countries did not attend the next day .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity was moved from 99 % from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % had their capacity to use all transmission capacity .
according to the last trading day of July , in the area of Nas@@ da@@ q , the electricity stock market in August could develop around 34 and September of EUR 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour .
the price of carbon dioxide prices on electricity prices came up last month and transactions were conducted at 5.@@ 04 @-@ 5.@@ 47 per tonne .
living lives - semi @-@ clean and cle@@ ver de@@ sig@@ ners have transformed this pet@@ ty Ear@@ l &apos;s house to house a flat house .
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker who is im@@ passion@@ ate about property innova@@ tors and exchanged their large K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge home in 2014 against the Ear@@ l .
it is on the first floor of Ms Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ Ter@@ d , and that Jo@@ anne has not sold his bags to the pac@@ ket and the flat @-@ off , is an honourable statement to a new design .
&quot; before that , I lived together with a former life @-@ mak@@ er in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , &apos; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I referred to something that would be tanta@@ mount to the price that I offered .
I have been shown that the Ear@@ ls of the Ear@@ l were repeated , with the same high waves .
I have done this and I made the same offer on the day . &quot;
since the first visit , it is 93 @-@ square metres that has passed a complete innovation .
at the beginning it was one s@@ lee@@ ping to@@ at@@ re and a complicated sta@@ r - s@@ lee@@ ping s@@ lee@@ ping to s@@ cu@@ n in the s@@ lee@@ ping , and Jo@@ anne wanted to add a s@@ lee@@ ping of storage and qu@@ asi @-@ order to take advantage of the high ones .
&quot; I wanted ambitious , big win@@ dows , many light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he is asking for the design of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi N@@ ot@@ ting architecture and de@@ sig@@ ner Du@@ ck Du@@ ck to take advantage of the 3,@@ 8 de@@ ser@@ ts and to create a home that is not just a development object but a place where the Jo@@ b could live .
the final thing was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so architecture was a archite@@ ctural challenge to create a qu@@ asi @-@ standing where it could stand .
the exception was to take the form of creativity .
&quot; the Me@@ tal@@ l@@ construction is quite complex , &apos; he will explain .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise the spaces so that they are based on each other , without being bo@@ gged down .
it was not just a platform to build a platform , but we used the steel design so that it is only right to have the upper room for over@@ crow@@ d . &quot;
this place allowed the Er@@ fan@@ il to create two full s@@ takes with each other , with a great deal of dramatic elements .
in the order of Poland , it will open up in the old age of dis@@ gus@@ ting or rou@@ tine &apos;s window of view .
the gol@@ den th@@ read fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver detail and retro@@ spe@@ ctive Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille &apos;s lighting under@@ score .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a part in the introduction of theat@@ re , space and lighting .
in the short corridor , the mir@@ rors have been added to see that it would seem longer .
in the case of night , I would like to give the impression as the second window of the w@@ ool .
in the course of the course , a mir@@ ro@@ l report provides a reflection on all the directors and glass boards .
for the whole of life , the opportunity to close part of vegetables will be closed if it is not used , creating an imag@@ in@@ ative change of mind .
there is nothing new on the do@@ or@@ step .
what is unique about this is , however , a unique fact that it is an ab@@ iding copy of the popular u@@ prising .
&quot; this has been a little de@@ serving of planning , &apos; clarifies the Er@@ fan &apos;s strength from the de@@ spo@@ tism of M@@ D@@ F .
&quot; it has a counter@@ weight , which is why it is very simply le@@ c@@ tured when it is put off . &apos;
thanks to the space of space and storage , Jo@@ anne is now 16 additional metres , an extra s@@ lee@@ ping room and a better flat @-@ up plan .
&quot; after all , the floor is a flo@@ wn of what you sell - or what gives real value to property &apos; .
&quot; Kin@@ nis@@ asset Coun@@ ty &quot; is outdated and makes calculations on the basis of land area area . &quot;
here they have been able to increase the floor , using high @-@ quality materials which add a luxury to the premises .
&quot; materials are what you are missing and which will help to create an emotional bond with the home , &apos; says the Er@@ fan .
&quot; you will not be able to live in the gu@@ est of electricity .
this is important , but it does not place the heart of the hearts . &quot;
this shows that a good design and increased surface area can do something ama@@ zing from a rather normal flat .
in fact , they may even have the potential not to leave , as happened with Jo@@ anne .
the main figure is the ch@@ ic@@ ago cloud of Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s mo@@ ck@@ ery , who con@@ tests with his counter@@ part in the name of a de@@ ser@@ t .
there is no mention of the amount of money that has been earned , un@@ fol@@ ding any ethics .
his wife and three children only see a man in the early and late night .
in the first half of the film , I think that this is the version of the &apos; house of Ka@@ ar@@ di@@ house &apos; - even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Mr Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s speech is similar .
the film , the little the ec@@ ad@@ ri@@ c element remains , and the hu@@ m@@ our of film @-@ makers is becoming more and more transparent .
the main experience of life can be attributed to the issue of the main player and the disease .
the choice between working and family life must now be made .
the po@@ in@@ ous son makes a father &apos;s feet on the ground to think about really important things such as religion , ch@@ arity , love ... , not even a twin @-@ blo@@ wn disaster .
after the third st@@ un@@ t , where the son &apos;s father opens a blind eye , you get the feeling that film @-@ makers are determined to take the baby from the bottom , because even the most pre@@ valent driver is unable to keep a te@@ ar in the suffering of the suffering of a minor cancer in the Arctic .
if the po@@ g of the po@@ g falls and his situation seems hope@@ less , the father will be able to understand once and for all its work a moral gesture and does a ch@@ arity to the ch@@ arity .
now , in a sense , I am convinced - when the film is self @-@ sufficient , I re@@ warding my mis@@ fortune following a film error when I am wrong , then it could at least be praised at least one surprise .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g of the ice , when a hus@@ band breaks the baby from a hospital and a man is rus@@ hing down the corridor by a slow motion .
it is , however , a great shame , and even though her father has lost his job , it is a positive thing , as it is now time to deal with the family .
I can also be well acqu@@ ain@@ ted - I can say the end of the American dra@@ ma .
in truth , the film is well constructed , all the elements necessary to do so are there .
it is possible to get a but@@ ton , the actors are good and mor@@ ality : money is not the most important thing in life .
it will be well established by surprise .
the new staff@@ ing of T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i is intended to limit the media consumption of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F@@ . Kelly will be able to do so .
in this case , it would be the first .
he wri@@ tes that the White House &apos;s new staff is intended to limit the flow of information coming to President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope that it will keep the black off@@ s down .
there is a pla@@ gue of the repor@@ ter of the repor@@ ter D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ LT :
&quot; when the new staff of the White House , John F@@ . John F@@ . Kelly , met his first working day with the senior officials , he pointed out a key problem for President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ ges , which he intends to resolve in order to bring about poor information in the President &apos;s hands .
Mr Kelly said to officials that the information must be carried out on whether paper or meetings , because the President would make better decisions if you were to share good information . &quot;
the diagnosis seems totally logical , but others have tried to do so , and they have failed to tolerate T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s winter by monitoring his media consumption .
the relationship between President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i with television goes decades behind decades and now , when he is in the White House , his television viewing habits have not gone away .
&apos;@@ I@@ f the candidate T@@ ru@@ mp was dis@@ honest about the media , he was able to show him that he was also echo@@ ed by his publication in the publications &apos; said to S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg in February Poli@@ ti@@ co@@ le .
he was told that &apos; six former campaig@@ ners say that T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter is the key to managing Twitter , to ensure that his personal media consumption is also stable . &quot;
well done .
but the idea that the use of T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter has ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaig@@ ners will know something that the rest of us do not know of being the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s spar@@ k without their interference even further .
we will probably never be able to know what the T@@ ru@@ mp did not postal .
if he was able to save the boat or save a couple of times , their efforts were worthy of it .
but no one has been able to prevent T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i from constantly producing po@@ lem@@ ics .
part of the problem is that , amongst themselves , those in the White House , which are competing with each other , are trying to promote their own interests without giving the T@@ ru@@ a the material that supports their world views , but may not always be credible .
for the whole story , Poli@@ tic@@ o wrote in May , advis@@ ers of advis@@ ers &apos; ten@@ se to information which is strategically questionable to the President .
one of the examples that describes the repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is :
&quot; the current and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i are saying that T@@ ru@@ mp can react to negative press releases , particularly to the adverse effects on inf@@ ants , explo@@ sive , by ob@@ ses@@ sive ways of identifying their source source .
this is the case at the end of February , when someone gave a copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the dog , Charles C. Joh@@ n@@ son , to Mr G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com , which bla@@ med the de@@ pu@@ ties of the Chief of Staff , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , that he was a source of a number of le@@ af@@ lets &apos; .
it does not matter that Joh@@ n@@ son has been blocked by Twitter or that he did not offer any specific evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and have withdrawn them .
read the article and began to call into question Wal@@ sh@@ i . &quot;
the Gold@@ ma@@ cher said that the Head of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in staff and the head of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , has tried to set up a system for the management and documentation of documents reaching the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in system . &quot;
how did it manage ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a key leader , but the T@@ ru@@ mp is still impul@@ sive and its hel@@ ple@@ its are still in the name of influence .
these changing factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans from abroad will not be able to obtain permission to speak .
there are many foreigners in the middle town of Tallinn living in the centre of Tallinn .
those with which the air fire fire has come to witness that he played old in the old town without the permission of the town Government .
the first was the close three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who had taken up the same number of bags .
it was clear to see that the r@@ asta@@ ts and the mus@@ cul@@ ans &apos; clo@@ thes were the emig@@ ran@@ ts who would be taken on one of the driving mar@@ ches .
in spite of a f@@ ool , the only woman in the room was playing a a@@ mus@@ h@@ man with a cru@@ mb@@ o , while one man , along with three bal@@ ls , joined him and brought them closer to it .
the third man was one of their co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il and smo@@ ked the ru@@ th@@ less pl@@ under of their gun@@ s .
their three homes did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the people of the past .
the A@@ cor@@ di@@ on has been played by the well @-@ known and mer@@ ged ges@@ tures in Bo@@ b that kis@@ sing the streets for both fu@@ n and money .
the aim of this clarification was to collect the ticket money on the same day of the night .
on the question of whether , for example , they had an old permit for the inaugu@@ ral struggle , sha@@ ke well and Bo@@ b his head .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stay in one town for more than a day or a few , and in most cases , permits will be granted for a period of time or something like that .
there is no point in paying for this , Mr Bo@@ b .
when we got around 20 minutes later into the Vir@@ u gates , we saw that two women are in mus@@ ici@@ ans and drive them away .
in this context , I will be happy to come to the b@@ os@@ s of a co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il and do@@ gs .
three Polish young men , one of whom is playing a fifth , the second k@@ lar@@ ne@@ ment and the third was even electronic ver@@ ges .
&quot; we are here to provide people with enter@@ tainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living , &quot; explained the tri@@ o of M@@ iv@@ os@@ h for fuel and living .
according to the M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there must be permission from the urban government to speak .
&quot; of course we do not have it , he said a jo@@ ke .
but we hope that if people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
of course , if the police are to be involved , we will go elsewhere , but try it , he added .
the Estonian bank purchased the euro area in the framework of a public asset shopping programme in the euro area , with a debt of EUR 149 million , the Central Bank bond portfolio increased to € 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish any more detailed information on purchases .
Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , President of the Bank of Estonia , has previously made it clear in answering all its members that the European system for the assets of the central banks of the Euro@@ system included three different purchasing programmes : bonds covered by the financial sector ( covered by your ) , asset bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public sector bonds ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage investors to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases is due to a low risk of asset production and it will motivate investors to take greater risks .
as a rule , in the framework of the public debt shopping programme , each Central Bank bu@@ ys its government bonds without buying bonds from other countries .
as the Estonian country has not issued its bonds , the Estonian bank is making a so @-@ called replacement rust within the scope allocated to them .
the current purchases are also made by central banks in those countries where the purchase of their purchasing power is limited .
the Estonian bank bu@@ ys H@@ ans@@ son is generally buying bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian bank purchases assets under the asset purchases programme from March 2015 .
in the meantime , Ele@@ ring bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian bank of June 2016 bought no more than Ele@@ ring bonds .
on behalf of the euro area central banks , both the Central Bank and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds are purchased by the Central Bank .
migrants ignore their degrees and return to the building blocks of millions of business .
some of the weal@@ thi@@ ans of the West Mid@@ lands have returned to fier@@ ce confron@@ tations with determined migration , who have ignored the auto@@ cracy of the Council in winning their way away from their cotton .
the migrants have been par@@ king into their 20 tra@@ i@@ ler . &quot; millions of businesses will be able to take refuge in the near vic@@ inity of the So@@ lih@@ an So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l .
they have returned to the hor@@ ses of the hor@@ ses , the children and the lorry , after they got out of it in May , without being dis@@ tracted by the dit@@ ch of the dit@@ ch of their invasion .
the activist Group found a weak position in the protected areas by turning their vehicles out of the un@@ th@@ war@@ ted part , which was left to wal@@ king .
the people of the M@@ aru@@ ry are passion for the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Council saying that the Council is &apos; useless to deal with the problem &apos; .
one anon@@ ymous person said : &apos; they moved there on Monday evening after they were ous@@ ted by Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ l , where they lo@@ ved the fur@@ ths .
the Council must be dis@@ credi@@ ted that they are taking action , because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were up and now they were back again .
they had to come to us yesterday evening , probably more so today . &quot;
he added : &quot; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long @-@ win@@ ds to protect their par@@ ks .
I live by Ro@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k , and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay a total tax if the Council does not even be able to stand in such a way .
one local resident who also wanted to be anon@@ ymous said : &apos; this is ridiculous : only we saw how the last of these emig@@ ran@@ ts were left , and there is already a new offensive .
this time the number has grown , and the grass@@ land is even in the ru@@ min@@ ants . &quot;
the representative of the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Council said : &apos; we are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the vic@@ inity of the Ro@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k route , and we are working together with the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l police ; we are taking the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
there is a great deal of help in gathering evidence if as many as possible local residents report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police , by b@@ reaching the numbers .
this will help bring a picture to the Court of Justice if we present them . &quot;
the We@@ ex@@ tage F@@ esti@@ val will also visit the Minister of Culture In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is delighted that Estonia has been able to bring top world names .
the question of why it is so important for children at the We@@ ek@@ ine festi@@ val , the Sa@@ ar is saying that this should be asked of all those who enjoy the full enjo@@ y@@ ment of the three days &apos; festi@@ val .
what he says is that the real players in the area have come to the fore .
&quot; when you look at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia , it is that the absolute top names of this music gen@@ i@@ ry are brought home - it is often our qu@@ e@@ ue , he is talking about culture .
what are the festi@@ vals on the festi@@ val , however , who are most telling me ?
I consider myself to be relatively old , and for some elderly people it is certainly one of the most experienced Ar@@ min van B@@ uu@@ re@@ n , who stood up yesterday evening .
according to his record , all of us have , at some point in time , complicated &apos; , goes without saying &apos; .
it will , however , mention a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ ur , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ f@@ h@@ all .
of course , our own Estonian players : from NO@@ p P and they can be read in a whole series .
in fact , this well @-@ known concentration of names is very high &apos; , he says .

car manufacturers are being hit by criticism in mid @-@ October to 850 000 diesel vehicles .
the day before the Au@@ di announcement , B@@ M@@ W said that it would offer software more than 350 000 vehicles .
B@@ M@@ W &apos;s Chairman said that &apos; there is a more intelligent option than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including B@@ M@@ W &apos;s city of Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that it will reduce the emissions of diesel engines in Europe for three million people in Europe .
no company described these steps as a re@@ vo@@ id .
European car manufacturers have been promoting active use of diesel vehicles in Europe and in the United States to help comply with the regulations imposed on carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide em@@ itted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , the cost of exha@@ ust equipment em@@ itted by diesel vehicles is increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of calling the government of Angela Merkel to ignore the power of powerful car manufacturers and to ignore the signs referring to the problem .
companies are trying to avoid repeating the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen error who qui@@ et@@ ly sup@@ pressed the use of so @-@ called pe@@ dis@@ o@@ gic devices which enabled them to adapt emissions to the test of the car by the time of testing , but the numbers were withdrawn from normal driving conditions .
several Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen are charged in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic inquiry .
last month , a former president of the department for the development of the Au@@ di modu@@ le in Germany was arrested .
the former President , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
earlier this year , Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , in Germany , was drawn into a criminal investigation when the authorities accused the installation of the system in order to circum@@ vent Europe &apos;s emissions requirements by extending its investigation into an investigation that was previously focused on the United States .
the launch of the prize may be a big blow to Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , a disproportionate proportion of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen profits .
the Estonian schools are purchased for EUR 20 000 in the flags of the European Union .
the Ministry of Education is planning to buy the European Union flags to be bought by the Estonian schools by 1 September .
in total , 5,@@ 15@@ 8 cent of the 5@@ 70 educational institutions of the European Union will be met .
flags are intended for er@@ rone@@ ous in@@ door spaces , they must be carried out in the quality printing of printed electronic communications with the recognition of the portal &apos;s news portal .
the flag text is the text : &quot; the Estonian schools in Estonia to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags is EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , or a single flag will cost EUR 35 .
the murder of the journalist highlights the growing danger of the threat in Mexico
N@@ weeks of al@@ ph@@ e Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers are usually on Wednes@@ days to review plans for the most recent spread of the Blue State , which is so@@ wn by organised crime , corrupt officers and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars .
today , however , they are over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed by a personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change its rou@@ tine .
the two old houses are discussing , which seems safer : either to bring children into office , which was a target of a g@@ igan@@ tic attack in 2009 , or leave them home .
the security experts have written a few words to the head of the room : &apos; enemies , &quot; &quot; neutral , &quot; &quot; allies .
they call on repor@@ ters to provide their own evidence without any need for evidence is sufficient impres@@ sions and internal emo@@ tions .
in the absence of a government or car@@ tels , drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists are being suspected of a whole list of bad people who are hazardous in the elimination of the chaos in Mexico .
there is no b@@ reat@@ h of violence , and the more the body amas@@ ses over the country , the majority of these are journalists , according to the protection Committee for journalists , since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to have been in office in December 2012 , at least 25 ; 5@@ 89 journalists have been subjected to death and threats under national protection , and during this year , seven journalists in seven states have been killed so far .
the most recent victims include the edit@@ or of their edit@@ or , Mr Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce co @-@ foun@@ der Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ a .
&quot; the biggest error is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &apos; wrote Val@@ dez one of its many books on drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , although his presence can be felt everywhere on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building , a large picture of the average fin@@ gers of Val@@ de@@ z@@ ist , together with his &apos; justice &apos; and two 30@@ n@@ ant repor@@ ters , the A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , a T @-@ s@@ är@@ ke , which has been de@@ pic@@ ted by his s@@ mil@@ l@@ able specta@@ ted s@@ cor@@ n and his pe@@ cu@@ ent contribu@@ tory cy@@ bar@@ bar@@ er .
the meeting will take place less than two months after he died , and the Re@@ por@@ ters are discussing a common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , dre@@ aming , paran@@ o@@ ia .
even though a separate Public prosecution was set up in 2010 to address journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been brought to justice by journalists .
like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders , the number of which goes to thousands , is also rarely brought to justice by journalists .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edit@@ orial will continue to reflect on the violence in S@@ al@@ o@@ a , although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and fairness of the murde@@ rers , there will be no benefit from security meetings , according to the I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very nice to be wasting his time here , &apos; he says .
&quot; as long as the cause is not known , dis@@ trust everyone . &apos;
in Val@@ dez , in the capital of the capital of the capital of the State of the State of State , Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ is , on 15 May .
he managed to drive only a few quarters before two men , red by the red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ rol@@ la , who was forced to leave the car and shoo@@ ked 12 times , presu@@ ma@@ bly by the &apos; twelve . &quot;
a armed man went to Val@@ de@@ z car and made an immediate accident .
it was 50 years old .
she left a woman and two adults .
the rum@@ ours are circu@@ lating freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ is .
however , on the subject of Mr Val@@ de@@ z , there is basically only silence .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition of the United States in January , there has been one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country , since ri@@ val@@ ries are fighting for a vacuum of power .
it does not matter that on a daily basis , every day a person or several people are left behind or that the dead are dra@@ gged down by two @-@ made drug ro@@ pes , which are bigger than the homes of many .
let us forget for a moment that the time for peace implies the only car@@ tel on the sea route with valuable ports and drugs to the United States is only one car@@ tel .
despite all this and to the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the risks involved in his work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce co @-@ foun@@ der and President Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) of Mr Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , that he was unable to protect his friend .
he believes that two mistakes favoured the killing .
the first of these was an interview with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s son , a car@@ tels , a car@@ tel car@@ tels , D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z@@ iga , was published in February .
this piece of mail could in@@ sin@@ u@@ ate the suspect suspects buying all the cop@@ ies immediately when they were reached in the newspaper .
the second mistake was that Mr Val@@ de@@ z was not forced to leave his country on his own security after the sweep of the sweep in one of the other languages .
Val@@ dez was leg@@ alised both in Mexico and abroad , and his death is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had remained so long that his friends and colleagues had assumed that he was permanently available .
he worked in a newspaper in 2003 as a ve@@ ter@@ es@@ repor@@ ter when he joined five colleagues to set up Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , sold 50 @-@ dollar .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said you were impossible to deal with the &apos; You impossible &apos; , without tou@@ ching the drug problem . &quot;
a moment of time spent its b@@ older and honest reports and sales and advertising grew .
in the Re@@ por@@ ters &apos; demonstrations , without any fear of fear and reading in the rea@@ m@@ our , which they read to read stories that no one else da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the journalist won his prize for the pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ o@@ x .
in the same year , the Committee on the Protection of journalists for journalists ( AK@@ K ) won its courage to follow the Mexic@@ an drug for whatever it takes .
he admitted openly that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said against the ICC .
last October , he told Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV in an interview that drug trafficking was a life @-@ free way of life .
&quot; you have to take up the task that journalists will have a second chance to play .
I do not want to ask me that what I did so much when faced with so many deaths , or why I did not say what is going on . &apos;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ ctions lon@@ ging on Val@@ de@@ z , a jo@@ ke who ro@@ p@@ pered like mad@@ ness , a friend who dis@@ soci@@ ated the embry@@ os and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they supported her rou@@ tine .
he always conve@@ yed his bar@@ rel .
he went to the office in the office of El Ne@@ ab@@ o Ba@@ ar and he was always in the same table .
now they are asking whether his ru@@ in@@ ant love became fatal to her .
he has also put them in a position to doubt how to do our job best and keep alive .
&quot; they do not like the ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity of their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing pla@@ gues used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is even strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ sustaining in the best times .
tr@@ eng@@ th@@ ening their in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
when it comes to fra@@ gran@@ ce , you will stay away .
according to Mr And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ ali , the problem is that &apos; fra@@ gran@@ ce can be dece@@ ived ... and this is the case with J@@ avi@@ er@@ i .
he and others say that the al@@ o@@ as is no longer the old rules , just as they do not apply in the Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ sis , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z@@ is , Guer@@ re@@ ros or other states which are home to the smuggling routes , the weaknesses of weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in a room where Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers got together for security training , mobile phones were no longer able to allow mobile phones ; a few days prior to that , it was revealed that only the pa@@ ints used by the governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
for the house , two poli@@ ce@@ men over@@ shadow the bul@@ let of a 40 @-@ degree bul@@ let in front of the house .
the government has set up a more painful Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office , which is located in the four regular buildings of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an in the middle neighbour@@ hoo@@ ds .
some repor@@ ters thought semi @-@ jo@@ ke about whether these police officers are among the 50 per cent of police officers who have been dis@@ tr@@ usted by their govern@@ ors .
several months have passed since repor@@ ters have been travelling to mountain areas , where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gan@@ gs .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce this week &apos;s edition dealt with three main issues .
one of them was the assassination of the former po@@ x@@ o leg@@ ar Ju@@ li@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez .
in addition , they had a reve@@ aling story of the spending of government money on the town of the Governor &apos;s office .
one of the most expensive groups of restaur@@ ants from the c@@ abinet of the Prosecutor &apos;s office from one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants from the restaur@@ ant .
there was no formal announcement of who was rob@@ bed or how it happened , so it was necessary to be cautious when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows of the restaur@@ ant , both as regards drug traffickers and the authorities .
the Re@@ por@@ ter was informed from the public that a sta@@ r has been registered to a politician who belongs to a ruling party of the ruling Institu@@ tional Institu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all policy levels over the last century .
in recent times , several IR@@ Ps have been accused of widespread coverage of corruption in the framework of court cases .
on the Vil@@ lar@@ line , a repor@@ ter asked a repor@@ ter to sign previous incidents in the same place , including the way in which the slogan of the de@@ sig@@ ner , El z@@ man , sh@@ ou@@ ting the slogan &apos; El man &apos; .
only a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have sought a copy of Val@@ de@@ z to obtain information on kid@@ napp@@ ings from the best sources .
earlier we would have known what happened , &apos; said the 46 @-@ year @-@ old village of Vil@@ sen , who had been de@@ pic@@ ted to him by the &apos; El Fla@@ co &apos; .
&quot; now all communication channels have broken up with our sources . &quot;
the Val@@ de@@ z office has been able to keep their homes and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the effect of active staff has become something they never expected to expect in the name of the pres@@ ti@@ gious campaig@@ ner .
Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez seized a couple of bridges and directions to the local Prosecutor &apos;s office next morning for another journalist .
in the west of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an in the west of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an , three days after the killing of Val@@ de@@ z .
it has been found as a body of death and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists have changed all over the country , and are cri@@ pp@@ ling the words &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; as a form of organised protest .
on this day , the President of Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez will be in Washington by trying to collect international support for the restoration of justice in Val@@ de@@ z .
the day after the death of Mr Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s death in front @-@ of @-@ court cases , it accused the Ra@@ mi@@ rez authorities for journalists and their killing because of the truth .
after that , he asked him to shift government action away from elsewhere , worried that anger has influenced the objec@@ tivity .
the Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists are in favour of organised crime , co @-@ guilty national officials and indifferent societies .
in his latest book &apos; drugs &apos; , he wrote that repor@@ ters not only kill drugs , but it is also done by the orders of politicians and security forces who are involved in criminal activities .
the media monitoring group Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 gave more than half of journalists &apos; assa@@ ul@@ ts on police and civil servants .
&apos;@@ You in Mexico , because you want to keep quiet , &apos; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
there is obviously a bloody record of the effects of the murders .
nobody will forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ ger Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ sis six years ago .
he was found in a body with a letter that had probably been signed by a car@@ tel in Z@@ e@@ ta : &apos; I am here for my reports about the reports &apos; .
in addition to his land@@ less head , computer ju@@ m@@ our and head@@ phones .
some of the publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the northern fronti@@ er of El Nor@@ te in the northern crossing of Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ as , after their cor@@ respondents in the B@@ oper@@ h B@@ use@@ h in March .
others will continue to do so , as did the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do after the killing of their President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z nar@@ co@@ tel@@ le openly presented the front &apos; Mi@@ da you want ? &apos;
some journalists have fled from their homes or even from the country .
this is a ner@@ ve decision .
it is difficult to find a job in the E@@ aks , and they still have to keep on the streets in order to prevent the risks .
sometimes they are being hun@@ ted , as is perhaps the case with Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered together with four women &apos;s people in 2015 , three months after Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
those who remain stag@@ na@@ ting and continuing to work must take the lead every day around the risky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a po@@ et , recognises that it is frigh@@ tening the drug business .
&quot; Mexico is on the way to hell , and that is why I said &apos; he said .
one of the recent Friday mid@@ night , when the most recent number had already been s@@ ounding , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edit@@ orial office and s@@ ounded a be@@ er when everyone suddenly started to lo@@ cate their telep@@ hon@@ y .
in the town of R@@ anna@@ ver@@ se in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ i , 19 people were killed by ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces .
the war continued , as promised by several of the missing messages of the car@@ tels found in the region .
on the same lines , repor@@ ters using Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce websites using a mobile phone .
in the next day of the day , change was needed .
the scen@@ es overlooked another fire in the region .
Mr Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was elected by poli@@ ce@@ men to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not show it at least .
in the massive portfolio of the post @-@ foun@@ der , which has his average fin@@ gers to see the whole of the blue , ed@@ yed Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers in his foot@@ steps .
&quot; how can one think at all , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; when , on the same day that Javier killed , asked the tra@@ ine@@ e to report on his report ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur@@ us used protection col@@ ours to avoid enemies of enemies
at first sight , it seems like a form , albeit quite frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now unve@@ iled the first inven@@ tions with regard to the un@@ beli@@ evable size of the un@@ beli@@ evable size of the Canadian mine , which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as &apos; the entry of the &apos; din@@ osa@@ ur@@ lian Mon@@ a &apos; .
it has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the sk@@ in covered by his m@@ ight@@ m@@ are was the colour of red Brown and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the repor@@ ter report on the basis of the reports published by the Bi@@ ology , described as &quot; the most well preserved gender @-@ based din@@ osa@@ ur that has ever been found &apos; and when one of the best din@@ osa@@ ur@@ ists in the world . &quot;
in the case of F@@ fossil , this is a new no@@ d@@ do@@ p that lived in the middle of the no@@ i@@ qu@@ é , the 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
it is incredibly good to keep the tra@@ kers who describe it as &apos; really significant &apos; .
it is a vege@@ tarian feed covered by these me@@ als , according to the National Ge@@ o@@ cial data , the most well preserved fos@@ sil@@ s of this type , which has ever been found .
on 21 March 2011 , Mr Ke@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he mined a Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine in a factory near Mur@@ ray near the Northern Alber@@ ta in Canada .
he has struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to examine it .
on the site , Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell was sent a muse@@ um of H@@ yr@@ rell .
for the next six years , it was designed to extra@@ ct an animal from 2 to 100 ( 1 100 @-@ km ) .
after all this hard work , the final result is now finally ready to bring the public ahead .
&quot; if some eyes are tor@@ n , he may believe that he s@@ le@@ ep , &apos; said the leading author Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , a research@@ er , Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell , in a muse@@ um where you are being lost .
&quot; this will go down in history as one of the most beautiful and the most absor@@ ptive din@@ osa@@ ur@@ is@@ sis , a din@@ osa@@ ur Mon@@ a . &quot;
he also found out in a brief@@ ing that it was realised that it was realised by a bee@@ kee@@ per who is covered by so@@ m@@ ours and re@@ minis@@ cent tanks , potentially causing a significant risk to meat @-@ intensive din@@ osa@@ urs .
this abundan@@ t partic@@ ul@@ ance used red red and white col@@ ours to hide up for pre@@ da@@ tors , and applied sha@@ dow@@ ry techniques , which are referred to as &apos; over@@ shadow &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
this allowed experts , according to experts , to be better able to escape the environment and prevent enemies , as the major din@@ osa@@ urs were likely to hun@@ t to him .
it was the first time that a family belonging to a well @-@ owned family of 110 million a year ago reached news in the news in May and is now visiting Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell in a col@@ o@@ gy muse@@ um .
the information has now been investigated by the science and gave it a mark@@ er of a Mar@@ x@@ ist M@@ use@@ um in the M@@ use@@ en M@@ use@@ um , who belon@@ ged to a team which spent more than 7@@ 000 hours to reveal the pain@@ ting of the pain@@ ting .
thanks to the aston@@ ishing good of the father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists was able to docu@@ mentary the shape and size of gender .
they found a dis@@ ap@@ prehen@@ sion - a common method of protection in animal species , which means that the presence of being on the side was a dark dam than the bottom .
although the over@@ shadow is widespread , inven@@ tions come as a surprise , as Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta is much greater than those of today &apos;s over@@ shadow animals .
it suggests that the din@@ osa@@ ur hun@@ ts were actively used by other meat @-@ owners that the ev@@ olu@@ tion favoured the abandonment of the survi@@ v@@ ors instead of the reverse .
but most of the animals used for today &apos;s over@@ sha@@ do@@ te - such as fears , b@@ ric@@ ks or co@@ da@@ il@@ s - are much smaller as an island , and the more vulnerable , which suggests that re@@ do@@ se had to really make a real effort to survive .
&quot; the vigorous hun@@ t of a vast , abundan@@ t , abundan@@ t star@@ k of a huge and abundan@@ t size , shows the danger of being rob@@ bed by dangerous s@@ wa@@ thes of the age &apos; said Brown &apos; .
the chemical analysis of fine organic comp@@ ounds also revealed that the din@@ osa@@ ur s@@ now was a red t@@ all .
scientists will continue to research in order to get hot@@ lines about this life , including the content of this sal@@ in@@ thetic st@@ ine , in order to find out what the animal would call its last age .
they believe that the din@@ osa@@ ur fell into the river , thereby power@@ less into the sea , where he sun@@ k into the ocean in front of it .
at the time , the same soya was as warm as it is today in the south of the South and the rivers and oceans are likely to go much further than they are today .
&quot; this no@@ d@@ dy is truly remarkable , as he has covered a fully covered gender @-@ based sk@@ in , while it has remained three @-@ dimensional , while preserving the original form , &apos; Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal is now seen almost the same as in the age of dis@@ agreements .
in order to recon@@ stru@@ ct it , there is not a great deal of imagination to use - it is enough simply to pre@@ ach eye and that it seems to be s@@ lee@@ ping . &apos;
the crisis in the Cri@@ me@@ an was a time when vast two @-@ leg@@ ths of meat from meat are movements on the ground .
although the Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x lived millions years later than Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , this bean @-@ owned din@@ osa@@ ur could hun@@ t some of his hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous predecess@@ ors .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ th@@ ur@@ us , 38 leg@@ s ( 1@@ 1.5 metres ) and six tonnes of weight .
scientists whose recent findings have been published in Bi@@ ia Bi@@ ology believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta dro@@ w@@ ned after death in the sea , and this mu@@ mi@@ fication is mu@@ ted .
in the prec@@ urs@@ ors of 21 March 2011 in Sha@@ wn , if he extra@@ cted a Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine in the steel of Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the Northern Alber@@ ta in Canada .
according to the muse@@ um , it is best preserved in the world , including lea@@ ther and so@@ m@@ bean , and it is a complete concentration to a stand@@ still .
these were on average 18 leg@@ s ( five metres ) long and twelve p@@ ounds up to GBP 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .
two 20 pieces of customs were celebrated on this subject .
scientists believe that this soya is covered by vege@@ tation and s@@ now through the current Western Canada , as long as the river is floo@@ ded into its open sea .
however , the place of the din@@ osa@@ ur in the sea has helped to maintain its so@@ m@@ ours in detail in detail .
the rem@@ nan@@ ts of this particular father have been so well preserved that the my@@ ste@@ rious s@@ wa@@ thes of my@@ ste@@ rious s@@ ongs are still covered by lea@@ ts .
as Mr G@@ res@@ h@@ ko magaz@@ as National Ge@@ o@@ graph@@ er wrote , &apos; such continuity is as rare as a to@@ ken victory .
the more I look at it , the more incredible it seems .
the rem@@ nan@@ ts of sk@@ in sk@@ in are still covered by my@@ ste@@ rious machin@@ ations of noise .
it is better to put his foot in front of him , and five are rus@@ hed up@@ wards .
it is possible for me to count on the s@@ takes . &quot;
how did one activist find out the answer to the question &apos; who is today ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll got a full shock .
just a day after the travel of New York , this St@@ . Lou@@ is , through a temporary flight , through a ren@@ ted to@@ tality , a site on the phone .
he got on top of her former school of com@@ passion .
there was a letter : &apos; the police killed just 18 years of ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ence and he is still s@@ lee@@ ping on the street .
he was confused as to why nobody else had posted this information , which is why he closed a Facebook and opened Twitter .
the P@@ ide@@ mega @ The@@ e@@ P@@ evi@@ ah user postal was repeatedly shared on his line .
in real time , Michael Bro@@ w@@ n , a region of St@@ . Lou@@ is , was handed down to the death of a young , 18 @-@ year @-@ old black @-@ year black young man , killed by a white police officer in Fer@@ gus@@ on .
he com@@ pris@@ ed a picture of the body of Bro@@ w@@ n &apos;s life , which was found in the street , remaining four hours .
&quot; this is mad@@ ness , &apos; thoughts in the j@@ arg@@ on .
but death was not something new for his or her community .
he put his phone off , but he re @-@ visited the fla@@ x later this night , which reported on the gathering of people at Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
the photo@@ graph@@ s were photo@@ graph@@ ed by the police and the sh@@ ou@@ ting people and the man who claimed to be the father of Bro@@ w@@ n &apos;s father and kept the label &apos; Fer@@ gus@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &apos;
he watched a web@@ stream in which a poli@@ ce@@ man stood in front of the group of protest@@ ors .
in a second video in the video , a second police officer , says &apos; s@@ gun@@ s and sh@@ ell@@ ness &apos; : &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
the Fer@@ arm reminds us of how he thought of his mind : &apos; it is extraordinary . &apos;
&apos;@@ This is not the kind of hom@@ icide that we are used to and which we could describe as typical . &apos;
I have been alar@@ med at this moment .
I was outra@@ ged and said &apos; .
he boo@@ ked his flight flight and he went home the next day .
after 23 May , he went to her father for her six @-@ year da@@ u@@ ghter and decided that they would be travelling to the Fer@@ gus@@ on in the next morning .
what took place with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ er in the next three years , is the central theme of the new docu@@ mentary &apos; W@@ ho@@ se strike &apos; ( &apos; whose street ? &apos; ) , which comes on top of the cinema on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who met the answers by demanding their answers .
when Mrs To@@ tal was with a da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a flow@@ ing stic@@ ker with a proper ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um , a Fer@@ gus@@ on , they were once again talking about what they had been talking about before this morning - the experience of black experience and living conditions .
&quot; do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; recalls it in a question .
&quot; we are currently driving Fer@@ gus@@ on because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old bo@@ y and is not the right thing to do .
&quot; I was not able to take him up , &apos; said Ferreira later .
&quot; what is happening now is the cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it must know that and see it and grow in the middle .
he must learn about the organisation and organisation of a activist and , at the same time , to know the different la@@ yers of experience and living conditions of black senti@@ les and what we need to do to free ourselves and to free themselves .
even if I manage to grow him in such a way that he does not co@@ arise personally with blatant racism , he will not be taken from another black girl from a black girl .
I feel I would be doing him a dis@@ service if I defended him on this world . &quot;
the first suspension that they made on the strength of Fer@@ gus@@ on was the South Osse@@ is@@ san@@ ti , a police station that had become a kind of la@@ isse@@ z @-@ fa@@ ire , where activists were awaiting news of the police officer , Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not finally charged with the blame .
there was a link between Ferreira and her da@@ u@@ ghter with the local business owners who prepared the lunch .
they put the food ba@@ g together and helped to distribute them to the protest@@ ors .
for the Fer@@ rel@@ l , a new type of activist is slowly taking shape .
&quot; my activist became fully changed after 9 August , &apos; he said , pointing out that when he had been Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ is University , he was the President of the European Union for low achi@@ ever@@ s and focused on social justice and health inequalities in minority communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organising it .
this is all just a la@@ isse@@ z . &apos;
N@@ weeks later met with a statement by the co @-@ Mayor of a co @-@ film , a co @-@ director of a co @-@ film , Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ h .
Mr Fo@@ lay said that he and the film operator , Mr Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , wanted simply to document what is going on .
the question of the name of the Fer@@ rel@@ l : &apos; do you try to document or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often painful - come to the community and try to reap the benefits of this sample and resistance .
Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of the people who were born and increased in Fer@@ gus@@ on will not be heard and we wanted to do it differently . &apos;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an was already gri@@ ev@@ ing his hands with his co @-@ author D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ is , a region with an ar@@ tist , known as the prisoners sentenced to death row .
his involvement has made the project a cap@@ tured Fer@@ rell and a further six other local people who have been tra@@ cked by the film W@@ ho@@ se street , following the fire of Bro@@ w@@ n .
&quot; in this docu@@ mentary , nobody talks with us and with us , we are talking to us , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; for me , it was important to see how these people are portra@@ yed , as I am also portra@@ yed . &apos;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of the Fer@@ rell - to show that the movement is not a &apos; head of the re@@ de@@ mption , but a community col@@ lu@@ ding , &quot; as Mr Fo@@ ma said - becoming the most open player in the film .
as a result , &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; , &apos; surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of the life of Fer@@ rel@@ l , such as ru@@ th@@ less and mar@@ ried marriage .
&quot; I knew , as I would have said , &apos; You said , laugh@@ ing at the first time that he was prepared to see the city of the city .
&quot; but I realised that there must be a degree of vulnerability to the human trafficking of those who are engaged in this work and the black population .
moreover , the respect of the Fer@@ rel@@ li story and re@@ puts the role of the black female minority in the wider deployment of Mr Mat@@ ter .
two of the three initi@@ ators who thought black in the social media in 2012 following the killing of a teen@@ age teen@@ ag@@ er Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , are homo@@ sexual .
&quot; female homosexu@@ als in the lead role role in general have maintained the move , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll , &apos; and this is precisely because we need to constantly fight on many fronts .
the Roma women who are the victims of the Roma must bear the full burden . &quot;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an has agreed that &apos; movement does indeed keep alive women and many of them are black women on black grounds .
he states , however , that &apos; this is not a kind of kind of creation of equal opportunities &apos; - Fer@@ rel@@ l was not chosen as a central point of his identity .
&quot; he was a man to take the right energy , &apos; he said .
&quot; but this is no coincidence that he was directly at the front line , because the black female sexual female woman is much at stake when they live .
his energy can be perceived in the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news camer@@ as with Fer@@ gus@@ on has long disappeared , but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile .
the suspended sentence handed down for blocking the road for blocking the road for a further 2.5 years .
he describes the social policy atmosphere in a region which he calls home simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
nevertheless , he still considers it important man@@ tra which he has eating memory since the time he took to the Fer@@ gus@@ on street three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose apart from our chains . &quot;
7 list of how to overcome the po@@ et boys after We@@ ek@@ ore
some stu@@ b@@ born men will find a s@@ nap@@ shot , although they wo@@ ke up , as well as help .
or the &apos; avoided &apos; po@@ t &apos;s po@@ t , break the w@@ ool . &quot;
but it is only a s@@ ine qu@@ a non for urgent delays and health .
what can you do so that after today &apos;s and tomorrow &apos;s We@@ ex@@ my trend - or anything else - to feel better in the morning and get the bo@@ g in the most painful way possible ?
Jo@@ o waters .
it was under the name of the Al@@ ps , after a great deal of the morning ... or , if possible , even alcohol .
as a body loses a great deal of liquid in alcohol consumption , it must be restored in any way .
together with water , miner@@ als and fun@@ ces are good drinking water .
since there is often a lot of irri@@ tation as a result of a tight summer , it is particularly good if the soil is free of the soil , or it is easy .
to walk .
it would certainly not be paid to a po@@ t to the po@@ t , but it could be a fatal wrong decision .
but an easy walk helps remind the body once again of what it is like to be .
the ma@@ pping of T@@ el@@ g and s@@ lee@@ ping s@@ lee@@ ping is a more time @-@ consuming way of becoming more healthy .
it is with little sense that you are slowly and carefully treated .
if you are going to get over the top of yesterday &apos;s over@@ drink , it is certainly not worth trying to charge a large fat .
for example , a ref@@ res@@ h@@ ant in which the t@@ ree of disability is silent on the markets .
if the health of the South is already suffering , one could try to get the w@@ ed@@ ding , for example .
and a bit later , it is already unclear .
there was no time limit .
this di@@ re@@ ar is rele@@ asing the body from the w@@ ool .
as has been said , the water and the volume are friends .
my contribution to the pain@@ kil@@ lers .
if you take the pain@@ kil@@ ler at night to prevent the bo@@ ge@@ t , you have to take charge of not only alcohol but also par@@ king or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ ph@@ en@@ k .
so the ri@@ ches all the extra , and in future , the boys are worse off .
in addition , the anal@@ ge@@ si@@ cs of anal@@ ge@@ si@@ cs will not be in place for long .
if you take the pain@@ kil@@ ler in the morning , you will do it with empty hot air - it anno@@ ys your rub@@ b@@ ish of rub@@ b@@ ish .
or if the partner is not to be taken , you will be able to do it well .
it is around the same as wal@@ king , but when you walk , you cannot get a hea@@ p .
however , at times of too active speed and ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant po@@ t , the bo@@ as@@ t should be moderate .
make a jo@@ ke .
the f@@ ool of friends of friends , the easy to@@ be@@ o and s@@ era friendly , both for themselves and for the other ( suffering ) .
the jo@@ ke and the laugh@@ er may not confuse the po@@ ker , but they are certainly the result of a la@@ isse@@ z @-@ fa@@ ire .
for once , the po@@ h@@ me@@ ll goes anyway !
the Professor of the North@@ west of Gdańsk and the workers of the University of Ox@@ ford are being hun@@ ted behind as suspect .
according to the police , Professor of Professor at the University of North@@ west of North@@ west and the workers of Ox@@ ford , who have become the body of death of a le@@ th@@ al of death for death @-@ seekers .
according to the C@@ oo@@ k coun@@ sel of C@@ oo@@ k , an arrest warrant without any chance of arrest , was issued on Monday to arrest a 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ oo@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i arrested on the grounds of the first @-@ instance assassination due to their alleged involvement in the death of T@@ ren@@ ton H. James Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ lea@@ u .
according to documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u died after repeated p@@ its .
according to the warning , which was issued by the police community in Ch@@ ic@@ ago , a body of death was discovered on 27 July .
the police received a phone call and found the victim of the Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house and the victim of a victim whose body had several storm bodies .
according to officials , Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ lea@@ u was recognised to death and investi@@ g@@ ators will be treated as murder , while the police are actively seeking two suspi@@ ci@@ ons .
Ms La@@ y has been working since 2007 as a co @-@ professor of micro@@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at the University of 2007 .
Vice @-@ President of the University of University , Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , said in a statement sent by e @-@ publishing that he has been temporarily removed from the workplace and is forbid@@ den to enter the town of the University of Lap@@ land .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter to be investigated by the competent authorities , and the University of North@@ west M@@ ester@@ n is working with the investigations , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ arre@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant at the University of Ox@@ ford .
a statement from the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College , said in the e @-@ mail statement : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to help the US research authorities in every possible way .
in addition , the statement stated that War@@ ren@@ i colleagues are shocked and willing to extra@@ dite himself .
Mr An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , President of the province of Chi@@ ice , urges the authorities to give up to the authorities on suspicion .
&quot; the police has a flav@@ our where they are , but we are working increasingly intensively in defining the exact location , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
according to the G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , suspects are helped to seek the foundations of both local , regional and national authorities .
the G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police received a phone call from the Mayor of the Pla@@ za flat house , who had become just a ch@@ cry@@ p@@ ic al@@ lusion that there was something happening .
according to the police , this was a ma@@ gic specta@@ cle .
the G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m report is not clear whether the event itself was also held on 27 July .
he said that the security camer@@ as confirm the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ mil and the victim had a relationship , &apos; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the management of the Grand Pla@@ za sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police is currently working on the identification of the events and the background of the victim , including the possibility of family custody . &quot;
dual companies which help you to avoid the next new U@@ b@@ ine
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wished to measure the satisfaction of their e @-@ trade start @-@ ups , but the polls were fu@@ tile .
the answers were often vague , useless or , even worse , misleading .
and even though he promised to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some employees did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &apos; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is leading to the presence of the e @-@ Commerce company , the e @-@ Commerce company , which sel@@ ls the sales of 75 workers .
thus , it called on non @-@ relief .
a new type of human resources start @-@ ups that help businesses to find out what their employees feel .
by developing and licensing the software , which is determined to measure the involvement of employees , enables them to perform a &quot; voice polls &quot; to target specific cre@@ ws and demographic groups , to provide anon@@ y@@ mity for employees and a hot@@ line for complaints , and in some cases allow em@@ powering operators to by@@ pass the heads of the C level and turn directly to the Bureau .
&quot; there is now tools such as Stra@@ b and F@@ it@@ bit , designed to monitor health , but where is F@@ it@@ bit for your business ? &apos; asked Mr Bar@@ net@@ t , the co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O of the City of Kash@@ wood , whose software tool is used by companies to measure the involvement of employees .
according to Ms ret@@ ret@@ ti , he has been able to have a better overview of what the workers think and feel .
in addition to the ad hoc and targeted cre@@ ws , it provides a company &apos;s heat card which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and where drivers have the lowest level of support , allowing them to identify the causes .
companies have begun to realise that they have to keep up with their work culture so as not to become U@@ b@@ iting , which has been ri@@ oting in scandals since the former worker released a blo@@ g describing a har@@ as@@ sing a environment that punished those who da@@ red to speak .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , the desire to have an overview is an opportunity for business .
the global area of governance , regulation and conformity can be more than $ 15.@@ 7 billion in funding for the period from L@@ et 2020 , according to the financial transaction statistics website .
in Den@@ ver@@ is Col@@ or@@ ad@@ os , a start @-@ up firm to help businesses prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , this year saw an increase in the interest and activity of U@@ b@@ ric@@ ka@@ bly .
it has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
the U@@ ber registered itself recently as a customer .
as with the G@@ town , the inter@@ cep@@ tive companies are allowing for tailor @-@ made impul@@ ses , to collect confidential confidential answers and to look at the problem areas of insu@@ lation .
it also provides anon@@ ymous messages that allow employees to know their inappropriate behaviour .
and as far as the executive director is concerned , complaints go straight to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion is self @-@ regulatory authorities , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , foun@@ der and CE@@ O Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Mr Qu@@ in@@ lan said that if it is found that a company treats its workers badly or beha@@ vely , the company may face serious consequences , such as the withdrawal of workers and court cases , even when the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by , a restaur@@ ant of restaur@@ ants with more than 25 000 employees at 500 operating places used more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to provide a simple way of interaction with the headquarters .
if the worker wanted to report the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone phone phone number or a email address , to submit a formal complaint and to hope that it will be taken seriously .
this was a often da@@ un@@ ting and in@@ convenient process , Ru@@ by used a general advis@@ er , James Vit@@ ran@@ o , who said that there was no good way to monitor the complaints of workers .
however , now that a company uses a cen@@ sus , problems such as discrimination , harassment or dis@@ honest wage practices , which did not reach the lead in other cities or in state offices , to identify and deal with them .
&quot; it is possible for me to get closer to workers &apos; hol@@ h 3@@ 60 degrees , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who leads the Ru@@ by &apos;s group of risk management .
&quot; and we defend our shareholders from court disputes . &quot;
Mr Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies began ethical behaviour , values and workers &apos; involvement to take much more seriously back in 2002 , after the audit@@ or of the audit@@ or of the audit@@ or &apos;s company , Mr Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen , in relation to the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media &apos; became c@@ oo@@ king , companies understood that they could not prevent their black was@@ hing from publicly disgu@@ ising the web .
&quot; before using the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used the hope , &apos; said .
both the G@@ lin@@ t and the affi@@ lia@@ ted services offer their software as a service by taking a perio@@ dic period for the use of their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors , who have been supported by both start @-@ ups .
in February , a sum of 10 million dollars was funded by companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and Customs , thereby increasing the value of capital collected at USD 47 million .
in G@@ lin@@ t , in November , USD 10 million were invested in B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ tures , increasing the total financing of the company to 60 million dollars .
such investments do not come as a surprise when taking into account the interdependence of businesses , culture and venture capital .
an increasing number of studies show that modern workers are expecting more jobs than they have done in the past .
in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are mere des@@ ks .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy , they are being listened to and that the work they are doing is grati@@ fying , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &apos; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , who is a universal beneficiary and a Vice @-@ President of the team , L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , Vice @-@ President of the team , who uses both the cen@@ sor and the G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors are making profits when their portfolio companies are doing well ; businesses are doing well when the workers are committed and involved .
if the third party analytical tool allows the commitment and involvement of the workers , we do not think that these will be supported .
the inclusion of data on the inclusion of employees is important , according to the professionals of work .
but these data have been useless if the success@@ ors of the company do nothing about them .
in fact , if a company asks its employees to hear feedback , expectations expect changes .
and if change does not happen quickly or at all , it can cause frustration and reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask the 4 000 proposals , you need to be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &apos; said International President R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who has seen how companies are making the mistake of relying too much on data collection .
&quot; because if things are not running until the end , the workers are wondering : &apos; did you really listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to the Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Mad@@ ison Re@@ e@@ el , which is now organising six studies among workers , it was possible to implement measures on the same day that the problem has been reported via the G@@ lin@@ ti .
and after the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , he was able to re@@ organise a number of teams in the company and to provide communication training to deal with the problems .
however , from a point of view , new data on workers will be collected and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will result in a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in the industry , which is well known for its large workforce .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose the people , &apos; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&quot; and if you lose the people , you will lose your customers .
and if you lose your customers , you will lose the companies . &quot;
the remaining sta@@ r sta@@ rs in the euro area are the Baltic : incomes grow rapidly
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade challenges with Russia have impac@@ ted to the Baltic , three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe , wri@@ tes B@@ animal berg with reference to the European Central Bank report .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 the total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania exceeded the expectations .
there is a low debt burden behind success , fast @-@ looking institutions and a business @-@ friendly policy .
&quot; the Baltic States in one of the countries of the euro area is among the few countries in the euro area where there is a significant convergence of its GDP per capita , the Central Bank reported .
although the aim is for the economy to become more equal to a richer Western Europe , in 2015 the total production of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2 / 3 15 of the national average , which belon@@ ged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement rounds .
low wages have led the Bal@@ ts to seek better wages abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic in a positive light , and the economy is also growing this year , local residents are not enthusiastic at all .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only one quarter of the inhabitants of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies are doing very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , some less than half of the countries surve@@ yed on their lands .
the N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel two times a day is changing the Bru@@ in@@ si Days long
it is almost 23 , when a team of F@@ C@@ L@@ A football club is stopped to talk to a team in a new habi@@ tual exercise in the University of Paris .
some of them have been burdened by their company , reve@@ aling their co@@ aches at the first day of the strike .
for a large part of the team , these gan@@ gs will provide a mid@@ day pa@@ tho@@ s .
the participants who take part in the course of the cu@@ cu@@ mbers will be going to learn to learn for the common living in the next morning , before returning next morning to 6.@@ 30 meetings in football .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &apos; said Bru@@ in@@ si strikes to Jim Mor@@ a a little before the Monday became a Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel two times a day to reduce the burden of players , they have actually changed their days - at least until the end of the final exa@@ min@@ ations on Friday .
for this reason , U@@ C@@ L@@ A was the first step @-@ up call at 7.@@ 15 to fit themselves into the already tight schedule of players .
the transition from two to a half a day means more than one trend - the beginning of the Bru@@ in@@ si training camp increased nearly a week ago and , for the first time in a period of Mor@@ a six W@@ es@@ tw@@ in season , there will be training at a time of summer .
they will have 18 tr@@ end@@ s up to 20 August , before the formal preparations for the launch of the &quot; opening @-@ up &quot; Games in T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M .
according to Mor@@ a , he is in favour of changing the N@@ CA@@ A rules , even though it adds another item to the players &apos; intensive schedule .
&quot; these have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge , &apos; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; and they break themselves from this challenge ; they are making an effort , they are wonderful young people .
I believe that when the day comes on the table and we have more time , it is really fu@@ n . &apos;
once the camp has been closed , U@@ C@@ L@@ A will shut down , which is no easy task , given the clear view of their out@@ stand@@ able par@@ king cir@@ cus and the f@@ all@@ out from the L@@ us@@ kin Centre , a higher @-@ class ho@@ le which has already got through the gates &apos; wave of protection from the gates .
since that weekend , the players playing a hotel in the hotel , but Mor@@ a admitted that problems could arise over time for free tobacco .
&quot; we use security measures , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; this is a real concern and it is not at all excessive to think that people can rent a do@@ zen and co@@ aches .
if you have a record of a record , it can do quite a good deal .
but we are using a security team in there and 8 par@@ king .
we will do our best by using the best .
I will try to be very concerned about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
a Central electoral union , born as Sa@@ sta@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , a party from the party , Mr Chris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ and , as a result of the ECB , to be forced to join the O@@ ther and the ECB , to be forced to show the Association of O@@ col@@ o@@ men from the ballot box in party politics , seems to be at least as much as political parties .
however , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key will be whether they are sufficiently disappointed by the voters .
who will stay with the Sa@@ b@@ erian ?
if it is reduced to a group of supporters of Ed@@ gar Sa@@ du@@ are , he may be anticip@@ ating the events organised by his election union .
one member of the country , some former and current central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and is there any reason why , in Tallinn , some of the fai@@ th@@ ful fai@@ ths and war@@ fare are being held away from the fact that the &apos; Sa@@ du@@ are list &apos; , led by the corruption and corruption factors , is becoming a reality ?
the celeb@@ ra@@ tor of the film @-@ c@@ at han@@ ging to the Russian po@@ em , in which the Mayor of the Child is taking part of the older part of the city ; and in every respect , the pri@@ di@@ mentary computer game , in which Prime Minister J@@ ü@@ ri Ra@@ tas will have to avoid f@@ om@@ it and orph@@ an , whether in this way the Central Party is trying , for the first time , to the votes on the electoral bo@@ xes - and the votes of the 17@@ 17 voters ?
we look forward to the understanding of political parties about the youth campaign .
if a black 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 view@@ er will watch a black new from the beginning of August , two options will be left : to accept that henceforth only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V , TV TV and the English @-@ language language from 24 to 24 .
there will probably also be those who publicly re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed publicly about advertising free television , but at the end of the day - albeit reluc@@ tantly - paying the price for television and advertise@@ ments .
the high @-@ profile music , the rub@@ ble people and the rub@@ b@@ ish rub@@ b@@ ish , are confronted with the un@@ pleasant side of the music festi@@ val .
however , if you do not want to be part of a me@@ ag@@ re , it is worth keeping home at home instead of pain@@ ting - and s@@ le@@ ep s@@ pan@@ g in the F@@ esti@@ val .
Washington turns the rules of the green card
media publications are cited by President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who said that a new US immigration plan will be planned , which will change the rules of the green card .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants for 50 000 people per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family orientation .
the new rules have been proposed by the Re@@ publi@@ can and the President supports them .
the draft regulation will be discussed in the two houses of the Congress .
&quot; this law reduces poverty , increases wages and sa@@ ves billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , as it is changing the way in which citizens from other countries are issuing green cards to citizens of the US .
the law reduces the migration of the chain and will replace the current programme .
the new application process gives priority to the candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economies , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp said , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp said .

J@@ ev@@ se@@ e@@ v A@@ na@@ had continues to be a gl@@ ori@@ ous tradition of the famous Ma@@ ana river .
he is working as a home of 140 kilometres from Ma@@ ana tribu@@ taries as the gold driver of the gold .
it is a harsh piece of work : two months without rest 12 hours of work and only ten days back home and back again .
in the three years commissioned , the A@@ na@@ tol@@ st has seen only one occasion .
&quot; there is a res@@ ounding order : there will be a thorough check that the lion would not lead , and it goes out that the cul@@ mination does not take the lead &apos; .
M@@ are Pi@@ ho , in H@@ ai@@ da village , a local tie to Ja@@ an , who has spoken to him many times about the memory of his family in Si@@ beria .
the still sh@@ ou@@ rite culture of Si@@ b@@ erian b@@ ric@@ ks will also affect home mus@@ h@@ rooms , because it is simply so fe@@ aring , considers the most detailed studies of Pi@@ ho M@@ are .
her first visit to Si@@ beria will take place this year for 30 years .
during that time he has been there 14 times and has lived there for one year .
how much did the Si@@ beria emig@@ rated at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here ?
that is the unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8@@ 000 .
I have calculated this on the basis of the rum@@ ours of Si@@ b@@ erian men who have also thought about it .
it is very difficult to say , because at that time one group could reach up to 30 people , but the passport was issued only to a man .
the passport was granted only one , but had children , sis@@ ters and lea@@ gues .
look at how much of this territory was here !
it was several times the historical S@@ et@@ oma@@ an .
that was what we need to educate , in some way .
S@@ et@@ os came here as pe@@ as@@ ants , but their life changed , because they got into areas that did not just relate to agriculture but also to river ( pal@@ king par@@ king ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New Pet@@ ser@@ h , many se@@ fed later to work in the town of K@@ ras@@ no@@ jar@@ sk @-@ 45 ( in the construction of Soviet power in the uranium enrichment plant - Mr P@@ . ) , when it was formed .
was it the majority of the population in the region at that time ?
yes , they lived in a Compact .
in addition , it retained a long tradition of marriage and a great child .
the seven @-@ eight children were common .
how much of a Si@@ b@@ erian culture was different and different from that of the mother land ?
they are different , although what was said was never the same thing there .
they brought a great deal of pa@@ ci@@ fication .
they also did their own ( &apos; popular ideas &apos; ) , but they always made a difference that had been brought about and what was done here .
climate change has a strong impact on the traditional ri@@ ce of the pig , because it is col@@ der .

&quot; it is very easy for you to come and go on , because the city is an excellent location : the hu@@ b of the hu@@ b and the crossing of roads &apos; , T@@ ap@@ k@@ fully comes from the father of Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m .

the river of the river can be st@@ reamed and easy to do the ro@@ man@@ tics - the flow of the river will be able to look into it and think about life .
I have been there myself , too , to walk .
O@@ oper@@ father Tam@@ m is not only the be@@ ac@@ on of the river with three bridges : &apos; this place is in the city , no one may come to gri@@ ps when their stories are &apos; .
&quot; there is a ma@@ gic view of the &apos; M@@ än@@ ni@@ ku@@ p &apos; , but there are also whole@@ sal@@ ers where you can drink , to ski@@ s , and today , for example , the gol@@ f gol@@ f - a gol@@ f course has been done , the he@@ re@@ ants can lend to sports &apos; , the Re@@ ig@@ ns Re@@ ig@@ o .

two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal de@@ ten@@ tions
the television channel quoted a foreign minister who reported that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ ts .
on 1 August , the police arrested the people who had been illegally ten@@ ted on the island of Si@@ th@@ onia on 1 August , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but the investigation is now under way .
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , TV channel TV b@@ TV said that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free ten@@ ts and are already imposing tough fines for all those who are stuck in a clean @-@ up area that is not intended for this .
the controls will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the court may impose the fine .

rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Life sent a draft law amending the law on the greening of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and on the amendment of the plant protection law .
the amendment of the law depri@@ ves the creation of a separate data base for both genetically modified ( GM ) crops and for hand@@ lers , which will continue to be used as a plant health register .
in addition , it amends the management of GM crops and the obligation to have a prior agreement with the designated radi@@ cal@@ ity for ap@@ ic@@ ulture .
although currently GM crops are not culti@@ vated in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
at least as long as it is not decision @-@ free to declare Estonian GM , &quot; said S@@ ig@@ mar ga@@ ig@@ mar , President of the Earth Department of Life .
&quot; however , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account both the costs and administrative burden incurred by the private and public sectors . &quot;
the draft law repe@@ als the provisions relating to the management and handling of GMO crops and cargo @-@ handling units in V@@ S , lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and on economic activity .
in specific terms , the cultivation of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to inform bee@@ keepers about the cultivation of GM crops on the basis of an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement on ap@@ ic@@ ulture cultivation before increasing cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to ministerial departments for coordination .
all interested parties have the opportunity to examine this in the draft information system and if they so wish to submit their opinion to the minis@@ tries of life .
the proposed changes affect , in particular , those operating in the area of crop farming , bee@@ keepers and agricultural agencies .
in the European Union , including Estonia , only one GM crop is authorised - maize mon 8@@ 10 .
so far , however , no Estonian farmer is interested in culti@@ vating GM crops .
this is due to the fact that in Estonia , there is no ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h , a European t@@ reas@@ ure industry , on which the maize line mon 8@@ 10 resistance .
it is also a hot@@ line for the southern regions and is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
in order to secure the pre @-@ e@@ min@@ ence , the State Department of residence will have commissioned various summer and 2016 investigations into possible GM organisms in Estonia in different su@@ pes , maize and so@@ seeds seeds .
the results of the analysis of sam@@ ples showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of seed , maize and soya seeds in Estonia did not include genetically modified organisms .
in turn , the latter may conclude that , in Estonia , GM crops are not being culti@@ vated and it was also confirmed that no random contamination has taken place either .

the white house of the White House cost taxpayers to pay thousands
according to the military documents dis@@ closed to the magaz@@ ine magaz@@ ine , the White House went to air a helicop@@ ter helicop@@ ter last month to the South Bank for the southern hor@@ ror .
the Green and white colour @-@ S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , ter@@ med as President par@@ k , in the presence of the President , was the central sing@@ er of the American construction programmes in Val@@ ges on 17 July .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence and White House senior officials were news of their circu@@ its of industrial products from all 50 states .
a helicop@@ ter built in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut , together with a reputation from a reputation , a man coming from W@@ is@@ con@@ sin@@ s and a Mis@@ se@@ si@@ pp@@ led plan@@ tation .
H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on , responsible for H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter and H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) , the White House called for a military office to call H@@ AR@@ G@@ O @-@ ga a little 36 hours before a helicop@@ ter of H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &apos; H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 com@@ and@@ ö@@ r said on a daily occasion before the event , the leading officer of the sea , the leading officer of the sea .
it was noted that helicop@@ ter will arrive at the southern hor@@ ror on 17 July at 7 o &apos;@@ clock at 7 o &apos;@@ clock and will remain there until the end of the night , while the same evening between 18 and 21 will be cleared .
it was added that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , the flight flight requires a second age flight because of the restrictions on working time .
the original team was in helicop@@ ters at the helicop@@ ter , and the security team of the es@@ ro@@ per , was close to the entire ground during the period of stay .
the documents given to the magaz@@ ine were not able to read out whether or not you eventually needed or not for the second age .
the H@@ at@@ ch Act bans the Federal workers to use the government for political purposes .
the documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 examined whether this initiative could violate this provision .
&apos;@@ T@@ en wonder whether this infring@@ es the H@@ at@@ ch law and we were told that he would not han@@ g , &apos; wrote com@@ man@@ ö@@ r .
&quot; you seem to have no choice , &apos; said the lead officer .
the White House declared the event &apos; For an official event and the H@@ at@@ ch Act would not have covered it .
however , even the official events are politically under@@ ton@@ ed .
during the event in the Senate , President supported health reform efforts and praised the government &apos;s regulations .
the use of the name of the name of the name or the air carrier , known as &apos; Air &apos; , for politically profitable purposes is no new phenomenon .
the Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use these purely photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic is extraordinary .
the T@@ ru@@ mp was brought to the attention in February when his first campaign event in Flor@@ an Mel@@ bour@@ ne , a President of the President , and he is s@@ ounding Twitter &apos;s account s@@ ounding a message on how his predecessor &apos;s president used the plane .
&quot; the White House is very pleased with the wording &apos; American made in America , where products were represented from all 50 states prepared by American American workers , &quot; said the White House on the commitment of the representative of the White House and L@@ ind@@ say Wales .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often operate in Washington and the southern hor@@ ror test to get used to the White House of the United States to the White House with no me@@ tic@@ ul@@ c prec@@ ision .
at the start of the T@@ ru@@ mp at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , 58 sam@@ ples of the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 white house were arrested .
according to the official official , the flight flight was thought to be included in the &apos; flight crew &apos; of the flight crew for a month .
the helicop@@ ter helicop@@ ters were flying on the day not only for 11 hours &quot; support missions with the President of 11 hours &apos; .
according to the White House , not one other is burdened by this event in the taxpayers &apos; pockets .
according to Mrs S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky &apos;s spokes@@ woman , the company was not involved in the organisation of helicop@@ ter in the South .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 does not retain the budgetary documents of the President and the precise costs of the event are hard to find out .
however , according to a brief@@ ing at the Ministry of Defence in 2017 , the V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D compensation rate is 24 380 dollars per hour .
in the Es@@ ka@@ r &apos;s document , the flight was extended to 30 minutes of the main base on the ground .
the White House states that the actual cost of helicop@@ ter use is well below this amount .
&quot; calculation of taxpayers &apos; costs based on estimated compensation rates is highly misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates include a combination of human resources , maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account in the case of annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 rand survey , the level of protection at the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation levels for staff costs , but they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the White House &apos;s former spokes@@ man , Se@@ an S@@ ob@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ter at the event .
&quot; the point is to show the things that have been made this week in America , &apos; said S@@ ik@@ er .
&quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are hundreds of thousands , if not thousands , of people who depend on it .
and I believe that , just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicop@@ ter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked relen@@ tle@@ ssly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether the T@@ ru@@ mp t@@ ree in the southern n@@ ight@@ m@@ are of a helicop@@ ter or not , but the fire @-@ fighting whe@@ el was willing .
in the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky addressed the representatives of the S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , on the release of media extra@@ cts and on the products of the company in his personal aircraft .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sk@@ y very well , &apos; said President , &apos; I have three products . &quot;

in the dark , Sh@@ ade@@ ik@@ o was only a bub@@ ble when , at the beginning of the Amsterdam of Amsterdam , you did not get a copy of the result .
I would just just like to put one proper multi @-@ annual contest together .

worse still : a month later , his Olympic contest in Ri@@ os died for the first hur@@ dle .
time had to be taken - could the seven contest be continued at all ?
is the two @-@ day effort still worth all this ?
there was a long time ago , but there was peace .
I need to think about this .
this experience has been relatively hard to describe , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
T@@ han@@ k@@ fully , it was time to be able to cure itself and think we need to think about it .
&quot; I knew that a photo@@ graph does not mind , &quot; says Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o of his self @-@ cle@@ ans@@ ing .
I got a clean le@@ af@@ let and a new le@@ g forward .
the T@@ re@@ en@@ er Anne hill said , &apos; The suffering of neg@@ ligence was very difficult to look at , but he has realised that , above all , the ath@@ le@@ tes themselves must come to their eyes .
after all , he had been bo@@ gged down by everyone .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; however , the G@@ rit said he would not give up and he wants to prove what it deserves to be &apos; , says Nag@@ or@@ no .
now there is some sort of peace .
he is doing so for himself .
the competition came back in May when the Sh@@ ade@@ ik@@ o e@@ rec@@ ted a new Estonian re@@ order on a new Estonian record .
at the high @-@ level competition , he corrected a personal top @-@ level bul@@ let of nearly 3 p.m. ( 13.@@ 89 ) and ran a record @-@ time barrier .
there was a feeling of competition , and that it is not at all a waste of ability , but it is just a star@@ vation race that has been ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
he has been put on record for years that Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o is a Muslim student .
he is ready to play a ath@@ le@@ te , he is a good train@@ er .
if something goes wrong or is wrong , he says so immediately .
he knows his body and dis@@ trust his sense .
that is what we must do .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we will follow it .
the new approach has also been found by Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
&quot; I am not the one who is doing the best thing in the tr@@ un@@ ch , he talks and says that the most important thing is to get the hour out , because it will also ensure a good result .

the Li@@ conver@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon per@@ d is a big wine fan that believes - wine can be trained better than any other world .
She@@ per@@ d is a scien@@ tist of Y@@ ale &apos;@@ i University .
his message is not about alcohol , or about how it affects our feelings and minds , but about a very active &apos; wine taste &apos; process .
by s@@ ounding the word , the wine was complicated , enjoying it in enjo@@ y@@ ment and after@@ perception , we are putting our brain to work in order to create a taste for wine .
according to the She@@ per@@ di , the human presu@@ mptions does not actually contain a taste , but a taste of the way in which wine stimu@@ lates .
he will set the benchmark as to how the brain &apos; sees the colour &apos; .
&quot; taste is not wine , a taste of taste for wine and &apos; , says the family .
the things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , our age , summer and even the quantity that man produces .
it is , of course , man@@ age@@ able that wine is not there to be full of a ha@@ ir .
&quot; there needs to be more &apos; , he says .

10 % of women in the Estonian ICT sector receive less pay than colleagues
the figures in the Per@@ son@@ ic search company reveal that 10 % of workers in the Estonian ICT sector receive less pay than colleagues .

59 IT and telecom companies participated in the ICT sector &apos;s pay study .
a total of 8 5@@ 77 posts were examined .
63 % of the posts were male .
&quot; although only 3 companies found that the pay gap is in favour of men and the difference in pay gap between the rest of men , the average salary gap for men is 10 % higher than those of men on average , and men earn an average of 8 % higher than those of men , &quot; said Fon@@ crates analy@@ st Il@@ mar Nordic .

China &apos;s role in politics , according to the United Nations
the head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can represent the people only when all members of society , including women , play their part .
Sir Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are standing for election in local councils , three women are standing as Vice @-@ President and over 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the importance of women in the importance of importance cannot be exagg@@ erated , &apos; he said in a statement on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have been threatening the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with a transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections represent the first time that power will be transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next .
according to the Ha@@ ys@@ om , the strong role of women in the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the independent electoral commission in Afghanistan , 3.@@ 6 million women have registered up to 3.@@ 6 million registered .
the joy of sharing makes every thing much more acute , both in the big and the small .
there is always too little time in the common time , but the th@@ read will be a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , clo@@ sen@@ ess and burden .

all this is the foundation of the feet and the foundation of a wh@@ im - who would then like to take the form of s@@ log@@ ans in the summer ?
it is wonderful to have children , instead of chic@@ ken !
first of all , it is secure and comfortable , which is growing slowly at the same pace as training and force .
it is also possible to do a great deal with large children .
the child strikes a balance , reads the cor@@ ps and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
the bigger children can do the same at the same time .
the scope of the move is to put the land missing and to call for it .
the fin@@ gers of the Ho@@ mis@@ try , the pal@@ let mini@@ ab@@ t , are to be kept well closed .
the child can read the repetition and feel as a train@@ er .
the planet is extremely well @-@ founded , but an une@@ le@@ cted ha@@ bit for the child .

in order to add to the burden of burdens , one can stay on the plan@@ k , a te@@ ar tur@@ t , and a wal@@ king circle in this position .
a further consideration could be made to the hip of a baby , but this exercise offers a fu@@ n for all children .
at the same time as the ta@@ b s@@ lee@@ ping , the tri@@ az@@ ery , the ash and the f@@ ab@@ ric@@ al burden such as conta@@ gious .

on children , there is a great deal of a@@ mus@@ ement with a th@@ ick and a pla@@ te .
work on the ground and the w@@ ool .

the fav@@ ou@@ rite and great fu@@ n of all children !
at the same time , a truly effective body of the entire body .

broken bags are also summer classes , which have become an end product in recent years , which , in one of the right summer @-@ tables , has to han@@ g at the hands of the hand at hand , and which has been able to open a price label to this modest origin , in spite of their modest origin .
the red ba@@ g is probably one of those things that have been alive in one order and has not been subject to particular emo@@ tions .
it is simply there , and if there is no , there is no overla@@ p .
now , however , the be@@ er are embar@@ king on a real victory and mo@@ ef@@ ics have changed their fine de@@ sig@@ ner bags against red bags .
this is not only a coast@@ copy , but today it is also just a popular street , and b@@ older women are standing in office even in office .
however , it is worth making it clear , however , whether an upper @-@ like summer is still sitting up , or it is worth pic@@ king up a little more than a little more than that of the official .
the wealth of the Va@@ g@@ ko@@ v@@ ous has become a real summer love of women .
for example , by reading foreign mo@@ il@@ stic@@ ks , the first thing is that the mo@@ th@@ o@@ gh@@ ted road to the first thing on the local market , and acquire some be@@ er on which you have a healthy holiday club and which is accompanied by be@@ ach , market and also cy@@ cling on the city .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are so b@@ righ@@ ter that they are buying off the market with a hea@@ vier hea@@ p and sell them to their loyal read@@ ers .
it is worth noting , however , that there is so much demand among read@@ ers , so that women ( and men ! ) in the real world , women ( and men ! ) probably had to be moved to each other to become a happy owner in some homes .
in some respects , this mad@@ ness is understandable , as it is those flat times that , when the fashi@@ oned is possible to buy a few s@@ nu@@ ff to buy just a few euros .
it is true that white traders have found a simple opportunity to earn money here , and both sell off the luxury of luxury bags for a few hundred years and years .
perhaps it is still the case that the richer customers should not feel as easy to feel pro@@ ph@@ ets of cheap do@@ gs .
for example , it is possible to buy D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ a from a thousand euros in the shoulders of the euro .
however , the interpretation of the Chan@@ ch@@ ko@@ ti is available to 6 000 in the euro .
however , unlike most of the mo@@ constru@@ ts , the bre@@ w@@ ers do not , however , come from some big mo@@ b , but origin@@ ated from their story .
indeed , the bre@@ pp@@ ers of the be@@ er are allegedly told far from the Philippines , where they have been we@@ aring them .
the red ho@@ le in the air is very often an export business and very often do not see them around .
it is said that the burning technique dates from 14 to 14 years , and it is quite hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous by means of a normal repetition .
however , as the be@@ er does not have to be so heavily red as a bas@@ ket , they can wea@@ k mus@@ ter mus@@ ter and other materials that make co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il more individu@@ alised and more ak@@ er .
for example , in recent times , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y bags where red pa@@ ro@@ ts or lea@@ ther s@@ kin@@ s have been red .
the copy can be sent first and foremost to send an audience to J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , the largest red be@@ er to the g@@ ko@@ p , were not available before .
that is how he conveni@@ ently f@@ itted into all possible forms of ap@@ pare@@ l , and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
the popul@@ arity of the tourists today does not play a smaller role , but also that caring for them is the head of the ro@@ b and , unlike any other summer , they do not have to take care of these special means , but it also explo@@ its water and bat@@ tles .
as is still the case with the &apos; trends &apos; , it is not only the br@@ anding of the classic stra@@ its of a whole range of interpretations .
for example , if they so choose , they can acquire a red shel@@ l or a tiny s@@ word of little .
it is worth remembering , however , that classi@@ cal be@@ er will never be going from a mo@@ b , an shoulder of be@@ er .
but , what is the classic bre@@ w@@ ba@@ g ?
for some centuries now , it has been classi@@ cal to be@@ at the be@@ er that is re@@ minis@@ cent of its style bas@@ ket , is open and will be short , as are be@@ er .

G@@ M@@ B is worried about investments following Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant
the trade union expects c@@ oo@@ kies and Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s leadership of long @-@ term production plans in the enterprise of G@@ las@@ go@@ w .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has been silent on the future of the investment on the subject .
in the class of H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich , mature internal and other products , works more than 500 people .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s owner , the owner of the company , said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million over the last few years .
the staff and trade union chairs &apos; are the first to hear &apos; when something changes in the activities of the plant .
in a letter sent to the manager of the company , G@@ M@@ B sent a request to Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s request for &quot; dis@@ connected concerns in order to ensure that the funding is not used to modernise the production lines &apos; .
D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y , the G@@ M@@ B senior body , said : &apos; the fact that we cannot have clarity from the head of the site about the business needs and the investment plan for the future , our Members are deeply concerned .
a number of generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely composed of the local community and the people of the G@@ las@@ go@@ w , as a vital pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region characterised by high unemployment and social exclusion .
so G@@ las@@ go@@ w is in favour of jobs , salary and well @-@ being , and in the context of Bre@@ x@@ iti , the rise in living costs and the chronic decline in production in the wake of the chronic loss of production . &quot;
the representative of the Pla@@ dis@@ e said : &apos; the head of the customs , G@@ M@@ B , was only able to write a letter from the G@@ M@@ B and the company responds to her directly , as we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between workers and G@@ M@@ B representatives , which discussed openly a number of problems .
we discussed then with workers that , like all other highly competitive and uncertain businesses , we are looking at our activities on the current - and this applies to all our businesses and facilities - to ensure their competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years we have invested more than GBP 5 million in customs in order to improve the production of production lines and operations .
we fully understand the legacy of the customs as a production site , and if any change is to be made in the activities of the site , workers and trade union representatives are the first to hear from it . &apos;
did the PS@@ G warned Barcelona three years ago for his approach to the country ?
la Ashton may regret this interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti
the Paris Saint Ger@@ main is not trying to attract Mr mar mar in his ranks , making it possible to buy an amount of GBP 18@@ 9 million , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago against this record con@@ quest for con@@ quest ?
this cur@@ sory approach has opened up as a transitional window , and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is prepared to break up more than twice buying over the current world record , which was e@@ rec@@ ted with Mr Po@@ g@@ ba &apos;s return for GBP 89 million .
once the transition has been completed , it will result in the most expensive player in the world and , at the same time , the highest paid professional player in the world , who will be able to pay more than GBP 500 000 a week from the PS@@ G .
the Barcelona is aware of this approach , both because of the approach of convergence and of the liber@@ ation of the Ney@@ r , although the head of Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ i &apos;s Bureau is a close source of evidence that the club has always borne the best care in the years after his arrival in 2013 .
but did the President of the PS@@ G warned the football world three years ago ?
when the City of Manch@@ ester showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blair Agreement in 2014 , Mr Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all clubs who think about the best player and the recruitment of some of the PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they deal with some of our players , we are going to stand up to them and contact their players , &apos; Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f &apos; .
&quot; we respect all club .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have been over@@ taken by this limit , as the Spanish club earlier showed an interest in the G @-@ Central play and Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they would not be able to leave the perpetra@@ tor under any circumstances and that the Barcelona may get a set@@ back as a result of this interest , losing the de@@ br@@ is in one of its expensive assets .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t , not borders .
Bre@@ x@@ it is seriously threatened by the ro@@ ck between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , warned of early visit to Northern Ireland in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it . &quot;
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the free movement of people and goods , &quot; said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders &apos; .
according to the Var@@ ad@@ kar@@ i , he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union , and because it cannot be done , it will remain part of the European single market .
this would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
the second way to make Britain more se@@ am@@ less would be the creation of a European Union @-@ UK Customs Union , the Prime Minister of Ireland .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , said Var@@ di@@ ka@@ r : &apos; surely we could have this kind of British &apos; .
the alternative to this would be a return to customs items , which would pro@@ claim historical divisions and political failure .
&quot; raise trade , prosperity and peace &apos; said the Irish Prime Minister .
he called Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t &apos;s &apos; challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that the result could affect every aspect of the daily life of Northern Ireland .

through my first qu@@ ery of the long tri@@ ck , Mrs Doyle : I@@ ron@@ man will be able to pass .
today , the largest tri@@ ck in the Baltic countries was held in the w@@ ounds of the most tri@@ ck in the Baltic , when nearly one thousand tri@@ cks were taken over to a long time in three countries .
a total of 7@@ 0.@@ 3 miles was composed of 1.9 km , 90 km of cy@@ cling and 2@@ 1.1 km of cy@@ cling .

&quot; I thought it would be difficult and , in the end , it was difficult to see , &apos; said Av@@ and fin@@ i@@ š@@ is .
in spite of the complexity of the truth , Mrs Doyle is that it is , in fact , a stand@@ still for everyone .
&quot; not the dis@@ course kills , it kills , &apos; he said that it will reach the finishing line at the end of the term .
with the exception of the O@@ ba@@ g : &apos; with a po@@ ck@@ y@@ ard , everything is fine , but unfortunately he cannot sw@@ allow . &apos;
