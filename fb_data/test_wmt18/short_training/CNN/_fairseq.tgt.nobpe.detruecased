Four members of the Kase rovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to a postal newspaper , in Spain , the so @-@ called Khorovo leader , Slava Gulevitch , who is known as Slava Kennrovski , who is known in the criminal world under Spinrovski .
The Gulevitych arrested in Spain was arrested on the Court &apos;s list .
Yesterday , the court also seized three suspicious arrests in Estonia .
According to suspicion , these are so @-@ called &apos; Khorovo &apos; members of the Community for the age of 27 to 57 years of age , committing mainly to drug crimes .
In the Spanish province of Metroprovince , the alleged leader of the criminal community was arrested .
In Estonia three men were detained as a suspect , one of which is a criminal figure for criminal data collected , and two are criminal members of the criminal community .
The data collected indicates that organised tasks and roles were clearly identified in the criminal community .
The objective of the actual Community action was to commit to drug crime and thus to generate criminal benefits , &quot; commented the head of the criminal proceedings , the head of the pre @-@ trial procedure , the Public Prosecutor .
&quot; We do not rule out that there is an increase in the number of suspects involved in this criminal offence . &quot;
These are people who have been involved in the interests of law enforcement authorities in the past , and some of them have been punished for drug offences .
Mrs underlined that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high on the whole duration of the investigation .
&quot; International cooperation has become the norm for us and the operation of this week shows the success of the cooperation , &quot; commented the Public Prosecutor .
The head of the criminal police department , Mr Leis , said that the detention was preceded by an ongoing investigation of nearly one and a half years .
&quot; A long time ago in the first half of this week , a great deal of success was realised and we observed the &apos; , said , in parallel with Estonia and Spain .
In Leis , the officers of the central criminal police were helpful in detention in Spain .
For years now we have a good contact and understanding between the Spanish police and the civilian Guard .
These arrests are yet another message to criminals that we can also get them from another European Swede , &quot; said Leis .
The information that has been collected so far is clear that , when there is a free stay , men can continue to carry out new crimes , which is why the prosecution and the court of the prosecution has also been approved by the court .
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his release to Estonia .
Under this criminal law , property , vehicles and cash cash have been seized in order to ensure confiscation .
The pre @-@ trial procedure in the criminal case is conducted through a central criminal police organised crime office and leads the Public prosecution Service .
The Municipality of Tallinn in Slava Gulevitch found guilty of blackmail in 2005 and punished him with five years &apos; imprisonment .
In the middle of last decade , Mr Gulevitch was considered the second metre of the world &apos;s most important place in the criminal world .
The Gulevitych from Cape Verde rose from the beginning of the 1990s when he started to engage in the tortures in Tallinn .
He has allegedly taxed taxi leaders and prostitutes in the various hotels and called for a monthly rock tax on business men .
International joint operations , confiscation of proceeds of criminal assets and court rulings confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
For example , the latest judgments , the so @-@ called criminal prosecution of the so @-@ called criminal community , confiscating EUR 80 000 in criminal assets , or a judgment against nine individuals in that the Igor Aleynikov established a criminal community in 2006 aimed at smuggling illegal cigarette smuggling and trafficking in crime in the East Viruland and South Estonia .
There are nearly EUR 71 500 in the form of a secret criminal income .
In these criminal matters , it has ensured that police officers exchange information with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and that the public Prosecutor will prove evidence and , if necessary , to carry out actions in any country of the European Union .
The Citizens &apos; Group warns the mission for travelling to the scene .
The organisation of the Adath of Advanred People of Colored People ( NAS ) has warned about a discriminatory policy and racist attacks against the State of the State of Overa .
The non @-@ script statement states : &apos; The State of the Missouri State , issued in the State of NASouri , which applies until 28 August 2017 , calls on all the American travellers , visitors and misfortune , to be particularly attentive and extremely careful in moving around the entire state , given the whole wave of suspicious racial events , which have taken place over recent times , as well as pointed out .
According to NAS , the group issued a warning to the &apos; travel warning &apos; , so recent Mistral law , which makes discrimination more difficult to win cases when it comes to the fact that the country &apos;s repeated targets for law enforcement are unequal in large respects .
&quot; Citizens &apos; rights are being infringed .
They are pulled because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said Rod Chapel newspaper Rod Chapel newspaper Ransas City Star .
&quot; We have never had so many complaints before . &quot;
This is the first such warning that the US has issued on the state of US state .
The group was referring to events such as racist offence in the school of black students at school University University and Tennesse &apos;s death of 28 @-@ year @-@ old black tanks in Sandersi .
The Sanders died on the basis of the beginning of this year , under which he had been subjected to war in the run @-@ up to the police and the Missouri police arrested , without being accused of a crime .
In addition , the comment refers to a report compiled recently by the Chief Prosecutor General , which shows that in the State of the State , the cars of black car drivers are being stopped by 75 % more than those of white guhalts .
&quot; The comment is intended to make people aware and warn their families , friends and commuans of what could happen in the Missouris &apos; said Chapel .
&quot; People must be prepared , so long as making money involved or informing the relatives that they are going through the state . &quot;
On the basis of the latest information on the FBI hate crime programme , a crime of 100 hate crime in 2015 , which places the state of the country &apos;s cross @-@ cutting number of similar offences .
The travel warning is also a response to the new law of the Mistral sourder , which makes it harder for a company to be taken to court for discrimination on grounds of nationality or employment .
The American Civil Liberties Committee ( the American Civil Liberties Association , ACLU ) had issued an earlier trip to the Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws obliging the local authorities to arrest people from immigration infringements , as ACTA LU claims that it will increase racial profiling .
As a rule , travel warnings are issued on other countries , but recently interest groups have begun to use this measure as a response to certain US laws and trends .
Hepatitis : What can everyone know about the various forms of this serious disease ?
Hepatitis , liver , can be caused by five different - A , B , C , D and E hepatitis virus .
All these viruses are provoked by the liver of the liver burning .
The worst cost is chronic B and hepatitis , which can develop into a lip @-@ up to the lip of the liver , the cost of the liver and the liver .
The rapporteur , Kuulgioviser Kuulo Kutsar , says that the acute hepatitis disease is the same for all the types of inwage , fever fatigue , fatigue , madness , okserot , fricet emissions , blem , meat , meat and leak pain and leather smasping .
The last sickness also comes from the liver @-@ burning name of the burning profession .
Children can get hepatitis with sick @-@ free diseases .
The different types of land incineration can only be determined on the basis of data from a laboratory study .
A extreme hepatitis can be switched into a chronic hepatitis and run for decades without sickless diseases , which means that a person may not know anything about a dangerous lip @-@ causing illness .
The Kuulo Kutsar sets out different forms of hepatitis and describes their depth .
A hepatitis virus is spread from a sick person and infect us in eating food or drinking water , sexement , infected human emissions and direct food , soil , objects , sugarances and drugs .
A hepatitis infection of hepatitis infection , in other words , family members and carers , people suffering from chronic diseases , people who are infected with infection , sex men , drug addicts , the high spread of the A hepatitis .
It is possible to pre @-@ empt the infection , in particular , the vaccination of a large number of people travelling by the travelling and A hepatitis .
In addition , it is important to comply with the daily hygiene requirements : To disinfecte or disinfect their hands before using food for all fruit and vegetables .
The viruses of hepatitis sufferers spread sick blood in contact with blood , injection of drugs , bull , honour , blood @-@ contaminated sharks ( tootha , means of pregnancy ) , the use of blood blood , a hepatier of hepatitis and hepatitis sick .
A group of hepatitis infected by hepatitis are drug users , infected man sex partners , male sex sex men , infected mother @-@ born babies , sick family members and carers , blood and other body medical , rescuers and policemen and hepatitis travellers .
It is possible to vaccinate people to prevent hepatitis ; in particular , it is recommended to vaccinate people from the risk group , as well as people suffering from chronic diseases , HIV infections , sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes .
The hepatitis is prevention measures : Refraining from non @-@ food and mantic devices , other theratic means and needles of needles , intensive and autism and the use of condoms , and the use of condoms in cases of dangerous sex or avoidance of sexual risk .
Vaccination against hepatitis is part of the National immunisation Plan in Estonia and free of charge for children .
C hepatitis sufferers spread sick blood in contact with blood , injection of drugs , spirition , honour , blood pollution , blood contamination , blood blood , hepatitis , hepatitis sex and hepatitis sick .
The group of &quot; hepatitis C &quot; is drug users , infected man sex partners , male sex sex men , infected mother @-@ born babies , sick family members and carers , blood and other medical liquids , health care , rescue staff and policemen , HIV infections and men and C hepatitis .
The hepatitis C prevention measure is : Refraining from non @-@ food and mantic devices , other therapeutic means and systalles , inaccurate and autism and the use of condoms in cases of dangerous sex .
There is no reference to hepatitis C .
The hepatitis is caused by a D hepatitis virus , which is much more than the presence of the hepatitis B .
As a result , D hepatitis B , combined with hepatitis B hepatitis B hepatitis Apatitis hospital .
The virus of hepatitis is contacted by exposure to blood and other body fluids , contaminated by needles , sexually and rarely infected .
The hepatitis hepatitis is chronic B hepatitis viruses and B hepatitis against non @-@ human beings .
An effective preventive action is a vaccination against hepatitis B vaccines , which also protects people against the infection of D hepatitis .
The viruses of hepatitis are disseminated by feemonal drinking water and food , including low @-@ heat beef , fish and seafaring , blood blood , joint used needles and infected animals .
Passengers may be infected by E @-@ hepatitis in the countries of high illness .
The prevention measures for hepatitis are the implementation of hygiene requirements : To disinfecte or disinfect the hands of the roof , prior to the preparation and eating of the food , after the care of the sick .
Fruit and vegetables will be deterred before consumption , avoiding the use of low @-@ cost beef , fish and seafood , drinking only safe drinking water and avoid consumption of drugs .
Although the last round of proodus competitors from the rug of the Olympic race , 34 @-@ year @-@ old Farah final force and won a total of 26.49.51 .
The Farah did not consider a long time , drawing the baby Tania and children with the fingers .
That was a particular moment for me .
I very much appreciate my family .
It was a wonderful &apos; , Farah journalists , who used to be with them .
The Farah is targeted at 5 000 and 10 000 metres of gold in the London fifth in London .
It is possible for everyone to have this belief .
In spite of the title , Ms Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connormgold , &apos; Daam gold ; Gustav Klimti masteose , Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer , a great deal in the history of the &apos; one art of art &apos; from the end of the 19th century and the Vienna century of the 20th century .
But even more so in history .
The lethal leaflet infection could have been cut off , a harder cut in snail surgery , in the title of the subject , it would have been possible to get more influence on this portfolio .
There would now be two books : Gustav Klimti and his painting , &apos; Daam gold las &apos; , would be a different story , and a much larger and more comprehensive history of history and the German occupation , with its aftermath in Austria .
The first third of the book is taking place in the middle of a wedding Viin culture and who himself got the capital of Austria , can imagine how more than one hundred years ago , over one hundred years ago , the coffee of the Ringstrasse , or how all the heads of the Central coffee all drops when the Klimour pulled .
The concentration of cultural figures in one of the richest parts of Europe was known in a rich city , and the familiar name of the name , which is known as &apos; magnificent cultural &apos; .
At the same time , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where there is an untherapiable arson in the capital , and it was the highest level of suicide in Europe , does not give development as if it does nothing .
Or , perhaps , every couple of couples , we add a colour to the cultural life of the 20th century .
Dream of the Soviet Union
In the last decade of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded in Vienna , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
The Sajandig debate had almost one in ten people in Vienna .
The elderly were also newcomers in Vienna , but by the time when Adele helplelus opened up two times to open the Czech sugar magnanaadi Ferdinand Blochland , and to the climate of his famous paintings , his father had already become the fourth largest bank in the Habsburg Empire Empire .
But Adelet &apos;s whole life , where he belonged , has not pulled .
If you look at the &apos; Daami gold &apos; , it is hard to believe that a life @-@ ending infection of this great person , a mega @-@ socialist and a dream of travel to the Soviet Union .
In 1933 , when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband &apos;s portfolio to order a climate of a snob , it was the last minute of six motherland in Vienna .
A contract was paid at 4 000 kronns , a quarter of a good seat on the rural house .
The fact that , for some of the portfolio , he was suspected of modelling , the sugar magnaat has not been intimidated .
As far as deletion is concerned , the only certainty is that the close relationship between the modell and the artist that has emerged during the course of their work .
Ms Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connor - &apos; Daam gold &apos; .
Gustav Klimti Chatharse , Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer portfolio , the Varrak 2016 , English translated Aldo Randland .
Shortly before the start of the work , the climate was to be visited by Ravennas San Vitale , and the researchers think that it was the brilliant mosad in the mosaina Theodorna made an artificial idea to make the golden Port as a pavious mosaic .
The climate was presented in his &quot; Daami gold &quot; in 1908 and around the same time ( 1907 @-@ 1908 ) was born in a golden land .
The historical history of the arts has not escaped the similarity of two women .
How are the Hitler @-@ related Hitler ?
&quot; I think that as a friend of my friend , I am obliged to be owed to him to make his work available to the public &apos; , Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer a couple of years after the departure of the artist ( in February 1918 ) , the Belvedere museum Director and the desire for their family of the family to go to the museum .
Six years before the death , the climate was completed at Adelest &apos;s portfolio .
In his wills ( Adele left in February 1925 ) , he asked her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt &apos;s Austrian Galerier .
In his article , he inherited her words to Mariana and Lutz .
One year later , when the Klimt had finished the &quot; Austrian Mona annex , &quot; it had attempted to escape the 17 @-@ year @-@ old Adolf @-@ Akademy .
Although sometimes Hitler &apos;s late anti @-@ Semitism is being held as a result of the fact that the Jewish professors did not accept him , no one was actually hair of his examinations .
In any case , the task of the Austrian Galtain , referred to in Maria Retestament , was noticeably important , as was the case in the case of the most recent Jewish collections of the art of Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal art of art , including some at home , have been working , but not a climate .
Sixty years after the Nazi art of art , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute broke out between the Austrian Government and Bloch @-@ Baukers .
Let me just mention here that , when &apos; Snolus &apos; sees Belvedere in Vienna , Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer , &apos; Daami gold &apos; , needs to be looked at in New York &apos;s Neue Galtle .
And the aforementioned book was read before the Vienna war .
Even when you were going to look at the work , you did not plan to go ahead , because at least my emotions were torn after the closure of the book more Nazi and Jewish than 135 million dollars were sold in Balloch @-@ ch .
So not so much as a portfolio , if rather a family of a family - and a very moving tale .
A significant facilitation of the progress of the events at the beginning of the paper will facilitate the sexuality of the Baudis .
17 @-@ year @-@ old swimming in Canada was very close to Estonia .
In housing , 200 m more seliting on their own lives was very close to 2.16.662 .
The winning mark dates from 17 @-@ year @-@ olds from one week &apos;s time when the Canadian jump champions gained 2.16.58 at the time , the Private Private Aavik Ujumisg .
Last but not least , a decade of A @-@ finality .
In the finhalh he distanced himself from 2.15 p.m. and achieved a good seventh site with a new powerful crowd .
In the case of Estonian rebate ( 2.15.13 ) , Estonian rebate ( 2.15.13 ) left a little over half a second .
For all the times in Estonia , the Scoreboard went up with the third , and its recent personal peak is the fifth result of all Estonian people .
A young hope for the future will be the start @-@ up of Canadian adults &apos; championships , 200 m and 400 mmours , and 200 m- and 400 kmours .
Last week in Toronto , Canadian God champions were taking place and the successful start @-@ up is also available there .
He won 200 m in wool silver in the silver al of 2.03.22 .
This distance was thus rapidly swamped by the leader in the last year in 2008 .
In Estonia this distance has been distanced only by the Estonian record Elina Parauthenticka in Estonia .
In Canada , a child in Canada still won a great deal of personal record in the demise of the backsania , and the new Estonian season with a peak of 56.66 .
For example , Alnek , the old Kertu Alnek , is just one hundredth of one hundredth .
In a personal top , he reached a further 100 m swimming in the opening of a notice of a letter of 1.03.69 .
Over a long distance , he only gained the seventh place when it took 2.17,31 in the finest .
In the meantime , Estonia is currently leading the ranking of the Estonian season from four different distances .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics of critical teeth
The holiday time has come - that is to say , a lax of the US President , Donald Trumpile .
However , since the Trump has still been one of the most deprived days , the critics are already hampered .
On the basis of the US and CNN reports , 17 @-@ day @-@ long leave in Bedminsterh in Bedminsteris , which is based in New Jersey .
Although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , the opponents of Trumpi have taken the floor for weeks .
They complain too much about the Trup .
Indeed , the President has taken the time for a short stay in his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey .
By the way , the Trump has not cleared his President for the most in the course of 196 .
For example , George W. Bush had already reached 67 days in this period , and Barack Obama left less than Trump , but 21 days .
But , on the other hand , the Trup is tending to sleep .
The few days later , Trump said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , that the long holidays will not be lost over a long period of time , because a great deal needs to be done .
He also expressed his indignation three years ago about Barack Obama &apos;s leave .
The current President wrote on Twitter : &apos; While Obama is on holiday , golf , applies on the brakes and on the jungle group , the journalists in the Treasury are sloging . &quot;
The white house officers &apos; reports do not have a 17 @-@ day golf &apos;s visit to a sort of lackery .
It is officially referred to as working holidays , during which the Trumpil has no time to read or become pro @-@ active .
In addition , there was another reason for the working holidays .
In particular , the White House will be replaced by a system of deception for the west of the White House , and therefore the entire staff had to leave it .
The West Bank also takes part in the Ovalkabint and other President &apos;s offices .
&quot; I do not believe that someone of you would like to be in the west in August , when 38 degrees are there and there is no condom &apos; , said the White House speech Lindsay Walters , who stressed that the President would continue to work during the holidays .
Where President Trump will follow 17 days &apos; water , you will know about the video .
Blocking critics from Facebook do not apply to the public office if you do not tolerate the voters &apos; criticism .
Our country &apos;s father knew about the unfavourable media coverage .
The Americans loved George Washington , but the newspapers did not last long to start to fool him for everything from internal policy to political principles .
The criticism , of course , has upset him .
But he did not make his critics silent .
Because , in 1783 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of speech can be taken away from us and that we may be able to take the lead in the dark and quiet . &quot;
This brings me to Mr Maryland &apos;s Governor , Mr Khaner , who is struggling to be more in Washington .
The Hogan has blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their official Facebook page .
And earlier this week , the United States of America ( the American Civil Service Association , ACLU ) , was therefore taken to court .
The hearing of the Governor of Siberia , who pulled the actions empty and web comment was sounding in response to the reactions of the reactions &apos; who is interested ? &apos;
&quot; This is only a Facebook , &apos; said many .
But that is what counts .
And this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Kgan .
This is astonishing in the vast majority of the popular republics in the democratic state .
His approval is the second highest in the 50 months of the country &apos;s 50 seats .
I do not think we are thinking of a reactive wind of thought .
He has been firm on the state stage and strictly ascertained to his principles .
In addition , he has used as a major tool to communicate with his constituents in a rather unskilled way , presenting , for example , the first time of chemistry for the first time in his kitchen head .
It is therefore the case that the Governor of the governor &apos;s Governor is a public forum with a public forum managed by taxpayers &apos; dollar staff to block the people who visit their visitors , is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
The spokesman of the press officer , Amelia , defended the conduct of the Governor of Washington in an interview with the Governor , arguing that the blocking of comments was nothing other than a reorientation .
It is too easy , however , to paint a picture of online chefles , junk mail or people with anger .
The post has been discussed with a number of quite people whose Hogan blocked .
And that is what they are the people who communicate with their chosen leaders , the owner , the owner of the company and the passport , not internet controls .
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not rocky .
Pastor quoted its postal office Biblical , with emphasis on the traffic of the Hogan .
Ms Lakshmi Sarwie , a lawyer from the Maryland Bowie , did not incite hatred but rather hate crimes .
&quot; I was politely advised that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &apos; he wrote The post @-@ mail news story in the country .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , when many people comment on the same subject , some of it is immediately insensitive to collective effort instead of recognising that it is a great deal of concern to citizens . &apos;
What the Governor of the governors called &apos; towards an attack on &apos; targeted junk &apos; , others would probably call &apos; public support &apos; .
The Facebook era allows the text to be easily accommodated , simply blocking a critical or deletion of negative comment .
It is much cleaner than the elderly when workers were to be sent out to do the same , so that they collect critical editorial editorial newspapers and burn them or arresting protestors and forcing them to keep silent .
But that is exactly what is happening today , just digital .
I am not the first national official who is being criticised for the toothlessness of Facebook and other social media .
President Trumpi has been taken to court by users who are blocked by Twitter .
One of the first woolly judgments on this subject was made last week in Virginia .
The US District judge , James C. Cacheris , ruled in Alexandria that the first revision of the Constitution by the board of Loudouni County , when he blocked a constituent on her television .
In Kentucky , ACLU visited the use of Facebook and Twitter as well as the Governor Matt Bevink ( R ) .
It should not be so difficult .
At the time of Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar effect than the Internet .
Between 1776 and 1 800 quadrupled newspapers and anonymous writers dammed her way of leadership .
And even then , Washington had to deal with anonymous trollery .
People wrote letters on the newspapers from pseudo @-@ tems such as Juricola , Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , making Washington judgments ground .
Under the draft collection project for the collection of the collection of the website of the website of George Washington , he buried his office under the petitions that criticised his views on the British friendship , trade and shipping agreements .
But he did not make them silent .
Freedom of expression , disagreements and debates are the very foundations of our country .
And proper management means accepting it .

In addition to this , it will be possible to depart in consumer timber reserves , with an estimated annual value estimated at USD 78 billion .
However , these riches are a source of pawn suffering , as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army .

Reserves have been tightened up more strongly , as natural reserves have caused the influx of new settlers from outside Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demography is changing because of the massive , Kalimantan , the Kalimantan , Sumatra and Sulawes are coming from the islands of the islands .
The family resonance is sold in the courtesy and mixed sdo gado gado @-@ gado @-@ gado , which is served together with ground level .
Local people are unable to compete with them .
&quot; Migrants started cheaper from the myths of the chicken and vegetables on the traditional market , &apos; explains the 24 @-@ year @-@ old report born in Paniais , who brought the capital to the capital of the province of the province of the province of the province of Prague .
&quot; Indigenous people on the pawn of the pawn will lose their market share due to their market share .
The President of Indonesia , Joko Widodo , who is well known as Jokow among their people , pledged to deal with their inequalities and human rights abuses in the Plena .
The former wook won her road on the front of Jakarta in the 29 constituencies of 29 , including the Paniai .
But there has been very little change in the purity and the local feeling deceived .
&quot; Our hearts have been broken because , in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jokow in waiting for our hopes of restoring justice &apos; says &apos; .
In fact , only two months after the arrival of Jokow in Jokow .
On 7 December 2014 , 11 children sounded a Christmas bell on 11 December 2014 , when the darkness of the blind motorway has two Indonesian soldiers .
The children of Kohl told them that they should switch the lights .
The fate of the local passport , Yavei Yavei , is an insult to one of the soldiers on their tone and then returned to four soldiers .
According to the victims and witnesses , soldiers in the drink are driving behind their children and caning them with their guns .
One soldier was shot in the ranks of the soldiers .
One child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yulianus Yeimot , beaten so cruel that he fell to the House .
A few hours later , a close @-@ to @-@ close electoral commission was installed in the Commission and the scenes of the next day .
Around 1 000 young men , women and children experienced football at the local police station and the military leadership centre in the cocktail .
They were wearing refurbsal hunts and fifiled the pawn clothes of a sloging tanker with a drink @-@ and @-@ sounding poultry song .
Some protestors began to lecture the police and the military militants .
In the case of a handful of anger , a soldier was sent to soldiers , &apos; when the crowd shows more than three times the resistance , shot them down , &apos; said under the official document , which has been seen by a magazine but not issued by local media reports .
The majority of the majority of the Roma city , Kego Koto , in the oldest Yeremias Kayame ( 56 ) and called for peace to be kept , asking for the public to go home .
No one had any intention to listen .
&quot; During the turn , I was suddenly shot into the left , &apos; he said to the magazine in his erred colours on the blood of the tree .
We still do not know who the guns were , but says that soldiers from the soldiers gathered in the month came out .
&quot; The people had a lot , a knock of a great deal , &apos; adds him .
A local man , Alfius Youw , got his wool on the eye three times .
&quot; I would like to stick to him and he looked at her body to make sure that it is with him , &apos; said at the time of the magazine , Mr Yohanes , who is using only one name in many indicators .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... Snolemy was he . &apos;
The chief police officer , Yotje Mwinsaid , said to reporters that his subservient guaranteed only the security of their sections , as this was attacked .
&quot; We need to defend ourselves if we are threatened with killing , &apos; said in 2015 by the High Representative of the police , Mr Pudjo Sulistiyo .
&quot; This is a question of life and death . &quot;
According to Human Rights Watch , five young protestors were killed and there were many injured .
The news of the killings reached the next day in Jakarw .
Three weeks later , Jokow Jayapuras considered a passionate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses that took place in Panna .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future . &quot;
In October 2016 , the Minister of Security , Wiranto , said in October 2016 that he will introduce an ADR mechanism to deal with human rights .
However , almost immediately , the excuses .
&quot; Most crimes happened a long time ago .
Some of them were taking place in the 1990s and in the early 2000s .
The point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; said .
Speaking at the time of the magazine on 5 June in Jakano , Wiranto summed his words , saying that he had no intention whatsoever to set up a mechanism for dealing with complaints .
Instead , he said that &apos; everything will be resolved by law &apos; .
Wiranto , who has been indicted by the United Nations in relation to human rights against more than 1 000 human deaths in East Timor in the bloody independence referendum of 1999 , said that 11 human rights crime has been resolved in Puga , including in the Pania .
The families of the victims of the Paniai victims adopted such statements with disgust .
&quot; I have been listening to four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , &apos; said Yohanes .
&quot; I am tired . &apos;
He says that he is still living in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid he says .
&quot; I am afraid that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I will be shot . &apos;
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view that the Paniai people are afraid of this incident .
He said that he was beaten by the army after he had helped buried four victims .
&quot; After the buried of the bodies of death , the army had to look to me , &apos; he says .
The killings have not stopped .
On Tuesday , the residents of the Indonesian police in the Paniai neighbouring in Deiyais , the village of Indonesia .
One person died and 17 injured , including children , when it came to a war between the village people and the head of the construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man .
This male , 24 @-@ year @-@ old Radanus Douw , who drowned fish in a nearby , died on the way to hospital .
The residents of the village were protesting against a company office in the construction site .
According to the police , the inhabitants of the villages were told by police officers , with the latter alerted to alerts .
But , according to the local forces , mobile Brigade ( the military escorted police ) began to shoot , killing one person .
&quot; We were in a big scaremongering , we were afraid of retaliation , &apos; said a magazine of 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dominglong Badii , who lives on a hospital and had been injured in infutasy .
&quot; I have been beaten by two days in my house . &apos;
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of police officers and the withdrawal of the police from the police from the region .
The Paniai is always a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
The lack of meaningful development is fuelled by the dissatisfaction of the man , moni , dani and dammal tribes .
Many of them have joined the Liberation movement ( VPL ) with the rebels &apos; army , which protects the rights of their boats , by carrying out random attacks and kidnappings of kidnappings .
Some VPL leaders come from Pania , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
In response , under the pretext of &apos; protecting the sovereignty of the country &apos; , the army has arrested the Paniais and arbitrarily detained by thousands of people .
Some of them will never appear again .
Among the people , there are known Paniies as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
Poverty is fuelled by discontent .
The low rice sold by the majority is too expensive for the local .
The same is unattainable .
People are increasing their own food themselves , mainly from the baseline , as well as some fruit and hardquitable vegetables .
It is a job for women who can care for four or five baths .
They usually keep the majority of the harvested families , the rest in the local market .
Only 10 000 Indonesians ( 75 cents ) pay a 10 @-@ year @-@ old site .
Over time , there has been a deepening of economic inequalities between floate boats and the new migrants , who have been brought to a large extent since the opening of new airlines at the Nabire airport .
These few jobs , which are available , will be better educated and more prosperous migrants .
The pumps themselves often do not have a competitive business to drive up a competitive business or acquire the necessary skills .
&quot; Young people are not interested in having a village , because there is no jobs or money here , &apos; says John Gbai , Chairman of the Council of Paniai .
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from its eyes .
In addition , there are tight restrictions on foreign media .
Later this year , French journalists were sent out of Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp , as &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they had been given a rare film authorisation .
According to Human Rights Watch , the President of the Asian department , Mr Kine , has not put into practice the electoral promises of Jokow to abolish transparency and development restrictions .
&quot; In Indonesia , some of the most eastern provinces of the East and of the West Paspua report are threatening new threats to the rejection of the visa and blacklisting of the black list , &apos; said in a statement .
A lack of journalism in the press means that the international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to the near neighbours .
In March , six of the Pacific countries of the Pacific , Tonga , Nauru , Belau , Tupain , Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands , and the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the &apos; various wide @-@ ranging crimes &apos; in Pabia , including the Panias .
The same countries have also supported historically VPL .
The accusations levelled by the foreign Secretary of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Arrmanatha Nasir , to put his accusations aside , by saying to Mr journalists : &apos; In Indonesia , there is still democratic order and freedom of the press , so that the evidence of human rights cases would be buried .
The local people want more foreign governments to take notice .
When a Dutch official delegation led the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , Kees Van Bapupura on 4 May , the local people interrupted the meeting , but &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
In Indonesia , new presidential elections will take place in 2019 , but boats do not believe that they will vote again for Jokow .
Joow is a well @-@ meaning man , but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of the Paniai , &apos; says the Chairman of the Council of tribes .
He wants to make it clear to Mr Jokow that , apart from being persecuted by the people of the Panias under the threat of constantly predatory military threats , they are struggling with poor education and health services .
In the words of Gobai , the people of Paniai , like other boats , will have to pay their voice to the debt that it has to pay .
&quot; They do not need money ; they want justice &apos; , &apos; he says .
Despite the theft and intimidation of alarm , the families of the victims of the Paniai were still able to cope with the most symbolic revolt of the death of one of the victims of the victim &apos;s body and the military .
Knowing that justice may never be put on their feet , they will not allow at least those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; One of our family members was killed , &apos; says Yacobus felled .
&quot; What can we do ? &quot;
Last year &apos;s Torbai Torch pickings and , for the second time itself .
Last Friday , one of the world &apos;s worst residential Dubat , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee the 3 37 metres and to flee their homes in 79 .
This is the second fire that has been ravaged by the high hall that has been ravaged in two years , which is called the Tuchvor Tfragile tortutor .
There was no mention of any direct fire in the building , and no direct cause of fire was reported .
&quot; We sleep and we woke fire on fire and the fear of the people .
We would come under the stairs , and it took us around 10 minutes to reach the floor , &apos; said Reuterrand one resident who called himself George .
According to civil protection officers of Dubai , fire fighters were extinguished at around 4 a.m. at a local time ( 00.00 GMT ) and jahuled the building .
The government said that they were working to ensure shelter .
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of the materials used on the world &apos;s highest foreign surface .
In the follow @-@ up to the Tuchi Management Board in 2015 , it was found that the worst damage suffered the appointment and isolation of fasads .
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenportfolio Tower &apos;s isolationist and the power panel could have contributed to the rapid deployment of fire in June , killing around 80 people .
See : In the autumn , they will be available in the autumn
In writing . - ( FR ) Those and autumn is a magic time for techniques , as the public will publicise their new models of excellence .
In the spring , the Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium will also be expected in the autumn .
According to the journalist of the Tele2 marketing and sale director , the &apos; Innovation Union &apos; is characterised by an innovative design , an eye by the Confederal Group of the Treasury , the serle @-@ servani 4K resolution screen and the ultra @-@ fast process .
A major elephant in the world of technology was Samsung Galaxy S8 , which has also reached the top of Estonia &apos;s smartphones .
In the autumn , a more astute high @-@ air , more durable , more quality cameras and greater water and dust security .
He added that , on the basis of the rumours , you can already make assumptions and forecast the four main models that will probably conquer the swathes of sales .
These four smartphone models will be available to the shops in the autumn of this year .
8 and iPhone 8 are expected to reach shops in mid @-@ September .
The rumours of the new Apple model , however , and what can be done can be done .
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences between iPhone 6s , the tenth anniversary of Apple &apos;s tenth birthday is expected that the new model is completely different from previous ones .
Four colours have been talked about : Black , white , rosé and chromium .
One of the elements of the new design is obviously the screen covering the whole of the phone , lost the dop and the fingerprints and built on the screen .
Apple &apos;s design leader JonyIve demands that the new iPhone model would look like a glass .
There has also been mention of the iPhone version of iPhone .
In addition to the eyes of the fast @-@ track snuner , the charge for free charging and a further high @-@ quality cameras can be expected to be faster in A11 .
This is certainly one of the most anticipated smart phones in the year .
The launch of the new model Galaxy will start on 23 August .
Although there are many rumours that the new Galaxy will start to see 8 .
It is estimated that even more business users and the S pen will allow even greater functionality .
The telecom should have two cameras , one of which is a wave of waves , and the other is the same vision of television .
At the moment , no one knows what the two camps are capable of , but in any case this Samsungi is the first attempt , which is certainly comparable to the iPhone 8 .
However , we are eagerly awaiting the 23 August .
Although Nokia has been selling three smart phones with Nokia 6 in this year , it is still missing their flag , Nokia 8 , which is already being presented on 16 August .
We look forward to the roll @-@ out of the 5.3 @-@ pollinated screen and the ultra @-@ fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processes and a more static one .
In the case of Nokia , there is also talk of aluminium Corps and significant water and dust @-@ proof .
Like the Samsug , the new model of Nokia will have two tamours , an opaque of a company Zea .
If the Sony &apos;s sound flagship vessel has been XZ Premium until now , the manufacturer has confirmed that there will be at least two smart phones in the near future , with even more innovative functions .
We are waiting for a smart phone that is slightly more modest than XZ Premium , but at least the same good or better cameras .
On the new model of Sony , it has been speculated that the screen is at least hot .
What the reality will be , we can see from the very beginning , as traditionally , the Sony has unveiled the International Technology Fair Financial Technology Fair , which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year .
On the basis of transcripts leakers leaked , Trump Mexico on the border wall
The Washington post unveiled the President of the United States of America , Donald Trumpi , Mexico and Australian leaders .
On 27 January , Mr Enrique Pena Nieton , the Mexican President , went on saying that it would stop public membership not to repay the proposed border wall .
The President of America , with his wall of condemnation of the wall , said : &apos; You must not say this to the press &apos; .
The Trump erected his presidential campaign to build the long @-@ distance wall of the United States of America and the age of Mexico to pay Mexico for this project .
There were also transcripts from his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister , Mr Turnbull , which exposes an intense debate .
Trump said to the Turnbull that the agreement that the United States will take on their own refugees to Australia &apos; is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; nerve &apos; and &apos; foolish &apos; ; he claimed that the agreement that was made under the Obama Administration would leave him a &apos; guide &apos; , since he has proposed the resettlement of refugees from the United States .
The Trump closed speech by announcing the Turk that &apos; this was the most unpleasant speech . &quot;
The Supreme Court failed to discuss the complaint in the city of OC MRP in a case where the Tartu city rejected the procurement of the bus and coach transport for the period from July 2019 to 2029 .
This is a letter with which the city of OC MRP ( OCS ) was refused a bus or coach bus because the tendering did not meet the requirements , explained the transport service for the city of Tartu , Anneli Acleantin .
This is a period of transport for the transport of passengers with the transport of the city of Tartu in the period 01.07.07.06.2029 .
In the case of MRP , Liberia complained to take the decision of the National Court of Justice .
It was not taken by the Supreme Court .
Although there are many in the social media that it is annoying that the Web is annoying their night and the whole of the city is full of brakes , there are many of those who do not have a single word on the festival .
I am even positively surprised that the shop was both courtesy .
I have not seen any disgust or discourtesy .
Even the left I saw , the wave boasting a wave .
&quot; It is all well and good that it is coming to an end , and there is a joy of joy , which is a farm like winter , it will gladly add .
A wave of strains in the name of Rannlia is not a hair .
If , in the middle town of the centre , he still survived that music is playing a music , then music is not yet at the end of his home country .
&quot; But I hope that I hear &apos; I am happy to say &apos; .
The discussion with the headar will also say that the great festival is a good thing for the sake of the great festival , it will greatly contribute to the VAT of local tradespeople .
In addition , he welcomes that the summer capital has come so much out of the village .
There is no woman in the family of men .
Although I am no longer behaving on the beach , but it is good that there has been a recovery .
And it is good that the people are moving , and that is what has been the case three times , says a woman .
In the first case , I think it was a little worse .
&quot; Maybe , there was a complaint , he is wondering .
What is happening , however , is that of summer capital as usual for the summer capital .
&quot; This Web test is a very good program for our small city , &quot; speaks on the front Harri .
Life and möll have not been absorbed by his life of life and möll .
But why ?
We should all pull together .
To think about how this interaction between nations is better .
Festival music is not a muscle .
This is not the case , although I live close to it .
&quot; Good people can save and there is no thick , he speaks .
The visitors &apos; guests are , as he said , courtesy .
&quot; With the bottles , they are of course also a little exaggerated , but young people are young and they are God - to go , but be the people and we can start ! &apos;
The extreme residents have moved away from that period , whether to relatives or to acquaintance .
&quot; But , in general , people with a positive impact on the festival will like to enjoy such a man , &apos; he speaks as a Tiina Tiina .
His model of the family &apos;s Festival does not disrupt , even though it went even further in the past year .
Last summer , the theatre was there , we heard more .
We are living outside the city that , in fact , there is a great deal of space for the river , he speaks .

A major bomb attack in the centre of the bomb in the centre of 31 May killed more than 150 people - the military attack on the military attack since the US @-@ led military forces in 2001 .
This violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the President of the United States , Donald Trump , is considering whether to increase the military and police forces in the country .
According to the Corps , suicide attacks in recent weeks have also led to public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf Ghan .
The EPA annulled the decision of deferral following the postponement of the oral regulation
The United States Environmental Protection Agency ( IMS ) annulled the decision to delay the adoption of the Obama @-@ modern regulation obliging states to limit emissions caused by smog emissions , one day after 15 states referred the agency to court because of this progress .
The decision was announced by the decision to proceed with the &quot; 2015 ozone @-@ alcohol designation procedures &quot; late on Wednesday , saying that it shows the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; We believe that we need to keep dialogue with our state partners and listen to them , &apos; said the President of the EPA , Mr Pruitt .
The Pruitt had announced the intention of June to reject the ozone content levels , which measure pollution from different parts of the country in order to determine where its level of minimum air quality standards should be reduced by one year to the 2018 year .
The 15 mainly democratic states jointly submitted an action against Columbia on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President Trumpi &apos;s government has tried to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , and , as Mr Trumpi said , this part is part of a broader growth agenda .
These aspirations , however , have provoked reactions between the democrats and the natural groups who are concerned about the effects of increased pollutants on human health .
It is available on the website that breathe breathing breaour of ozone can reduce the ability of the Copg and increase the risk to diseases of respiratory diseases , such as asthma .
The German cigarette can come from the pipe .
Germany &apos;s swine and bovine can come from a pipe , because the strong rainfall are threatening the European Union &apos;s second wheat producer - Banimal berg .
This year , it is possible to go to the fact that a week spent before harvest can mean that bread intended for bread will only be eaten for animals .
&quot; The quality of the SEPA is far worse than the bubble and worse than in 2015 , &quot; Agravis Raiffeisen analytical .
This year , up to 40 % of German nights may be used for animal feed , which is fine compared to the usual , forecast Agravis .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have been exposed to all weather this year .
First , the winter was too dry .
There was a cold ban which was replaced in June by the heat waves .
In July , Germany was hit by a situation which has continued in August .
Many eyes have been turned to Northern Germany , where the rain hinders the harvest .
So far , only five per cent of the per cent has been picked up .
The majority of the region has not yet reached the harvest , the local buying of harvests and the Ceravi .
&quot; These are quite difficult days , &quot; Ceravis parental trader and Frank Deckert Rendsburg .

There is a clear demonstration there that black , white and grey contestants , if they are supplemented by the wood tones and tothos , can be very desperate .
There will be some good ideas for a week to come , because the Fair will last until 13 August .

Ms Mooy Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko will meet for the first time ,
Vasyl Lomachenko and Msety Garcia , who should be on a collision course to go to the most attractive boys in the near future to 66.7 kg in a weighted category , met for the first time on Thursday .
They were in Angeleat in the ESPN office in Angeleles , to Garcia , the winning World BoceCouncil County Counchpopipil , walked off the corridor to the second run in order to welcome Lomachenko , World Bouseaszusei sulgweighch .
Following the victory of the unanimous decision of the Garcia unanimously , the former four @-@ fold world champions , the Broner on Saturday in Showlate , both combatants are part of the top @-@ ranking .
Shcia got his better hand and said : &apos; How is it going , the champion ?
I wish you success . &quot;
In the case of Lomachenko , your belts in Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 19 ESPN .
When a few photographs were to be covered , Lomachenko pointed out in the Eg Klimas that a &apos; perfect moderation &apos; could be possible between the opposing militias .
&quot; I am a former closing point , &apos; recalled Garcia .
&quot; I have been nominated for the Broner &#91; 63.5 kg , but I am not so great .
I am a small per cent of 63.5 kg .
I want to move downwards weight .
And it must go upwards weight &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
The Fäns have called for this .
Let us offer them that . &quot;
Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; The world needs this fight . &quot;
Finally , the question was raised as to whether this consideration should be worthwhile , it is part of his strategy under which he wants to allow the Lomachenl to put an end to this year in the 61.2 kg class , in order to make the next summer possible meeting in Garciaga ( 37 to 0 , 30 nociti ) , which also has an interest in combating Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbelli , after their 23 September , in Forliture Forsala Forsala .
&quot; This struggle could be cost @-@ effective , as fans have called for this confrontation , &apos; said Garcia , later saying that he was open to combating any of the channels offering the best financial packages .
&quot; We are the main players .
No other name will be able to attract so much attention .
Whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Mrs cia said that he considered Lomachenkot to be the &apos; driving force &apos; , and he could take a look at her Saturday .
But Lomachenko was modest in praising the Garcia by saying that he thought that the three divises from the Riverside went out of three divises &apos; very slow ; excuse , Msety ... you wanted it to be noted &apos; .
In the words of Garcia , the aim was to show the strength and then the boxing .
Both assured that they feel the tension is increasing to reach the tension .
&quot; This is a fight that awaits realisation .
No other confrontation gives rise to so much attention and a great deal .
I am more than willing to work for this , &quot; said Garcia .
Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been on the waiting lists of the best combatants and the Mooy .
This is a good struggle . &quot;
What is going to happen from the world &apos;s eyes to Estonia ?
The extension of the soil and issuing a police and border agency ( PPA ) record over 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have been travelling to Estonia for work , study or family .
If , for example , a fixed @-@ term residence permit was decided to issue 6702 foreign , the impression was 4928 .
The agencies cannot say how many immigrants are permanently left to Estonia , but such an analysis will be drawn up in the Ministry of the Interior .
If , a decade ago , nearly 500 Ukrainians died in the home , in recent years this figure will start to close to 2 000 .
The number of applicants for residence permits was soaring at the time of the Ukrainian crisis - 1 687 people had acquired fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 .
The statistical agency gives us the highest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia - the Ukrainian citizen who arrived in the soil in Estonia is more than a secession .
&quot; The Ukrainian community has been a great community in Estonia and , due to complicated circumstances , it is natural that work and opportunities for learning are being sought from a country where the community and many of the family are already facing themselves &apos; , the internal Ministry of Interior in the Interior , Kristin Rammus .
The soil and the bubble , the number of open @-@ ended Ukrainians was even higher than the number of Russian citizens , although in ten years , the highest number of fixed @-@ term residence permits have been awarded .
If the Ukrainians come here predominantly , the citizens of Russia will have their family migration .
&quot; Given the historic Russian community here , they are also more likely to have the largest family contacts with the people living in Russia , &quot; said the Internal Protection Advisor of the Interior , Helina Moina .
&apos;If you look at where the citizens of Russia who have received Estonian residence have moved to life , after the land of Harpreiland , he immediately found East Virumaa , added and pointed out that around 40 % of these have been married by the citizens of the European Union .
In the same way , 1696 Russian citizens received a fixed @-@ term residence permit , which is also a record number .
At the same time , the Russians &apos; permission to extend the residence permit decreased dramatically .
&quot; The compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , the new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence , &quot; explained the High Representative &apos;s press officer , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years .
There will be at least three years of foreign access from last year for a new residence permit to be established permanently .
Its aim is to facilitate the sickness of people who have adapted to it .
A long @-@ term residence permit requires five years , for example .
After the new residence permit , the extension of the old residence permit has obviously been reduced .
For example , this residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians , who have been working for at least three years here .
Now the Ukrainians will be able to change their work , and the country in Estonia is no longer pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
This residence permit became popular - applicants &apos; holders of a grey passport ( 1029 ) , Russians ( 487 ) , individuals ( 54 ) and Nigereerers ( 36 ) .
In total , 1968 people were authorised to live in the Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 Georgians and as many Chinese .
The first half of this year is already set at 12.69 .
In ten years , a country with a surprisingly poor country whose citizens are among the most active Estonian residence applicants .
When three residence permits were issued to the children of the age of 2007 , the bubble was 200 .
From Nigeria , you come to learn in these great universities .
In addition , the Estonian high education institutions are popular , for example among the Georgians , the Chinese and the Turks .
The number of Indian , Bangladeshi and Nigerian citizens has increased predominantly thanks to the lessons learned .
In these cases , too , the rule applies that there is a need for the community to come up with more simply others , &quot; said Rammus .
Over the course of 10 years , two people in Estonia have also moved from North Korea , for example , from Laos and Madagascar .
Ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 from South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four Uruguay .
If around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals obtain residence permits per year , around 0.46 % of the total population .
Even if you think about the citizens of the European Union , migration remains around a percentage , &quot; said : &apos; The numbers are actually small .
In total , 14 822 people were reported by the statistical office in Estonia , while 13 792 .
This means that immigration exceeded the second year from emigration .
Most of the exodus and entry @-@ out are Estonian citizens , but there are more among those who leave them .
That is why the migration of Estonian citizens in the soil fell from 2 000 to 2 000 .
Estonians migrate in particular between Finland and Estonia .

It is a joy !
The long world of Couture may seem to be some kind of alien example , but designer does not think so .

The Moeartificial artist does not recognise the gap between brilliant events and the grey day of the grey .
It is this reasoning that put the rolling stock on the ground to the places in the countryside , between forests and fields , to the people , who are often not reaching their mood .
The Mlong collectilation was presented , for example , by a comparison , Jaw and the Permoealleel , where 45 modell of 45 modell filled his entire street .
In a very often half @-@ baked , young people are taken in a dignified way , but there are more emotions in other parts of the world - shouting &apos; vo , you stand up , you want to thank you .

Mr Myrsepp U18 boys : The weapon of the custody of Estonians is now turned against us .
The damage , the fairy tale is running out .
The first thing is that we did not get our desk .
And if there is such a difference in the table , there is nothing to be done &apos; , the Estonian U18 corners of the Palace : 75 out of the UK , our only milestone , Mr Kalev / Cramo abitreer Martin Mandrsepp .
Opponents were attacked by 28 balls and received so many more attacks .
We were not prepared either to defend them aggressive and to attack it , it created it .
Many of the British attacks ended in three to five seconds , we were not able to build protection .
However , when it came to the protection , they reached every side of the hands , we could not combine it .
It created a team on its feet .
The work of the opponents was better done .
The Mührsepa estimates that Estonia would have to make more tactical mistakes in order to get the opponents down in the bud .
The last quarter of the water - we had a zero error , but opponents have already been quick to repeat .
Atleethness and close insistence , which was a slap @-@ up to our arms , has now turned to all of us .
Today we had no strength against their aggressive attitude .
The Mührsek remained at the heart of his negligence , in Kalevis , Matthias Tass .
Overall , there is good words for a whole team in general , to say to the team , to date there was a single blow in the strike .
It is a pity that this aggressive opponent was already forged in the past .
The whole time has been self @-@ confident and played off the streets , but seemed to have been tired of - he has borne a huge burden .
But he made some very positive moves that I have seen in the past in the trends . &quot;
Terrible figures : The rehasing of nerets in the &apos; EM @-@ turniiril &apos; with less than 10 points ...
In the latest age class , it is not only young men &apos; formula B @-@ divisjon basketball in Tallinn , which started in Dublin yesterday .
And the Estonian game in Poland , unfortunately , is in the area of quarances .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 but , even after the third water andalet , the situation was 9 : 49 , in the last ten minutes only 16 : 16 .
Both in the first and second quarters , Estonian 4 , 3rd 1 ( ... )
In so doing , at the beginning of two minutes , two pieces were thrown out of the first two minutes , and 25 have been caught by 25 , then one of the three has been retained and then 21 more dismissed ...
Perhaps for almost half an hour , 47 vises are caught .
In addition , 2 points came from four free chains .
The many losses were a sensible figure in this time , 12 .
By the end of the game , Poland was stagnated with 33 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has begun two losses , with the exception of the Portuguese 83 : 56 black black .
NATO vessels in Tallinn to complement Tallinn
Today , 1 weeks ago , a permanent anti @-@ dumping group from NATO came to Tallinn for a port port visit to complement the stocks of vessels and prepare for the pre @-@ presumed exercise .
Ships in the course of the visit are preparing to nail the sea and give crews a chance of a few days &apos; leave .
Following a visit , ships from NATO will remain in the waters of Estonia to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future historic remnants for bursting .
&quot; The involvement of Estonians in NATO units and their activities in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the merging forces &apos; , said the overseas fleet &apos;s over @-@ capacity for Operation Operation Arto Reinland .

4 . - 13 August , the moirs of the Pirita monastery will become once again a site where 13 years ago 13 years ago the Mari Kans are being called on to Festival Festival .
This year &apos;s Birgitta Festival will be the risk of a beautiful , powerful and unprecedented risk , according to the Festival of Festival .
The risk to the Joost : &apos; The layers reach the &apos; Traviata &apos; and the &apos; Tosca &apos; , the balle &apos;s discolummava &quot; Bolerost , &quot; a ladni &apos;s &apos; Karlssonini &apos; , and neither does it lack its own production , which is this time Joseph Haydni admiororama &apos; Aastatimes &apos; laching the same international loving team in 2015 and neither does it lack its own production , which is this time Joseph Haydni admilise Aastatimes .
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concert and theatre responses .
This is greater than any music theatre in its normal form .
It is a festival that is gaining ground and is never going to get off the ground .
Because the experience that can be heard and can be found in this superior and mysterious environment , human mind sounds brighter and it concerns human tragedies in a way that is not possible .
Risk to the first year of Birgitta Festival &apos;s artistic leader .
Did the Maastro Eri Kans not felt a little bit like this ?
Of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Ery Klaus , it has been a great deal of help .
He went through a career of a whole of mine and also supported a career in the early stages of a divisive career .
Perhaps it is thanks to which I will be easier to continue his work .
In the different camps , the Festival team has so much charity and , of course , it is passed on to me .
It was excellent to join a team who knows how things are going .
It is the great courage of the Eri Keea who gave me the strength to move ahead with Festiloui Festivali in harmony in Tallinn .
And here I am , and I can do it .
What would be the audience for the audience in the street , which is what are you offering ?
We have the land of artists , Latvia , Lithuania and , as a surprise , a first Cabinet , written to Mrs Lindgreni .
To do so , &apos; Karlsson fights &apos; .
And one of the notorious nuances at this is that it was written by the author of Latvia in Karnoise and Juris Karlbia , who himself expressed a desire to write this act .
He has probably had the fear of the Carlsson floaker who had lived in the bud .
To what extent do you hunt all this ?
Thanks to my support , my fellow Member will certainly .
This work needs a system of support and much love , and I am fortunate enough to do so .
And I have noticed that my personal emotions are not dependent on so many other people , as I am perhaps going to be going against every new day .
And such an informed tone , keeping a positive spirit and actually smile itself in the morning , significantly raised my happy percentage .
Especially now this week , when the most important test is , I have been very keen to practise it and it is working .
Turning yourself into a smile is a sounding and raises tone .
It is not just a word of words .
I think people do not yet know the boys about their own body , which the universe is offering them , but everybody himself is little comfortable .
Immediately , this is an important moment .
Is there some ritual before the dirigend wounded ?
It is time that the clothes need to be replaced by more convenient .
It is a small moment for itself .
But , in general , I do not have the opportunity to make a pump or a little snapping before a great deal of time .
In fact , I even like to be very keen to communicate with the people , even before the dirigenant were taken .
But come to all Birgitta Festivali , what is detected here , not particularly for the great operatives and the cyclone .
Watch a quiet video with Joostiga !
New findings of the evaluation of the age of Swedish asylum applicants :
In Sweden , there were some of the asylum applicants , in which the old approach to their old approach was medically assessed , and the latest results of the test show that more than 80 % of the texts were judged to be older than 18 , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of results .
The Swedish National Institute for Public Health ( Rashtsiciinalverk ) started the tests for the beginning of this year .
The tests were set up in the period of application for a more accurate evaluation of age , following Swedish Migratian ( IMigsverket ) , in particular for failing to correctly define the age of many allegedly underage minors .
To date , the Iversverket test has been sent of 80 cases and the Institute of Forensic in March 2017 , up to 31 July , the results of 24 81 tests .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) was assessed at 18 years old or older and a further 25 cases were assessed by the Institute of medicine to test the test &quot; may be 18 years old or older . &quot;
In the 432 cases , it has been concluded that a person is &apos; perhaps younger than 18 &apos; .
The tests will only be used if a person &apos;s age is questioned .
According to the Johan Institute of medicine , Johan Göransson , the results are consistent with those of the past months .
&quot; We do not see the big difference compared with the previous statistics , the numbers are quite consistent , &apos; he said in the newspaper .
The fact that a large proportion of the cases were deemed to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum applicants have shed their age .
The Institute issued the results of the May test and said that , in 442 cases , there are indications that the person studying is 18 or old or older . &quot;
However , when the newspaper was able to see the results of these 581 tests in the Northern Dimension , it emerged that 243 people had directly claimed that it would be 18 this year .
This method of medical age assessment being conducted by therapeutic röntgeniiciic and scorn @-@ blood MRT , which could be analysed on dentists and radiology , have been criticised in some quarters .
One of the sceptics is the Carolinska Institute endokring Claude Marcus , whose working tasks include an assessment of the biological maturity of people to find out whether they passed a teenager in the normal sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about it , and I do not think that the measure used now should be used .
The appointment of biological age in this way is very uncertain .
If we cannot say for sure , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he said to the newspaper Metro &apos; .
But in Johan Göransson &apos;s doctor , the doctor &apos;s medical Institute , defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; Overall , it can be said that a child &apos;s inaccurate risk of adulteration is small .
Perhaps the biggest perhaps around 10 % are at risk of just under 18 . &quot;

20 years old and Anna Maria Orel gave a beautiful debate in MMil , receiving 67.37ga a good 18 .
After all , MM noorm was a woman &apos;s waste and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for medals in the future .
The contest went well and I got a good experience .
With the first test ( 64.80 ) I immediately did my average result , the second ( 62.80 ) , I went too much , and third ( 67.37 ) , I had been able to keep it clear , &quot; said Orel after the contest .
I went to my own emissions and I am very pleased that I found it .
Ms Maria Orel MM &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 .
The Oreliit did not obscure , because it is marching on the basis of a static phase in the phase .
&quot; I am afraid , he said a little mutigue .
The London Olympic Torchon was almost a full house for the people , was it the people of Orel himself around himself or turned himself off ?
I have seen it , but in a positive sense .
Everyone is saying that it gives us - that is !
If you go down the road , you can experience it .
It was confirmed that MM &apos;s debate is satisfactory , and he is still waiting for a great deal of good contest : &apos; I came here to 32nd , the latest result , I finished on 18 .
This is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and the MMC - that is the only thing that matters .
I am taking a good experience , and on some day I would like to compete on behalf of medals .
Western Virgina kuberner declared party exchange
In his inaugural meeting with President Trumpi , the Western Virginia Democrat , reported on Thursday evening with President Trumpy that he breaks parties .
&quot; We want it or not , but democrats walked away from me , &apos; said the Governor of the governor .
&quot; Today I say to you , having been afraid of the prast and I have thought ... today I say to you , the West Bank , that I cannot help you any more as democratic governor . &apos;
Overting in the doorstep was gratifying .
&quot; So I will be the Republican tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; As a Treer , I would say to you that it is time to play a second game . &quot;
The Trump had promised a great deal of announcement in the Western Virginia .
The Trump wins a 42 point in the Western Virginia , and the candidacy of Hillary Clinton was not supported by the democrats .

Mr Coe approved Russians &apos; fair apology for the Demit channel
Mr Sebastian Coe , the international rhythm of Kergeate , applauded his words &apos; Russia &apos;s fourday &apos;s honest excuse for the Doping scandal , but reiterated that now is not the time to promise the country back to sport .
Dmitry Shylachtin , Russia &apos;s lighter effect , said that the ban on the International Cup of the athletin World Cup in the eve of the eve of the World Cup , that the ban on the competition imposed on his country is right and that it has a firm objective of combating doping .
He apologised &apos; from all the athletes who have lost their golden golden gold and silver swine . &quot;
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of a ban on the entry into force of a ban on the entry into force of a ban on the entry into force of the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) in Russia .
&quot; I think it was a very honest answer today , a very honest presentation , &apos; said IAAF @-@ i President Coe .
&quot; The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian alalian also acknowledged that they had had quite difficult times and that they would do their utmost to restructure the permanent alliance . &quot;
In the words of Coe , he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criterion of self @-@ forecasting .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and there is progress , but the Congress supports the working group &apos;s proposal that this is not the time to take Russia back , &apos; said Coe .
&quot; We need to do everything possible over the next few months to normalise the situation .
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to dissociate pure sporting athletes from the system &apos; .
One of the other Russian athletes who comply with the stringent criteria of IAAF will compete on Friday in London as neutral athletes in the World Cup .
Mr Rune Andersen , the head of the IAAF working group , said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet a number of forecasted criteria .
Following a presentation by the IAEA to the Council , in London , he told the London press that the anti @-@ doping controls are still inadequate , and that the travel engineers were still operating freely .
The electric car revolution makes a significant difference in demand for metals .
Who are the winners and the losers ?
The fact that the electric car revolution will substantially change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure , it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market .
Although mines like Glenge can say that one place they win and lose , smaller mining firms will not help .
At the moment , the Glencore coal and oil will continue to be built , but cobalt , lithium , copper , aluminium and nickel will continue to grow .
This year , the UK , France and Norway governments &apos; decisions have contributed to the spread of electric cars , allowing decades to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the near future .
It is already Volvo who knew that they are planning to abandon their internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring the market a cheaper one in the market for the cheapest electric car .
Banimal berg &apos;s New Energy Finance predictions are already expected to sell more electric cars than cars produced from oil over the next two decades .
&quot; For some parts it amends everything , &quot; said Simona Gambranini Banimal berg , according to the analysis of the raw materials of Capital . &quot;
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium , which demand has grown for years .
In electric cars , there are about three times more copper than in the ordinary car , Glentures .
There is a need for recharging stations , which is why the &apos; BNP Paris Paris &apos; estimates that it will increase demand for 2025 of around 5 % by 2025 .
The increase in demand for electric cars means an additional lip , cobalt , graphite and mangandemand .
The Glends can grow from the rising price of electric cars and that it is the world &apos;s largest cobalt in the world , forecast the Jeffarly Group .
This country &apos;s broker estimates that Freeport @-@ McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals are winners of the winning power of electric cars .
The market is reacting to a changing trend .
This year , 70 % of the London metal code has been fished .
The increase in the price of the Multi years was 37 % .
The answer is 14 per cent of this year , mainly due to economic growth .
The Glenge stock in London rose by 20 % , having surpassed on the rival in Rio TheuGroup , BHP Billion and Anglo .
On the front of the losers , companies such as Recyclex and Campine , will be required to adapt to a new era .
The main end @-@ use of the ball is the seed of petrol and diesel engines with a stream of flowers .
Electric cars use lithium @-@ free windows .
&quot; This is a serious risk of lead demand unless any other purpose can be found , which could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael Widmer , head of analysis of the market in the Bank of England .
With regard to the price of the Plii price , there is not yet any effect of a scattering trend .
Plii is 17 % of this year , which is the best metametal in London , among the main industrial metals .
Investors see problems in the metal in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure that the lead is so bad , as cheap oil is holding unconventional competition , &quot; said Herwig Zwig , a metal in metal .
If the lead demand falls , it will be slow .
This may be the case for around ten years .
In the meantime , however , stricter emission standards mean that hybrid demand for hybrid cars is increasing , which is more dependent on the lead @-@ based batteries in the launch of these engines .
Cargmeroles such as aluminium replace steel , as let us get the car going to drive off the electric .
This will be explained by a minimum of 1.6 million tonnes of rubbish between 2013 and 2016 .
It accounts for 2.7 % of the world &apos;s total .
This trend is likely to grow , said Widmer .
The Aluminium is 13 per cent of this year , as the increasing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
The steel producers are not .
On the subject of ak , General Motors will work with General Motors to use nanotechnologies for the production of so @-@ called car chains .
ArcelorMittal and the desert Europe are trying to develop a lighter thread steel to stand up to the minimum .
&quot; A strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris &apos;s analysis of Sylvain Brunet .
There is some success in Europe .
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to the plate .
It took around half of this precious metal diesel engine for car catalysts , reported metal fingers and Johnson Matsi .
&quot; Many of the high @-@ demand raw materials such as oil and posters may not have a major demand in the future , &quot; said Natixise raw materials analysis , Bernard Dahdah .
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
Plaatinde producers continue to believe in the continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Mr Marc Grynberg , the head of the Unstar , said that , in 2025 , more hybrid cars will continue to be sold to hybrid cars .
The great hope of planned producers in the 10 years is Toyota Motori and Hyf Motosi @-@ developed hydrogen cells based on the plate to produce a hydrogen electricity .
Until now , however , this technology has not yet proved to be legitimate .
&quot; The latter appears to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Exane BNP from Paris to Brunet .
German car manufacturers received a major setback in July , as Stuttgart &apos;s court abolished the use of diesel in the town of Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche .
How the financial rules on football will affect the transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs are not hampered by the global record transition from the Spanish football club to the French club of Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
Any consequences from UEFA , the governing body that governs the European game and has the potential to ban crews in the presence of the prestigious March of the media , waiting for the Paris Saint Germention .
The rules of fair play introduced by UEFA in 2011 ( FFP ) mean that the PSG must prove that the transition to the transition to NeyMarch was funded without huge loss .
A total of EUR 222 million was paid out to Barcelona ( 262 million dollars ) for having been able to buy his contract , and the salary of Mr Neys will reach up to tens of millions of dollars a year .
There are some aspects of the transfer of transplants to the French club .
The G @-@ l will undoubtedly be able to recruit a designer in the recruitment of a number of marches , given that the team finances the family of the Qatar .
Clubs are allowed to spend a great deal to recruit players , but they must balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out of the football business .
Mr FFP has laid the foundation for Michel Platini following his election as President of UEFA in 2007 .
This former French player believed that clubs who fall in search of their search in large debt are actually dealing with fraud and risk shopping when banks or owners should give up their support .
Since 2011 FFP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of FFP clubs .
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich was first used in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then to make huge costs to make it easier for the team to be improved and that the global trade mark is harder to implement .
During the current three @-@ year evaluation period of FFP , which runs until 2018 , clubs can carry up up to EUR 30 million .
And , despite the fact that Mr Platini was disreputed in 2015 by the presidential office , his UEFA &apos;s successors and Alexander Ceferin are still committed to obstructing excessive spending .
FFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules , &apos; said last week &apos;s Fpress le Andrea Traverso , who is UEFA &apos;s FFP concessions .
Although the PSG is one of the integrated payment clauses for a single whole payment clause , they will be able to distribute this sum for the purposes of the entire contract for the period of validity of the Treaty .
A five @-@ year contract was signed by Mr Neymar , which makes it possible to show a sum of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years .
With the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , the PSG became the most severe punishments on the Abu Dicbi in Abu Cityga .
For the G @-@ G , a fine of EUR 60 million was set at EUR 82 million , which was reduced to EUR 20 million later , and a club was required to limit the implementation of the March @-@ 2015 season for the 21 @-@ 2015 season .
UEFA is looking for clubs who can try to control financial institutions , blowing their incomes through companies linked to clubs .
While a subscriber company may sponsor the PSG , but if the value of sponsorship is deemed to be standard market rates , UEFA will not allow this official income to count .
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the quality of the support for the Qatar has been inflated .
It has been said that a certain part of the PSD PSG may come from the World Cup Management Committee for the period of 20 22 years through the SCC .
However , the PSG and the Qatar 2022 deny that it would be possible to become a World Cup and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulators can easily uncover such a manoeuvre .
The penalties imposed on the G of the G mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant when it comes to any attempt to flout the rules .
The familiar people of the situation have echoed on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition of the PSG to preventive discussions .
They talked to the Ppress on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG .
The latest reports show that , in the period 2015 @-@ 2016 , more than EUR 10 million will be profitable at around EUR 2.4 million .
The latest financial year has not yet been published .
The PSG hopes that the arrival of the Neys will be good for sponsorship deals , commodity processing and seal sales .
A minimum of 30 per cent growth is expected in the context of the agreement .
Spain too , having clearly upset the departure of one of the biggest football stars , trying to prevent the transition of a martary , arguing that the PSG is in breach of FFP .
&quot; This is clear the case of the &apos; financial doping &apos; with a club and a country , &apos; said Javier Tebas , President of the La Tebas , referring to the fact that the PSG belongs mainly to Qale .
Arried Wenger , a member of the Arsenal memory of the Arsenger , whose club belongs to the American sporting magnage , shares the English approach that the country funds the club .
&quot; This is a consequence of property rights , and it has changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger Thursday .
&quot; If the club belongs to the country , everything is possible .
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as others can have other ways or other interests so that such a large player is represented . &apos;

They are given a tractor that is behaving a sleeping trajectory on the surface of a sleeping smile .
In fact , the last seven @-@ metre @-@ metre exaggerating the last seven metres , picking out the marine litter and the desert of people : Bottle , cigarette consoles and so on .
People still come to rank , regardless of whether the water is warm or not .
If it is fine , people are beach , and if there are no people , then the private company is saying to the private company , Mr Alexander Usov , is a private servant .
It is 6.30 p.m. and strict work is being done , because it is up to eight people to have a record .
The new job is already at 4 : 4 .
In addition to Stroom , he will keep an eye on Pirita , Harku lakes , Kakumäe and Palgaraare Pikakari .
The overall amounts have been reduced .
Many years ago it was much more .
People are now already able to assess what is being done for them , &apos; talks Usov , who has picked up for 15 years .
Before it was the case that when something new got up , it was the next day .
Now it is already being kept under what is rankward .
Cost of clean air
One of the biggest entries in the rank of Estonia is the decommissioned sea basket , the &apos; naru harvesting &apos; .
For example , in the Pirita rank , 400 000 tonnes must be taken away from this coastal season .
&quot; This is unbelievable quantity , &quot; says Usov .
The second large category is the collection of municipal waste , or all that people leave behind .
In the south of Poland , in Stroom , eight large container containers are in Stroom , which needs to be done three times a week .
So much for the rubbish .
However , the cold summer summer has meant that the waste is one fifth less than otherwise .
The third species are deserted .
In most cases , these are children &apos;s televisions .
As a result , Usov sand has broken the ten metymug wave .
They will be able to wait for a beach trawl .
&quot; Normally they need to be done more , but it is a normal harvest &apos; , and it is already aware that they will soon find them back in the sand .
Children come to rank and take toys to bury them into the sand .
Landfill dishes
Mrs Scholler , a representative of the Special Representative for hospital services , admits that the operation of a tractor is disrupting local life .
Noise , which runs from night hours to property , is distracted by people living in the vicinity .
On the day , this work is impossible .
In one month , there will be two times to drive through a screening .
&quot; If we do not do this , the part of the city will be fined , &apos; notes Scholler .
But the aim is , like the Pirita , the Pikakar and the Personant to become part of the quality label of the Stroom .
&quot; Estonia has much more work in Estonia to ensure that they are nurtured , &quot; says Scholler .
We have more knowledge and passion , and it is more difficult to drive the sand .
But our beaches are less rubbish than in other parts of Europe .
When I hear that the rank talks are being talked about in the rubbish , the devoom of Stroom , a living @-@ free journalist , and the interlocutors &apos; conversations , highlight the current bottlenecks .
Hommines are just half the picture .
The problem lies with birds and slave slave slaves who have pulled the rubbish of rubbish .
Although it is hard to expect people to be able to change their current patterns of behaviour , it is hoped that the city government is taking action in the blending of rubbish and putting them on the whales , for example , to prevent at least birds taking place there .
In general , however , Mr Stroom is pleased with development .
We can see that the city is taking care of it .
It has become more pleasant with childcare , enlightened and refreshing roads .
It was never the case that there was only one way to go on the agenda , Martin .

Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to hear that interest rates remain at the same level as weak growth and the easing of inflation have cushioned speculation on the increase .
Bank of England has warned that growth is stagnating because household incomes have put interest rates on standby .
The policy makers of the Bank &apos;s Committee on Monetary Policy ( MPC ) have voted for a period of 6 : 2 to 0.25 % for retention and less Members will be demanding an increase in this month , as slow growth has weakened support .
In its quarterly inflation report , the bank is slashing at 1.7 % in the 2017 growth forecast and a 1.6 % increase in 2018 , and warned that pressure on households &apos; incomes persists , as inflation is expected to return to 3 % in the autumn .
At the same time , the bank also signalled that the growth rate will be necessary to curb inflation caused by Brexitk over the next few years , and on financial markets it may be necessary to have a higher increase in the cost of borrowing .
The Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the economic stimulus package , which was launched a year ago by Brext .
It will put an end to a fixed @-@ term finance scheme in February , offering banks cheap money , although he said that it is now expected to wait for an increase of 15 billion , which is GBP 115 billion .
On the basis of the decision on the rate , the bank is saying : &quot; GDP remains the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the near future , as the difficult situation of households &apos; real income will continue to have an effect on consumption . &quot;
On the level of inflation , it was reiterated that there is a need to tighten the monetary policy to some extent &apos; and this &apos; somewhat greater &apos; than expected in the markets .
The Böge programme is now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
However , the bank emphasised that any anthem is gradual and limited .
The Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to May .
The projected growth forecast of 1.8 % in 2018 remained stable .
After that news , the pounds fell against the dollar and the euro .
In Naples , there were 0.5 % of USD 1.31 and 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .
The decision not to make any changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have raised rising hopes in relation to rising GDP rose by 0.3 % in the second quarter of the previous quarter .
The bank says that growth is likely to reach 0.3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will start collecting slightly .
The latest inflation report in the bank provided little reason to rejoice with rising inflation and wretched wage increases , saying that the situation would get slightly worse before the recovery is made .
It was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent incoming incomes in the next few years , but a three @-@ year forecast is expected to bring about a marked recovery of wages .
As a result of this fine GBP , the economy is stimulated by the growing demand for British produce , which partially compensates the lower costs of consumers .
The decision comes one year after the rates were taken in August by 0.25 % following the shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the price .
The bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to breathe prices and economies .
Before the last decision of the bank , increasing demand for raising the demand was felt , as inflation increased pressure on straits households ; three policy makers called for an increase from 0.5 % in July .
Inflation fell at 2.6 % last month , compared with 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected to rise again over the next few months .
The bank said that excessive growth compared to 2 % was completely down to weak .
In the light of the recent decline in the spreads of the Coreco mortgage , Andrew Montlake , said that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive , as the lending companies are losing their jobs and hoping to complete their positive hope for the year .
The latter seem to be particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to a close , since refinancing , often serving and low @-@ rate , have become increasingly popular . &quot;
NHS is writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV medicines
Patients have had access to &apos; transformative &apos; HIV treatment following the battle of the Supreme Court on whether the NHS should finance the medicine .
The NHS reported that public health now makes an initial clinical attempt to make it possible for an estimated 10 000 people to be exposed to exposure to pre @-@ pre ( PrEP ) - a tablet that is being manageated before the mid @-@ term and which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection by around 86 % for people with high risk .
The NHS agreed to finance the clinical test after an appeal court supported the ruling of the Supreme Court last year , according to which the NHS is able to pay for the EP , despite the claims made by the agency itself that the medicinal product should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Simon Stevens , President of the NHS England , welcomed this Thursday &apos;s public release as &apos; new extensive intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NAT ) described it as a &apos; landmark moment &apos; .
The sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverboolis and Sheffield are among the first to register people in October and will be accompanied by even more clinics in October , before the programme is introduced by April 2018 .
There is also a pre @-@ professional prophylactic ( PrEP ) is an HIV medicine cuur that is to be taken before the mid @-@ term to minimise the risk of HIV infection .
The results of clinical trials show that the PrEP will significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission among people who are infected .
The introduction of the PrEP before the mid @-@ term means that a person &apos;s body has sufficient numbers of medicines that prevent HIV infections from being infected .
These medicines can be taken on a daily basis or two hours before the mid @-@ term .
One of the most suitable candidates will include lesbian or bisexual men , transgender people and people whose partners are HIV @-@ infected and unable to receive treatment .
Appropriate people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , transgender people and those whose HIV as an interdependent partner cannot receive anti @-@ retroviral treatment .
People who live in England and have chosen to have a family doctor will be able to register their participation in the local health clinic in the programme .
The programme costs GBP 10 million and the NHS has signed an agreement to obtain medicines this week following an international procurement procedure .
The clinical test is intended to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who is treated and implemented in a large cloud .
Steary said : &apos; This new extensive intervention should complement and enhance the widespread and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
This is yet another milestone in the struggle for one of the biggest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
Deborah gold , NAT @-@ i Executive , said : &quot; This is a landmark moment in the fight against HIV .
The PrEP , if it is correctly targeted at those who need it and belong to the risk group , is an opportunity to transform the HIV epidemic in the United Kingdom .
Since September , people with a high risk of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool , which is individually managed and dependent on negotiating with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
We warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
The CEO of the Terrence Fund , CEian Green , said : &apos; The priority now is to ensure that the clinical trial should be pushed out swiftly and that none of the members of the HIV risk group are excluded and excluded .
Now that the clinical test of PrEP clinic has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are in danger of being infected with HIV .
Ms Kdgson said : &apos; The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very much delayed following the months of delays and the legalisation of the government .
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to HIV prevention and the non @-@ proliferation of this life @-@ changing infection .
This clinical attempt takes us one step closer to the full understanding of the benefits of the PrEP .
It is now important that the clinical trial be introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people with exposure to HIV , and take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
The cost of electricity rose by 12 % in Estonia , while in Latvia and Lithuania .
In July , the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to EUR 1.94 , compared with EUR 7.71 in June this year .
The main reason for the price differences is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
In Estonia , the price of the electricity centre in Estonia was estimated at 34.33 euro per megawatt hour and the price rose to 12 per cent compared to 12 % .
In Latvia and Lithuania the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt hour .
In Finland , the price was EUR 34.17 and the electricity exchange on the Nord half of the system was 26.37 per megawatt hour .
Prices rose by 12 and seven per cent respectively .
Between Estonia and Finland , electricity intervieted from 75 % last month to Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
The remaining nine per cent between two countries did not attend the next day .
Between Estonia and Latvia , electricity was moved from 99 % from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % had their capacity to use all transmission capacity .
According to the last trading day of July , in the area of Nasdaq , the electricity stock market in August could develop around 34 and September of EUR 37 per megawatt hour .
The price of carbon dioxide prices on electricity prices came up last month and transactions were conducted at 5.04 @-@ 5.47 per tonne .
Living lives - semi @-@ clean and clever designers have transformed this petty Earl &apos;s house to house a flat house .
Joanne Leigh , a former banker who is impassionate about property innovators and exchanged their large Knightsbridge home in 2014 against the Earl .
It is on the first floor of Ms Queen Anne TerTerd , and that Joanne has not sold his bags to the packet and the flat @-@ off , is an honourable statement to a new design .
&quot; Before that , I lived together with a former life @-@ maker in Knightsbridge , &apos; said Joanne .
&quot; I referred to something that would be tantamount to the price that I offered .
I have been shown that the Earls of the Earl were repeated , with the same high waves .
I have done this and I made the same offer on the day . &quot;
Since the first visit , it is 93 @-@ square metres that has passed a complete innovation .
At the beginning it was one sleeping toatre and a complicated star - sleeping sleeping to scun in the sleeping , and Joanne wanted to add a sleeping of storage and quasi @-@ order to take advantage of the high ones .
&quot; I wanted ambitious , big windows , many light .
These were my demands , &apos; he said .
He is asking for the design of Erfan Azadi Notting architecture and designer Duck Duck to take advantage of the 3,8 deserts and to create a home that is not just a development object but a place where the Job could live .
The final thing was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so architecture was a architectural challenge to create a quasi @-@ standing where it could stand .
The exception was to take the form of creativity .
&quot; The Metallconstruction is quite complex , &apos; he will explain .
&quot; We had to reorganise the spaces so that they are based on each other , without being bogged down .
It was not just a platform to build a platform , but we used the steel design so that it is only right to have the upper room for overcrowd . &quot;
This place allowed the Erfanil to create two full stakes with each other , with a great deal of dramatic elements .
In the order of Poland , it will open up in the old age of disgusting or routine &apos;s window of view .
The golden thread furniture , silver detail and retrospective Serge Mouille &apos;s lighting underscore .
The use of mirrors plays a part in the introduction of theatre , space and lighting .
In the short corridor , the mirrors have been added to see that it would seem longer .
In the case of night , I would like to give the impression as the second window of the wool .
In the course of the course , a mirrol report provides a reflection on all the directors and glass boards .
For the whole of life , the opportunity to close part of vegetables will be closed if it is not used , creating an imaginative change of mind .
There is nothing new on the doorstep .
What is unique about this is , however , a unique fact that it is an abiding copy of the popular uprising .
&quot; This has been a little deserving of planning , &apos; clarifies the Erfan &apos;s strength from the despotism of MDF .
&quot; It has a counterweight , which is why it is very simply lectured when it is put off . &apos;
Thanks to the space of space and storage , Joanne is now 16 additional metres , an extra sleeping room and a better flat @-@ up plan .
&quot; After all , the floor is a flown of what you sell - or what gives real value to property &apos; .
&quot; Kinnisasset County &quot; is outdated and makes calculations on the basis of land area area . &quot;
Here they have been able to increase the floor , using high @-@ quality materials which add a luxury to the premises .
&quot; Materials are what you are missing and which will help to create an emotional bond with the home , &apos; says the Erfan .
&quot; You will not be able to live in the guest of electricity .
This is important , but it does not place the heart of the hearts . &quot;
This shows that a good design and increased surface area can do something amazing from a rather normal flat .
In fact , they may even have the potential not to leave , as happened with Joanne .
The main figure is the chicago cloud of Chicago &apos;s mockery , who contests with his counterpart in the name of a desert .
There is no mention of the amount of money that has been earned , unfolding any ethics .
His wife and three children only see a man in the early and late night .
In the first half of the film , I think that this is the version of the &apos; house of Kaardihouse &apos; - even Kevin Spacey and Mr Gerard Butler &apos;s speech is similar .
The film , the little the ecadric element remains , and the humour of film @-@ makers is becoming more and more transparent .
The main experience of life can be attributed to the issue of the main player and the disease .
The choice between working and family life must now be made .
The poinous son makes a father &apos;s feet on the ground to think about really important things such as religion , charity , love ... , not even a twin @-@ blown disaster .
After the third stunt , where the son &apos;s father opens a blind eye , you get the feeling that film @-@ makers are determined to take the baby from the bottom , because even the most prevalent driver is unable to keep a tear in the suffering of the suffering of a minor cancer in the Arctic .
If the pog of the pog falls and his situation seems hopeless , the father will be able to understand once and for all its work a moral gesture and does a charity to the charity .
Now , in a sense , I am convinced - when the film is self @-@ sufficient , I rewarding my misfortune following a film error when I am wrong , then it could at least be praised at least one surprise .
For a moment , there is a suspicion that the iceberg of the ice , when a husband breaks the baby from a hospital and a man is rushing down the corridor by a slow motion .
It is , however , a great shame , and even though her father has lost his job , it is a positive thing , as it is now time to deal with the family .
I can also be well acquainted - I can say the end of the American drama .
In truth , the film is well constructed , all the elements necessary to do so are there .
It is possible to get a button , the actors are good and morality : Money is not the most important thing in life .
It will be well established by surprise .
The new staffing of Trumpi is intended to limit the media consumption of the President .
Others have tried and failed .
Perhaps John F. Kelly will be able to do so .
In this case , it would be the first .
He writes that the White House &apos;s new staff is intended to limit the flow of information coming to President Trumpin , including news , in the hope that it will keep the black offs down .
There is a plague of the reporter of the reporter DawseyLT :
&quot; When the new staff of the White House , John F. John F. Kelly , met his first working day with the senior officials , he pointed out a key problem for President Donald Trumpi Valges , which he intends to resolve in order to bring about poor information in the President &apos;s hands .
Mr Kelly said to officials that the information must be carried out on whether paper or meetings , because the President would make better decisions if you were to share good information . &quot;
The diagnosis seems totally logical , but others have tried to do so , and they have failed to tolerate Trumpi &apos;s winter by monitoring his media consumption .
The relationship between President Trumpi with television goes decades behind decades and now , when he is in the White House , his television viewing habits have not gone away .
&apos;If the candidate Trump was dishonest about the media , he was able to show him that he was also echoed by his publication in the publications &apos; said to Sam Nunberg in February Politicole .
He was told that &apos; six former campaigners say that Trumpi Twitter is the key to managing Twitter , to ensure that his personal media consumption is also stable . &quot;
Well done .
But the idea that the use of Trumpi Twitter has ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
Perhaps those campaigners will know something that the rest of us do not know of being the Trumpi &apos;s spark without their interference even further .
We will probably never be able to know what the Trump did not postal .
If he was able to save the boat or save a couple of times , their efforts were worthy of it .
But no one has been able to prevent Trumpi from constantly producing polemics .
Part of the problem is that , amongst themselves , those in the White House , which are competing with each other , are trying to promote their own interests without giving the Trua the material that supports their world views , but may not always be credible .
For the whole story , Politico wrote in May , advisers of advisers &apos; tense to information which is strategically questionable to the President .
One of the examples that describes the reporter Shane Goldmacher is :
&quot; The current and former Trumpi are saying that Trump can react to negative press releases , particularly to the adverse effects on infants , explosive , by obsessive ways of identifying their source source .
This is the case at the end of February , when someone gave a copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the dog , Charles C. Johnson , to Mr GotNews.com , which blamed the deputies of the Chief of Staff , Katie Walshi , that he was a source of a number of leaflets &apos; .
It does not matter that Johnson has been blocked by Twitter or that he did not offer any specific evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and have withdrawn them .
Read the article and began to call into question Walshi . &quot;
The Goldmacher said that the Head of the Trumpin staff and the head of the White House , Rob Porter , has tried to set up a system for the management and documentation of documents reaching the Trumpin system . &quot;
How did it manage ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
Perhaps he will prove to be a key leader , but the Trump is still impulsive and its helpleits are still in the name of influence .
These changing factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .
Street musicians from abroad will not be able to obtain permission to speak .
There are many foreigners in the middle town of Tallinn living in the centre of Tallinn .

The aim of this clarification was to collect the ticket money on the same day of the night .
On the question of whether , for example , they had an old permit for the inaugural struggle , shake well and Bob his head .
Firstly , we did not know .
Secondly , we will never stay in one town for more than a day or a few , and in most cases , permits will be granted for a period of time or something like that .
There is no point in paying for this , Mr Bob .
When we got around 20 minutes later into the Viru gates , we saw that two women are in musicians and drive them away .
In this context , I will be happy to come to the boss of a cocktail and dogs .
Three Polish young men , one of whom is playing a fifth , the second klarnement and the third was even electronic verges .
&quot; We are here to provide people with entertainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living , &quot; explained the trio of Mivosh for fuel and living .
According to the Mivoshi , they are aware that there must be permission from the urban government to speak .
&quot; Of course we do not have it , he said a joke .
But we hope that if people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
Of course , if the police are to be involved , we will go elsewhere , but try it , he added .
The Estonian bank purchased the euro area in the framework of a public asset shopping programme in the euro area , with a debt of EUR 149 million , the Central Bank bond portfolio increased to € 4.36 billion .
The Central Bank does not publish any more detailed information on purchases .
Hardo Hansson , President of the Bank of Estonia , has previously made it clear in answering all its members that the European system for the assets of the central banks of the Eurosystem included three different purchasing programmes : Bonds covered by the financial sector ( covered by your ) , asset bonds ( ABS ) and public sector bonds ( PSPP ) .
The Central Bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage investors to invest money elsewhere .
The impact of purchases is due to a low risk of asset production and it will motivate investors to take greater risks .
As a rule , in the framework of the public debt shopping programme , each Central Bank buys its government bonds without buying bonds from other countries .
As the Estonian country has not issued its bonds , the Estonian bank is making a so @-@ called replacement rust within the scope allocated to them .
The current purchases are also made by central banks in those countries where the purchase of their purchasing power is limited .
The Estonian bank buys Hansson is generally buying bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds .
The Estonian bank purchases assets under the asset purchases programme from March 2015 .
In the meantime , Elering bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian bank of June 2016 bought no more than Elering bonds .
On behalf of the euro area central banks , both the Central Bank and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds are purchased by the Central Bank .
Migrants ignore their degrees and return to the building blocks of millions of business .
Some of the wealthians of the West Midlands have returned to fierce confrontations with determined migration , who have ignored the autocracy of the Council in winning their way away from their cotton .
The migrants have been parking into their 20 trailer . &quot; Millions of businesses will be able to take refuge in the near vicinity of the Solihan Solihull .
They have returned to the horses of the horses , the children and the lorry , after they got out of it in May , without being distracted by the ditch of the ditch of their invasion .
The activist Group found a weak position in the protected areas by turning their vehicles out of the unthwarted part , which was left to walking .
The people of the Marury are passion for the Solihull Council saying that the Council is &apos; useless to deal with the problem &apos; .
One anonymous person said : &apos; They moved there on Monday evening after they were ousted by Bentley Heathl , where they loved the furths .
The Council must be discredited that they are taking action , because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
The migrants were there in May , they were up and now they were back again .
They had to come to us yesterday evening , probably more so today . &quot;
He added : &quot; Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long @-@ winds to protect their parks .
I live by Roetsbrook , and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay a total tax if the Council does not even be able to stand in such a way .
One local resident who also wanted to be anonymous said : &apos; This is ridiculous : Only we saw how the last of these emigrants were left , and there is already a new offensive .
This time the number has grown , and the grassland is even in the ruminants . &quot;
The representative of the Solihull Council said : &apos; We are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the vicinity of the Roetsbrook route , and we are working together with the Solihull police ; we are taking the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
There is a great deal of help in gathering evidence if as many as possible local residents report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police , by breaching the numbers .
This will help bring a picture to the Court of Justice if we present them . &quot;
The Weextage Festival will also visit the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar , who is delighted that Estonia has been able to bring top world names .
The question of why it is so important for children at the Weekine festival , the Saar is saying that this should be asked of all those who enjoy the full enjoyment of the three days &apos; festival .
What he says is that the real players in the area have come to the fore .
&quot; When you look at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia , it is that the absolute top names of this music geniry are brought home - it is often our queue , he is talking about culture .
What are the festivals on the festival , however , who are most telling me ?
I consider myself to be relatively old , and for some elderly people it is certainly one of the most experienced Armin van Buuren , who stood up yesterday evening .
According to his record , all of us have , at some point in time , complicated &apos; , goes without saying &apos; .
It will , however , mention a number of names , such as Chainur , Deadmau5 , Knifhall .
Of course , our own Estonian players : From NOp P and they can be read in a whole series .
In fact , this well @-@ known concentration of names is very high &apos; , he says .
Watch more on @-@ going video !
Car manufacturers are being hit by criticism in mid @-@ October to 850 000 diesel vehicles .
The day before the Audi announcement , BMW said that it would offer software more than 350 000 vehicles .
BMW &apos;s Chairman said that &apos; there is a more intelligent option than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including BMW &apos;s city of Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will reduce the emissions of diesel engines in Europe for three million people in Europe .
No company described these steps as a revoid .
European car manufacturers have been promoting active use of diesel vehicles in Europe and in the United States to help comply with the regulations imposed on carbon dioxide emissions .
However , nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma .
At the same time , the cost of exhaust equipment emitted by diesel vehicles is increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
While German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of calling the government of Angela Merkel to ignore the power of powerful car manufacturers and to ignore the signs referring to the problem .
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the Volkswagen error who quietly suppressed the use of so @-@ called pedisogic devices which enabled them to adapt emissions to the test of the car by the time of testing , but the numbers were withdrawn from normal driving conditions .
Several Volkswagen are charged in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic inquiry .
Last month , a former president of the department for the development of the Audi module in Germany was arrested .
The former President , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
Earlier this year , Volkswagen , in Germany , was drawn into a criminal investigation when the authorities accused the installation of the system in order to circumvent Europe &apos;s emissions requirements by extending its investigation into an investigation that was previously focused on the United States .
The launch of the prize may be a big blow to Volkswagen , a disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen profits .
The Estonian schools are purchased for EUR 20 000 in the flags of the European Union .
The Ministry of Education is planning to buy the European Union flags to be bought by the Estonian schools by 1 September .
In total , 5,158 cent of the 570 educational institutions of the European Union will be met .
Flags are intended for erroneous indoor spaces , they must be carried out in the quality printing of printed electronic communications with the recognition of the portal &apos;s news portal .
The flag text is the text : &quot; The Estonian schools in Estonia to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , or a single flag will cost EUR 35 .
The murder of the journalist highlights the growing danger of the threat in Mexico
Nweeks of alphe Riodoce workers are usually on Wednesdays to review plans for the most recent spread of the Blue State , which is sown by organised crime , corrupt officers and unceasing drug wars .
Today , however , they are overshadowed by a personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
They are told that it is important to change its routine .
The two old houses are discussing , which seems safer : Either to bring children into office , which was a target of a gigantic attack in 2009 , or leave them home .
The security experts have written a few words to the head of the room : &apos; Enemies , &quot; &quot; neutral , &quot; &quot; allies .
They call on reporters to provide their own evidence without any need for evidence is sufficient impressions and internal emotions .
In the absence of a government or cartels , drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists are being suspected of a whole list of bad people who are hazardous in the elimination of the chaos in Mexico .
There is no breath of violence , and the more the body amasses over the country , the majority of these are journalists , according to the protection Committee for journalists , since President Enrique Pena Nieto have been in office in December 2012 , at least 25 ; 589 journalists have been subjected to death and threats under national protection , and during this year , seven journalists in seven states have been killed so far .
The most recent victims include the editor of their editor , Mr Riodoce co @-@ founder Javier Valdez Cardena .
&quot; The biggest error is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &apos; wrote Valdez one of its many books on drug violence .
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence can be felt everywhere on the Riodoce building , a large picture of the average fingers of Valdezist , together with his &apos; justice &apos; and two 30nant reporters , the Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , a T @-@ särke , which has been depicted by his smillable spectated scorn and his pecuent contributory cybarbarer .
The meeting will take place less than two months after he died , and the Reporters are discussing a common trauma , their nightmare , dreaming , paranoia .
Even though a separate Public prosecution was set up in 2010 to address journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been brought to justice by journalists .
Like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders , the number of which goes to thousands , is also rarely brought to justice by journalists .
Riodoce &apos;s editorial will continue to reflect on the violence in Saloa , although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
Without the data and fairness of the murderers , there will be no benefit from security meetings , according to the Ibarra .
&quot; It is very nice to be wasting his time here , &apos; he says .
&quot; As long as the cause is not known , distrust everyone . &apos;
In Valdez , in the capital of the capital of the capital of the State of the State of State , Culiacis , on 15 May .
He managed to drive only a few quarters before two men , red by the red Toyota Corolla , who was forced to leave the car and shooked 12 times , presumably by the &apos; twelve . &quot;
A armed man went to Valdez car and made an immediate accident .
It was 50 years old .
She left a woman and two adults .
The rumours are circulating freely in Culiacis .
However , on the subject of Mr Valdez , there is basically only silence .
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of the United States in January , there has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country , since rivalries are fighting for a vacuum of power .
It does not matter that on a daily basis , every day a person or several people are left behind or that the dead are dragged down by two @-@ made drug ropes , which are bigger than the homes of many .
Let us forget for a moment that the time for peace implies the only cartel on the sea route with valuable ports and drugs to the United States is only one cartel .
Despite all this and to the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the risks involved in his work , Riodoce co @-@ founder and President Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) of Mr Bojorquez ( 60 ) , that he was unable to protect his friend .
He believes that two mistakes favoured the killing .
The first of these was an interview with Guzman &apos;s son , a cartels , a cartel cartels , Damaso Lopeziga , was published in February .
This piece of mail could insinuate the suspect suspects buying all the copies immediately when they were reached in the newspaper .
The second mistake was that Mr Valdez was not forced to leave his country on his own security after the sweep of the sweep in one of the other languages .
Valdez was legalised both in Mexico and abroad , and his death is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
He had remained so long that his friends and colleagues had assumed that he was permanently available .
He worked in a newspaper in 2003 as a veteresreporter when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce , sold 50 @-@ dollar .
Bojorquez said you were impossible to deal with the &apos; You impossible &apos; , without touching the drug problem . &quot;
A moment of time spent its bolder and honest reports and sales and advertising grew .
In the Reporters &apos; demonstrations , without any fear of fear and reading in the reamour , which they read to read stories that no one else dared to reflect .
Eight years after the establishment of the Riodoce , the journalist won his prize for the prestigious Maria Moors Cabox .
In the same year , the Committee on the Protection of journalists for journalists ( AKK ) won its courage to follow the Mexican drug for whatever it takes .
He admitted openly that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said against the ICC .
Last October , he told Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking was a life @-@ free way of life .
&quot; You have to take up the task that journalists will have a second chance to play .
I do not want to ask me that what I did so much when faced with so many deaths , or why I did not say what is going on . &apos;
Riodoce collections longing on Valdez , a joke who roppered like madness , a friend who dissociated the embryos and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
They supported her routine .
He always conveyed his barrel .
He went to the office in the office of El Neabo Baar and he was always in the same table .
Now they are asking whether his ruinant love became fatal to her .
He has also put them in a position to doubt how to do our job best and keep alive .
&quot; They do not like the rigidity of their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing plagues used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; These things should not have been touched , &apos; said Bojorquez .
The result is even strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ sustaining in the best times .
Trengthening their instincts .
When it comes to fragrance , you will stay away .
According to Mr Andres Villarreali , the problem is that &apos; fragrance can be deceived ... and this is the case with Javieri .
He and others say that the aloas is no longer the old rules , just as they do not apply in the Tamaulisis , Veracruzis , Guerreros or other states which are home to the smuggling routes , the weaknesses of weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
The landscape is constantly changing .
In a room where Riodoce workers got together for security training , mobile phones were no longer able to allow mobile phones ; a few days prior to that , it was revealed that only the paints used by the governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
For the house , two policemen overshadow the bullet of a 40 @-@ degree bullet in front of the house .
The government has set up a more painful Riodoce office , which is located in the four regular buildings of Culiacan in the middle neighbourhoods .
Some reporters thought semi @-@ joke about whether these police officers are among the 50 per cent of police officers who have been distrusted by their governors .
Several months have passed since reporters have been travelling to mountain areas , where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gangs .
Riodoce this week &apos;s edition dealt with three main issues .
One of them was the assassination of the former poxo legar Julio Cesar Chavez .
In addition , they had a revealing story of the spending of government money on the town of the Governor &apos;s office .
One of the most expensive groups of restaurants from the cabinet of the Prosecutor &apos;s office from one of the most expensive restaurants from the restaurant .
There was no formal announcement of who was robbed or how it happened , so it was necessary to be cautious when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows of the restaurant , both as regards drug traffickers and the authorities .
The Reporter was informed from the public that a star has been registered to a politician who belongs to a ruling party of the ruling Institutional Institutionary Party ( IRP ) , which dominated all policy levels over the last century .
In recent times , several IRPs have been accused of widespread coverage of corruption in the framework of court cases .
On the Villarline , a reporter asked a reporter to sign previous incidents in the same place , including the way in which the slogan of the designer , El zman , shouting the slogan &apos; El man &apos; .
Only a few months earlier , readers would have sought a copy of Valdez to obtain information on kidnappings from the best sources .
Earlier we would have known what happened , &apos; said the 46 @-@ year @-@ old village of Vilsen , who had been depicted to him by the &apos; El Flaco &apos; .
&quot; Now all communication channels have broken up with our sources . &quot;
The Valdez office has been able to keep their homes and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the effect of active staff has become something they never expected to expect in the name of the prestigious campaigner .
Reporter Miriam Ramirez seized a couple of bridges and directions to the local Prosecutor &apos;s office next morning for another journalist .
In the west of Michoacan in the west of Michoacan , three days after the killing of Valdez .
It has been found as a body of death and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
Journalists have changed all over the country , and are crippling the words &apos; SOS press &apos; as a form of organised protest .
On this day , the President of Bojorquez will be in Washington by trying to collect international support for the restoration of justice in Valdez .
The day after the death of Mr Valdez &apos;s death in front @-@ of @-@ court cases , it accused the Ramirez authorities for journalists and their killing because of the truth .
After that , he asked him to shift government action away from elsewhere , worried that anger has influenced the objectivity .
The Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are in favour of organised crime , co @-@ guilty national officials and indifferent societies .
In his latest book &apos; drugs &apos; , he wrote that reporters not only kill drugs , but it is also done by the orders of politicians and security forces who are involved in criminal activities .
The media monitoring group Articulo 19 gave more than half of journalists &apos; assaults on police and civil servants .
&apos;You in Mexico , because you want to keep quiet , &apos; said Ramirez .
There is obviously a bloody record of the effects of the murders .
Nobody will forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulisis six years ago .
He was found in a body with a letter that had probably been signed by a cartel in Zeta : &apos; I am here for my reports about the reports &apos; .
In addition to his landless head , computer jumour and headphones .
Some of the publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the northern frontier of El Norte in the northern crossing of Chihuahuas , after their correspondents in the Boperh Buseh in March .
Others will continue to do so , as did the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the killing of their President in 2004 .
In 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez narcotelle openly presented the front &apos; Mida you want ? &apos;
Some journalists have fled from their homes or even from the country .
This is a nerve decision .
It is difficult to find a job in the Eaks , and they still have to keep on the streets in order to prevent the risks .
Sometimes they are being hunted , as is perhaps the case with Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered together with four women &apos;s people in 2015 , three months after Veracruz .
Those who remain stagnating and continuing to work must take the lead every day around the risky decisions .
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , recognises that it is frightening the drug business .
&quot; Mexico is on the way to hell , and that is why I said &apos; he said .
One of the recent Friday midnight , when the most recent number had already been sounding , Riodoce &apos;s editorial office and sounded a beer when everyone suddenly started to locate their telephony .
In the town of Rannaverse in Mazatlani , 19 people were killed by rival gangs and security forces .
The war continued , as promised by several of the missing messages of the cartels found in the region .
On the same lines , reporters using Riodoce websites using a mobile phone .
In the next day of the day , change was needed .
The scenes overlooked another fire in the region .
Mr Bojorquez was elected by policemen to see whether they are vigilant .
If they were afraid , they did not show it at least .
In the massive portfolio of the post @-@ founder , which has his average fingers to see the whole of the blue , edyed Riodoce workers in his footsteps .
&quot; How can one think at all , &apos; said Bojorquez , &apos; when , on the same day that Javier killed , asked the trainee to report on his report ? &apos;
Dinosaurus used protection colours to avoid enemies of enemies
At first sight , it seems like a form , albeit quite frightening .
Scientists have now unveiled the first inventions with regard to the unbelievable size of the unbelievable size of the Canadian mine , which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as &apos; the entry of the &apos; dinosaurlian Mona &apos; .
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered by his mightmare was the colour of red Brown and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
The reporter report on the basis of the reports published by the Biology , described as &quot; the most well preserved gender @-@ based dinosaur that has ever been found &apos; and when one of the best dinosaurists in the world . &quot;
In the case of Ffossil , this is a new noddop that lived in the middle of the noiqué , the 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
It is incredibly good to keep the trakers who describe it as &apos; really significant &apos; .
It is a vegetarian feed covered by these meals , according to the National Geocial data , the most well preserved fossils of this type , which has ever been found .
On 21 March 2011 , Mr Kewn Funk , when he mined a Suncor Millenium mine in a factory near Murray near the Northern Alberta in Canada .
He has struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to examine it .
On the site , Royal Tyrrell was sent a museum of Hyrrell .
For the next six years , it was designed to extract an animal from 2 to 100 ( 1 100 @-@ km ) .
After all this hard work , the final result is now finally ready to bring the public ahead .
&quot; If some eyes are torn , he may believe that he sleep , &apos; said the leading author Caleb Brown , a researcher , Royal Tyrrell , in a museum where you are being lost .
&quot; This will go down in history as one of the most beautiful and the most absorptive dinosaurissis , a dinosaur Mona . &quot;
He also found out in a briefing that it was realised that it was realised by a beekeeper who is covered by somours and reminiscent tanks , potentially causing a significant risk to meat @-@ intensive dinosaurs .
This abundant particulance used red red and white colours to hide up for predators , and applied shadowry techniques , which are referred to as &apos; overshadow &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
This allowed experts , according to experts , to be better able to escape the environment and prevent enemies , as the major dinosaurs were likely to hunt to him .
It was the first time that a family belonging to a well @-@ owned family of 110 million a year ago reached news in the news in May and is now visiting Royal Tyrrell in a cology museum .
The information has now been investigated by the science and gave it a marker of a Marxist Museum in the Museen Museum , who belonged to a team which spent more than 7000 hours to reveal the painting of the painting .
Thanks to the astonishing good of the father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists was able to documentary the shape and size of gender .
They found a disapprehension - a common method of protection in animal species , which means that the presence of being on the side was a dark dam than the bottom .
Although the overshadow is widespread , inventions come as a surprise , as Borealopelta is much greater than those of today &apos;s overshadow animals .
It suggests that the dinosaur hunts were actively used by other meat @-@ owners that the evolution favoured the abandonment of the survivors instead of the reverse .
But most of the animals used for today &apos;s overshadote - such as fears , bricks or codails - are much smaller as an island , and the more vulnerable , which suggests that redose had to really make a real effort to survive .
&quot; The vigorous hunt of a vast , abundant , abundant stark of a huge and abundant size , shows the danger of being robbed by dangerous swathes of the age &apos; said Brown &apos; .
The chemical analysis of fine organic compounds also revealed that the dinosaur snow was a red tall .
Scientists will continue to research in order to get hotlines about this life , including the content of this salinthetic stine , in order to find out what the animal would call its last age .
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river , thereby powerless into the sea , where he sunk into the ocean in front of it .
At the time , the same soya was as warm as it is today in the south of the South and the rivers and oceans are likely to go much further than they are today .
&quot; This noddy is truly remarkable , as he has covered a fully covered gender @-@ based skin , while it has remained three @-@ dimensional , while preserving the original form , &apos; Brown .
&quot; As a result , the animal is now seen almost the same as in the age of disagreements .
In order to reconstruct it , there is not a great deal of imagination to use - it is enough simply to preach eye and that it seems to be sleeping . &apos;
The crisis in the Crimean was a time when vast two @-@ legths of meat from meat are movements on the ground .
Although the Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions years later than Borealopelta , this bean @-@ owned dinosaur could hunt some of his horrendous predecessors .
These include Acrocanthothurus , 38 legs ( 11.5 metres ) and six tonnes of weight .
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in Biia Biology believe that Borealopelta drowned after death in the sea , and this mumification is muted .
In the precursors of 21 March 2011 in Shawn , if he extracted a Millenium mine in the steel of McMurray in the Northern Alberta in Canada .
According to the museum , it is best preserved in the world , including leather and sombean , and it is a complete concentration to a standstill .
These were on average 18 legs ( five metres ) long and twelve pounds up to GBP 3 000 ( 1300 kg ) .
Two 20 pieces of customs were celebrated on this subject .
Scientists believe that this soya is covered by vegetation and snow through the current Western Canada , as long as the river is flooded into its open sea .
However , the place of the dinosaur in the sea has helped to maintain its somours in detail in detail .
The remnants of this particular father have been so well preserved that the mysterious swathes of mysterious songs are still covered by leats .
As Mr Greshko magazas National Geographer wrote , &apos; such continuity is as rare as a token victory .
The more I look at it , the more incredible it seems .
The remnants of skin skin are still covered by mysterious machinations of noise .
It is better to put his foot in front of him , and five are rushed upwards .
It is possible for me to count on the stakes . &quot;
How did one activist find out the answer to the question &apos; who is today ? &apos;
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell got a full shock .
Just a day after the travel of New York , this St. Louis , through a temporary flight , through a rented totality , a site on the phone .
He got on top of her former school of compassion .
There was a letter : &apos; The police killed just 18 years of adolescence and he is still sleeping on the street .
He was confused as to why nobody else had posted this information , which is why he closed a Facebook and opened Twitter .
The Pidemega @ TheePeviah user postal was repeatedly shared on his line .
In real time , Michael Brown , a region of St. Louis , was handed down to the death of a young , 18 @-@ year @-@ old black @-@ year black young man , killed by a white police officer in Ferguson .
He comprised a picture of the body of Brown &apos;s life , which was found in the street , remaining four hours .
&quot; This is madness , &apos; thoughts in the jargon .
But death was not something new for his or her community .
He put his phone off , but he re @-@ visited the flax later this night , which reported on the gathering of people at Canfield Drive .
The photographs were photographed by the police and the shouting people and the man who claimed to be the father of Brown &apos;s father and kept the label &apos; Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son ! &apos;
He watched a webstream in which a policeman stood in front of the group of protestors .
In a second video in the video , a second police officer , says &apos; sguns and shellness &apos; : &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
The Ferarm reminds us of how he thought of his mind : &apos; It is extraordinary . &apos;
&apos;This is not the kind of homicide that we are used to and which we could describe as typical . &apos;
I have been alarmed at this moment .
I was outraged and said &apos; .
He booked his flight flight and he went home the next day .
After 23 May , he went to her father for her six @-@ year daughter and decided that they would be travelling to the Ferguson in the next morning .
What took place with Ferrell and Fergusoner in the next three years , is the central theme of the new documentary &apos; Whose strike &apos; ( &apos; whose street ? &apos; ) , which comes on top of the cinema on 11 August .
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who met the answers by demanding their answers .
When Mrs Total was with a daughter - who had a flowing sticker with a proper chromium , a Ferguson , they were once again talking about what they had been talking about before this morning - the experience of black experience and living conditions .
&quot; Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; Recalls it in a question .
&quot; We are currently driving Ferguson because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and is not the right thing to do .
&quot; I was not able to take him up , &apos; said Ferreira later .
&quot; What is happening now is the culmination of what happened in the past .
It must know that and see it and grow in the middle .
He must learn about the organisation and organisation of a activist and , at the same time , to know the different layers of experience and living conditions of black sentiles and what we need to do to free ourselves and to free themselves .
Even if I manage to grow him in such a way that he does not coarise personally with blatant racism , he will not be taken from another black girl from a black girl .
I feel I would be doing him a disservice if I defended him on this world . &quot;
The first suspension that they made on the strength of Ferguson was the South Osseissanti , a police station that had become a kind of laissez @-@ faire , where activists were awaiting news of the police officer , Darren Wilson , who was not finally charged with the blame .
There was a link between Ferreira and her daughter with the local business owners who prepared the lunch .
They put the food bag together and helped to distribute them to the protestors .
For the Ferrell , a new type of activist is slowly taking shape .
&quot; My activist became fully changed after 9 August , &apos; he said , pointing out that when he had been Missouri @-@ St. Louis University , he was the President of the European Union for low achievers and focused on social justice and health inequalities in minority communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organising it .
This is all just a laissez . &apos;
Nweeks later met with a statement by the co @-@ Mayor of a co @-@ film , a co @-@ director of a co @-@ film , Sabaah Folah .
Mr Folay said that he and the film operator , Mr Alvarado @-@ Farrar , wanted simply to document what is going on .
The question of the name of the Ferrell : &apos; Do you try to document or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
Such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often painful - come to the community and try to reap the benefits of this sample and resistance .
Folayan explained in a recent interview : &apos; We had heard that the voice of the people who were born and increased in Ferguson will not be heard and we wanted to do it differently . &apos;
The Folayan was already grieving his hands with his co @-@ author Damon Davis , a region with an artist , known as the prisoners sentenced to death row .
His involvement has made the project a captured Ferrell and a further six other local people who have been tracked by the film Whose street , following the fire of Brown .
&quot; In this documentary , nobody talks with us and with us , we are talking to us , &apos; said Davis .
&quot; For me , it was important to see how these people are portrayed , as I am also portrayed . &apos;
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of the Ferrell - to show that the movement is not a &apos; head of the redemption , but a community colluding , &quot; as Mr Foma said - becoming the most open player in the film .
As a result , &apos; Whose street &apos; , &apos; surprisingly personal aspects of the life of Ferrell , such as ruthless and married marriage .
&quot; I knew , as I would have said , &apos; You said , laughing at the first time that he was prepared to see the city of the city .
&quot; But I realised that there must be a degree of vulnerability to the human trafficking of those who are engaged in this work and the black population .
Moreover , the respect of the Ferrelli story and reputs the role of the black female minority in the wider deployment of Mr Matter .
Two of the three initiators who thought black in the social media in 2012 following the killing of a teenage teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , are homosexual .
&quot; Female homosexuals in the lead role role in general have maintained the move , &apos; said Ferrell , &apos; and this is precisely because we need to constantly fight on many fronts .
The Roma women who are the victims of the Roma must bear the full burden . &quot;
The Folayan has agreed that &apos; movement does indeed keep alive women and many of them are black women on black grounds .
He states , however , that &apos; this is not a kind of kind of creation of equal opportunities &apos; - Ferrell was not chosen as a central point of his identity .
&quot; He was a man to take the right energy , &apos; he said .
&quot; But this is no coincidence that he was directly at the front line , because the black female sexual female woman is much at stake when they live .
His energy can be perceived in the screen . &quot;
At the same time , the news cameras with Ferguson has long disappeared , but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile .
The suspended sentence handed down for blocking the road for blocking the road for a further 2.5 years .
He describes the social policy atmosphere in a region which he calls home simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
Nevertheless , he still considers it important mantra which he has eating memory since the time he took to the Ferguson street three years ago .
&quot; It is our duty to fight for our freedom .
It is our duty to win .
We need to love and support each other .
We have nothing to lose apart from our chains . &quot;
7 list of how to overcome the poet boys after Weekore
Some stubborn men will find a snapshot , although they woke up , as well as help .
Or the &apos; avoided &apos; pot &apos;s pot , break the wool . &quot;
But it is only a sine qua non for urgent delays and health .
What can you do so that after today &apos;s and tomorrow &apos;s Weexmy trend - or anything else - to feel better in the morning and get the bog in the most painful way possible ?
Joo waters .
It was under the name of the Alps , after a great deal of the morning ... or , if possible , even alcohol .
As a body loses a great deal of liquid in alcohol consumption , it must be restored in any way .
Together with water , minerals and funces are good drinking water .
Since there is often a lot of irritation as a result of a tight summer , it is particularly good if the soil is free of the soil , or it is easy .
To walk .
It would certainly not be paid to a pot to the pot , but it could be a fatal wrong decision .
But an easy walk helps remind the body once again of what it is like to be .
The mapping of Telg and sleeping sleeping is a more time @-@ consuming way of becoming more healthy .
It is with little sense that you are slowly and carefully treated .
If you are going to get over the top of yesterday &apos;s overdrink , it is certainly not worth trying to charge a large fat .
For example , a refreshant in which the tree of disability is silent on the markets .
If the health of the South is already suffering , one could try to get the wedding , for example .
And a bit later , it is already unclear .
There was no time limit .
This direar is releasing the body from the wool .
As has been said , the water and the volume are friends .
My contribution to the painkillers .
If you take the painkiller at night to prevent the boget , you have to take charge of not only alcohol but also parking or ibuprophenk .
So the riches all the extra , and in future , the boys are worse off .
In addition , the analgesics of analgesics will not be in place for long .
If you take the painkiller in the morning , you will do it with empty hot air - it annoys your rubbish of rubbish .
Or if the partner is not to be taken , you will be able to do it well .
It is around the same as walking , but when you walk , you cannot get a heap .
However , at times of too active speed and exorbitant pot , the boast should be moderate .
Make a joke .
The fool of friends of friends , the easy tobeo and sera friendly , both for themselves and for the other ( suffering ) .
The joke and the laugher may not confuse the poker , but they are certainly the result of a laissez @-@ faire .
For once , the pohmell goes anyway !
The Professor of the Northwest of Gdańsk and the workers of the University of Oxford are being hunted behind as suspect .
According to the police , Professor of Professor at the University of Northwest of Northwest and the workers of Oxford , who have become the body of death of a lethal of death for death @-@ seekers .
According to the Cook counsel of Cook , an arrest warrant without any chance of arrest , was issued on Monday to arrest a 42 @-@ year @-@ old Woodham Lathemi and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni arrested on the grounds of the first @-@ instance assassination due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell @-@ Duranleau .
According to documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Duranleu died after repeated pits .
According to the warning , which was issued by the police community in Chicago , a body of death was discovered on 27 July .
The police received a phone call and found the victim of the Plaza Corterhouse and the victim of a victim whose body had several storm bodies .
According to officials , Cornell @-@ Duranleau was recognised to death and investigators will be treated as murder , while the police are actively seeking two suspicions .
Ms Lay has been working since 2007 as a co @-@ professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of 2007 .
Vice @-@ President of the University of University , Alan K. Cubbage , said in a statement sent by e @-@ publishing that he has been temporarily removed from the workplace and is forbidden to enter the town of the University of Lapland .
&quot; This is now a criminal matter to be investigated by the competent authorities , and the University of Northwest Mestern is working with the investigations , &quot; said Cubbage .
Warren is a senior assistant at the University of Oxford .
A statement from the University and the Somerville College , said in the e @-@ mail statement : &apos; We have been in contact with the British police and ready to help the US research authorities in every possible way .
In addition , the statement stated that Warreni colleagues are shocked and willing to extradite himself .
Mr Anthony Guglielm , President of the province of Chiice , urges the authorities to give up to the authorities on suspicion .
&quot; The police has a flavour where they are , but we are working increasingly intensively in defining the exact location , &quot; said Guglielmi .
According to the Guglielm , suspects are helped to seek the foundations of both local , regional and national authorities .
The Guglielm said that the police received a phone call from the Mayor of the Plaza flat house , who had become just a chcrypic allusion that there was something happening .
According to the police , this was a magic spectacle .
The Guglielm report is not clear whether the event itself was also held on 27 July .
He said that the security cameras confirm the presence of Lathemi and Warreni .
&quot; We believe that Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship , &apos; added Guglielmi .
The management of the Grand Plaza sent a letter to the people : &apos; The police is currently working on the identification of the events and the background of the victim , including the possibility of family custody . &quot;
Dual companies which help you to avoid the next new Ubine
Amy Errett wished to measure the satisfaction of their e @-@ trade start @-@ ups , but the polls were futile .
The answers were often vague , useless or , even worse , misleading .
And even though he promised to ensure anonymity , some employees did not trust this process .
&quot; This system was simply not consistent and objective , &apos; said Errett , who is leading to the presence of the e @-@ Commerce company , the e @-@ Commerce company , which sells the sales of 75 workers .
Thus , it called on non @-@ relief .
A new type of human resources start @-@ ups that help businesses to find out what their employees feel .
By developing and licensing the software , which is determined to measure the involvement of employees , enables them to perform a &quot; voice polls &quot; to target specific crews and demographic groups , to provide anonymity for employees and a hotline for complaints , and in some cases allow empowering operators to bypass the heads of the C level and turn directly to the Bureau .
&quot; There is now tools such as Strab and Fitbit , designed to monitor health , but where is Fitbit for your business ? &apos; Asked Mr Barnett , the co @-@ founder and CEO of the City of Kashwood , whose software tool is used by companies to measure the involvement of employees .
According to Ms retretti , he has been able to have a better overview of what the workers think and feel .
In addition to the ad hoc and targeted crews , it provides a company &apos;s heat card which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and where drivers have the lowest level of support , allowing them to identify the causes .
Companies have begun to realise that they have to keep up with their work culture so as not to become Ubiting , which has been rioting in scandals since the former worker released a blog describing a harassing a environment that punished those who dared to speak .
For start @-@ ups such as Glint , the desire to have an overview is an opportunity for business .
The global area of governance , regulation and conformity can be more than $ 15.7 billion in funding for the period from Let 2020 , according to the financial transaction statistics website .
In Denveris Colorados , a start @-@ up firm to help businesses prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , this year saw an increase in the interest and activity of Ubrickably .
It has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
The Uber registered itself recently as a customer .
As with the Gtown , the interceptive companies are allowing for tailor @-@ made impulses , to collect confidential confidential answers and to look at the problem areas of insulation .
It also provides anonymous messages that allow employees to know their inappropriate behaviour .
And as far as the executive director is concerned , complaints go straight to the Bureau .
&quot; Public opinion is self @-@ regulatory authorities , &quot; said Patrick Quinlan , founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan .
Mr Quinlan said that if it is found that a company treats its workers badly or behavely , the company may face serious consequences , such as the withdrawal of workers and court cases , even when the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ruby , a restaurant of restaurants with more than 25 000 employees at 500 operating places used more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to provide a simple way of interaction with the headquarters .
If the worker wanted to report the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone phone phone number or a email address , to submit a formal complaint and to hope that it will be taken seriously .
This was a often daunting and inconvenient process , Ruby used a general adviser , James Vitrano , who said that there was no good way to monitor the complaints of workers .
However , now that a company uses a census , problems such as discrimination , harassment or dishonest wage practices , which did not reach the lead in other cities or in state offices , to identify and deal with them .
&quot; It is possible for me to get closer to workers &apos; holh 360 degrees , &quot; said Vitrano , who leads the Ruby &apos;s group of risk management .
&quot; And we defend our shareholders from court disputes . &quot;
Mr Quinlan said that companies began ethical behaviour , values and workers &apos; involvement to take much more seriously back in 2002 , after the auditor of the auditor of the auditor &apos;s company , Mr Arthur Andersen , in relation to the Enron scandal .
However , only when &apos; social media &apos; became cooking , companies understood that they could not prevent their black washing from publicly disguising the web .
&quot; Before using the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used the hope , &apos; said .
Both the Glint and the affiliated services offer their software as a service by taking a periodic period for the use of their products .
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors , who have been supported by both start @-@ ups .
In February , a sum of 10 million dollars was funded by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Customs , thereby increasing the value of capital collected at USD 47 million .
In Glint , in November , USD 10 million were invested in Bessemer Ventures , increasing the total financing of the company to 60 million dollars .
Such investments do not come as a surprise when taking into account the interdependence of businesses , culture and venture capital .
An increasing number of studies show that modern workers are expecting more jobs than they have done in the past .
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high wages and interesting projects are mere desks .
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; If people are happy , they are being listened to and that the work they are doing is gratifying , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &apos; said Nina McQueen , who is a universal beneficiary and a Vice @-@ President of the team , LinkedInis , Vice @-@ President of the team , who uses both the censor and the Glinti .
Investors are making profits when their portfolio companies are doing well ; businesses are doing well when the workers are committed and involved .
If the third party analytical tool allows the commitment and involvement of the workers , we do not think that these will be supported .
The inclusion of data on the inclusion of employees is important , according to the professionals of work .
But these data have been useless if the successors of the company do nothing about them .
In fact , if a company asks its employees to hear feedback , expectations expect changes .
And if change does not happen quickly or at all , it can cause frustration and reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; If you ask the 4 000 proposals , you need to be ready for 4 000 conversations , &apos; said International President Russell Raath , who has seen how companies are making the mistake of relying too much on data collection .
&quot; Because if things are not running until the end , the workers are wondering : &apos; Did you really listen to me ?
Do you care ?
And if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
According to the Erretti , the Madison Reeel , which is now organising six studies among workers , it was possible to implement measures on the same day that the problem has been reported via the Glinti .
And after the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , he was able to reorganise a number of teams in the company and to provide communication training to deal with the problems .
However , from a point of view , new data on workers will be collected and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will result in a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in the industry , which is well known for its large workforce .
&quot; If you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose the people , &apos; said Vitrano .
&quot; And if you lose the people , you will lose your customers .
And if you lose your customers , you will lose the companies . &quot;
The remaining star stars in the euro area are the Baltic : Incomes grow rapidly
Although the crisis in 2008 and the trade challenges with Russia have impacted to the Baltic , three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe , writes Banimal berg with reference to the European Central Bank report .
According to the Central Bank , since 1999 the total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania exceeded the expectations .
There is a low debt burden behind success , fast @-@ looking institutions and a business @-@ friendly policy .
&quot; The Baltic States in one of the countries of the euro area is among the few countries in the euro area where there is a significant convergence of its GDP per capita , the Central Bank reported .
Although the aim is for the economy to become more equal to a richer Western Europe , in 2015 the total production of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2 / 3 15 of the national average , which belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement rounds .
Low wages have led the Balts to seek better wages abroad .
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic in a positive light , and the economy is also growing this year , local residents are not enthusiastic at all .
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only one quarter of the inhabitants of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies are doing very well or rather well .
In the Czech Republic and Poland , some less than half of the countries surveyed on their lands .
The NCAA decision to cancel two times a day is changing the Bruinsi Days long
It is almost 23 , when a team of FCLA football club is stopped to talk to a team in a new habitual exercise in the University of Paris .
Some of them have been burdened by their company , revealing their coaches at the first day of the strike .
For a large part of the team , these gangs will provide a midday pathos .
The participants who take part in the course of the cucumbers will be going to learn to learn for the common living in the next morning , before returning next morning to 6.30 meetings in football .
&quot; The next three days will be a real challenge for them , &apos; said Bruinsi strikes to Jim Mora a little before the Monday became a Tuesday .
The NCAA decision to cancel two times a day to reduce the burden of players , they have actually changed their days - at least until the end of the final examinations on Friday .
For this reason , UCLA was the first step @-@ up call at 7.15 to fit themselves into the already tight schedule of players .
The transition from two to a half a day means more than one trend - the beginning of the Bruinsi training camp increased nearly a week ago and , for the first time in a period of Mora six Westwin season , there will be training at a time of summer .
They will have 18 trends up to 20 August , before the formal preparations for the launch of the &quot; opening @-@ up &quot; Games in Texas A &amp; M .
According to Mora , he is in favour of changing the NCAA rules , even though it adds another item to the players &apos; intensive schedule .
&quot; These have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge , &apos; Mora said .
&quot; And they break themselves from this challenge ; they are making an effort , they are wonderful young people .
I believe that when the day comes on the table and we have more time , it is really fun . &apos;
Once the camp has been closed , UCLA will shut down , which is no easy task , given the clear view of their outstandable parking circus and the fallout from the Luskin Centre , a higher @-@ class hole which has already got through the gates &apos; wave of protection from the gates .
Since that weekend , the players playing a hotel in the hotel , but Mora admitted that problems could arise over time for free tobacco .
&quot; We use security measures , &quot; Mora said .
&quot; This is a real concern and it is not at all excessive to think that people can rent a dozen and coaches .
If you have a record of a record , it can do quite a good deal .
But we are using a security team in there and 8 parking .
We will do our best by using the best .
I will try to be very concerned about this .
We have a plan in place . &quot;
A Central electoral union , born as Sastaare @-@ Ivanova , a party from the party , Mr Christiina Ojuland , as a result of the ECB , to be forced to join the Other and the ECB , to be forced to show the Association of Ocolomen from the ballot box in party politics , seems to be at least as much as political parties .
However , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key will be whether they are sufficiently disappointed by the voters .
Who will stay with the Saberian ?
If it is reduced to a group of supporters of Edgar Saduare , he may be anticipating the events organised by his election union .
One member of the country , some former and current central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
And is there any reason why , in Tallinn , some of the faithful faiths and warfare are being held away from the fact that the &apos; Saduare list &apos; , led by the corruption and corruption factors , is becoming a reality ?
The celebrator of the film @-@ cat hanging to the Russian poem , in which the Mayor of the Child is taking part of the older part of the city ; and in every respect , the pridimentary computer game , in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas will have to avoid fomit and orphan , whether in this way the Central Party is trying , for the first time , to the votes on the electoral boxes - and the votes of the 1717 voters ?
We look forward to the understanding of political parties about the youth campaign .
If a black 2 or TV3 viewer will watch a black new from the beginning of August , two options will be left : To accept that henceforth only ETV , ETV2 , ETV , TV TV and the English @-@ language language from 24 to 24 .
There will probably also be those who publicly rejoiced publicly about advertising free television , but at the end of the day - albeit reluctantly - paying the price for television and advertisements .
The high @-@ profile music , the rubble people and the rubbish rubbish , are confronted with the unpleasant side of the music festival .
However , if you do not want to be part of a meagre , it is worth keeping home at home instead of painting - and sleep spang in the Festival .
Washington turns the rules of the green card
Media publications are cited by President Trumpi , who said that a new US immigration plan will be planned , which will change the rules of the green card .
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants for 50 000 people per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family orientation .
The new rules have been proposed by the Republican and the President supports them .
The draft regulation will be discussed in the two houses of the Congress .
&quot; This law reduces poverty , increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , as it is changing the way in which citizens from other countries are issuing green cards to citizens of the US .
The law reduces the migration of the chain and will replace the current programme .
The new application process gives priority to the candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economies , &quot; said Trump said , &quot; said Trump said .
Siberian young people move to a town , pensioners back to the land .
Jevseev Anahad continues to be a glorious tradition of the famous Maana river .
He is working as a home of 140 kilometres from Maana tributaries as the gold driver of the gold .
It is a harsh piece of work : Two months without rest 12 hours of work and only ten days back home and back again .
In the three years commissioned , the Anatolst has seen only one occasion .
&quot; There is a resounding order : There will be a thorough check that the lion would not lead , and it goes out that the culmination does not take the lead &apos; .
Mare Piho , in Haida village , a local tie to Jaan , who has spoken to him many times about the memory of his family in Siberia .
The still shourite culture of Siberian bricks will also affect home mushrooms , because it is simply so fearing , considers the most detailed studies of Piho Mare .
Her first visit to Siberia will take place this year for 30 years .
During that time he has been there 14 times and has lived there for one year .
How much did the Siberia emigrated at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here ?
That is the unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8000 .
I have calculated this on the basis of the rumours of Siberian men who have also thought about it .
It is very difficult to say , because at that time one group could reach up to 30 people , but the passport was issued only to a man .
The passport was granted only one , but had children , sisters and leagues .
Look at how much of this territory was here !
It was several times the historical Setomaan .
That was what we need to educate , in some way .
Setos came here as peasants , but their life changed , because they got into areas that did not just relate to agriculture but also to river ( palking parking ) , gold mines , industry .
For example , in New Petserh , many sefed later to work in the town of Krasnojarsk @-@ 45 ( in the construction of Soviet power in the uranium enrichment plant - Mr P. ) , when it was formed .
Was it the majority of the population in the region at that time ?
Yes , they lived in a Compact .
In addition , it retained a long tradition of marriage and a great child .
The seven @-@ eight children were common .
How much of a Siberian culture was different and different from that of the mother land ?
They are different , although what was said was never the same thing there .
They brought a great deal of pacification .
They also did their own ( &apos; popular ideas &apos; ) , but they always made a difference that had been brought about and what was done here .
Climate change has a strong impact on the traditional rice of the pig , because it is colder .
The amendments have changed .
For example , Setomaal meat was warm , but here it was simply frozen .
Where are the villages of Siberian bath and living there ? / graphics : Alari Paluends
The bond with the mother has been mentally strong , which was considered to be very important .
It seems to me that now it will start to get the land back there .
The girls who have lived in family families have been hearing amazing stories .
A delegation from the Estonian Setode delegation who , at the beginning of July , came to Haida &apos;s village of the Kingdom and lived in the four @-@ day homes , Mr J. P .
What is still here , it is shocking .
&quot; It is very easy for you to come and go on , because the city is an excellent location : The hub of the hub and the crossing of roads &apos; , Tapkfully comes from the father of Reigo Tamm .
The city is no longer just a military capital , we have a great deal of hope , sport and cultural places , and the petty can every nightmare .
Tapa is the tip of the pond .
There is a small island in the Linna @-@ running River , where the thugs used are to be held .
&quot; This beautiful place does not seem to be &apos; , the Muheheb Reigo .
Who is not afraid of cold water , it is flooding in the river , as the river is full of resources .
I have been floating there , you can do it !
The river of the river can be streamed and easy to do the romantics - the flow of the river will be able to look into it and think about life .
I have been there myself , too , to walk .
Ooperfather Tamm is not only the beacon of the river with three bridges : &apos; This place is in the city , no one may come to grips when their stories are &apos; .
&quot; There is a magic view of the &apos; Männikup &apos; , but there are also wholesalers where you can drink , to skis , and today , for example , the golf golf - a golf course has been done , the hereants can lend to sports &apos; , the Reigns Reigo .
The old processors are , of course , travelling with their bodies , but I have not yet reached it .
Obviously Mr Rasmus Goll Tapa must be called , because he has experienced the design of a photographs and he has a chain .
Perhaps it lends me !
In the case of the Reigo and Männikup , the current operatives were inseparable .
At least a few hours .
There is a lot of tears , frustration and rest of my sporting life .
Not to mention the shatteings and the smelves .
&quot; The whole centre is now full of construction works , all this becomes unknown , &quot; applauds Reigo .
However , the Tapa old and tired building house is a very attractive place in which you are playing summer discoveries .
I am pleased that , in 2012 , R.A.A.A.M &apos;s leader , noting my idea in Meo Meo .
Although the time for the theatrical theatre of the theatrici Karenin , 11 August is the &quot; Elswack &quot; on 11 August , when the old building is moved around in the 1980s .
&quot; 11 @-@ 13 August is the town of Tapa , which has waged the open house of the wane building house , and there will be ritual cultural events , including a popular asset &apos; , speaks Reigo , who recommends visiting a city of 91year in particular .
By means of a pawn house on 1 May , the museum is already 1994 .
&quot; The house is small , but there is a great deal of pond and information enormously &apos; , applauds the Reigo that is full of the history of the city of Tapa , the majority of which is concentrated on rail and war .
The fatigue is that , if the Tapal has to go through all the recommended sites , a kick will go out of the long term but , fortunately , small towns will be packed with cafés .
&quot; We have such good eating places and sometimes sometimes get the feeling that you are going abroad &apos; , he describes .
Well @-@ educated and young soldiers who have come to the Taps spend a lot of time , the stap is a feeling of rubber feeling that the present is in Estonia and in their home town , but it is such an international company together .
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to the stories of the French or the Americans .
The soldiers , yes , are moving a lot !
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal detentions
The television channel quoted a foreign minister who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tents .
On 1 August , the police arrested the people who had been illegally tented on the island of Sithonia on 1 August , including two Bulgarians .
They were released on the same day , but the investigation is now under way .
At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , TV channel TV bTV said that Bulgarians were released later .
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tents and are already imposing tough fines for all those who are stuck in a clean @-@ up area that is not intended for this .
The controls will continue throughout the season .
According to the Ministry , the court may impose the fine .
The leaflets teaches the wool are breaking sheep .
The shelf land farmers have to lecture their herds once again to their herds &apos; lecturers &apos; - probably the scenes have already broken a number of sheep .
This year , the wolves in the Hiiu County have broken down three times , a total of 23 sheep and wounded eight , the Hiiu page .
I have only had the figure in the Multi years , the year before .
There is also the environmental agency &apos;s data in the Gulf of Murdania , that the land shelves in the land of Hizbollah will not be born and Hiiumaa land hits information that two wolwashing areas have been fixed on the island this year .
On the night , a Monday ago , the wolves in Easter in the village of 15 bulbs and injured the parties of 18 survivors .
In the property of 13 days , the wolves broken the wolf in the village of the village of one sheep and injured a great many who had to be faced with an emergency killing .
Rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Life sent a draft law amending the law on the greening of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and on the amendment of the plant protection law .
The amendment of the law deprives the creation of a separate data base for both genetically modified ( GM ) crops and for handlers , which will continue to be used as a plant health register .
In addition , it amends the management of GM crops and the obligation to have a prior agreement with the designated radicality for apiculture .
Although currently GM crops are not cultivated in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
At least as long as it is not decision @-@ free to declare Estonian GM , &quot; said Sigmar gaigmar , President of the Earth Department of Life .
&quot; However , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account both the costs and administrative burden incurred by the private and public sectors . &quot;
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the management and handling of GMO crops and cargo @-@ handling units in VS , lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and on economic activity .
In specific terms , the cultivation of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to inform beekeepers about the cultivation of GM crops on the basis of an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement on apiculture cultivation before increasing cultivation .
The draft law has been sent to ministerial departments for coordination .
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine this in the draft information system and if they so wish to submit their opinion to the ministries of life .
The proposed changes affect , in particular , those operating in the area of crop farming , beekeepers and agricultural agencies .
In the European Union , including Estonia , only one GM crop is authorised - maize mon 810 .
So far , however , no Estonian farmer is interested in cultivating GM crops .
This is due to the fact that in Estonia , there is no mammoth , a European treasure industry , on which the maize line mon 810 resistance .
It is also a hotline for the southern regions and is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
In order to secure the pre @-@ eminence , the State Department of residence will have commissioned various summer and 2016 investigations into possible GM organisms in Estonia in different supes , maize and soseeds seeds .
The results of the analysis of samples showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of seed , maize and soya seeds in Estonia did not include genetically modified organisms .
In turn , the latter may conclude that , in Estonia , GM crops are not being cultivated and it was also confirmed that no random contamination has taken place either .
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester in the form of &apos; gegenus &apos; in the form of &apos; gegenus &apos; in Manchester .
The Jose Mourinho believes that the Manchester is coloured by Nemja Maticu &apos;s &apos; genius &apos; , after the middle playing field and Sampdoria on Wednesday evening in his debate .
For GBP 40 million , Chelset was bought by a player bought in Dublin , in the pre @-@ seasonal game prior to UEFA Super Cupi real Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 victory in the initial row , giving the impression of a defence role , while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to attack on the attacks .
But , being set aside from the seasonal pre @-@ eminent Asia , Matica was also badly needed to bury the match and he held only 45 minutes , which must be improved before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; He needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , ingenious thinking - he has the football mindset , &apos; said Mourinho .
&quot; We will help it achieve the form as soon as possible . &quot;
As is the case , the initial stadiviser in Aviva , the other new colourless Victor Lindelof and Romeva lu , and the Mourinho began to quietly set up a man starting the start of the season .
The Independent public unveiled this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers , but he asserted that the club has already done &apos; excellent work &apos; by concluding contracts with three priority samples .
&quot; I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three out of four &apos; .
&quot; I am even happier if they can make four of the four , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;

The white house of the White House cost taxpayers to pay thousands
According to the military documents disclosed to the magazine magazine , the White House went to air a helicopter helicopter last month to the South Bank for the southern horror .
The Green and white colour @-@ Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , termed as President park , in the presence of the President , was the central singer of the American construction programmes in Valges on 17 July .
President Donald Trump , Vice @-@ President Mike Pence and White House senior officials were news of their circuits of industrial products from all 50 states .
A helicopter built in Connecticut , together with a reputation from a reputation , a man coming from Wisconsins and a Missesippled plantation .
Helicopter Squadron , responsible for Helicopter and Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX @-@ 1 ) , the White House called for a military office to call HARGO @-@ ga a little 36 hours before a helicopter of HMX @-@ 1 .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an unusually high @-@ profile event , &apos; HMX @-@ 1 comandör said on a daily occasion before the event , the leading officer of the sea , the leading officer of the sea .
It was noted that helicopter will arrive at the southern horror on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock at 7 o &apos;clock and will remain there until the end of the night , while the same evening between 18 and 21 will be cleared .
It was added that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , the flight flight requires a second age flight because of the restrictions on working time .
The original team was in helicopters at the helicopter , and the security team of the esroper , was close to the entire ground during the period of stay .
The documents given to the magazine were not able to read out whether or not you eventually needed or not for the second age .
The Hatch Act bans the Federal workers to use the government for political purposes .
The documents show that HMX @-@ 1 examined whether this initiative could violate this provision .
&apos;Ten wonder whether this infringes the Hatch law and we were told that he would not hang , &apos; wrote commanör .
&quot; You seem to have no choice , &apos; said the lead officer .
The White House declared the event &apos; For an official event and the Hatch Act would not have covered it .
However , even the official events are politically undertoned .
During the event in the Senate , President supported health reform efforts and praised the government &apos;s regulations .
The use of the name of the name of the name or the air carrier , known as &apos; Air &apos; , for politically profitable purposes is no new phenomenon .
The Presidents must use them to travel .
However , the requirement to use these purely photovoltaic is extraordinary .
The Trump was brought to the attention in February when his first campaign event in Floran Melbourne , a President of the President , and he is sounding Twitter &apos;s account sounding a message on how his predecessor &apos;s president used the plane .
&quot; The White House is very pleased with the wording &apos; American made in America , where products were represented from all 50 states prepared by American American workers , &quot; said the White House on the commitment of the representative of the White House and Lindsay Wales .
HMX @-@ 1 teams often operate in Washington and the southern horror test to get used to the White House of the United States to the White House with no meticulc precision .
At the start of the Trump at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , 58 samples of the HMX @-@ 1 white house were arrested .
According to the official official , the flight flight was thought to be included in the &apos; flight crew &apos; of the flight crew for a month .
The helicopter helicopters were flying on the day not only for 11 hours &quot; support missions with the President of 11 hours &apos; .
According to the White House , not one other is burdened by this event in the taxpayers &apos; pockets .
According to Mrs Sikorsky &apos;s spokeswoman , the company was not involved in the organisation of helicopter in the South .
HMX @-@ 1 does not retain the budgetary documents of the President and the precise costs of the event are hard to find out .
However , according to a briefing at the Ministry of Defence in 2017 , the VH @-@ 3D compensation rate is 24 380 dollars per hour .
In the Eskar &apos;s document , the flight was extended to 30 minutes of the main base on the ground .
The White House states that the actual cost of helicopter use is well below this amount .
&quot; Calculation of taxpayers &apos; costs based on estimated compensation rates is highly misleading , &quot; said Walters .
&quot; These estimates include a combination of human resources , maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account in the case of annual appropriations . &quot;
According to the 2015 rand survey , the level of protection at the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation levels for staff costs , but they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
The White House &apos;s former spokesman , Sean Sober , defended the use of helicopter at the event .
&quot; The point is to show the things that have been made this week in America , &apos; said Siker .
&quot; And I know Sikorsky and Connecticut is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are hundreds of thousands , if not thousands , of people who depend on it .
And I believe that , just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked relentlessly .
So , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
It is not clear whether the Trump tree in the southern nightmare of a helicopter or not , but the fire @-@ fighting wheel was willing .
In the White House , Trump Sikorsky addressed the representatives of the Sikorsky , on the release of media extracts and on the products of the company in his personal aircraft .
&quot; I know Sikorsky very well , &apos; said President , &apos; I have three products . &quot;
Mr Grit Šadeiko - round the tears of peace and joy
The MMil Daegus hit Shadeikot in the last area , 800 m drinks and stadiums were taken on a stadium .
Immediately prior to that , he had become an unpleasant leap from China .
The 2012 Helsinki Convention breached the depreciation of the cheapest , but the detense of the detentions in London went to 60 13 places of 23 seats .
However , I will keep quiet .
In the Moscow MMil of Moscow in 2013 , the Estonian republics , after the inauguration of Estonian republics .
Two years later , MMil gained 15 seats in Beijing and met the Olympic orthodom , but it was more than that of sport .
In the dark , Shadeiko was only a bubble when , at the beginning of the Amsterdam of Amsterdam , you did not get a copy of the result .
I would just just like to put one proper multi @-@ annual contest together .
One time , sprat Šadeiko .
Worse still : A month later , his Olympic contest in Rios died for the first hurdle .
Time had to be taken - could the seven contest be continued at all ?
Is the two @-@ day effort still worth all this ?
There was a long time ago , but there was peace .
I need to think about this .
This experience has been relatively hard to describe , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
Thankfully , it was time to be able to cure itself and think we need to think about it .
&quot; I knew that a photograph does not mind , &quot; says Šadeiko of his self @-@ cleansing .
I got a clean leaflet and a new leg forward .
The Treener Anne hill said , &apos; The suffering of negligence was very difficult to look at , but he has realised that , above all , the athletes themselves must come to their eyes .
After all , he had been bogged down by everyone .
It was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; However , the Grit said he would not give up and he wants to prove what it deserves to be &apos; , says Nagorno .
Now there is some sort of peace .
He is doing so for himself .
The competition came back in May when the Shadeiko erected a new Estonian reorder on a new Estonian record .
At the high @-@ level competition , he corrected a personal top @-@ level bullet of nearly 3 p.m. ( 13.89 ) and ran a record @-@ time barrier .
There was a feeling of competition , and that it is not at all a waste of ability , but it is just a starvation race that has been extinguished .
He has been put on record for years that Šadeiko is a Muslim student .
He is ready to play a athlete , he is a good trainer .
If something goes wrong or is wrong , he says so immediately .
He knows his body and distrust his sense .
That is what we must do .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we will follow it .
The new approach has also been found by Šadeiko .
&quot; I am not the one who is doing the best thing in the trunch , he talks and says that the most important thing is to get the hour out , because it will also ensure a good result .
The baby baby baby is happy to recount
The good emotions have also been offered close doors to Shadeikole .
Both his former counterpart , Maris hill and sister , have recently received grandparents and several competitors and have received support from the new citizens .
&quot; It is quite interesting to have been &apos; , the Shadeiko .
One alcohol that is synonymous with brain training .
The Liconvertrong writes that Dr Gordon perd is a big wine fan that believes - wine can be trained better than any other world .
Sheperd is a scientist of Yale &apos;i University .
His message is not about alcohol , or about how it affects our feelings and minds , but about a very active &apos; wine taste &apos; process .
By sounding the word , the wine was complicated , enjoying it in enjoyment and afterperception , we are putting our brain to work in order to create a taste for wine .
According to the Sheperdi , the human presumptions does not actually contain a taste , but a taste of the way in which wine stimulates .
He will set the benchmark as to how the brain &apos; sees the colour &apos; .
&quot; Taste is not wine , a taste of taste for wine and &apos; , says the family .
The things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , our age , summer and even the quantity that man produces .
It is , of course , manageable that wine is not there to be full of a hair .
&quot; There needs to be more &apos; , he says .
If you take too much of a longing longer , the system is over @-@ abundant .
Excessive oenological practices can do no harm to the brain : According to a 2004 study , people who drink more than three glass , loss of memory , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity .
10 % of women in the Estonian ICT sector receive less pay than colleagues
The figures in the Personic search company reveal that 10 % of workers in the Estonian ICT sector receive less pay than colleagues .
The 10 % pay gap is between men and women , the portal writes .
59 IT and telecom companies participated in the ICT sector &apos;s pay study .
A total of 8 577 posts were examined .
63 % of the posts were male .
&quot; Although only 3 companies found that the pay gap is in favour of men and the difference in pay gap between the rest of men , the average salary gap for men is 10 % higher than those of men on average , and men earn an average of 8 % higher than those of men , &quot; said Foncrates analyst Ilmar Nordic .

China &apos;s role in politics , according to the United Nations
The head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can represent the people only when all members of society , including women , play their part .
Sir Nicholas Haysom , head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are standing for election in local councils , three women are standing as Vice @-@ President and over 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; The importance of women in the importance of importance cannot be exaggerated , &apos; he said in a statement on Wednesday .
The elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
The local council elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
The Taliban have been threatening the electoral process , which coincides with a transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
This year &apos;s elections represent the first time that power will be transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next .
According to the Haysom , the strong role of women in the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
According to the independent electoral commission in Afghanistan , 3.6 million women have registered up to 3.6 million registered .
The joy of sharing makes every thing much more acute , both in the big and the small .
There is always too little time in the common time , but the thread will be a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , closeness and burden .
And what a convenient solution - wherever you hurt in the summer , live in life , you will always be able to keep up with your fine voice : &apos; We are now doing the trendy ! &apos;
With insulating insulation , it is a very good thing to play as a common gold play or bypass the lip of the coastline .
All this is the foundation of the feet and the foundation of a whim - who would then like to take the form of slogans in the summer ?
It is wonderful to have children , instead of chicken !
First of all , it is secure and comfortable , which is growing slowly at the same pace as training and force .
It is also possible to do a great deal with large children .
The child strikes a balance , reads the corps and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
The bigger children can do the same at the same time .
The scope of the move is to put the land missing and to call for it .
The fingers of the Homistry , the pallet miniabt , are to be kept well closed .

In fact , it is more difficult than usual , but a lot more amusing than in the meantime can hand the hand .
In order to add to the burden of burdens , one can stay on the plank , a tear turt , and a walking circle in this position .
A further consideration could be made to the hip of a baby , but this exercise offers a fun for all children .
At the same time as the tab sleeping , the triazery , the ash and the fabrical burden such as contagious .
Child walking on the feet that their physical location is equal and willing .
A market of security may be kept to the hands .
The verbal feet and stupid straight up .

On children , there is a great deal of amusement with a thick and a plate .

At the same time , a truly effective body of the entire body .

A wide range of world @-@ wide air traffic , such as air traffic , in the heart of the journey !
Broken bags are also summer classes , which have become an end product in recent years , which , in one of the right summer @-@ tables , has to hang at the hands of the hand at hand , and which has been able to open a price label to this modest origin , in spite of their modest origin .
The red bag is probably one of those things that have been alive in one order and has not been subject to particular emotions .
It is simply there , and if there is no , there is no overlap .
Now , however , the beer are embarking on a real victory and moefics have changed their fine designer bags against red bags .
This is not only a coastcopy , but today it is also just a popular street , and bolder women are standing in office even in office .
However , it is worth making it clear , however , whether an upper @-@ like summer is still sitting up , or it is worth picking up a little more than a little more than that of the official .
The wealth of the Vagkovous has become a real summer love of women .
For example , by reading foreign moilsticks , the first thing is that the mothoghted road to the first thing on the local market , and acquire some beer on which you have a healthy holiday club and which is accompanied by beach , market and also cycling on the city .
Some bloggers are so brighter that they are buying off the market with a heavier heap and sell them to their loyal readers .
It is worth noting , however , that there is so much demand among readers , so that women ( and men ! ) in the real world , women ( and men ! ) probably had to be moved to each other to become a happy owner in some homes .
In some respects , this madness is understandable , as it is those flat times that , when the fashioned is possible to buy a few snuff to buy just a few euros .
It is true that white traders have found a simple opportunity to earn money here , and both sell off the luxury of luxury bags for a few hundred years and years .
Perhaps it is still the case that the richer customers should not feel as easy to feel prophets of cheap dogs .
For example , it is possible to buy Dolce &amp; Gaba from a thousand euros in the shoulders of the euro .
However , the interpretation of the Chanchkoti is available to 6 000 in the euro .
However , unlike most of the moconstruts , the brewers do not , however , come from some big mob , but originated from their story .
Indeed , the breppers of the beer are allegedly told far from the Philippines , where they have been wearing them .
The red hole in the air is very often an export business and very often do not see them around .
It is said that the burning technique dates from 14 to 14 years , and it is quite horrendous by means of a normal repetition .
However , as the beer does not have to be so heavily red as a basket , they can weak muster muster and other materials that make cocktail more individualised and more aker .
For example , in recent times , there are particularly trendy bags where red parots or leather skins have been red .
The copy can be sent first and foremost to send an audience to Jane Birkini , the largest red beer to the gkop , were not available before .
That is how he conveniently fitted into all possible forms of apparel , and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival .
The popularity of the tourists today does not play a smaller role , but also that caring for them is the head of the rob and , unlike any other summer , they do not have to take care of these special means , but it also exploits water and battles .
As is still the case with the &apos; trends &apos; , it is not only the branding of the classic straits of a whole range of interpretations .
For example , if they so choose , they can acquire a red shell or a tiny sword of little .
It is worth remembering , however , that classical beer will never be going from a mob , an shoulder of beer .
But , what is the classic brewbag ?
For some centuries now , it has been classical to beat the beer that is reminiscent of its style basket , is open and will be short , as are beer .

GMB is worried about investments following McVitie &apos;s Glasgow plant
The trade union expects cookies and McVitie &apos;s leadership of long @-@ term production plans in the enterprise of Glasgow .
According to GMB Scotland , the company has been silent on the future of the investment on the subject .
In the class of Hobnobsi and rich , mature internal and other products , works more than 500 people .
McVitie &apos;s owner , the owner of the company , said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million over the last few years .
The staff and trade union chairs &apos; are the first to hear &apos; when something changes in the activities of the plant .
In a letter sent to the manager of the company , GMB sent a request to McVitie &apos;s request for &quot; disconnected concerns in order to ensure that the funding is not used to modernise the production lines &apos; .
Drew Duffy , the GMB senior body , said : &apos; The fact that we cannot have clarity from the head of the site about the business needs and the investment plan for the future , our Members are deeply concerned .
A number of generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely composed of the local community and the people of the Glasgow , as a vital pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region characterised by high unemployment and social exclusion .
So Glasgow is in favour of jobs , salary and well @-@ being , and in the context of Brexiti , the rise in living costs and the chronic decline in production in the wake of the chronic loss of production . &quot;
The representative of the Pladise said : &apos; The head of the customs , GMB , was only able to write a letter from the GMB and the company responds to her directly , as we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives .
Two months ago , there was a regular meeting between workers and GMB representatives , which discussed openly a number of problems .
We discussed then with workers that , like all other highly competitive and uncertain businesses , we are looking at our activities on the current - and this applies to all our businesses and facilities - to ensure their competitiveness .
He added : &apos; In recent years we have invested more than GBP 5 million in customs in order to improve the production of production lines and operations .
We fully understand the legacy of the customs as a production site , and if any change is to be made in the activities of the site , workers and trade union representatives are the first to hear from it . &apos;
Did the PSG warned Barcelona three years ago for his approach to the country ?
La Ashton may regret this interest in Marco Verratti
The Paris Saint Germain is not trying to attract Mr mar mar in his ranks , making it possible to buy an amount of GBP 189 million , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago against this record conquest for conquest ?
This cursory approach has opened up as a transitional window , and the Ligue 1 club is prepared to break up more than twice buying over the current world record , which was erected with Mr Pogba &apos;s return for GBP 89 million .
Once the transition has been completed , it will result in the most expensive player in the world and , at the same time , the highest paid professional player in the world , who will be able to pay more than GBP 500 000 a week from the PSG .
The Barcelona is aware of this approach , both because of the approach of convergence and of the liberation of the Neyr , although the head of Catalansi &apos;s Bureau is a close source of evidence that the club has always borne the best care in the years after his arrival in 2013 .
But did the President of the PSG warned the football world three years ago ?
When the City of Manchester showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blair Agreement in 2014 , Mr Al @-@ Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who think about the best player and the recruitment of some of the PSG .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they deal with some of our players , we are going to stand up to them and contact their players , &apos; Al @-@ Khelaif &apos; .
&quot; We respect all club .
But if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have been overtaken by this limit , as the Spanish club earlier showed an interest in the G @-@ Central play and Marco Verratti .

Brexit is seriously threatened by the rock between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , warned of early visit to Northern Ireland in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it . &quot;
Cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the free movement of people and goods , &quot; said Varadkar .
&quot; This is our vision for the future : Building bridges , not borders &apos; .
According to the Varadkari , he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union , and because it cannot be done , it will remain part of the European single market .
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
The second way to make Britain more seamless would be the creation of a European Union @-@ UK Customs Union , the Prime Minister of Ireland .
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , said Vardikar : &apos; Surely we could have this kind of British &apos; .
The alternative to this would be a return to customs items , which would proclaim historical divisions and political failure .
&quot; Raise trade , prosperity and peace &apos; said the Irish Prime Minister .
He called Brexitit &apos;s &apos; challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that the result could affect every aspect of the daily life of Northern Ireland .
