four members of Cape Verde in Estonia and Spain
according to Mr Posselt , the police in Spain considered the leader of the so @-@ called KCape rovo group of Guaderovo group , who is known as Srrovski , who is known in the criminal world .
in Spain , Gulevich was arrested by the Court of Justice .
yesterday , the Court also took three of the suspects detained in Estonia .
according to the suspicion , the so @-@ called KCape rovo criminal Community members of the 27 @-@ 57 lives of the 27 @-@ 57 lives who are mainly committed to drug crimes .
in Spain , MiFID was detained in the province of the criminal Community .
in Estonia , three men were detained in Estonia , one of them has been collected according to the criminal community , and two are members of criminal Community members .
the data collected indicate that the criminal community was clearly divided and roles in the criminal community .
the purpose of the actual Community activity was to commit crimes against drug crimes , and thus serve a criminal offence , as the head of the pre @-@ trial procedure , the Head of State Prosecutor , Verte Verte .
&quot; we do not exclude that the circle of suspected of criminal matters is increasing in the annex to the Prosecutor .
this is the people who are also in the past , and some of them have borne the penalty for crimes against drug crimes .
Mrs Verte stressed that there has been a significant number of cooperation with Spanish colleagues throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become a normal way for us , and the operation of the week &apos;s week shows the success of cooperation &apos; , commented on the Prosecutor Verte .
the leader of the Environment Police Office , LeLein , said that the detention was preceded by a half @-@ year preliminary examination of the detention .
&quot; a long @-@ term work in the first half of this week and , at the same time , held in Estonia and Spain for crimes suspected of crimes . &quot; said he said .
in the event , officials in the Centre for criminal police officers were helpful in detention in Spain .
for years , we have a good contact and understanding between the Spanish police and the civil card .
these arrests are yet another message to criminals that we will also be able to take the hands of the rest of Europe . &quot; said Leat .
the information that has been collected so far indicates that there can be a suspicion of men in the non @-@ free stay in the case of the new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s Office has requested the prosecution of the prosecution and the Court also approved it .
the men arrested in Spain are waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
in the context of this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash will be seized in order to ensure the confiscation of the confiscation .
the criminal proceedings procedure will lead to a regular prosecution of the criminal police in the centre of organised crime , and is headed by the state Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the city of Tallinn in the city of Gulevich in 2005 was sentenced to blackmail and punished him for five years of imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gulevv , Nikolai Tarankov , was held in Nicolai Tarankov , in the context of the Estonian criminal world .
KCape rovoo from Gulevich rose in the beginning of the Republic of Estonia in the beginning of the 1990s , when he started to address blackmail in Tallinn .
Admittedly , he has been acting in the various hotels , and the prostitution of men and women demanded a monthly tax on business .
international joint operations , criminal proceeds confiscated and the decisions taken into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the last court decisions , the so @-@ called Dikayei criminal practice of the eight accused persons who have been confiscated in the form of 80 000 of the proceeds of criminal proceeds , or the judgment on nine persons in that , in Igor Aleynikov , created in 2006 in the criminal community , which was aimed at illegal trade in cigarettes , which was aimed at illegal trade in secret cigarettes and to commit crimes related to human trafficking in East Viruland and South Estonia .
there are almost EUR 71 500 of the proceeds of criminal proceeds .
in these criminal matters , it has ensured that policemen exchanges with foreign colleagues on the daily basis of information and prosecutors , and if necessary , together with operations in any EU country .
civil Citizens &apos; Group warns a Mistral travel .
the organisation National Association for the Advantes of Coloves People &apos;s ( NAMA ) has warned the country &apos;s discriminatory policy and racist attacks on the State of the State .
in the declaration of the resolution , the &apos; Missouri State of State issued in the NAP , which applies until 28 August 2017 , calls on all the passengers of the African Americans , visitors and their sourians , to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious in the state of the whole country , given the whole range of suspicious racial events that have taken place at the last time and here , and here &apos;
in the case of NAPs , the group urged the group to issue a warning to a &quot; Missouri law &apos; , which makes discrimination against cases of discrimination , as well as the fact that the state of the State of State corners &apos; targets are unequal in terms of the same minorities .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
they will be drawn up because of their colour colour , they are beaten or killed , &apos; said NAPs &apos; , the President of Rod Chapel , the President of The Kansas City Star , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we have never received complaints so closely . &quot;
this is the first warning that the US state has issued on the state of the US .
Mrs Rühle referred to these events as racist insults in the vicinity of the marches of the tanks , and the death of 28 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old @-@ year @-@ old Sandersi of Sandersi .
in the light of this year , Mr Sanders died in all dubious circumstances , when he had a war on petrol and a Missouri police carried out in the state of arrest , without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the comment indicates the recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of the Solidarity Fund , which shows that in the State of the state , the cars of drivers are being stopped by 75 % more likely to be the case of white @-@ fares .
&apos;The point is to say that people are aware and warn of their families , friends and working partners for what might happen , &apos; said Chavez .
&quot; people are ready to be ready , it will be the case for the inclusion of the money , or to inform relatives that they are carrying out in the state . &quot;
on the basis of the latest data from FBI hate crime , a fund was documented in 2015 , which puts the country with similar violations in the state of cross @-@ border 16 of the state .
the warning is also in response to the new law of the Solidarity Fund , which makes it difficult to prosecute housing or work on the basis of discrimination against the company &apos;s court .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( ACLU ) ( ACLU ) was issued earlier in the case of Texas and Arizona on how these countries were adopted by the immigration laws , which oblige the local authorities to arrest the people of immigration , because the ACLU says that it increases racial profiling .
normally , the warnings on the foreign Ministry of the other countries , however , have started to make use of this measure as a response to the laws and trends in the United States .
Mr patitis : what could everyone learn from different forms of illness ?
Mr patitis , it may have been caused by five different - A , B , C , D and E hepatitis virus .
all these types of virus call on the height of the burn .
however , the worst cost is chronic B and C hepatitis , which can be developed in a circus , or pay for cancer , and pay for cancer .
the Health Agency &apos;s epidemiology adviser , Mr Kuusar , is telling us that the phenomenon of hepatitis disease is the same for all the species of incineration , the same - a fatigue , tigue , a sounding , a sblematic , ometre , beatty , beatty , beatting , mechants , cook and coinobjects , and nail and limests .
the last point of disease also comes from the patholation of the rock of the rock .
children can live in hepatitis .
the various species of incineration can be identified only on the basis of the data on laboratory research .
let me talk about hepatitis hepatitis , and for decades , for decades without disease , which means that the person may not know anything about the harmful disease that is harmful .
Mr Kuusar will find out different forms of hepatitis and describes their way forward .
an hepatitis virus spread from hospital and infectious food for food eating or drinking water , on the roads , on the shelves of people , and to those on foods , soil , objects , contact , and drug consumption .
a very hepatitis hepatitis , family members and carers , who are suffering from chronic pay , are suffering from grotesy people , men who are sex sex men , men , drug trafficking , the high spread of hepatitis .
it can be prevented by vaccinations , particularly for people who are to be vaccinated , and the people of hepatitis &apos;hepatitis &apos;hepatitis &apos; Group .
in addition , it is important to comply with the right to hygiene requirements : washing or disinfectants , before the consumption of the consumption of the fruit and vegetables , all of the fruit and vegetables .
hepatitis antivirals are spreading to the blood of man &apos;s blood , drug @-@ style , parenthood , aughance , blood @-@ contaminated pollution ( tooththnic , pregnant means ) , the use of donors with blood , hepatitis hepatitis , child sex and hepatitis / wigborn .
in hepatitis hepatitis , the sex partners of human beings , the sex of people , men who are sex sex men , the mother @-@ born people who live , sick family members and carers , verb and other bodies are exposed to health , rescue workers and police officers and B @-@ hepatitis countries visiting passengers .
hepatitis prevention is possible to vaccinate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vaccinate people in the north @-@ based group and , in addition , chronic pay @-@ related diseases , HIV @-@ infection , relatives and diabetes , and diabetes .
hepatitis &apos;s other preventive measures are : avoiding the hygiene of strangers , hygiene and manure , other acute resources , and the use of systalles @-@ advice , hepatitis and gooking , and the use of condooms , and the avoidance of sexual risk risks , or avoiding risk of sexual risk .
in the case of hepatitis vaccination , vaccination is a part of the national immunisation scheme and for children free of charge .
C @-@ hepatitis &apos;s virus spread to the blood of man &apos;s blood , drug @-@ minding , parenthood , aughance , blood @-@ contaminated pollution , the use of donors with blood , hepatitis hepatitis , sex sex and hepatitis / Uigborn .
C @-@ hepatitis &apos;s HIV @-@ based group , the sex partners of human beings , the sex of man who are sex sex men , the mother @-@ born people who live , sick family members and carers , blood and other bodies are exposed to health , rescue workers and police officers , HIV @-@ infection persons and C @-@ hepatitis countries visiting travellers .
C @-@ hepatitis preventive measures are : avoiding the hygiene and manageable tools , other acute resources , and the use of systalles @-@ advice , as well as the use of hourning and auctions , and the use of condooms in the event of dangerous mixtures of infection .
there is no vaccine against hepatitis C .
d &apos;hepatitis &apos;s visitis virus , which is a lot of B @-@ hepatitis &apos;s presence in the presence of hepatitis B .
in this regard , the D hepatitis hepatitis B or super @-@ leafarances , in conjunction with B , are experiencing a chronic B of hepatitis or superchés .
d &apos;hepatitis &apos;s virus spread by exposure to blood and other body liquids , with contaminated coal @-@ advice , sexually and rarely infected animals .
there are chronic B @-@ hepatitis virers and the anti @-@ fraud of hepatitis Bhepatitis &apos;s anti @-@ proliferation virus .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against hepatitis &apos;s vaccines , which will protect people from the infection of hepatitis virus .
Inhepatitis &apos;s virus spread on ehepatitis @-@ on @-@ water drinking and food , including low @-@ processed animal meat , fish and sea potato , fish and seafood animals , with blood , joint life pystalts and infected animals .
passengers may be infected with the high incidence of hepatitis in the countries .
the prevention of hepatitis preventive measures is to comply with hygiene requirements : washing or disinfectants , or disinfectants , before the existence of the food and feed , after the care of the hospital .
the fruit and vegetables of fruit and vegetables before consumption , avoid low @-@ treated animal meat , fish and marine anafood , only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption .
although the last front in the last front , the competitors from four Olympic Olympic winners , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Farah final irgel and won a period of 26.49.51 .
the Farah did not thought long , after the refining of the finalists , the husband Tania and children .
that was a special moment for me .
I am very much in favour of my family .
they were a wonderful word , said Farah on journalists .
Farah is targeted at the fifth title in London , and 5 000 metres of a golden dup of 10 000 metres .
all of it is possible if there are things .
in spite of the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connorm &apos; Daam gold las &apos; , Gustav Klimti , the extraordinary story of a slave of the As Bloch @-@ Baueri , the extraordinary story of one of the magnificent born @-@ out of the 19th century and the beginning of the Vienna of the 20th century in Vienna .
however , more closely in the history .
on the basis of the carryity , the carpet , which is stunned in short @-@ night , a more narrow issue would have been allowed in the title of the extraordinary hope of being able to have a more impact on this .
at the moment , there would be two book @-@ xes : Gustav Klimti and his wife &apos; Daam gold gold &apos; , and a much more ambitious and more comprehensive history @-@ based family and the German occupation , along with its follow @-@ up in Austria .
the first one third of the book is in the middle of a fatty in Vienna on cultural life and who , in the Austrian capital , could not imagine the way in which a hundred years ago , or how the Centrali coffee , who took all the heads of his head when it was introduced .
the concentration of cultural players was a high @-@ rich city in one of Europe &apos;s richness in the city and in the White Paper , with a view to some of the titles of the &apos; cultural &apos; more than one gram .
however , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where unbridled punishes and the highest levels of self @-@ suicide were the European highest level of suicide , the development as if nothing does .
or perhaps , however , every couple of couples , too , are adding a colours to the cultural life of the 20th century in Vienna .
dream of travel to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century , there was an explosion in the number of Jews in Vienna , by changing the largest community in Western Europe .
the Sajandical exchange had had to be in 10 in the last half of the Jewish .
in Vienna , parents were also newcomers in Vienna , but for the time , when the aid aid for As is twice opened up to the Czech sugar milnate , Ferdinand Blochevery and the moot , he was his father , the bank has already received the first seventh bank bank Habsburg Empers empire .
however , the Adelet &apos;s entire sense of life , which he was famous , has failed .
if you look at the &apos; Dao &apos; gold las &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the life of the end of the life of the infection is a more powerful pro @-@ socialist and dream of travel to the Soviet Union .
in 1903 , when Ferdinand Bloch decided his husband from his husband from the Klimtig , the last moment was the last minute to be a half @-@ year @-@ of @-@ house panel in Vienna .
the climate was paid at the time of 4 000 kroon , a quarter of a quarter of the landhouse of the land .
that is that there was a modell of the modell of a creker in a number of crews , the carrot of sugar was not discouraged .
as far as the deletion is concerned , the only thing is that the relationship between the modelli and the artist &apos;s close relationship continued to the end of life .
Mrs O &apos;Connor - &apos; Daam gold let .
the extraordinary story of the Gustav Klimman Champitepiece , Adele Bloch @-@ Baueri , the extraordinary story of &apos; , Varrak 2016 , English , translation into the Aldo Randland .
immediately before the start of the work Adeleh , the Klimm has come to the San Vitaga Raventa , and the investigators think that it is precisely where the brilliant mosars of the gringe grinp in Theodorant gave an artificial idea to make a golden piece of Domeste colours .
his &quot; Daam gold let &apos; Vienna 1908 in Vienna and about at the same time ( in 1907 @-@ 1908 ) , there was a golden land in Snovel novel .
the historians do not have unnoticed the similarity of the two women .
how is Hitler involved ?
&apos;I think that , in my friend &apos;s Klimman , I am indebted to him in order to make his work publicly available to the public , signed the Aloch @-@ Bauer couple a few years after the departure of the artists ( the director of the Klimm died in February 1918 ) and wanted to ask for their family to be a collectorate of museues .
six years before death was a spamat Adelet .
in my view , in February 1925 , he asked him that his husband would leave her two reports and four Gustav Klimti @-@ landscapes in the Austrian Galspecial case .
in his own , Mrs Mariana and Luan , he had his own eyes .
after this year , when a spam was completed by the Austrian Mona lisa &apos; , it has tried to access the Acadeissuer Acadeissula in Vienna , and it was a failure in the case of a year when it was carried out .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s late anti @-@ Semitism is considered to be the reason for the Jewish professors to be opposed to the deprivation of the deprivation , no one would actually be in July .
in any case , the Austrian Galspecial task was referred to in the case of the Austrian Galspecial special task of 1939 , which has become a significant change in the presence of the Vienna of the rich Jewish arts , which has been the very rich in the University of Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal art of artistic life was also a few of the As at home , but not a climb .
Sixty years after the arts of the Nazis , the ten @-@ year @-@ old litigation between the Austrian Government and the Bloch Bautastes was beginning .
at this point , it is only mentioned that , when &apos; SInnovative &apos; is in Vienna Belvedere , the &apos; Dao Bloch @-@ Bauer &apos; , the &apos; Daam gold let &apos; need to be a look at the New York Neue Galspecial .
and before you read in Vienna , the White Paper has also been carried out .
even if you were to look at the moos work , because at least my emotions , after the closure of the book , were more naked than the end of the book , and the cradle of 135 million dollars , and the moll As Bloch @-@ Edit reon .
so , not so much of the kind of office , if rather a sexuality , is the living of a sexually , and a very move .
in the event , it facilitated the orientation of the Bautastes in the early words of the Bautastes .
17 @-@ year @-@ old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonia
in the event of life , it was a very close to a private record of 200 sethilims in a very close to 2.16.62 .
the Spring mark dates from 17 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ olds when Canada &apos;s football championships became 2.16.58 , the Prir Aavan @-@ APP block .
in the last place , a decade A @-@ finalist .
at the end of the last year , 2.15,76 , the latter can distance from a distance of the period , and achieved a good 7th site with a new powerful top @-@ year .
as Alina Kendziorn , Estonia &apos;s recoring of Estonia ( 2.15,13 ) remained a little over half a second .
in the age of Estonia , Estonia has grown and its fresh personal top @-@ mark is the result of the five @-@ time result of Estonia .
young people in the future will be more ambitious in the diplomatic competitions of adults in Canada , 200 m and 400 m in balls and 200 mths and 400 wins .
last week , Canada &apos;s Championships were held in Toronto , and the way in which successful start will also have been successful .
he won 200 m to be a silver bullet with a silver meal in 2.03.22 .
this is the last year in the last year , as soon as possible , as a facilitator of this distance .
the Golf @-@ time period is only a distance from Estonia &apos;s record in Estonia , only as a year &apos;s record .
in Canada , there has still been a strong advocate of an unstoppable attack on 100 cents for a great personal record , with a new year of 56.66 in the top @-@ year of Estonia .
for example , it is a year old in the old hour of Alnek , which has failed only a single century more quickly .
at the top of the personal excellence , he has yet made 100 more limps in the exchange of a letter of time 1.03.69 .
over a longer distance , it has only reached the seventh place if the finest was 2.17.31 .
it is currently in the middle of the four different distance visits from Estonia at the moment .
President Trum will go on holiday , critics of a toothm
the time has come from the time - that is to say to the President of the United States , Donald Truy .
however , as the Trum has so far been one of the last few days , the critical critics have already been taken by the President .
the US @-@ US and CNN reports have been in 17 @-@ day leave for the President of the President of the EU @-@ 17 @-@ day holiday in the Bedminster , which is located in New Jerseys .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , Trumpi &apos;s opponents have already taken the floor for weeks .
they are putting it too frequent on the Olympic order .
it is a President @-@ in @-@ Office for a week of his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey &apos;s cotton .
incidentally , Mr Trum is not the most puzzled President of his 196 office .
for example , George W. Bush came on holiday in this time to be 67 days , Barack Obama , but less than Trum , but 21 days .
however , there is a tendency to keep things quickly .
a few days after President , he said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , so that the longest holiday in his wife , he will not be able to do so , because there is a lot of need to do .
he also expressed three years ago on the leave of Barack Obama &apos;s leave .
the current President wrote on Twitter : &apos; at a time when Obama is on holiday , it will have a golf , it goes on the brakes and the group &apos;s groups , in fact , is set out by journalists from the sun .
the language of the White House officials have not been a sign of a few hundred years of cooking .
it is called officially on holiday , which has no time to read , or other words of action , to be taken into action .
in addition , there was also a second reason for job holidays .
this is an exchange of the white house in the western front of the White House and , therefore , all staff have to leave it .
the West is also located in Owhkacon and others of the work of the President .
&quot; I do not believe that one of you would like to be in August , when there is 38 degrees and there is no anti @-@ conditionist language , said the language of the white house in Lindsay Walters who stressed that President will continue to work during the course of leave .
where President Trum is followed by 17 days of water , it will be an idea of video .
blocking of the critics on Facebook : do not stand up to the Head of State when you do not have the criticism of the voters .
the father of our country knew something about the unfavourable media opinion .
the Americans loved George Washington , but the newspapers did not have a long way to begin to stem him from the internal policy to the political principles of up to the political principles .
of course , it was annoyed by the criticism .
however , he has not forced to remain silent .
because , in the year , Washington states that &apos; freedom of expression can be taken away from us and , in the face and in silence , we can be chaired by sheep . &quot;
this brings me to Mr Hogan , Larry Hogan , who has worked to see that there are more to be in Washington .
it has been blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook website .
the European Union for the freedom of the American citizen ( ACLU ) , and a week ago , is therefore the case for the Court of Justice .
the Governor &apos;s official officer was born in a vacuum and an online comment on the reactions of the jargon , who are interested in &apos; .
&quot; this is just Facebook , &apos; said many .
however , it counts .
and that is particularly much if it is a sort of thing like Hogan .
this is an amazing popular republicy in the democratic state in the democratic state .
the percentage of his approval is the second second stage of the state of the country &apos;s 50 .
I am not thinking of a response to the undetermined position .
it has led to a firm , determined state on the state of play , and in the face of its principles .
in addition , it has used the main instrument in communicating with its constituents , for example , by presenting a Facebook page , for example , after the first time in the chemical or the first time .
therefore , the Governor of the Governor of the site is a public forum , which is managed by a public forum to be blocked by the workers of taxpayers &apos; dollars , and , ultimately , dangerous and ultimately dangerous .
in the interview with Mr Chastel , the representative of the Office of the press , the Washington Congress , in his interview with the Governor , claiming that the blocking of comments was nothing other than a raft .
however , it is too easy to extract the picture on the online web browser , spasmail or hatred full of the people .
the post was set up by a number of people whose Hogan is blocked .
it is precisely what they are doing , and that is what they are about to do with their elected leaders , the owner of the company and the passport , and not Internet controls .
they have all said that their comments were disrespectful , thought @-@ out and , at all , not the rogue .
Pastor quoted in his postal services , by underlining the Handle Catholic road .
Marylan Bowie , a lawyer from Lakshm Sarma Raman , did not instigate anger , but quite angry of hate crime .
&quot; I have been in courtesy that I am disappointed , because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &apos; he wrote the news story of a comment in the six countries .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , if many people comment on the same subject , some of them will be inexindly in a collective effort , rather than acknowledging that this is a great deal of concern with citizens . &quot;
what the Governor of the Governor &apos;s officer has called &apos; to call on &apos; spawling attacks &apos; would probably call for &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook @-@ era allows messages to be easily fitting , by blocking simply a criticism or deleting a negative comment .
it is a lot of cleaner than old when the workers had to be sent to the same , so that they would collect newspapers in the newspapers and burn them or arrest protestors and forced them to remain silent .
however , exactly this is what is happening , simply in a digital fashion .
the Hogan is not the first public official who criticises Facebook and other social media .
President Trumpi has taken the Court of Twitter users who have been blocked by Twitter .
one of the first points of view has been made on this subject in the last week , Virginiin .
at the US Department , James C. Cacheris decided , Mr Alexandria , that a substance of the Committee on Budgetary Control in Alexandria is an asset for the first revision of the Constitution , when he was blocked by the election and his Facebook .
in Kabuy , the ACLU Facebook and Twitter use , after Governor Matt Bevini ( R ) .
this should not be so difficult .
at the moment , at the moment , there was a similar impact on the Internet than the Internet .
between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers in the newspapers and anonymous writes turned out his leadership .
and even then Washington had to face anonymous controls .
people wrote letters from the newspapers such as Yricola , Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , to Washington &apos;s decision on the ground .
in accordance with the draft collection project of the water @-@ based George Washington , it will be matised by a series of historical documents that criticised the views of Britain on the basis of friendship , trade and shipping agreements with the United Kingdom .
however , he has not forced them to be silent .
freedom of expression , specific opinions and discussions are the foundations of our country .
and the right management means acceptance .

many of them have been joined by the Liberation Movement ( VPL ) in the wake of the army , which protects the rights of boats , by organising the rights of the Indonkian soldiers , as well as the attacks on human abductions and kidnappings .
some of the leaders of the VPL are come from Paniaana , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
in response to this , the army has arrest Paniawas and had arbitrarily detained thousands of people during the pretext of protecting the sovereignty of the country .
some of these are never more than ever .
in Papua humans , it is known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty is dissatisfied .
the lack of a poor , which is sold in the majority , is too expensive for local purchase .
the Leib is the same unavailable .
people are growing in their own food , mainly when it comes to their own food , in addition to a little bit of fruit and deserts .

&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the sitting , because there are no jobs and no money , &apos; says Paniai &apos;s Chairman of the Council , John Gobai .
the privatisation keeps the eyes of the world away from the Pope .
in addition , strict restrictions on external media .

in the course of 2019 , the new presidential elections will take place in 2019 , but boats do not believe that they will vote in Jokow .
&apos;Jokow is a man of good intentions &apos; , but the people surrounding it , who are involved in the shooting of Paniai , &apos; says the President of the Council , Hobai .
he wants to give the Jokow to understand that , in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly suffering from the threat of the military junta , they are suffering from poor education and health services due to the poor .
according to Gobai , the people of Paniai must , as the other boats , the voice of Jokow to debt , which will have to pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &apos; says he .
despite the misfortune and intimidation , the families of the people of Paniai were not yet to cope with the last symbolic objection to the death of one victim to the physical police of the victim and the military junta in the country .
knowing that justice may never be put on their feet , they will not allow them to forget their crimes .

the Vasyl Lomachenko and Mlony Garcia , who should be on the course of a collision in order to face the most attractive boys in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday , for the first time on Thursday .
they were in LOS Angelein , in the office of the ESPN , until Garcia , won the unwon World Bount Council lightly , the second running of the corridor in order to welcome Lomachenkot , the World Bog , the World Bount .
as a result of the unanimous decision by Mrs Garcia , the victory of the former two @-@ time world leader , Adrien Broner , on Saturday in Showtime , both of the kidnappers of the front of the table .
Mr Garcia has given his better hand and said : &apos; how do you go , the shadows ?
I would like to make a close success . &quot;
the Lomachenko will protect its belts from Mr Marriaga on Saturday evening to 19 ESPN .
if a couple of photographs , the Lomchenko mountains , the Lomachenko mountains , said that it can be &apos; perfect &apos; for opposition fighters &apos; .
&quot; I am a former prevalent , &quot; reminded Garcia .
&quot; I have returned to Broner &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so much .
I am small from 63.5 kg .
I want to move below the lighter .
and he must move towards a lighter weight &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we will be able to fight .
Fänans have wanted it .
let us give them this . &quot;
the Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
it raised the question of whether its review should be a cost @-@ paid ; it is part of its strategy that he wants to allow Lomachenkol to put an end to this year to the end of the debate , in order to make it possible for the next summer to be a meeting of Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 noses ) , who also have an interest in the fight against Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbell , following the lighter fares of the Foruum on 23 September .
&quot; the review of this fight could be a reward , because the fans have wanted this confrontation , &apos; said Garcia , saying later that he is open to the fight against any channel , which offers the best financial package .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name will be able to pay so much attention .
when they are ready ... &apos;
Mrs Garcia has said that he must be the champion of Lomachenkot , and perhaps to look at his page on his desk .
however , the Lomchenko was modest in approving the Garcia , saying that he considered that the three chambers of the Riverpool was set out in the case of the Cverties , but I apologise , Melay ... you wanted it to be a nope . &quot;
the Garcia said that the aim was to show strength and then boy .
both confirmed that they feel that they are growing in the face of the challenge of the tension between them .
&quot; this is the fight that looks forward to realising .
no other confrontation does not bring so much attention and take place .
I am more than willing to work on this , &apos; said Garcia .
the Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been the creators of the best fighters and Mlony .
this is a good fight . &quot;
what is going to be moved from the World War to Estonia ?
a record of more than 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have been travelling to Estonia , who have been travelling to Estonia , have been extended and issued by the police and border guards Office ( PPA ) .
if , for example , the soil was decided to issue a fixed residence permit to issue 6702 foreign , the soil was the figure of 4928 .
the agencies do not know how much immigrants finally remain in Estonia , but this analysis will be drawn up in the Ministry of Interior .
as a year ago , around 500 Ukrainians a year ago , the figure in recent years will come to close to 2000 .
the number of applicants for authorisation has increased exponentially in the crisis of Ukraine , in 2014 , a fixed @-@ term residence permit , a year of 675 .
with the statistical office , we will have the highest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia , the number of EU citizens from Estonia , Estonia , is more than a distance .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been a great time in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many of the family are already in the country , in the Interior Ministry , Kristin Ramallay .
according to the soil and the soil , the number of people who have fixed fixed @-@ term residence permits was even more than the number of Russian citizens , even though , over 10 years , the most fixed @-@ term residence permits have been issued .
if the Ukrainians come to work here , Russia &apos;s citizens will be the family of family migration .
&quot; in view of this historic Russian community , they are also most likely to have the greatest family links in Russia , &quot; said the Home Protection Convention on Migration , the Helina Medeal .
&quot; if you look at where the Russian citizens of the Estonian residence permit have been able to live in a transplant , Harrumland has now been the case of East Viruland , he added , and pointed out that around 40 % of them are married in the European Union &apos;s citizens .
the Multi @-@ term residence permit was 1696 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians wanted to extend the number of Russians .
&quot; this is due to the need for a new residence permit for a permanent basis to be maintained in Estonia , as a result of the possibility of a residence permit , for a permanent basis for Estonia , explained by the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior , Ramon , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the event of a residence permit was not stable for years .
the new residence permit for Estonia will be able to obtain at least three years of foreign request for the first year .
its aim is to encourage the accumulation of people &apos;s sincere motivation .
however , a long @-@ term residence permit for a long @-@ term resident requires five years .
a new residence permit is expected to have also decreased as an extension of the old residence permit .
for example , the soil was awarded a residence permit for the 146 Ukrainians , which has been working for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to change the work and the Estonian state will no longer be the finger at the end of the pay criterion .
this residence permit was a pant to be popular - applicants for the bubble of the soil ( 1029 ) , the Russians ( 487 ) , individuals ( 54 ) and nigerans ( 36 ) .
the 1968 people who live in Estonia for a residence permit , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 gGeorgians and the same like the Chinese .
the first semester of this year is already a total of 1269 .
in 10 years , Nigeria has been surprised by the country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for the residence permit .
if three residence permits for children were issued in 2007 , the soil in the past 200 .
to learn from the University of Nigeria .
the Estonian higher education institutions are still popular , such as Georgians , the Chinese and the Turks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has been increasing largely thanks to learning games .
for them too , the rule is that , where there is a community that has arisen , there should be no more easy other words , in the annex to Ramon .
over 10 years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , as much as the North Korea and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four Uruguay .
as a year , around 6 000 third country nationals can receive a residence permit , this is about 0.46 per cent of the total population .
even if the citizens of the European Union are concerned , migration will be around a percentage of the percentage , &quot; commented on the use of the action that , in fact , the numbers are small .
on the basis of the statistical office , the Greek soil , from 14 822 people in Estonia , is expected to come out of 13 792 .
this means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration .
most of the winners and those who are relocating are Estonian citizens , but more are among those who are leaving them .
this is why Estonia &apos;s citizens &apos; migration is in mine 2000 &apos; .
the Spanish and Estonia are particularly emigrating .
Mlong Couture Princssimpets in the case of the Nazis , titles and bore !
however , in the North Sea , the history of Maria Tammeoru is , however , history - old old and defendants : &apos; I can dream of a few times somewhere in the museum , and the old @-@ old theft and crats .
if there is something that you are doing with you , you are watching and learn about it every day .
that is the pleasure of finding it !
a long @-@ term world of Couture is one of a few ways of life , but it does not do so .
you yourself decide how much you live in life !
I have a friend , as a friend , who has a whole sail of the wounds of mine , which I have created .
because , and it is not his fault , he does not live in the Hollywood and does not go on a daily basis for every day , he would also want them to bear the most beautiful ones .
you will live in a special life for their lives .
the Moeartificial nik does not recognise the gap between the events and the bad days .
this is precisely the reasoning of the plan to bring the rolling plan in Estonia in the middle of the world , to the people , to the people , who often do not catch up .
the Mlong ago was presented , for example , by comparison , Jools and the University of Almoean , where 45 modell Royal defilee was carried out by the whole street .
in Tallinn , it is often carried out , a young people are seen with dignity , but elsewhere , there are more emotions - songs , rise to stand up , want you to thank you .
a large part of the audience was just as news , but now they are in the Mlong Couture .
if you had the expectations of the people , they are spirited .
and I like this feeling that I am in my motto , as if the summer summer .
Mr Chatzimarkakis , we had 50 metres of red carp , the whole street , with you , who seemed to be the end of the end , it seemed that they did not end up .
Maria do not recognise the motto that animal nature must be presented in a supersupersupersupersize , it will be happy to give the wrong ordinary women .
I often call on my own customer - they are always happy to have come .
it is , after all , the experience of the experience , the island of the middle of the ice .
I am sorry that I myself have never seen his role , always , I am , of course , behind the fact that it is unwise to give an unpleasant form of influence on things .
my nerve would not allow calmly to look at the Chamber .
Mrs Maria is this kind of motto , who does not just want to play a representative role , but to be in everything involved in everything .
I have my own sister machine , most of the collections I do .
I like the whole process , where you are playing with details , discovered .
I have never been far from our animal , and I am not afraid of work .
the only thing is not limited , but also an additive , logistics , organisation , organisation , organisation , all of which must be a day @-@ off @-@ off of a woman &apos;s day .
it is up to the fanatics of these working hours to be a great deal .
I cannot say when my day will end , for me it is simply a day full of joy !
I have very much been saying - that is , as a lacite chain : I am doing something fine , a man can do something fine and , in turn , compliments .
several times have been said that my broker is in the countryside - they are putting them to know .
in the wake of the guise of the guideline , which Maria talent overnight has made , the Mlong Couture signalling has been left to date .
Mr Martin Myrsep U18 boys , a weapon of hospitality , has now been turned against us !
it is a pity , the sluggers of it were running out .
the first thing was that we did not get our tables .
and if there is a huge difference in the table , there is nothing to do with the Estonian U18 corps : 75 out of the UK in the United Kingdom , the only NBM has played a repetition of the helpler , Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsep Martin Myrsep .
opponents adopted an attack on 28 Palace and received more attacks on this basis .
we were also not prepared to defend their aggressive protection and attack , it created .
many of the attacks on children ended up to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
however , they agreed to keep all the hand between them , but we could not be combined .
it created a team .
the homeless work has been done better .
the Myrpa estimates that Estonia would have to do more tactical errors in order to take up the blow to the fight .
with the exception of the latter , we had a mistake , but we have already received a number of urgent times .
the generosity and close pressure that had been alagpihed on our arms , now all of us , have now been against us .
today , we had no strength against these aggressive acts .
the Myrder remained in favour of peace , Matthias Tassi .
in general , there will be good words to be told about the tourism team , to date , to be a united blow .
it is a pity that , in the past previously , this aggressive response has already been taken .
it has been a whole time for self @-@ confidence and played today , but it seemed that he had been tired - he has made a very large burden .
however , he made a very fine move in some of the things that I have seen in the past , in the annex and .
the terrible numbers : the rebatim concentration of the EM @-@ turnine EM , with less than 10 points ...
the 18 age classes do not only apply to the TB @-@ diviso of the Youth System in Tallinn , and , in the city of Tallinn , it started yesterday in Dublin .
and the EU &apos;s game of Poland , unfortunately , is the case of antiraals .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter of 2012 , the state of affairs was 9 : 49 , only last ten minutes , anti @-@ dumping , and a period left out of 16 : 16 .
in the first and second quarter of Estonia , Estonia , the third 1 point ...
in the same way , in the first two minutes , they hit the first two minutes , but there is a lot of reference to the 25 piece , but then there is a three @-@ day shop , and then 21 to wait for ...
perhaps almost half hours have been tabooked in 47 .
in addition , 2 points had to be 2 .
there was a sensible number of losses in this time , 12 .
in the end of the game , Poland was set out by 33 and Estonia in 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , on the day , on the day , to recognise Portugal &apos;s 83 : 56 .
NATO vessels coming to Tallinn
today , NATO , which has been a permanent contractor of NATO , arrived in Tallinn for weeks , to supplement the stocks of ships and to prepare for pre @-@ presumed habits .
in the course of smoking , ships are preparing to wear the sea , and give the crew of members of the opportunity to holiday on a daily holiday .
after a visit to NATO , NATO vessels will remain in Estonia to carry out a number of habits and be ready for future historic remnants .
&quot; the participation of children in the territory of NATO and the co @-@ operation carried out by them in local waters illustrates a well @-@ known way of our integration forces , &quot; said the transfer of the Gaer fleet to the operational and planning cycle of the naval fleet , the operation of the naval fleet in the tasks of the Sea .
since 29 June , NATO was chaired by a permanent contractor of NATO on the coast of Latvia , Gvido Laudupe , who took over a ceremony in Riga at a ceremony in the Estonian naval officer from the coast of the Estonian naval officer in Johan @-@ Elias , from 29 June from 29 June .
the flag of the group has been designated by the Latvian naval support ship LVNS Virsaitis , which will also act as a leader of the group .
in this half the year , Estonia is also part of the naval machine and the anti @-@ house of the Estonian naval force .
the four @-@ group groups of NATO &apos;s naval board in NATO , which are subject to the Association of the Community of NATO on the basis of Monday &apos;s fast @-@ track response , are a unit of primary speed , which the Alliance can send in different parts of the world in a range of days .
4 . - On 13 August , the Pirita kastery , once again , has once again been a place where 13 years ago , the Testro Eri Klasta has been put in favour of Dgitta Festival .
this year &apos;s visit to Birgitta Festival can be a beautiful , powerful and unprecedented way to the Federal leader of the University of Tallinn Film .
the threat to Joost : Cuba is to reach the classest of the world class , &apos; Traviata &apos; and &apos; Tosca &apos; , the Crustilaanswers &apos; Karlssotine &apos; Karlssonini &apos; , and also does not lack the scheme , which is the case of Joseph Haydn &apos;s mourricchers in the same way in 2015 , which led to Pirita in 2015 . &quot;
she is much more than just a group of groups and communications .
it is more than any music muster in their normal form .
this is a festival , which is going to take power and will never be completely open .
since experience , which can be heard in this area and in a secret environment , human beings are taking a more generous , and it is about human dignity in a way that I cannot be described .
the first for the first year in Birgitta Festival .
does the maestro Eri Klaskins have not seen a little bit about ?
but , of course , because I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been a great deal of aid .
I am in the direction of a whole student career , and also supported a professional career at the beginning of the adjustment process .
perhaps thanks to this , I will have it easier to continue his work .
in the past , there has been the heart of Birgitta Festival team so much good and , of course , it will be all over me .
it was excellent to join the team who knows how things go .
it has just been a great heart to me , Mr Klashed , also given me the strength of the Festival in the town of Birgitta Festival .
and here I am now and I can start !
what could be done in a more audience street at the Festival of the Festival .
we have the first museues , from Latvia , Lithuania and , as a surprise , the first balleans written by Mrs Lindgreni .
in order to do so , &apos; Karlsson will fly &apos; .
and one of the notorious nungs is that it was the author of the balleans of Latvia and Jurs Karlnes , who himself expressed their desire to write this works .
it is probably a child who has been living in KarlAndersson &apos;s carpet .
to the risk of how you are all angry ?
thanks to my support , I certainly will certainly be able to support .
this work needs a system of work and a lot of love , and I am thankful to this .
and I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend on the other people , as I do not think I am going to go on to every new day .
and this is aware of the fact that it is being kept , maintaining a positive sense and , in fact , a laughing of self @-@ offs in the mirror , a significant proportion of my disappointment .
in particular , this week , when the most important test is , I have been very keen to have done so , and that is working .
to give ourselves a laughing in the act , it is rewarding the tone .
that is not just a word .
I think that people are not yet aware of the things that the universe offers to them , but it is also a case for everyone to get it slowly .
right now , it is an important moment .
is it also a kind of ritual before the surviving of the rigens ?
there is still a rival to be replaced by more convenient .
this is a small moment for itself .
however , in general , I do not have the opportunity to make a large number of wounds or a small inater .
in fact , I even like to be able to engage actively with the people , even before the dirty dropping .
however , get all the Festival to the Festival , which is also to be discovered , not particularly in the great ooperotive and balleans !
see a demonstration of a video to the risk of Joodtry !
new results of the publication of the age assessment tests for the Swedish edition of Sweden
among the various applicants in Sweden , the latest results were carried out by the most recent results in a medical test , in order to show that the latest results show that more than 80 per cent of the old one was estimated to be older than 18 , but not all of us do not believe any clarification of results .
the Swedish National Institute of medical medicine ( Rhartswomen ) began with tests on this year &apos;s start .
the tests were set up during the first application of the age of age , after the Swedish Republic of Congo , in particular , to criticise the fact that they have not managed to put the age of juvenile refugees properly to determine the age of minors .
to date , the migration of the migration has sent a test of 80 cases , and the Institute for medicine is between the middle of March 2017 , between the middle of March 2017 , and the results of 24 81 tests were issued by the mid @-@ March 2017 test .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) assessed the 18 @-@ year old age and another 25 in the case of cases of medicine , the Institute of medicine , in order to test &apos; may be 18 @-@ year or old &apos; .
the 432 cases concluded that the person is &apos; probably a younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests are used only if the age of man is questioned .
the results of the previous few months are consistent with the previous few months in the Office of the Legal Office for medicine .
&quot; we do not see a great difference in the statistics in previous months compared to the figures , the numbers are quite consistent , &apos; he said &apos; The United Kingdom &apos; .
the fact that the vast majority of cases were assessed as a parent , does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been ascribed at their age .
the Institute was issued in May 581 the results of the test , and said that 442 cases are references to the fact that a person is being examined 18 @-@ year or old . &quot;
however , if the newspapers in Mrs Svensson examined the results of these 581 tests , it was clear that 243 was a person directly saying that this year will be 18 .
the method of assessing the age of medical age , which is carried out by sixty @-@ hull images and blood @-@ related MRT , which will be allowed to analyse them with tooth doctors and radiologists , is criticised in some circles .
one of the sceptics is the Harolinska Institute &apos;s Honologist Claude Marcus , whose job tasks include the assessment of the maturity of the people of the people , to identify whether they were in the normal past or later .
&quot; I have had the reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement method that is currently used should be used .
the designation of biological age in such a way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say clearly , we should not be faced with the fact that we can , &apos; said in the history of forestry .
however , in Johan Göransson &apos;s Institutional Institute of medicine , the accuracy of the tests : &apos; generally , it can be said that the risk of inaccurate adults in the child is small .
most of the least 10 % of the risk is where the person is a little below 18 . &quot;

the 20 @-@ year old and Mrs Maria Orel made the London MMil fine debate , with 67.377a on 18 seats .
Mr Of was the MM novelist , and a warm woman confirmed that it hopes for the future to fight medals in the future .
the contest went well and received good experience .
in the first test ( 64.80 ) , I made an immediate end to the end of my average , on the other ( 62.80 ) , at the risk of too much and the third ( 67.37 ) I have had to be clear , &quot; said , after the contest .
I was very happy to see my own emissions and I am very pleased that I found it .
Ms Maria Oreli MM has ended a fine on 18 @-@ time .
Mr Orelier did not disrupt , because it is training he has carried out the LTTE in the Quartet .
&apos;I am afraid &apos; , he said a small sludge .
the London Olympic state was almost a single nation of the people , whether Mr Of was the people who had their own or was able to integrate themselves ?
I have said , but in a positive sense .
everyone says that it will give it - that is what it is !
if it is to compete , it can experience it .
finally , it confirmed that the MM will be satisfied , and it is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here to the 32 , last outcome of the season , I ended up on 18 .
this is a very good result .
I am 2040 and Mil - that is the only thing .
I will take a good experience and some day I would like to compete on behalf of the medals .
Western Virgina , Governor of the West Virgina ruling party exchange
the Governor of the West Virginia Democrat , Governor Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President Trumpevery , that he will exchange parties .
&apos;Mpresue &apos; or not , but the democrats to go away from my Jewish , &apos; said the Governor of Justice .
&quot; today , I say to you , having forged and wondered ... today , I say to you , the pro @-@ Western Europe , that I cannot be able to help you as a democratic presence . &quot;
the devil is in the wake of the joy .
&quot; so I will be able to revisit me tomorrow , in the Annex Justice .
&apos;Trening , I would like to tell you that it is time to play a second game &apos; .
the Trum was allowed to have a great announcement in the coming before the West Virginia @-@ Virginia .
the Trum won the West Virginias 42 points and Justice did not support the candidate of Hillary Clinton .
the case , which is the only billions per cent of the state in the Court of Ford , proved to be elected in 2016 .
it notes that it belongs to the coal mines in the state of five states and the quite father of coal @-@ business .
his value is approximately USD 1.59 billion .
at the same time , the republicing National Committee ( RNC ) on Thursday evening , the announcement that &apos; Governor of Justice &apos; party exchange is yet another blow to a democratic parable of a country that would rather hinder the improvement of the country once again . &quot;
&quot; all of the 15 chapters and control of the lowest number of state in the history of the state - Governor of Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent word to tell you what is the way to the end of the end , and we cannot find a positive , united message , &apos; said RNC Newl Ronna McDaniel statement CBS Newl .
it is not surprising that , where there is a lot of people , there are also many injured .
the Weekgraph of the Weekgraph in the office of Urtain said yesterday evening that the posters have had to share quite a lot of them .

of course , there is also a halt , in absentia and footwear .

Mr Coe approved an honest apology for the Russians following the anti @-@ doping channel .
the International Convention on International Women in Limtian Coe was approved by his words &apos; Russia &apos;s fair apology &apos; , but reiterated that it is not time for the country to allow sport to be allowed .
in writing . - ( PT ) Mr President , Mr Shylachtin , on the eve of the International Council Congress of the International CCup on the eve of the International War , the IAEA Congress , in order to have a ban on its country , is the right and he is determined to fight doping .
he has apologised for all @-@ of @-@ enter classes , who have lost the golden and silver medals in the contest .
despite his comments , the IAEA Congress voted in favour of leaving the ban on entry into force , which was established in November 2015 when the report of the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) took evidence of the country &apos;s sponsored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think this was a very honest answer today , with a very honest presentation , &apos; said the IAF President Coe on journalists .
&quot; the whole of the Council and the whole Congress were satisfied that Russia also recognised that they have had quite complicated times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Union . &quot;
he said , in addition , it was pleased that Russia was accepted by the criteria for rearing itself .
&quot; I believe that it was a very constructive day , and there is progress , but the Congress supports the proposal for a group that is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &apos; said Coe .
&quot; we must do everything possible within the next few months to normalise the situation .
we have always come to the principle that we want clean athletes to be separated from the system , &apos; added it .
one of the second Russia &apos;s barrels , who meet the strict criteria of the IAF , competition in London on Friday , will compete with neutral athletes as active athletes in London .
the leader of the IAAF Group , Rune Andersen , said Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of criteria for forecasting .
following the presentation by the IAEA to the Council , he said in London that doping is still insufficient and the technicians are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution makes a significant contribution to the demand of metals .
who is the winners and losers ?
little because the revolution in electric cars makes a significant difference in all the fuel market up to infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the automotive market .
although the mines in the Glencore can say that one of you will win and lose out , then smaller aircraft companies will not help .
at the moment , the Glencore coal and oil , but in the age of electric cars , there is an increase in technology for electric cars , copper , , aluminium and nouths .
in this year , the decisions of the UK , France and Norway , which allow for the sale of fossil fuels using new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades , have contributed to the spread of electric cars .
therefore , Volvo knows that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine , and Tesla will bring the market cheaper to the market for less than 3 electricity cars .
Banimal berg in New Energy Finance forecasts is already sold in the space of two decades more than oil produced by electric cars .
&quot; for some of the few parts , it makes all the &apos; said &apos; the Capital of Economics , Simona Gambranini Banimal berber .
we have already seen a great deal of impact on metals such as cobalt and liitium , which has increased for years .
in the electric car , there are around three times more than the ordinary car , declared Glencore .
more answers are needed during the charging stations , which is why the Exar BNP Paris estimates increase the demand for approximately five % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional lituum , cobalt , graphite and manors .
Glencore can grow from an increase in electricity cars from an increase in prices of electric cars and that it is the world &apos;s largest producer of coding , forecast Jeffens .
in the light of the race in the past , the winners of the Fbetg @-@ McMoza and the First Quanine Minerger will be the winners of this .
the market is already responding to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of 70 % of the fish caught in the London stock .
the increase in the price of soil was 37 % .
this is also the case for 14 % of this year , mainly because of growth .
the Glencore excise duty rose in London 20 per cent , having exceeded the rival in Rio Tlank Group , BHP Billitoni and Anglo .
on the side of Saists , companies are engaged in lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine , who must adapt to the new era .
the main end @-@ use of the Plii is petrol and diesel engines from the start of cars to be stolen .
electric cars are using limaries .
&quot; this is a serious risk from the demand for lead , unless any other purpose , which could be overcome by a decline in demand , said by Mr Widmer , the leader of the Bank of America , Mr Michael Widmer .
in the form of price movements , it has not yet been seen to have an impact on the sidelines .
it is a year of 17 per cent of this year , which is the best metapheric in London among the main industrial metals in London .
investors see the problems only far from the future .
&quot; I am not sure that it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil will save ordinary cars in competition &apos; , said the Herwig company Triland Metalsi sales company Triland Metalsi .
if there is a lead in demand , it will be slow .
it may be the case for around 10 years .
however , in the meantime , stricter standards of emissions mean that the demand of hybrid animals is growing , which depend on the exponential introduction of engines in the process of developed lead @-@ based ones , the international lead and the investigation organisation .
Kergmetal , like aluminium substituteres , because let us get a car in less power to go beyond electricity .
it has already been explained by a further EUR 1.6 million tonnes of lower minimum demand for 2013 @-@ 2016 .
this represents 2.7 % of the total world of aluminium .
it is likely that this trend is getting worse , said Widmer .
Aluminium is a year of 13 % , since the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to the market deficit .
the steel manufacturers do not .
the ak company is working together with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of light @-@ ups .
similarly , ArcelorMittal and the Svenue Europe are trying to develop a lighter melt of a steel , so as to resist the lower minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be a response to this development , &quot; said the Exread BNP Paris study Sylvain Brunet .
there is some success in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also lead to the suffering of the plainroom .
it took around half of this precious metal diesel engine for cars , announced in the metal of the metal and Johnson Maty .
&quot; in many times , such as oil and plaatas , in the future , there may be no major demand in the future , as Bernard Dahdah of the raw materials analysts , Bernard Dahdah .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important , but their importance will become more than 15 years .
the Platiinatmakers believe continued demand for the horses of diesel .
Mr Marc Grynberg , the leader of Mr Marc Grynberg , said that , in 2025 , it will continue to be sold more to hybrid cars in a more prosperous way .
the great hope of the Plaatinatmakers in the middle of 10 years is Toyota Motors and Hyperi Motosi , based on hydrogen @-@ based cars , which depend on a poster to produce a hydrogen electricity .
so far , however , this technology has not yet been legally justified .
&quot; it seems to be a clear chaos on the road to electric cars , &quot; said BNP Paris in Brunet .
German car manufacturers received a massive setback in July , as Stuttgart was a court in a ban on the use of diesel by Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche &apos;s home town .
how a football fund will affect the transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not hinder the record transition from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona French club Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences for the UEFA , governing bodies , which dominate the European game and in its power to ban crew on the prestige of the JCA , are waiting for the conclusion of Saint @-@ GerMay only before .
the financial rules for the fair game in 2011 ( FFP ) mean that the PSG has to prove that , without a huge damage .
the EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona , which is EUR 262 million alone , for the Brazilians to buy his agreement , and the salary of Neyra will come to the tens of millions of dollars a year .
there are some of the financial aspects of the French club .
the PSG is undoubtedly able to go to the recruitment of Mrs Neyi and to give its statitudes on the table , given that the team is funded by the state of the Star of the Ttar .
they have been allowed to spend a lot of players in recruiting players , but they must balance the legal income sources that allow them to come up with a football business .
FFP has set the basis for Michel Platini after he was elected as President of the European Year of UEFA .
this former French player and where the clubs who fall in the search for a large debt , are actually dealing with fraud and risk buying , when banks or owners should abandon their support .
since 2011 , the FFP club will focus on monitoring the debts of clubs .
this change means that the business model , which was used by Roman Abramovich , first in 2003 to buy a club with a potential , and then to make a large amount of spending so that the team can improve and create a global mark of global trade - is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of the FFP , which will run until 2018 , clubs can transfer up to EUR 30 million losses .
and despite the fact that Mr Platini was discredited in 2015 , the presidential office of its UEFA desert and Alexander Ceferin are still committed to preventing excessive overspending .
&quot; FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said the previous week in The Hague , Mr Traverso , who is a Supervisor of UEFA FFP .
although the PSG &apos;s overpurchase clause for the withdrawal clause , it will be possible to allocate this amount to the full allocation of the total budget for the whole period .
Mr Neymar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it is possible to show a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years .
in 2014 , the first wave of sanctions in the event of the first wave of sanctions in 2014 received the most severe penalties on the Manchester Cityga of Abu Dhabi .
at the moment of EUR 60 million , the PSG was appointed a fine of EUR 82 million , which was reduced later to EUR 20 million , and a club called for the introduction of a team of Memeters in 2014 @-@ 2015 rather than 21 players in the period 2014 @-@ 2015 .
UEFA is looking at a club who may try to choose over financial institutions , blowing their income through businesses with the owners of the club .
the company in Katar may be sponsored by the PSG , but if the value of sponsorship is considered to be standardised market rates , UEFA &apos;s official income will not be taken into account .
in 2014 , in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Qatar tourism Authority ( PSG ) has been distracted .
it has been said that a certain part of the PSG services can come from the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Management of Reports by the World CHonship in 2022 years .
however , the PSG and Katar 2022 deny that you could become a world championship Ambassador , and say that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities are able to expose such manoeuvres easily .
the penalties previously designated by the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules .
the people are familiar with the situation on Thursday , that UEFA is not a member of the PSG @-@ Neyra transition .
they spoke about the &apos; press release &apos; , provided that they are anonymous , because they have not been allowed to discuss the state of the PSG .
the latest reports show that , at the time of 2015 @-@ 2016 , more than € 10 million in the season 2016 @-@ 2016 , a total of € 542.4 million .
the data for the last financial year has not yet been published .
the PSG hopes that the arrival of marry will have a good sponsorship transaction , freight and label sales .
in the context of the conclusion of the agreement , at least 30 % of the total increase is expected .
the Spanish side , which clearly frustrated the departure of one of the largest football sceptics , tried to prevent the transition from the PSG , claiming that the PSG is in breach of FFP .
&quot; this is a clear &apos; case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with a club and a country , &quot; said the Spanish newspaper President Javier Tebas Spain , with reference to the fact that the PSG is primarily the case of Katarial .
Arseni &apos;s colleges of Arseni Wenger , whose club belongs to the American sports magnate , shares the attitude that the country finances the club .
&quot; this is a consequence of ownership rights and that is completely the whole football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to a country , all possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules for fair play , because the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player . &quot;

today , 50 years ago , a storm in Estonia , which is ripped of houses and windows .
the storms of the century of this kind , which , in the light of 6 and 7 August , caused major damage in particular to the Baltic States , Harmonland and Rapkay .
in the course of the Northwest Estonia , the wind was over 30 more than 30 / s .
in my esteemed drink , one of the posters of one card stop to another , and overlap with them to support them .
all of it was , and ragingly , like the world &apos;s experience .
in writing . - ( HU ) We have already moved from the houses of the houses , recalling the 2002 letter of the old Linda Kurova Haviv , in the form of an interview with Estonia in the name of the Estonian Federation .
Linda spouse saw how the planners were sitting on the ground .
but what do you still have to support , where you are receiving a storm of such a storm ?
the sea had to be below the windows of the wineing , the water of the Kashsalu Kalda , Mrs Linda at the time she has lived in the street .
it was the case that the roads were full and the perrotation of the railway station in the perrosite of the railway station was flying to 20 @-@ 30 metres , the Linda majority of the sharks like the next morning .
according to the local , there were no trees behind the aggression , some of the longest , some of the boys .
all of us saw very depressing , the storm went into the old old trees , and pragmatism , like war .
the Western Viruland was not able to have been hit by the 1960s by August 1957 , but the losses were very much hit there , Mrs Viruland &apos;s Official Journal in 2007 .
the Iberian Park and Padka Park has been wiped out , but also in our hands , the parks of our people were badly affected .
the wind in Tallinn has been measured in a period of up to 35 metres in a second , or around 130 kilometres per hour .
in Tallinn Meriority was one of the tears in 6.August this evening : &apos; mother , mother !

the common sense of the generational in Viljandiland is so much that it was decided to dismantle it later .

secret sites : night @-@ night work and poor coastal waters
the meters of summer summer also mean lower harvesting in the town of Tallinn .
&quot; if there is no , then people are in the rank , and if there is no , there are also no people , according to the beer .
the city of Northern Tallinn Stroom rankus .
they offer a paotic shift in low @-@ carbon competition , which posters a trape down the threshold of a loophole .
in fact , the last seven cent metre of life is going to be joined by the top seven cent metre , corners of the seas and people left behind : pumps , cigarettes and other .
people are still going to come , regardless of whether water is a soe or not .
if there is beauty , then people are in the rank , and if there is no , there are no people &apos; says the administration of the private company in the hands of Mr Usov , the President of Alexandr Usov .
at 6.30 and ranges , there is a hunt of flames , because at eight times the posters have to be in order to people .
the Usov is already at the thirst of the clock .
furthermore , the Stroom will keep an eye on the Pirita , Hark Lake , Kaymäe and Palaare Pikakari .
the current quantities of Prüm have decreased .
for years ago , it was much more .
people are now able to assess what they are doing to be done , talking about the Usov , which has been repeated for 15 years .
before that was the case that , if something new was put up , it was already a day for the next day .
now it is already being held in the rank .
the price of clean rigour
one of the biggest jobs in Estonia is for fish to be caught in the sea of rubbish , or adru Korre .
for example , the Pirita ranges must be prevented from 400 000 tonnes of coastlines .
&quot; it is unbelievable , &quot; notes the Usov .
the second major category is municipal waste , all the people who leave it .
Eighteen kilometres in the Stroom coast of Stroom are eight major intuna seiners , which are needed for three times a week .
so much will be the waste .
however , the meters of the summer &apos;s summer have meant that the waste is a fifth of less than otherwise .
the third species are abandoned .
in the most cases , they are the ones .
as a result , the Usov sand is replaced by a mixture of the wounds .
they will be able to wait for the withdrawal of the dead wood .
&quot; it is usually the case that they need more , but it is a normal harvest , &apos; Usov already knows that they will soon be able to join them again .
children come to beaches and make toys that they will be thrown into the sand .
landfills are being lost .
the Erika Scholler report , the Erika Scholler furnadies , is that the tractor of the tractor is disturbing to local .
noise , which will run at night hours , is confusing the people of people living in the neighbourhood .
on the day , this work is impossible .
one month we have two times to live in a war .
&quot; if we do not do this , the city will be fined , &apos; notes the Scholler .
however , the aim is , like Pirita , Pikakari and the University of Stroom , as well as in Stroom rand .
&quot; compared with Europe , there is much more work in Estonia in order to be careful , &quot; said Scholler .
we have more adqueues and heave , and it is more difficult to live in the sand .
however , we are less washing than anywhere in Europe .
when we were talking about the rubbish , there is a lively presence in Stroom rank , who is living in Stroom beunlessly at a journalist and corrogation , highlighting the current bottlenecks .
every half of tomorrow , there is a picture of the gallery .
the problem is the problem of birds and puslave @-@ slaves , who have been bogged down in rubbish , says Martin .
although it is difficult to expect people to change their senses in order to change their behaviour , Mr Martin hopes that the government of the city will take something in the dustbines and , for example , will not be hampered by the linkages , to prevent at least links to the news .
in general , however , Mr Stroom is satisfied with development .
it is to be seen that the city will look after it .
it has become more pleasant , enlightened and newly quoted road sites .
once again , there was only one way in which there was only one way to travel , notes Mr Martin .

Bank of England is keeping interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to notice that interest rates remain on the former level , as prosperous economic growth and inflation have cushion speculation on the rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth persists as a loium , as households are exposed to interest rates .
policy makers of the Bank ( EPAs ) have voted 6 : 2 rates 0.25 % , and less members require an increase in this month , because slow economic growth has weakened the support of the increase .
in its quarter &apos;s report on inflation , the Bank will be cut back to 1.7 % of the forecast for 2017 and by 2018 and by 1.6 % in 2018 , and warned that the level of income for households continues to be expected , as the autumn is still expected to increase inflation .
at the same time , the bank also signalled that the increase in the rates of the number of over the Brexitl in the next few years is necessary to curb inflation in the past few years , as well as a higher level of borrowing in the financial markets .
Members also voted for a year ago , as a result of the partial withdrawal of the package of depreciation of the economy created by the Brexti package .
in February , the bank will end up with fixed @-@ term fixed @-@ term funding , which will provide low @-@ cost funding for banks , even though it said that the scheme is now expected to be GBP 15 billion by EUR 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the Council &apos;s decision , the Bank says : &apos; the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) will remain powerless in the near future , because the difficult situation in the real income of households will continue to have an impact on consumption . &quot;
on the rates of the rates , it was repeated that the &apos; monetary policy &apos; is a need to draw up a lot of effort , and this &apos; somewhat more &apos; , if the markets are expected .
Mr Böge is now predicting the first increase in the second quarter of the next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the bank stressed that any kind of profit is a step and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and the next year are comparable to 1.9 % in May and 1.7 % respectively .
the forecast of 1.8 % in 2018 was maintained .
after this new , the dollar has fallen by the dollar and the euro .
women fell by 0.5 % of the USD 1.31 US dollar and 0.4 % of 1.11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointment of the spectators that have been given growing hopes in terms of the increase in GDP in the second quarter of the past three months , 0.2 % in the second quarter .
the bank says that growth continues to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year , this will be a little boost .
the latest inflation report by the Bank , the latest inflation report , gave rise to little reason to the fishermen who suffer from rising inflation and army pay , saying that the situation is going to be slightly worse before the improvement .
it was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent the amount of income in the next few years , but it is expected to put an end to a significant recovery of salaries in the next few years .
as a result , it is also encouraging the economy to create a growing demand for British production , which is partly due to lower costs for consumers .
the decision must be taken after the rate of 0.25 % in August last year after the shocking EU referendum , caused by a sudden weakening of the recession .
the bank estimates that it is likely to be four years that the prices and the economy can be put into full life .
prior to the last decision of the Bank , the growing demand was felt by increasing demand , since inflation has increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy @-@ makers were expected to increase the rate of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected to rise again and again in the coming months .
the bank said that excessive growth compared to 2 % was due to a completely weak pound .
Mr Montlake , the leader of the mortgaters , Mr Montlake said : &apos; the recent decline in Kurds seems to see that the mortgage market will again become more competitive , as creditors will be able to end up to work and put an end to the year positive .
Mr Böge seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions will be completed , as refinancing , often in a service , and a low rate , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
NHS is writing 10 000 people in contradiction with HIV medicine
patients have had access to the battle for treatment in the form of a &apos; transformative &apos; HIV @-@ friendly situation in the Supreme Court , whether the NHS should be financed by the medicinal product .
the NHS has announced that public health is now estimated at 10 000 people available to pre @-@ pre @-@ pre @-@ vocational training ( PrEP ) , which is estimated to be made available before the mid @-@ term and which has shown a reduction in the risk of contagion in the case of high @-@ risk people .
the NHS agreed to finance clinical trials after the Court of appeal was supported by the Court of Justice last year , according to which the PrEP is able to pay for the PrEP , despite its claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Steven , the Executive President of the NHS , welcomed this Thursday , as the &apos; new &apos; big intervention &apos; , while the national aidance fund described the &apos; turning point &apos; .
in writing . - ( PT ) clinical clinics in London , Bright ton , Manchester , Liverpoolis and Sheffield , are among the first ones who will be able to register , in October , in addition to the clinical trials before 2018 , in England , by April 2018 .
in order to reduce the risk of HIV @-@ infected infections before the mid @-@ term review is taken to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of the fibre tests show that the PrEP will significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission among people among people .
the PrEP , before the mid @-@ term , means that there is a sufficient number of medicines that prevent HIV infections from a large amount of medicines .
such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the interim .
they include a homosexual or bisexual men , trans @-@ gender people and people , whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot be treated .
these are suitable people in line with clinical coverage , including men , women , trans @-@ gender people and those with HIV @-@ intensive non @-@ retroviral treatment .
people who live in England and have opted for a family doctor in the programme will also be able to register in the local sex health clinics in the programme .
the programme pays GBP 10 million , and the NHS is signed by the Treaty in order to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the aim of the PrEP is to assess the actual potential of the PrEP , with clinical evidence for whom the treatment is intended and how it is used to be used and implemented .
Mr Stever said : &apos; this new large @-@ scale intervention should complement and leverage a wide @-@ ranging and increasingly successful fight against HIV proliferation .
this is another milestone in the long term in the long term in the fight against humanity one of the greatest health problems of humanity .
Mr Deborah , the Managing Executive of NAT , said : &apos; it is a turning moment in the fight against HIV .
the PrEP , if it was targeted correctly to those who need it and are the risk of a rup , offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England .
since September , people with high @-@ risk @-@ risk people in England have access to a powerful new tool to a new tool that is individually managed and dependent on the negotiating partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
the Chief Executive Director of the steel Fund , ian Green , said : &apos; now is a priority to ensure that clinical trials can be put in place quickly and that no HIV risk group should be sidelined .
now that the PrEP &apos;s clinical test is obtained , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who have a threat to HIV infections .
Mrs Hodgson , Minister of Public Health , Mrs Hodgson said : &apos; the PrEP @-@ i clinical test is a very welcome and very long overdue delay and the dispattern of the government &apos;s feet .
evidence shows how significant changes can be brought to the end of the spread of HIV prevention and the spread of the infection of life .
this clinical test will lead us to a step closer to the full understanding of the EP &apos;s advantages .
it is now important for the clinical test to be adopted as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV , and to bring us a step closer to the proliferation of HIV in society . &quot;
the price of electricity rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
in order for the next day of electricity , the difference between the cost of electricity in the electricity sector was reduced between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania to EUR 1.94 , compared to EUR 7.71 , in June this year .
the main reason for the difference is the richness of the Lithuanian Swedish community .
in Estonia , the mid @-@ term review of electricity in the medium @-@ sized electricity amounted to EUR 34.33 , and the price was expected to reach 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price of 5 % of 36.27 has fallen by the price of five per cent .
in Finland , the price of EUR 34.17 was EUR 34.17 , and the electricity exchange stock of Nord half was a systemic price of 26.37 .
prices rose according to 12 and seven per cent .
between Estonia and Finland , the electricity between Estonia and Finland moved from the hours of last month to Estonia and 16 % of the lessons from Estonia .
the remaining nine % of the two countries did not take place in the next few days .
between Estonia and Latvia , the electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved from Estonia to Latvia , and 73 % of the hours were at the disposal of the entire transmission capacity .
in the last trading day of July , Nashirq OMX on the market may be around € 34 and in September 37 to € 34 and in September .
the price of carbon dioxide in electricity prices last month and the transactions took place at 5.04 @-@ 5.47 per tonne .
life of high @-@ life life - a half @-@ call and smart designer have changed its small Earls in the middle of a house
Joanne Leigh , former bankers , who is passionate to property renewal and , in the wake of its great Knightsbridge , had a home in 2014 .
it is in the first time of Mrs Anne Ternez , and that Mr Joanne does not have a copy of the packed and logans that have been sold on the table , a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before this lived , I lived with the former co @-@ operation of Knightsbridge , a lot of more soil , &quot; said Joanne .
&quot; I was something that would be tantamount to the price of my contribution .
it was shown to me about the Earls and had the same high layers .
I am in a doctor and I did the same day .
since the first visit , this 93 @-@ rsquare metre has passed a total of complete innovation .
at the beginning , it was one of the sleeping and a complex sleep , a leep drowa , to get a piece of kitchen , Mrs Joanne wanted to add a space of storage and in a half that to take advantage of high rates .
&quot; I wanted high rates , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
in writing . - ( FR ) Mr President , Mr Azadi Notting Hillis , the architectural and design of Aadi Notting Hillis Duck &amp; D , to take advantage of 3.8 m , and to create a home , which would not simply be the point of development , but a place where Joanne could live .
it was not high enough to add two room for each other , so the architecture of the architecture was to create a quasi @-@ win situation in which it can stand up .
Mr Harbour was supposed to be a creative approach .
&quot; the industrial design is quite complex , &apos; explains it .
&quot; we had to reorganise space , so that they are based on each other , without which they should be absorbed .
it was not just a platform to build a platform , but we used the construction of a termedesign so as to be the right thing , as well as at the age of aluter . &quot;
it enabled the Erfanil to create two @-@ year @-@ old @-@ milly in the room for each other , with a large number of dramatic elements .

the golden furniture of Peegeled , silver details and retroambmental Serge Mouille is stressing room for style .
the use of Danes plays a role in the inclusion of theatre , spatial and lighting .
in the short corridor , the mirrors have been included in the same way that it would seem longer .
the Knight leaves the impression in the case of the second half @-@ out @-@ up window .
at the end of the return , the grab will provide for all Joanne &apos;s eating and the glass requirement for all Joanne .
the cost of life is adding to the carpet , which is not being used to shut down , if it is not used , creating a shining space .
the kitchen kitchen does not have anything new .
however , in this kitchen , it is a unique fact that this is the issue of the resounding @-@ up of the archiage .
&quot; it went a little in the design work , &apos; explains Mr terasstrengthened &apos; strengthen &apos; from the spodied MDF &apos; .
&quot; this is a counterpart , and this is why it is very simply a matter if it is to be rejected . &quot;
thanks to space and housing smart use , Joanne is now more than 16 square metres , an additional sleeping holiday and a better recovery plan .
&quot; after all , it is up to the woos that you are selling - or what is going to give property value , &apos; say Ercritically .
&quot; in Kinsware of the property land , an outdated form and makes calculations on the basis of the surface area . &quot;
here , they have been able to increase the wastage , using high quality materials , which will be a luxury of a space .
&quot; materials are those that you are missing and which will thus help to create an emotional link to the home , &quot; says Erfan .
&quot; you do not live in an electric cable .
it is important , but it does not give heart to the language . &apos;
this shows that a good design and increased area will help to make a quite astonishing way of anything .
in fact , they can even create a desire not to leave , as happened in Joanne .
the main issue of Jensen is the culmination of Mrs Chicago &apos;s povella , who will compete with a colleague from his counterparts .
it does not count on any kind of money , which is not forgotten by any kind of ethics .

the pockery of the advisers will give the father of his feet in Chicago &apos;s great buildings to think about truly important things , such as religion , good , love ... , without untouched on the disaster , even the disaster .
after the third place , where the son &apos;s father opens up , there is a feeling that the film @-@ makers will certainly be able to obtain the objective of informing the audience , because even the most initial heart is unable to keep doctors back to the hospital of cancer in order to see the suffering of breast cancer .
if the pog is falling and his situation does not seem to be hopeless , the father and the father of his work will understand the morality of its work and make a good job for the people who seek a job .
now I am in a sense of self @-@ betting - if there is a film in the hands of the film , then I will be rewarded with your own @-@ heartedness after the film is not a mistake , but I would perhaps be able to praise at least one surprise in the case of the risk of the latter .
for a moment , there is suspicion that the rest of the coffers - if the husband is a hospital and a man of torn in a hospital and a man in the middle of a girl ) .
however , the Poeg is a panacea for it , and although his father has just lost its work , it is positive because it is now a time to deal with family .
I can also be well aware of myself - I can see the end of America quite well !
it is the honour of having a film well constructed , all the necessary elements are available .
it will be a case that can be privatised , exhibitors are good and morally : money is not the most important thing in life .
it will bring this film into a well @-@ up .
the new staff of the staff of the Trumpg are planned to limit the consumption of the President &apos;s media .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John Fs will be able to do so .
in this case , it would be the first .
it writes that the new staff of the White House will be in order to limit President Trumpin , including the news , in the hope that it will keep a cross @-@ fire balance .
in this regard , a reporter has been covered by Mr Josh Dawseylt :
&quot; if the new staff of the white house in John Fs , Mr President of the first day on his first day , he received a key problem with the President Donald Trumpi Valled Maneeded , which he intends to resolve in the hands of the President in the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly said to officials that the information must be carried out , whether on paper or meetings , because President would make better decisions if it is shared by good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly seems completely logical , but also others have tried and they have been trying to decommission his media on the monitoring of his media consumption .
President Trumpi &apos;s relationship on television goes for decades , and now that he is in the White Mat , there is no habits in his television watch .
&quot; if the candidate Trum was discredited from the unfair media opinion , it was shown to show him that he was reflected in an unscrupulous manner , &quot; said the former campaign , Sam Nunberg , in February Politicol .
the Political tico Withel has signed at the time that &apos; the &apos; six @-@ pack &apos; , according to the &apos; six @-@ pack &apos; , is a key element of the control of the Trumpi Twitter , if to ensure that it is a personal media consumption in a stable manner . &quot;
good .
however , the idea that the habits used by Twitter by the Trumpg have never been &apos; control &apos; , is ridiculous .
perhaps these campaigns are something that the rest of us do not know about what the rest of us do not know about the fact that , without their intervention , it would have been even more unusual for their intervention .
we will probably never be able to know about the defats that you did not postal in Trum .
if he was able to save or rescue a couple of times if he was able to save them , their efforts are worthy of this .
however , no one has been able to obstruct Trumph consistently .
part of the problem is that , in the White Report of the White Paper on competition , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception , by conveying the Truy material that supports their views on the world , but may not always be credible .
the whole story of a policy @-@ based policy of tico wrote to the President of the advisers of the Centre for a strategically questionable value of information to the President .
one of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is the next :
&quot; the current and former Trumple will say that Trum can respond to a negative press , especially as regards the adverse effects of the infection , explosive , with an explosive approach to identifying the source of departure .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone gave a reasserful copy of a copy of the Internet provocation to Mr Charles C. HotNews.com article , which accused the staff of Mr Katie Walshi in order to have a white house for a number of leaflets in Wales .
it is not a difference that Johnson has been blocked by Twitter , or that he did not provide any specific evidence or that he has also made it wrong in the past and withdrawn them .
Trum &apos;s article and started subjecting to Walshi . &quot;
the Goldmacher added that the time of the time of the staff of the previous Reince Eebfast and the White House , Rob Porter , has tried to establish a system for management and documentation of documents reaching the system . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same for three months later .
perhaps it will prove to be a driver of Prititia more efficient , but , Mr Truf , there is still an impulse and his aberable competition remains on behalf of the influence .
these changes are changing the very difficult elements of the mission .
music music received from abroad to the capital of the capital to do not have a chance to go .
there is a lot of foreign affairs in the city centre in Tallinn .
those with whom the leaflet have been admitted , acknowledged that in the age of the town of the town , without permission to be held in the town of Mayors .
the first we have found the gates of Viru Viru today , who were the same as many of them in many of them .
it was clear to see that there were musicians of the flats and divisions in absentia , who were to spend one of the jargon .
despite the fact , the only woman played by a woman in the same way as a rhythh story , while one man in his or her side has been brought together by the three palprs and furniture .
the third man was one of them in absentia and smokered by a heavy @-@ hearter @-@ hearted advantage .
these three chambers did not allow ourselves to upset the people of furniture .
the ACordioni has played a gesture of Boeing and the palliates in Bob told that the streets in the streets and the money after the money .
the aim of this House was to collect the same day on the same day from Finland to the same day .
apart from the question of whether they asked for a suburban licence for the sake of the age , Noemi and Bob heads were shaken .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never be more than a day in one city or a couple of and most of them pledged for a period of time or something .
there is no point in paying for this , explained by Bob .
if we were to revisit Viru at around 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are at the hands of musicians and go up to them .
this House collapses and collapses to Viru &apos;s collapses and bags , Viru Centre .
there are three Polish people in the streets of Viru , one of whom played a fifth , a second klaring , and the third was the use of electronic gavert .
&quot; we are here to give people a entertainment to be able to spread music and joy and , in order for the money to earn money for fuel and living , a trio @-@ headed Mivosh .
they say that they are aware of the fact that there must be a licence for the urban government to take place .
&quot; of course we do not have this &apos; said &apos; , he said .
however , we hope that if people enjoy our musicians , there is no problem .
of course , if the police have to be , we will go elsewhere , but we must try , in the annex .
the Estonian Bank in the euro area of the public sector of central banks in the euro area , in July 149 million of bonds , grew up to € 4.36 billion to € 4.36 billion .
the Central Bank will not have a more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Mr Hansson , has made clear before the whole of all members of the country , that the system of central banks in the euro system covers three different purchasing programmes : the bonds of the financial sector ( in the case of the financial sector ) , but the bonds of the public sector ( PSPP ) and public bonds ( PSPP ) .
the Central Bank is buying bonds from the market so as to encourage bonds to invest in investors elsewhere .
the impact of purchases falls on the production of lower @-@ risk assets , and it will motivate investors to take greater risk .
in general , the government bonds in the public sector are generally buying bonds from the government of its own country , with other countries &apos; bonds .
since Estonia has not issued bonds , Estonia will do so in the limits of the so @-@ called replacement purchases .
the Internet is also working on the central banks in those countries where the supply of these sovereign bonds is limited .
the Estonian Bank is generally buying bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian Bank is buying bonds from the asset programme since March 2015 .
in the meantime , bonds were also realised , but the 2016 June 2016 Bank will no longer buy bonds from the year June 2016 .
in the name of the euro area central banks , since June and Estonia , the Italian Central Bank is buying bonds from the Finnish Central Bank .
migratory movements are being ignored and the &quot; millions of business &quot; will be returned .
some of the richest owners of the West Midlands are once again in the face of the confrontations of confrontation with determination , who have ignored the cumbering of the crack @-@ out of their cotton , to win back from their cotton .
the migratory movements have parked their 20 tracks in the run @-@ up to the rock of the &quot; millions of business &quot; in Sopik .
they have returned , together with the horses , the army and of the trucks of cars , when they were only in May , without being confused with a degree of confusion , which led to the invasion of their invasion council .
the act group found a weakness in defence limits , turning their vehicles without unblocking the part that was left to pot .
Marurious people have sursurrated the Sozulk Council , saying that the &apos; problem in dealing with the &apos; problem &apos; .
one of the anonymous residents said : &apos; they are in a Monday evening after their exclusion from the Benady Heathon , where they were loved by stoning .
the Council must be discredited that they would act , because they have been involved in dealing with the problem .
the migratory movements were there in May , they were going to go , and they are now back again .
this was the case yesterday evening , which is likely to be more . &quot;
he added : &apos; Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect their parks .
I live on the road to street , and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay a mandate to pay if the Council is not even able to prevent such a matter . &quot;
one of the local players who also wanted to remain anonymous , said : &apos; it is ridiculous , but we saw how the last few of these emigrants , and are already taking place under a new offensive .
this time , the number has increased and the grassland is even in the horses of the horse . &quot;
the representative of the Someat Council , said : &apos; we are aware that the road to the street in the south of the street is unacceptable , and we are working with the Sozulli police to take the necessary legal measures so that they can move as soon as possible .
in the collection of evidence , it is very helpful if many local people in any form of antisocial or criminal behaviour are a case with a number of 101 or criminal behaviour , when you call a number of 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation , if we are presenting the case to them . &quot;
the Weekgraph festival will also visit the Minister of Culture , among others , on the Minister for Culture , who is pleased that it has been able to bring the real world top names in Estonia .
on the question of the Weekgraph Festival , it is so important that it is so important to ask the Saar , that it should be asked from all those who have been fully enjoying the heads of the Festival .
however , it recognises that the real offices have come from the beginning of the University .
&quot; looking at this level of artists , which has been able to bring back to Estonia , it will be the absolute senior names of this music circus , which is often the case in our hands , the Minister for Culture .
what are the artists in the festival of Saart himself in the most words ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old age , and I am certainly one of the most recent doctors in the old Armin van Bnuren , who took place yesterday evening .
according to his poster , all of us are at some point in a position , at some point , too , &apos; say it &apos; .
however , it still brings a number of names , such as Chainthia , Deadmau5 , Knifea .
of course , our Estonian authorities , starting with NOx P and can be read a whole series of .
in reality , the &apos; concentration of names &apos; is very high , says it .
look at a video on a video .
in the midst of the criticism of the authors of the Audi , car manufacturers have been hit by an increase of 850 000 per vehicle for diesel .
a day before the Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW , the BMW , has said that there is no more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the BMW chairman , the company believes that &apos; there is a more intelligent option than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including BMW homeless , in Munich , which has considered a ban on diesel vehicles or restriction .
Daimler announced on Tuesday , that more than three million members of Mercedes depugas emissions to reduce diesel engines in Europe .
no company has described them as a re @-@ call for these operations .
European car manufacturers have been in favour of advertising in Europe and in the United States , in order to help to comply with the regulations imposed on carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen oxide from diesel engines are considered to be carcinogenic and may lead to asthma .
at the same time , the cost of neutralising the exhaust emissions of diesel vehicles for industrial companies is also increasing , making cars a difficult price for keeping cars into a competitive way .
at the same time , while the German car manufacturers are under @-@ depth investigation , the Chancellor of Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of unlocking the powerful car manufacturers , and ignoring the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to avoid the repetition of the mistakes of Volkswagen who is silent in silence , which allowed the use of the gas to be adapted to regulatory regulations for the time of testing , but it rose to normal driving times .
a number of Volkswagen has been charged with the United States , and others are under the Atlantic inquiry .
last month , the former President of the Audi Audi engine Development department was arrested in Germany .
the former President of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and is therefore not protected for extradition and can go to the court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year the Audi , the Volkswagen , the Volkswagen in Germany , when the authorities accused the installation of the audit system in order to circumvent the requirements of the European gas volume by extending its investigation , which was focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Audi can be a great blow to the Volkswagen , a great blow to the manufacturer of car manufacturers , a disproportionately large proportion of Volkswagen &apos;s profits .
Estonia &apos;s schools will be bought by 20 000 euro for the European Union .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union by 1 September from 1 September .
together with a measure of measurement , the European Union &apos;s flag of 570 educational institutions will receive a measure of measurement .
it is set out in the field of misguided efforts , which must be carried out in a high @-@ quality print in the field of quality information , as well as the rewarding of the ERR portal .
the text is the text : &quot; Kinasa Estonia &apos;s School of Estonia for the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the cost of 570 flags is a price of EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , or one flag goes for EUR 35 .
murder of a journalist , murder of the growing threat in Mexico
Nalalgoce workers will normally gather on Wednesday days to look at the most recent chaos in the State of the Sinti , the most recent losers in the state of organised crime , corrupt officials and ceased drug wars .
however , today , they have been assembled up to discuss their own safety .
they are told that it is important to change its stupid change .
the two parents will discuss , which appears to be safer : whether to bring children into office , which was a sign of an attack in 2009 , or to leave them home .
the Turks have signed a room for the next three words : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask the reporters to give the names of the report to the call to provide the evidence that there is no need for proof , it is enough to give the impressions and internal sentiments .
the presence of the government or cartels is suspected of the drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists in the whole list of the whole list of people who are making a threat to the chaos in Mexico .
there is no breath of violence , and which has been more controlled by the public purse , the majority of them account for the protection of journalists , according to the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights , according to the fact that , from President Enrique Pena , the appointment of at least 25 in December 2012 , at least 25 589 journalists , since attacks and threats , and has been killed in the course of this year , at least seven journalists in the seven states .
the latest deaths include a source of inspiration and inspiration , Riodoce , Javier Valdez Cardenas .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &apos; written in Valdez one of the books on drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though its presence can perceive the breadth of the masters in Riodoce building a huge picture of the average infinary at Valdezz , together with a letter of the &apos; Justice &apos; , and two 30nly reporters , Aaris Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , the T @-@ shirke , which has an image of his wife , or her compot .
the meeting will take place in less than two months after the death , Reporters will be discussing a common trauma , their nightmare stories , unthinkable , paranotics .
although , in 2010 , a separate public prosecution service was created to address cases of journalists , the protection of journalists from the Committee on Civil prosecution has been held accountable to the judicial prosecution of journalists .
as in the case of murder and organised crime in most of the annual drugs and organised crime , the number of thousands of deaths will also be allowed to court by journalists .
in the case of Riodoce , there will be a continuation of the anti @-@ grassroots violence , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the murderers and justice , there is no security meeting with Ibarra , said that there is a lot of benefits .
&quot; it is worth wasting our time here at this meeting , &quot; says he .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , there are no mistrust of all . &quot;
on 15 May morning , Culiacin Riodoce , the capital of the State of the State , Culiacin .
he has managed to travel only a few quarters before , before two men he gave red Toyota Coroles , he forced the car to come out and was shot at 12 times , which is expected to be the name of the &apos; twelfth river &apos; .
the armed man travelled to Valdez &apos;s car , and he made an emergency in the vicinity .
Mr Valdez was 50 years old .
he was left in a woman and two adults .
Culiacis freely circulated freely .
however , there is only a silence on the subject of Valdez .
since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of the United States in January , one of the most bloody battles in the country is one of the most bloody battles in the country , because rivalries are fighting in a vacuum of power .
it is not a difference that a few people in the streets of the AOoa on the streets or even a number of months or even many of the wounds of the wounds are dispatched in cold @-@ fashions , which are more than many of the homes of many living .
let us forget for a moment that the peace time refers to the fact that only one cartel of the global state of the drug traffic routes and road traffic routes to the United States is just a cartel .
despite all this and the fact that Mr Valdez was fully aware of the risks involved in his work , Riodoce and the President of Iceland on May Bojorquez ( 60 ) have not been able to protect his friend .
he believes that the slaughter was encouraged by two errors .
the first of these was Guzman &apos;s pockles , in the face of the breath of Guzman Damaso Damaso Lopezevery , an interview which took place in February .
this piece of correspondence could be alluded to the suspect of the monks of the gangs who bought all the books immediately when they arrived at the time of time .
the second mistake was that the Valdez was not forced to leave his own security country after it took place in one of the newspapers that have been reflected in one of the same story .
the Valdez was legalised , both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point against violence against journalists in Mexico .
he has lived in a long way so long that his friends and colleagues were expected to have a permanent presence .
he worked in the newspaper Noroka in 2003 , when he joined the five colleagues in order to create a Riodoce , sold 50 @-@ dollar @-@ to @-@ dollar .
Bojorquez said that it was impossible to address the issue of the press without being treated with the drug problem . &quot;
the real amount of time has been raised by your courage and honesty , and sales and advertising grew up .
there are strong studies on sport without censorship , without fear and readers , which they were able to read stories , which no one else has dared to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Riodoce , the newspaper has won the award of its Latin American mirrors for the prestigious Maria Moors Caboti .
in the same year , the Valdez journalists &apos; Protection of journalists won the award of the International Press Freedom Prize for his courage to follow the Mexican drugs , all of which it leads to .
he admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to move forward , &quot; said the AKK &apos;s award .
last October , he said a television channel Rompeviento TV in interviews that drug trafficking is a way of life in our fragile way .
&quot; the &apos; head of the task &apos; will be a task that is accompanied by the second opportunity to play in the hands of the journalists .
I do not want me to ask me that what I did in the face of so many deaths , or why I did not say what is happening . &apos;
the Sodoce collectives , the Valdez , a joyman , who , as low @-@ favoured , warther , friend who divided embryony and advice , teachers who knew how to survive .
they are in favour of the support of his stupid .
he always made a barrel .
he went on from the office of El Khadraoui and the father of the province of El Salvador on the table at the same time .
now they are asking whether his &apos; love &apos; was sent to him .
his death has also put them into question as to how best to work and stay in life .
&quot; they do not like a blind eye to their women , their children , their own business , their secret landing orders , which are used for transporting drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been left , &quot; said Bojorquez .
the result is even in the best times a strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ care .
the trust of their instintors .
if it is fragranted by a dubious , hody .
according to Mr Riodoce , Mr Villarreali , the problem is that the &apos; fragrances will be deceived ... &apos; and this is the case with Mr Jights . &quot;
his and other say that the OAS does not apply to the old rules , just as they do not apply to Thailand , Veracruzi , Guerreros or other states that are home to the poisoning of revenue @-@ generating routes , weak institutions and corrupt officials of state officials .
the engineering is constantly changing .
in the space where the Riodoce workers were met for security training , we suddenly had no longer allowed mobile phones ; some days before it was revealed that only the buckery of the buck has been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists .
two policemen from the house in front of the House have been relaxed by 40 @-@ mill six months .
the government set out a more courageous Riodoce office , which is located in the middle of a four @-@ time building in Culiacan .
some reporters were wondering whether these police officers are among their 50 % of police officers , whose Governor himself is unreliable .
several months have passed since the reporters have travelled to the mountain places where control is de facto drug gangs .
the report by Riodoce on this week addressed three main pillars .
one of them was the murder of Mr Chavez , Mrs Chavez , the murder of the guise of the former son .
in addition , they also revealed the lack of money from the government in the home town of the home town .
from one of the most expensive restaurants from the Culiacan from the Culiacan , the Prosecutor &apos;s office and the Prosecutor &apos;s office , the most expensive restaurant was kidnapped .
there was no formal announcement of those who were kidnapped or how it happened , so we had to be cautious when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of the restaurant , both the drug traffickers and the people of the authorities .
Reporter has been informed about public documents that a restaurant is registered as a politician , who is in power in the present institution of the Revolutionary Party ( IRP ) , which dominated all levels of policy at almost all levels of the whole century .
at the last time , several IRP accusations have been accused of a wide range of cases in corruption .
in Villaring asked the reporters to write previous incidents at the same time , including in the Guzman pog of Guzman &apos;s poet El Chapo .
just a few months earlier , readers have been looking for the Valdez komn to obtain information from the best sources of kidnappings .
&apos;sooner we have already known what happened &apos; , &apos; 46 @-@ year @-@ old Villars , whose motives have earned the body &apos;s name , El Flaco .
&quot; now all channels have been broken down by our sources of communication . &quot;
the office of Valdez &apos;s office has become a storage space and a sticker , which protests against the killing of journalists , and there has been something that they could never wait for the activists to press for the press .
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a couple of eyes and direction next morning to the local Prosecutor &apos;s cabinet in the next morning .
Mr Ake is the case of three days in the West of Michoacan in the State of Valdez .
it has been found in contempt for the death of its DNA tests , according to the use of DNA tests .
journalists are over the whole of the country &apos;s voice , and it is crippling organised proteins on the roads and buildings , &apos; SOS press &apos; .
on this day , the President of Bojorquez is in Washington , trying to collect international support for the justice of Valdez &apos;s case .
the day after the death of the Valdez , the WOO , accused of the death of Ramirez , was accused by the authorities for journalists , and because of the truth about their slaughter .
after this , he asked that he would focus on the part of the government , when it is concerned that hatred has been affected by objectivity .
Mr Valdez was repeatedly said that the Mexican journalists are organised by organised crime , co @-@ culprits and indifference in the form of a &apos; restricted society &apos; .
in its last paper , the &apos; drug press &apos; wrote that the reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also the command of politicians and security forces , who have organised crime in an area of organised crime .
the Media Monitoring Group in Articulo 19 attached a more than half of the attacks on journalists in the police and national officials .
&quot; in Mexico , you are going to be silent , because you want to be silent , &apos; said Ramirez .
obviously , there is a real impact on blood .
no one will forget the death of six years ago in the north @-@ half of the bloc and Maria Elizabeth Macikas , six years ago .
he was found with a letter , which was probably signed by a cartel in LOS Zetas : &apos; I am here for his report . &quot;
in addition to his pelagic , computer glass and ears were beaten by the computer .
some publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the newspapers El Norte , in the northern border state , Chihuahuina , following the killing of their fellow respondents in the Beehi Beehi in March .
others will move forward as a newspaper El Manana de Nualo Laredo after the murder of the President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez has publicly asked us , &apos; What you want , &apos; What you want to do , &apos; .
some journalists are in the state of state or even the country .
this is the nerve decision .
it is difficult to find a job , and they still need to get to the streets to prevent the dangers .
and sometimes they are behind , such as the photographgraph Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered together with four women &apos;s people in 2015 , in one of the three months after Veracruz .
those who remain in place and continue to work must be restructured every day .
Ibarra , who wanted to be a poker , recognises that the circulation of drug trafficking is frightening him .
&quot; Mexico is on the road to hell and I am talking about a reporter , &quot; he said .
one of the recent midnight of the recent Friday when the latest number was already besned in the case of Riodoce , the editchers of Riodoce , and robbed the beer when suddenly suddenly started to relax all telephone numbers .
there was 19 people who have died in the context of the Fzatlank Bank and the forces of the security forces , which have been killed in the exchange of rivalries and security forces .
the war is continuing to continue , as has been promised by several of the messages that have been found in the region .
on the same hand , the reporters made the news for a mobile phone in Riodoce on the website of Riodoce .
in the next day , changes were needed .
the Sireeners have been overlooked by another further fire in the region .
Bojorquez piilus in the hands of the police officers who are on track to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not have this at least .
the mass collection of Ajale has fallen under the mass collection of his average , which has a finger at the whole of the Sinti , was delivered by Riodoce workers in his footnote .
&quot; how can we think about the closure , &apos; said Bojorquez , &apos; when , on the same day , when Javier was killed , he asked him to be able to make his report on his report ? &apos;
Mr Dinosa used the guard against enemies in order to prevent enemies .
at first sight , it seems as a form , although rather frightening .
scientists have now unveiled the first bread in the case of the unbelievable massacres of Canada , which is so well known that the experts have described it as the &apos; dinosaurs Mona Lisia &apos; .
it is even more well @-@ known that it was even possible to identify that he had been covered by the sine and his past was somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the reports published in the Roology published in Biology were described as &apos; best for the most survivors &apos; , which has ever been found &apos; and if one of the best figures in the world &apos; .
on the other hand , it is a new nodosaurlation which lived in the middle of an io @-@ age , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
it is incredibly good to maintain that , in a period of science , who describe this &apos; truly significant &apos; .
this is covered by animal feed , according to a national Geoonian , according to a list of phosphorus , which has ever been found .
on 21 March 2011 , Mr McMurray of Millenium in the mining Strait was replaced by Mr McMurray , in Canada , on 21 March 2011 .
he has struck something that did not remind the kids , and decided to look more closely .
the phosphorus were found in Royal Tyrrell , the museum of the Royal Tyrrell .
the next six years was developed to refer the animal to 2 500 @-@ age ( 1100 @-@ kilometres ) .
after all this hard work , the final result is now to be prepared to bring the public back .
&quot; if a little bridge is to be put in place , it is almost to believe that he sleep , &apos; said the leading author , Caleb Brown , the doctor Royal Tyrrell , in which the presence of the tiacity is being extracted .
&quot; this goes to the history of one of the most beautiful and most vulnerable sectors of the science , Mona in Mona . &apos;
he also found that the researchers were aware that it has been known as those who are covered by soya and recalls the divisive tank , which is likely to have a significant impact on meat in the food sector .
it used the red and white defence colours in the light of the red and white defence , so as to hide behind the dautors , and implemented the overshadows that are referred to and used by many of today &apos;s animals .
it allowed experts , according to the fact , to a better surroundings and enemies of the enemy , because the larger number of figures were likely to be hunted in a shunt .
it was for the first time in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrell Palace in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrell .
researchers have now studied the existence and gave the name of Mr Bothedouble , the Museum of Marxchelle , who had the famous team , which spent more than 7000 hours , to be made more than 7000 hours .
thanks to the very good preservation of the father , Dr Mitchell and the team of scientists in the international community have been able to documentary the form and size of landings .
they discovered the subject of dissecrets , in the nature of animal species , which means that the intrusion on half was a metre than the lower .
although it is widespread , the bread will come as a surprise , as Boeing is much greater than those who are currently living in the face of the shadows .
this implies that the fact that there is a great deal of invitations in the spotlight of other musicians , in order to give preference to the status of the survivors rather than the opposite of their survival tactics .
however , most of the animals used in today &apos;s face of today &apos;s dissecrets - such as fear , sebers or archagraphy - are a lot smaller and more vulnerable , which indicates that the pressure of nodosaurs had to be truly struggling to survive .
&quot; a strong hunt of a large and large number of soya @-@ based areas shows how dangerous the kidnapping of those who were kidnapped in the centre of the age @-@ old era has been called &apos; Brown &apos; .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds at the same time revealed that the skin of the doctor was in the red sludge .
scientists will continue to create an investigation in order to get hotlines for this life , including the content of the devil , in order to identify what the animal has been in the last place .
they believe that the dinosasis failed in the ruins of the river , thereby bringing the influx into the sea , where he was left to the ocean of the ocean .
at this time , Mr Albertini was the same soe as the South @-@ FEast , and rivers and oceans are likely to be much further than the internal land currently .
&quot; this nodosaurus is a truly significant , as it is fully covered by a poisonous skin , while it has also remained a triple @-@ dimensional , while maintaining the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal is now almost identical to the same age .
in order to rebuild this , there is a great deal of imagination - it is enough to make it possible to build a label and that it seems to be a sleep . &quot;
the crisis was the time when there were huge two searches on the ground in the countryside - heterogeneous .
although the rock of all King Tyrannoons lived for millions of years later than in Boeing , it could be astounded by some of its predecessors .
these include Acrocanperourus , 38 footwear ( 11.5 metres ) and six tonnes of weighed monster .
researchers whose recent findings have been published in the magazine Biology , believe that Boeing has been invaded after death in the sea , and this mutilation .
on 21 March 2011 , Mr McMurray was discovered on 21 March 2011 , when he used the mining of Millenium in the North Albertas McMurray .
according to the Muuseum , it is the most vulnerable in the world in the world , including skin and soya , and this is a comprehensive concentration of up to pumps .
these are on average 18 years ( five metres ) , and the very long @-@ old , up to 3 000 ( 1300 kg ) .
on the shoulders of this , two 20 customs @-@ old ora &apos;s ora &apos;s letters .
scientists believe that this is covered by the adjacent of flora and mixtures from the current Western Canada until the flooded river in the sea .
however , the land at the heart of the sea has helped to maintain an excellent detail in detail .
it is so well placed on this particular line , so that the headlines are still covered by noise @-@ based soya beans , which are still covered by the headlines .
as Mr Greshko wrote in the National Geoonian magazine National Geoonian : &apos; it is the same rare thing as a loep &apos; .
what more I look at this is , the incredible it seems to be .
pre @-@ school leavers are still covered by the cruelty @-@ based soar soar bean stung .
it is a better presentation by his or her , and the way in which it is silenced is simplistic .
I will be able to bring about the solems in his winter . &quot;
how does the act found the answer to the question of &apos; today &apos; .
on 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was a complete shock .
just a day after the trip to New York travel , this storm , by the end of StLouically resident , is going to travel to a fixed @-@ up @-@ up site , on Facebook .
he was not in addition to the post @-@ school compilation of their own schools .
there was a letter : &apos; police killing just 18 years &apos; , and he is still in the street . &quot;
he was in the mess why someone else was not informed about his flow to postal , which is why he closed the Facebook and opened Twitter .
Pideally @ TheePowah had several times on his line on the lines of his time .
Mr St, the region from the region from the region , which has been sent back in real time , with the death of Mr Browni , the death of 18 @-@ year @-@ old people , who killed Ferguson Missourin , who killed the white police officer in Ferguson .
he gave a picture of Browni living in a poor , which in the street , in a street , which is to be held out of four hours .
&quot; this is crazy , &apos; it was a crazy &apos; .
however , death was not a new one for his or her community .
he has made its phone , but it saw later this evening , which said this time to the Conference of the people of Canfield Drive .
the photos of photographs in the police and the frightening people , and man who claimed themselves to be the father of Browni and keep a label of the &apos; Ferber police &apos; , were killed by my weapon in the case of the Ferber police . &quot;
he reviewed real @-@ time flows where the police officer was faced by the group of protestors .
in the second video , the second police officer , said that he said , and potato : &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; . &apos;
the Fercian remember how he struck itself from thought : &apos; it is unusual . &apos;
&quot; this is not a murder of this kind , which we are used to and what we could call a typical &apos; . &apos;
I felt that at the moment , I was horrified .
I was angry and I was afraid . &apos;
he booked the return of the flight and went home on the next day .
in writing . - ( FR ) Mr President , at 23 , he went to her to his six @-@ year tyrel , and decided that they will travel next morning with Fergusoni .
what the Fercian and Fergusonevery three years took place in the next three years is the key issue in the new documentary document , &apos; Wholean street &apos; in the &apos; Wholean street &apos; ? &apos; ( &apos; My street today &apos; ) , which is turning back on 11 August .
this is the story of survival and protested , love and loss of love , strength and resilience , from the point of view of those people who live in this community and who have responded to the answer .
if Mrs Ferreira , together with the tyrant , who had a lip sticker , and it is a suitable kroon , a Fergusoni sister , who spoke again on the subject that they had before this morning many times before , and the living conditions in the past , and the conditions of living .
&quot; if I taught you how the whole community had to fight for their rights ? &apos; recalls himself in question .
&quot; we are at the moment in Fergusoni , because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I did not have her to take it , &apos; said Mr Ferreira later .
&quot; what is happening now is the case in the past ... in the past .
it must be aware of this and to see it in mid @-@ term .
he must learn from a activist and organisation of the activist and , at the same time , feel the different layers of experience and living conditions , and what we need to do to be free and free .
even if I succeed in raising him so that it is not a person who has been brutally beaten against racism , it is not a small girl from another square girl .
I feel that I would like to make a disservice to him if I would defend him for the world . &quot;
the first stop that they made by Mr Fergusoni was the South Naissanti on the road - a police officer in the ice area , which was a kind of kind of camp , where the activists were waiting for news of the police officer , Darren Wilson , who was not charged by the end of the accusation .
there was a call for the initiative , and his daughter , the power of the local business , who prepared the south of the South .
they put food bags and helped to share these protests .
for the Ferweapon , there was slow to take shape for a new type of activist .
&quot; my activist change fully after 9 August , &quot; said he said that when he was a Missouri @-@ Stle , he was a student from a girl , he was a student from the President of the Union and focused on food justice and health inequalities in communities .
&quot; I did not have any experience of organisation .
that is all simply a shame . &apos;
at the end of the week , Mrs Ferreira would have one film @-@ sponsor Sabaah Folayanevery .
the FolayI said that his and film operator Lucas Alvarado wanted to document what is just happening .
the question of Mr Ferrelli was the question : &apos; do you try to documentary or find a story that can be used ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases of cases where people - often painful - will come to the community and are trying to benefit from this formula and resilience .
the FolayI explained in a recent interview : &apos; we have heard that the voice of Ferguson and the increase in people &apos;s voice will not be heard and we wanted to do this differently . &quot;
the FolayI has already had the hands of the Dams Davga , an artificial image of the region , who was known as a prisoner of prisoners who have been sentenced to death .
its involvement made the project closer to the Fercian , and yet six other local ones , whose film &apos; Whohotaets &apos; and a team after the shooting of Browni have been trapped for years .
&quot; this documentary is not talking about us or with us , but we are talking about our ourselves , &apos; said Davis .
&quot; for me , it was important for me how these people are portrayed , because I am also perceived . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrels - to show that the movement is not a &apos; organ &apos; , but a community of the community &apos; , as the Folayan - it was the most open part of his film .
as a result , the &apos; Wholean street &apos; is documented ? &apos; , a surprisingly personal aspect of the life of Ferrely , such as the raft and the execution of his wife .
&quot; I felt that , as I would be like , &apos; said , Mr Ferreira &apos; said , when he was ready for the town of the town .
&quot; however , I realised that the human trafficking of this work and the human trafficking of people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the Fercian &apos;s story emphasises and reiterates the role of LGBT Women &apos;s role in the wider Black Sea , Mr Matter mobile .
two of the three initiators of the movement of the social media in the case of the killing of teenagers Trayvon Martini in 2012 in the social media in the wake of the death of Hyvon Martini , Mr BlackLivesMatter , is homosexual .
&quot; in a leading role , homosexual women have kept the movement in general , &apos; said Ferreira , &apos; and this is precisely because we constantly need to fight on several fronts .
Roma women must bear the burden of homosexual women across the board . &quot;
the Folayan agreed , noting that &apos; the movement is truly in life in a life @-@ to @-@ life situation by women and many of them have beaches &apos; homosexuals &apos; .
he claims that &apos; it is not a kind of type of opportunity to create a kind of equal opportunity &apos; - the Ferrelli was not elected for his identity because of his identity .
&quot; he was a person , one of whom is the right energy , &apos; he said .
&quot; however , this is not a coincidence that he was held directly on the line , because there is a great deal at stake at the level of homosexual female women in the game .
his energy can be perceived by the screens . &quot;
at the same time , the news cameras , Fergusonist , has long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
in the wake of a statement by Ferrelle , the punishment imposed on the blocking of the road is still over 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region , which it calls on to be home , simply &apos; a massive threat &apos; .
however , it still needs to be an important mantra , which has been fed by the memory of the past since the Fergusoni streets of Fergusoni .
&quot; our duty is to combat our freedom .
our duty is to win .
we have to love each other and support .
we do not have to lose anything about our chains . &quot;
7 nips , how after Weekgraph leak over the Weekle
some of the hens are going to find a breaders after a scarce pipe , so that we are suffering from this , too .
or in the light of the word &apos; brain hunt &apos; , the pydshot &apos; .
however , this is only an inevitable postponement and a decent good for health .
what do you do to do so , after today and tomorrow &apos;s Weekgraph - or other piles - to be better felt this morning , and to get it as painful as possible ?
Joo water .
in the case of Alpan , and after a great deal this morning ... or if possible , even instead of alcohol .
as a body loses a lot of liquids on alcohol , it will have to be back in any way .
together with water , mineral substances and stap are also a good practice of mineral water .
as a matter of time is often frustrated , then it is particularly good if it comes to the soil , or just a quanched .
that is to be done .
certainly , it would not be paid to boy to the old trees - that may prove to be fatal to the wrong decision .
however , it is easy to remember the physical course of the poor once again that the feeling is alive .
betting and sleeping in the bogus and buried people are a more @-@ time @-@ consuming way of life .
it is gradually going back to the poor energy and cautiously .
if you are going to go on yesterday &apos;s overshoot , it will certainly not be able to try to download a high level of fat .
for example , in the wake of the refurbishment of the flotilla , in which the lion &apos;s cater can remain silent on the markets .
if the health of the South is already suffering , we could try , for example .
and a little later .
in order to avoid a coffee .
it will be free from the latest release of a body of water .
as has already been said : water and volumes are friends .
let us make a blind eye on malsits .
if you were to prevent pain from this evening , it needs to be dealt with in addition to alcohol as well as the modiphorus , or it will lose the way in which it is caught .
both the riches and in the future will continue to be a poppy worse .
in addition , it will not be a blind eye on the whole of tuna , even though long .
if you go on this morning , the way to which you can do so is a blank cheque - that is irritating with the already rosy macks .
or if a partner is not to take it well , it can be done well .
around the same way , it is just like walking out , but in the footwear it cannot be used .
however , in order to avoid an overly active pace and handful shops , the physical effort should be moderately .
a joke .
the talk of the friends of the friends of the time , the road to simple hutts and a naera friendly , both for itself and for other ( suffering ) .
the Nali and naer may not be squeezed , but it is certainly a result of them that they have a more seamless battle .
once again , a pocket is going to happen anyway !
Professor of professors and Oxford University of Awestern are being sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , the professor and Oxford University of Wwestern University , who have received suspects after death row , have been sought by the police , and the staff of Oxford University , who have received suspects of death row in Chicago .
according to the Cook rural document , on Monday , on Monday , there were 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi , and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni , accused of his alleged presence in the first instance of their alleged inconsistency , because of their alleged presence in Trenton H. James Cornell @-@ Duranleu .
according to documents , the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Duranleu has died in the wake of a recurrence .
according to a warning to the community of Chicago &apos;s police officer , on 27 July , the death penalty was discovered on 27 July .
police officers received a phone and found the Grand Plaza Corterhouse and arrivals for the victim , whose physical was a number of storms .
according to officials , the Cornell @-@ Duranleu event was killed and investigators on prostitution , while the police seek to actively engage in two suspects .
they have worked as co @-@ professors of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwestern since 2007 .
Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations Alan KKubbage , the Vice @-@ President of the University of the universities , said that Mrs Laos has now been temporarily removed from the work and has been banned from entering the town of the University of Northwestern .
&quot; this is now the case with the competent authorities of the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern is working with researchers , &quot; said Cubbage .
Mr Warren is a senior assistant of Oxford University .
the Commission &apos;s representative of the University and Somerville College said : &apos; we have been in the Community with the British police and the US research authorities in every way possible to help the US research authorities . &quot;
in addition , the statement stated that Warreni &apos;s colleagues are shocked and willing to give itself out .
Mr Anthony Guglielm , the Chair of the Committee on Communications in Chicago , is urging the authorities to give the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are present , but we are dealing with the exact location of the exact location , &apos; said Guglielm .
according to Guglielm , the suspects will help to seek the suspects , regional , regional and national authorities .
the Guglielm said that the police received a phone by the Grand Plaza Corterhouse , who had just had a cryptic rain that , in order to repeat , there has been something .
according to the police describe it , it was a spectacle .
the Guglielm said that it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July .
he said that the safety cameras in the building of the Lathemi and Warreni stay in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
the Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to the people : &quot; the police work at the moment of events and the background of the victim &apos;s background , and examines the different motives , including the possibility that this was a family dispute . &quot;
companies that help your businesses to avoid the next Ubwould
Amy Errett wanted to measure their e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups for workers &apos; satisfaction , but surveys were materialised .
the answers were often vague , useless or even worse .
and even if he promised to guarantee anonymity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system simply was not consistent and objective , &apos; said the Errett , who is responsible for the sale of e @-@ commerce in the Carison Reps in San Franciscos , who is working with 75 workers in San Francisco .
he therefore called on non @-@ external persons .
we are dealing with the new types of human resources , which will help businesses to identify what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software , which is determined to measure the involvement of workers , they will allow companies to make a step @-@ up to the polls , to take firm teams and demographic groups , to provide the anonymity and the number of complaints to the workers , and in some cases to allow manufacturers to bypass C @-@ level leaders and turn directly to the Bureau .
&quot; now there are such tools as the Straour and Fiter , which is intended to monitor health , but where Fiter is the company &apos;s own company , Mr Barnetis , co @-@ founder and CEO Reding , the Glint of the City of Glint , whose software analysts use companies to measure the inclusion of workers .
the Erretti said he has received three years when he has used the Glinti , a much better overview of what the workers think and feel .
in addition to the surveys and calls for more robust teams , it offers a company &apos;s heat card , which gives an overview of what parts of the departments are most concerned and whose leaders are the lowest support , allowing it to identify the reasons .
companies have begun to realise that they have to stay aware of their work culture , so as not to become the next Ubwould , which has been insurmounted in scandals since the former employee published a blog , which described the environment , which was sentenced to those who dare to take the floor .
for such start @-@ ups , such as the Glint , a desire for a business is an opportunity for the business .
the global management , regulation and conformity area can be in line with the Let &apos;s website of the &quot; RoHS &quot; on financial management , in order to be worth more than € 17.7 billion by 2020 .
Denveris Colorados acting in the first cent of the start @-@ ups , which will help businesses to prevent and identify unsuitable behaviour , noted in the light of the unquestionable reputation of the Ubber , in this year .
there are almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
the Uber register has recently registered themselves .
as the Glinter , the LLP will allow companies to send a tailor @-@ made impulse , to collect real @-@ time confidential answers and look at the problem of heat cards .
it also offers anonymous messages , which will allow workers to be informed about their unsuitable behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive , complaints are going directly to the Bureau .
&quot; the public opinion has been carried out by the regulators , &quot; said , the President of the Centre and CEO Patrick Quinlan .
the Quinlan said that , if the company treats its workers badly or inethically , the company may face serious consequences , such as the boycott of consumers , the exclusion of workers and cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not interfere .
Mr Ruby , the restaurant , which has more than 25 000 workers , has been used to be censored more than a year in order to ensure that workers &apos; awareness of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way for relations with the headquarters of the company .
if the employee wanted to notify the problem , he had to find a telephone number of a corporation headquarters , or to ask for an official complaint , and hope that it will be taken seriously .
it was often a deterrent and inconvenient process , said Mr Vitrano , who said , who said that there was no good way to monitor the complaints of workers .
it is now possible for the company to be censored , but it is possible to deal with problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices that did not reach the lead in other towns or states , in order to identify more quickly and deal with in offices in other towns or states .
&quot; I will be able to get closer to the positive experience of the workers , &quot; Mr Vitrano , who is headed by the Ruby @-@ by @-@ government group .
&quot; and we defend our shareholders for litigation workers . &quot;
Quinlan said that companies started a ethical behaviour , values and the involvement of workers more seriously in 2002 , following the fact that the audit company Arthur Andersen has failed in relation to ethical infringements , as a result of the scandal in the Enron scandal .
but only when the social media became mature &apos; , the companies that they are unable to prevent their breath on the web online .
&quot; before the use of the technology to monitor the ethical behaviour of the technology , people used as a strategy , &apos; he said .
both the Glint and the Convergence Fund provide their software as a service , by companies having a periodic fee for the use of their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity that has a venture to guarantee capital investors who have been based on both start @-@ ups .
in February 10 million dollars , such as Sapphire Ventures and the Customs Capital Federation , were censored by the Member State concerned , thereby increasing USD 47 million .
in November 10 million were invested in Bessemer Venture partners , by increasing the total funding of the company by 60 million to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise when taking into account the links between companies , culture and venture capital .
more research shows that modern workers are waiting for more than ever .
competitive markets such as Silicare Valley , are high wages and interesting projects only on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued , and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy with a company , they feel they are heard and that the work they do is satisfying , they are more committed to ensuring the success of a company , &apos; Mr McQueen , who is a general benefit and the Vice @-@ President of the Labour Party , LinkedInis , which uses both the so @-@ called &apos; and Glint &apos; .
investors earn revenue if their own portfolio companies are doing well ; businesses are doing well if workers are committed and involved .
if the third @-@ party analytical tool allows us to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , we do not have these support .
the possession of data on the inclusion of workers is important , according to the expertise of the professional culture .
however , these data are useless if the supervisory authorities in the company are not going to do anything .
in fact , if a company asks for feedback from its employees , expectations are expected to change .
and if changes are not enough quickly or not , it may cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask about 4 000 proposals , you must be prepared to converge 4 000 conversations , &apos; said &apos; Consultative International President Rusreen International President Rushene &apos; , who has seen how companies are making a mistake to rely on the collection of data .
&quot; because if things do not go until the end , then workers think : &apos; do you actually have taken me heard ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I pay care ? &apos;
according to Erretti , the Madison Reel , who is now organising six studies , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem is reported by the Glinter .
and , after the speed of decision @-@ making and communication on the quality of the quality , it was possible to have a number of teams to restructure and provide a number of teams to address the issues of communication training .
however , in the case of the Ruby @-@ by @-@ Office , the new data on workers will be collected , and it is hoped that in the long term , it will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in the industry , which is known as of its high level of labour flows .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &apos; Mr Vitrano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose your customers .
and if you lose your customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
the euro area of the euro area is the Baltic Sea : income grow fast
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic Sea , three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of Western Europe , writes BSE &apos;s report on the European Central Bank &apos;s report .
according to the ECB , the overall output of the economy from 1999 is in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the success of this is a low debt burden , a rapid improvement of the institutions and business @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States in one of Slovakia are among the countries of the euro area , where there has been a significant focus on the EU &apos;s central focus on the purchase of reactors in the purchasing power of the euro area . &quot;
while the aim is to ensure that the overall output of the economy is equal to the Western Europe of Western Europe , in 2015 , the overall production of the Baltic economies was just 2 / 3 15 from the average of 15 countries , which was the average of the European Union before the enlargement cycle of 2004 .
low wages have led to a better pay for foreign countries .
although the European Central Bank sees Baltic States in a positive light , and the economy is growing , the local population will not be enthusiastic about this year .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was a little less than half of those who were interviewed .
NCAA decision to remove two times a day in the light of the trends in the Bruges days .
at the moment , almost 23 is almost 23 , when the bluefin tuna fund is the main blow to the opening of a team of universities in the University of University of SCLA .
some of them have placed a burden on the company , revealing the efforts of the first day of their treach .
for a large part of the team , these will be a standby of the middle day .
the participants in the course of the Kurds are going to go back to the trialogues , after a three @-@ hour trend , to learn from the trialogues , before returning to at 6.30 meetings this morning at 6.30 meetings next morning .
&quot; the following three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Bruinsi , Jim Mora , before the day of Monday .
the decision of the NCAA to cancel the burden on players in order to reduce the burden of players a day is , in fact , a day of longer change - at least until one half of the final coin on Friday .
for this reason , three of the first three years of office was launched by the UCLA , in order to fit the already close timetable for players .
the transition to a single day is a day @-@ to @-@ day basis , more than the beginning of the Bruinsi camp , the beginning of the last few days in comparison with the previous season , and for the first time in Mora six of the Westwl season .
they are up to 18 % of the 18 trends before it begins in September , before the official preparation begins in Texas A &amp; M @-@ D .
according to Mr NCAA , he has been in favour of the change of the NCAA , although it adds another item on players &apos; partners .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; and they break themselves with this challenge ; they are trying to make them a great young people .
I believe that when coming Saturday and we have more time , it is a truly few . &quot;
if the camp is closed , the UCLA workings are closed , which is not a simple task , given the clear view of their expulsion and the centre of the Luskini centre , a high @-@ class hotel that has already escaped from a football shell from the rocks of a football shelf .
from this weekend , the Bruinsi player , but Mora admitted that the problems may arise during the season for free tobacco .
&quot; we implement security measures , said Mora .
&quot; this is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people may have a number of token and coaches filtered .
if you have recorded the record , it can make it quite a good deal .
however , we are using and on 8 parking a safety team .
we will do our best using the best .
I will try to be particularly concerned about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the European Union , which was born to the central party , Mr Sagiare @-@ Ivanova , the Democratic Union , has been thrown out by Kristiina Ojulas and the ECB , to relinquish the forces of the creative businessmen and the parties to be held in the gallery , to be able to show the idea of the electoral union of businessmen in Tallinn - it seems that there is at least as much as the political parties created in national politics on the initiative of the young people , at least as much as political parties .
however , in the autumn , and the key issue will be whether they will be sufficiently disappointed with the voters .
who will remain with the island ?
if a small country has fallen to the support of the Edgar Sagiare , it can anticipate his election of the events organised by the Union .
one of the members of the country , some former and current central players , and many of the most unknown examples - is that the membership of the election union ?
and can there be no reason why , in Tallinn , a few Sagiare faithful to the guests and friends of the Sainare , may look for the list of companies &apos; Sagiare , which is , at the forefront of corruption and corruption , is becoming a reality , and it is becoming a reality ?
on the basis of the Russian ban on film @-@ driven musicians , which is the first time in the city of children , and in every sense , the original computer game in which the Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid the way in which he is trying to avoid war on the road , and whether the votes of the 16th year old voters are trying to make the Central party , the first time in the electoral ballot box ?
we are looking forward to the idea of the people of political parties in the youth campaign campaign .
if the channel 2 or TV3 look at the beginning of August , there will be two options for a rrèche in the beginning of August , there will be two options : to accept that in future , the EIT , the EIT , the EIT , the EIT , the EIT , and the English channel , can be replaced by France24 channels or surrender every month to some television operators .
there are probably also those who openly welcome the television experience at the beginning , but at the end of the day - even though it is reluctantly - for the television and advertisements .
the high @-@ voltage music , lotine people and the savage left to the streets are almost the unpleasant side of any more music estival .
however , as part of its own part , it is worth doing at home , instead of being painted at home , to go to the home country - and a sleep place for the lung of the Festival .
Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
media publications quotes President Donald Trumpi , who said that the new US immigration plan , which makes the Green Card rules .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year by 50 000 people per year , stricter rules on temporary employment visas and restrictions on family orientation .
the new rules have proposed the republics and the President will support them .
the draft legislation will be discussed in the two chamber in the Chamber .
&quot; this law reduces poverty , increases the wages and savings of billions of dollars on taxpayers &apos; money , as it makes the way in which the other citizens of the US are issuing green maps with other countries .
the law will reduce the chain of migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process will provide an advantage for candidates who speak English and who have financial resources to support and skills that come to our economy , &quot; said Trum American media publications according to the United States .
Siberian , young people are moving to the city , pensioners back to the land .
the Anasejyev Anaked tradition continues to be the tradition of the newly @-@ famous River Maana River .
he is working on 140 kilometres from home to Maana additive Kuvai , as a driver of gold .
this is a harsh job : two months of ever @-@ day employment and then only 10 days ago , and again , only 10 days ago .
during the three years we have worked in Anatol , it was just one time ago .
&quot; there is a great deal of time : going to be thoroughly controlled , so that it does not mean that it does not lead to &apos; , it speaks Anatols &apos; .
in the village of Haida , Mr Piho , Haida , a local to Jaga , who has spoken to her family sites in Siberia .
the archaic culture of Siberian , which is still being maintained , will also affect the home , because it is simply embarrassing , the most closely thought @-@ out would have been investigated by Piho Mare .
his first research trip to Siberia will be passed for 30 years this year .
during this time , there has been 14 times and has lived there for one year .
how much did it went to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century , in order to get the land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 80,000 .
I have taken note of the talk of Siberian men who , too , have thought about this .
it is difficult to say , because at the time , one group could come up to 30 people , but the passport was only a man .
the passport was only one of one , but it was children , nurses and the Russians .
look at how much this territory was here .
this was a number of times more historic .
after all , it was necessary to educate , in any way .
Setud came here as a bedroy , but their life change , because they were in the regions that were not only linked to agriculture but also in the river ( palparking ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , the New Petsert went a series of dozens later to work in a secret city of Krasnox @-@ 45 ( where the Soviet power were built on uranium enrichment - J. P. ) , when it was formed .
is there a majority in the region at the time of the majority of the population ?
yes , they lived in a rogue .
in addition , a long tradition , too , has a long tradition of marry , and a lot of children .
seven @-@ eight children were normal .
how much the culture of Siberian nurses and differs from that of the mother tongue ?
they are different , although what was said here was never the same .
they brought a great deal of political ideas .
they did , too , also ( the shadow ideas ) , but they always made a distinction between what was made and what was done here .
climate change has been severely affected by the traditional riinism , because it is a metre .
the changes have been made .
for example , Setomaal meat was a warm , but it is just a freeze .
where the Siberian villages and what live there are living there ? / graphic : Alari Paluends
the mother tongue was highly strong , it was considered very important .
it seems to me that it is now going to give it back to the Seadland , to influence them .
these girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories .
the Piho must bear in mind the people of the Estonian delegation who came at the beginning of July in Haida , the Kingdom of Kaida , and the four days in homes - J. P .
that is what is happening here , it is a disgrace .
&quot; it is easy to come , and also to go , because the city is an excellent location : the railway chain , and roads at the crossroads of roads , says Tape @-@ operisololololisal Reigo Tamm .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a great deal of hope , sport and culture , and a carrot can every year .
there is a tip @-@ up city !
there is a small island of an island with the current river basin , where they are to be treated as usual .
&quot; it does not seem to be a beautiful train on a train window , &apos; sluggle Reigo .
who is not afraid of the cold water , it will be flooded because the river is full of resources .
I have been flooded there , I will be able to do so !
the water of the river can be regarded as a long way , and simply to do a romantic to do - can flow from the river , and to think about life and want to do so .
I have also been able to get my own feet there .
the Ooperisololololist Tamm has been the case of the three eyes of the river , in the case of three bridges between us , and that it is a place in the town of the town , no one may be opposed to any of the things that I say &apos; .
&apos;Mänymäki will be a wonderful look at Taple &apos; , but there are also health professionals where there can be a drink , winter and , for example , in the case of the golf , it has been done , a golf journey has been made , the rebels can be borrowed by sports from sports . &quot; , the Reigo .
the old professional bodies , of course , have their keysis , but I do not have yet to play there .
it is probably a question of my colleague , Mr Chastel , to invite Mrs Taps , because he has experienced cgolfans and he has a chain .
he is lending to me !
Reigo and Mänrs were inseparable from the current level of childhood .
at least during the older hours .
there are many tears , fraudsters and rest of my sport in my life .
let us not mention the collapse of wheels and sisters .
&quot; the entire centre of the centre is now full of construction works , all of this will become a blind eye , the Reigo .
however , the old and tired building building is a very attractive place in which the discoveries are being played .
I am pleased that in 2012 , A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.M , the leader of Meos , the leader of Meos , adopted by the summer of his theatre and the summer theatre .
although the theatre @-@ up of the street is the &apos; Alezen Karenga &apos; , it has just been carried out on 11 August , in the railway station , the &apos; Elsny &apos; of the railway station , when the old building is moving round in 1980 .
&quot; 11 @-@ 13 August , Tapa town days , in which there has been a mark on the open house of the ice building and will take place in the event of cultural events , among other things , the Reigo , who recommends that the city of 911years in the days of the town of Reigo , which refers to the city of 9 years ago .
on 1 May , the Museum on 1 May is already a museum from 1994 .
&quot; it is a small house , but it is a great deal , and information is a great deal , and it will be applauded in Reigo , which is full of the history of Tapa town , which is more focused on the railways and the war .
in fact , there is a long @-@ distance gap , but , fortunately , small schooling is full , and fortunately , small schoolchildren are full .
&quot; we have both good eating places and in the cares we sometimes feel that there is sometimes a feeling that you are going abroad , describes .
the soldiers who have been educated and young Taps have spent a lot of time in the coffee @-@ shops , stap it there in the guest , that you are in Estonia and in their home town , but there is a transformation of this international company together .
I believe that it would be very exciting to listen to the stories of the French or the Americans .
, yes , we are going to do a lot !
two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal cages .
television broadcasts in charge of foreign ministries who know that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal battery in Greece .
the police arrested on 1 August this morning on a group of people who were illegally staying on the island of Sithonia , including two Bulgarians .
they were born on the same day , but there is an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said television TV , that Bulgarians were born on a flight later .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free movement and introduce strict fines for all those who remain at the same location , which are not intended to do so .
the controls will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry of the Ministry , the Court can appoint a penalty .
young people are taught in a break with sheep .
the poor farmers in the shelf have to have a carpet once again since year , with the &apos; curriculum &apos; of the carpet , apparently , apparently , many sheep have already broken down a number of sheep .
this year , the junta has broken the sheep of Hiiu in three times , with 23 sheep and injured eight , writes the Hiiu page .
the soil was just three years , a year that was 124 .
it is also the data of the Environment Agency for the birth of Murdons , so that the soil was not born and Hicholand &apos;s information on the shelves of the planet , so that there are two romiwastes on the island in this year .
Mr Ööl has broken the wolds to Emhang Keshang in the village of 15 sheep , and injured in 18 years left on the shores of 18 .
Thirty @-@ day @-@ day saves have broken the ruins in Rehebacks in the village of Rehebacks on the village of one hundred and injured , which had to be done to be an emergency killer .
the rules for the treatment of genetically modified crops must be clear
the French Ministry of residence sent a draft law on the environment of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and the draft law on plant protection products .
the amendment to the law is not being abandoned , as well as the creation of a separate data collection for the crops of the products of GM ( GM ) , in the future to be used for plant health records .
in addition , GM crops are being used and the obligation to have prior agreement on the radio apiculture and the person concerned .
while at the moment , Estonia does not increase the cultivation of genetically modified crops , we need to consider clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non @-@ GM crops .
at least , at least , until there is no decision @-@ making of Estonia to declare GMO @-@ free GMOs , the Dutch Department of Health , Sigmar Suu Kyi , the World Health Department .
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , to take into account the costs and administrative burden of both private and public sectors , in the annex to the annex .
the draft law repeals the data collection and treatment of GMOs in the case of GM crops and operators in the field of treatment and treatment of GM crops , lays down the requirements for the treatment of GM crops and the establishment of an economic activity .
@-@ specific with regard to the current commitment to the cultivation of GM crops , the current obligation to inform beekeepers of the cultivation of GM crops is to be able to achieve an appropriate agreement with the beekeepers before raising the agreement .
the draft law has been sent to the Ministry of Coordination .
all interested parties have the opportunity to examine the draft information system and wish to present their opinion on the world &apos;s Ministry of residence .
the amendments will affect those who are active in the area of plant farming , beekeepers and agricultural agencies .
in the European Union , including Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 810 .
so far , no Estonian farmer has been able to increase the cultivation of GM crops .
the reason is that , in Estonia , there are no personal harassment , the European Observatory on the media , which is a magic line with which mon 810 resistant .
it is also the case for the southern regions of the South , and that is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
in order to obtain security , the Ministry of residence in 2015 has commissioned research into a possible presence of GM , maize and soya varieties in Estonia to detect the seeds of GM , maize and soya varieties in Estonia .
the results of the samples have shown that the seeds were not included in the seeds , and the study concluded that , in Estonia , the seeds of maize , maize and soya varieties do not contain genetically modified organisms .
in turn , it can be concluded that Estonia is not aware of the cultivation of genetically modified crops and also confirmed that no accident has been taken .
Mr Jose Mourinho thinks , in the form of &quot; genetic &quot;
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United States have recruited Nemjan Maticu in the form of &apos; genetic practice &apos; , after the central player in Wednesday evening .
GBP 40 million of the world , which bought up to the Chell , started in Dublin , in the latest seasonal world in the Unitedi , on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 , on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 , with the impression of a defensive role , while Mr Pogba and Mr Pereira were freely attacked in a crusade .
however , having left aside the Blueprint for seasonal pre @-@ Asian Asian Asia , Maticulasow was badly needed to bury and held only 45 minutes , it has to be adopted by Mourinho , according to the PMinho , in order to improve the start of the League of AMinho .
&apos;he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genial thinking - he has a football despair , &apos; said Mourinho .
&quot; we are helping him to achieve a form as soon as possible . &quot;
as is the case , the Aviva stage , as well as the other new colleges of Victor Lindelin , and Mr Lukashenko , and the Mourinho began in silence on the start of a sounding man from the beginning of the Aviva stage .
the Independent public week that the Mourinho wants still to recruit three football houses , but he confirmed that the club has already done a &apos; excellent work &apos; , by concluding agreements with three priority priorities .
&quot; I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three four , &apos; he added &apos; .
&quot; I am more happy if they can do the four four , but they have worked hard to me . &quot;
yet another warm son was on the list of GSM and on 1 August , and this is the case in Mesus .
Mr Martinson , who was living on alien living observers , was the first to be able to send the Sfragile Sfragile , and this washing the breath that has already gone around , is washing away from the Multi @-@ Grand wave of the Multi @-@ Grand Gulf .
this is because , after all , there is no fertility , the voice of the islands .
on Tuesday , a relatively late hour , it has already become one of the reson and the whistle on the island of this House .
the Martinson said , in fact , is an international project to be install , which spends Ahar Leito and Ivar Ojka .
Mr Mullu was one of the reposon called Mwas with the Most GSM , Sebasves Turkey .
&quot; his activities are on the internet all look at : how he went in Spain in the winter , returned to a piece of time in the German and Polish border , and then Saareland had to be &apos; spoke Martinson .
British inventors to install their own body with microchips to access their homes and cars
the first person in the country was the first person in a country to whom the micro @-@ chip was installed in order to be able only to open up their weight , access to office and even to launch a car .
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Steven NorthEast Children are installed on a tiny chip with a tiny chip , and we are now looking at this service to the companies and private individuals who want to make their lives easier to make their lives easier .
it has compounded by the Queestesiologist of the Royal hospital in Hankshire in Hanin Hanles , the Royal hospital in Hankiss , in order to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards in the case of medical standards .
the technology is similar to the microchip of microchips and the microchip of the cogs , and the procedure will take just 30 seconds .
the Northwest company will also prevent the houses of houses and cars , so that they are compatible with a simple , asking for one of the 300 GBP 300 .
it is a child &apos;s father of a child in the form of the technology now , and in his car , BMW Z4 , which is going to be launched if he has his hands .
the white house of the White House went to taxpayers for thousands of
according to a letter of public military documents announced in the press , the White House &apos;s decision to flight helicopter helicopter last month to the European Year of America to give taxpayers a price of USD 24 000 .
the green and white colours Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D @-@ 3D , which is called the &apos; President of the TDD &apos; , was a central indication of the event that took place on 17 July in Valille Maneeded on 17 July .
President Donald Truf , Vice @-@ President Mike , and the White House of the White House , were reported by the higher officials in the field of industrial products from all 50 countries .
Skycticutis built helicopters , particularly in the name of the image of the street , Wisconus , who has come from a fire @-@ fighting car and Mismood .
the Helicopter Squadrrck , the Helicopter Squadrrer , responsible for the operation of the HeliCopter , has called for a White House to carry out the presence of the CFARGO @-@ T to a handful of the TFARGO @-@ ga , the presence of FARGO @-@ ga 36 hours prior to the horror in the south @-@ south of the event of the &apos; unusual &apos; event .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is unusual to have a great deal of attention , &apos; said HMX @-@ 1 komcomör Day before the event in the case of e @-@ mail , the leading officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
the message was stated that helicopter arrives in the south of 17 July this morning , at 15 July , at 15 July , and will remain in the event until the clock at the same evening , between 18 and 21 .
it was the fact that , when the departure of the Hineest Majest is to be , there is a need for the time of restrictions on the time of time to be reopened .
the original flight team was at the event of helicopter at the event of helicopter and the security team in the middle of an aircraft near the whole of its entire ground over the time .
it was not possible to read out of the documents that have been given to the time of time , whether or not you have had the second time , or not .
the Hatch law prohibits the federal workers to use the government &apos;s property for political purposes .
the documents show that the HMX @-@ 1 survey can be breached by this event .
&quot; we are talking about whether this is a breach of Hatch law , and we were told that no rice , &apos; wrote a commanner .
&quot; it seems that you have no choice , &apos; the leading victim &apos;s Deputy Prime Guard &apos; .
the White House announced a formal event in America and the Hatch Act would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .
however , even in official events , there are political areas .
the President supported the health reform efforts in the Senate at the time in the Senate and approved the efforts to prevent the government &apos;s regulations in danger .
the use of a &apos; One or Air Force &apos; , known as a &apos; One or Air Force &apos; , is not a new phenomenon for a politically profitable purpose .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use these purely photographs is unusual .
in February , it would focus on the point of view of the day of his first campaign at the University of Reports in Floridas Melbourne , as well as by Twitter from the messages that complain about how his predecessor , the President of his predecessor , used the flight of his predecessor .
&apos;The Matal Maker is very pleased to put forward &apos; in America &apos; in America , where products were represented from all 50 states , which have been prepared by American workers in the American material , &apos; the White House &apos;s press officer , and Mr Walters .
HMX @-@ 1 teams are often going to be around Washington around and the south of the South , so as to make it easier to get the US President of the white house of a lockery of the centriary of the United States .
if Trum July at the beginning of July Germany , the HMX @-@ 1 White House was organised by the HMX @-@ 1 White House .
it was said that the flight was considered to be a number of flights in America for the flight of the &apos; catch @-@ up crew &apos; in America .
in Estader helicopter , it was not only 11 hours of the &apos; President @-@ in @-@ Office &apos; on the day in addition to 11 hours &apos; .
according to the White House , none of the other forms of this event have been burdened by the death of the taxpayer .
according to the Sikorsky representative , the company was not involved in organising helicopter on the south of the South .
HMX @-@ 1 does not maintain the precise costs of the flights and events caused by the President of the President of the President .
however , at an end of the cost of the Ministry of Defence , the VH @-@ 3D allowance for the financial year @-@ 3D is estimated at USD 24 380 per hour .
the Estader &apos;s documents were pointed out for a long @-@ term basis for the Quantico flight of Virginia , both on the basis of the main base of a flight to Virginia on both sides of the Sea .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using helicopter is very much below this amount .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; costs is very misleading , &quot; said Walters .
&quot; these estimates include a number of non @-@ irreversible costs for staff , care and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account in the annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 @-@ 2015 survey , compensation rates for staff costs are not included in the Ministry of Defence , but they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former press representative of the White House Sean Stuer defended the use of helicopter at a time in the event .
&quot; the idea is to show the things that were made in America this week , &apos; said Sicer .
&quot; and I know that Sikorsky and Connecticuti State is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there is expected hundreds of hundreds if not even thousands of people who depend on this .
and I believe that just as the majority of the Americans , we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the Trum cater in the south of the event in the south of the event , with helicopters , or not , but the fire @-@ fighting fire on the rol of him .
in the White Mat , Trum Sikorsky representatives , hears about media donations and on the products of a company in his personal aircraft in the form of his personal aircraft .
&quot; I feel Sikorská very well , &apos; said , &apos; I have three products &apos; .
Good Šadeiko - Nuarshoes arrived in peace and joy
the 2011 MMil Daenia hit the Šadeikot in the last area , 800 m beans on foot @-@ on @-@ foot , and was carried out in a stafrom from the stage .
immediately before it was in China , it was a long distance from scratch .
the Helsinki Programme for 2012 was an asset for the injury , but in London during the debate in London , he received 60 points on 23 .
however , I continued .
after 2013 Moscow MMil became a pioneer in the schedules of the year after the visit to the Estonian Reports .
two years later , he received the Beijing MMil 15 , and he was in the Olympic spirit , but it was more than a great deal of athletes .
in the light of the gloomy class , the Holodomor was not just a soil if it did not start a letter from the Amsterdam Embassy in the first place .
I would just like to put a single deal of time in order to put together a single regime .
one time , you sprayed Šadeiko .
worse , there were still more than a month later : the contest for his Olympic contest was already in the first barrier to the country in Rios .
the time has come to be taken - is there to continue to do so in a seven @-@ free country ?
is the two days of effort that are still worthy of all ?
there was a long time , but it took peace .
I have got to think about it .
this experience is relatively difficult to describe , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time to be a healthy cure and to think about it .
&quot; I knew that I am not going to say a lot about the slogan , speaks of his self @-@ friendliness of the Šadeiko .
I received a clean front and to go ahead with the new season .
in writing . - ( FR ) Other , Mrs Anne Naggi , it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the suffering , but it has realised that , above all , sportspeople themselves have to find themselves out .
it was , after all , been wrestled by all .
it was difficult to tolerate this .
&apos;Good , however , said that he does not give him and he wants to prove what he deserves &apos; , says mountain .
there is now some sort of peace .
he is doing so to joy .
the contest came back in May , when the Götzka was set up a new Estonian Recrashes in Götzka , a new Estonian rebate .
at a high level of competition , he has improved a personal excellence in a number of meters ( 13.89 ) and drink a loophole in record time .
then there was a great deal of competition , so that it is not at all levels , but has been removed only by the first conspiracy of hunger .
for years , he has been instructed to remember that Šadeiko is a university .
he is ready to be a sportsman , he is a good training .
if something is wrong , it is going to say it immediately .
he feels that he is a bad and trusted one .
that is what we must follow .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we follow it .
the new approach has also been found .
&quot; I am not one who is predicting the maximum , it speaks and say that the most important thing is to get the right thing , because it will also ensure a good result .
I am happy to see the baby &apos;s baby bop .
the good emotion has also been offered by the Šadeikou .
both his former Training , Marin Nagk , was recently received by the grandparents , and there has been a lot of new weather citizens support from the past , and there has become a lot of support from the citizens .
&quot; I have been quite interesting , &apos; say Šadeiko .
one alcohol , drinking , is tantamount to &apos; training &apos; .
the Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is a father of a great wine beauty , that it believes that the wine can be trained better than any other in the world .
the Carperd is a neuroscientist University of Yale .
his message is not a matter of alcohol or in the way that it affects our feelings and ideas , but instead of &apos; a very active &apos; wine &apos; process .
in the light of the Council , the wine @-@ producing complexity of the wine , it enjoyed and in the perceive of the taste of our work , so that we can create a wine taste .
according to the Sheperdi , there is no fact that there is a taste in the place , but a taste of the way in which wine is stimulated .
he will bring about a comparison of how you see &apos; colours &apos; .
&apos;Mak is not in wine , taste for wine &apos; , says Sheperd .
what is happening to the wine taste of wine is , for example , our age , and even sylje , which is produced by the person .
of course , the wine is not , of course , that wine is not up to a Jewish .
&quot; it must be more &apos; in action &apos; , says .
if you go too much of the very long one , the system has been overcrowded .
the excessive drinking drink may be a pity , instead of the damage - in 2004 the risk of people who drink over three glass wine , memory loss , balance with loss and reduced mental capacity .

despite the fact that &apos; Narcot &apos; in the second season revealed Pablo Escobari , and is far from the end of Netflix .
the third and fourth season has received a confirmation from the streaming of services and the first of them has already been on the clip of advertising , which is rife in the horns and new pathos .
in the third season , DEA will pay its attention to the world &apos;s richest drug organisation - Cali cartels .
they are acting in four powerful threats , &quot; as Forty 500 companies &quot; , just as a &apos; Forty @-@ company &apos; , but also to the government and violent acts .

according to the United Nations , the role of democracy in Afghans will depend on the role of women in politics
the leader of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan , on Wednesday , said that the elections can be represented only if all members of society , including women , play their role .
the head of the UN mission , Nicholas Haysom , said that hundreds of women are nominated for local councils in the local Soviet elections , three women stand as vice @-@ president and more than 30 per cent of voters registered .
&quot; the role of women in underlining the importance of women cannot be exaggerated , &quot; said on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the Hungarian @-@ Soviet elections and presidential elections are held on 5 April .
the Taliban has been threatened by the electoral process , which coincides with a transitional period , when the role of international military operations will become a adviser .
the election of this year marks the first time that power is given calmly from the democratically elected government to the next .
according to the tyrant , women &apos;s strong role in Afghanistan will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the Commission &apos;s independent electoral commission , 3.6 million have been registered by 1.2 million women .
it is a pleasure to make every case as far as small and small .
the common time is always too little , but I am going to give a good opportunity to combine meetings , a game , proximity and the burden .
and what a convenient solution - whatever the case in the summer , live works are always accompanied by , and we will be able to remember their fine remarks : &apos; we are now making a trend ! &apos;
it is a very good piece of insulation - a very good piece of gold , or a paint of artisanal flags .
is it a foundation for permanent and tutuation in the form of shoes , who would then want to take the form of a wave of sand in the summer of the summer ?
it is nice to use children instead of children .
firstly , it is a secure and convenient , race to grow slowly at the same time as training and power .
it will also be able to do a very large village with great children .
the child is eating a balance , points out corps and it is up to the possibility of a high @-@ ranking and important role .
the larger children may do themselves at the same time .
the scope of the movement in place is in place for the lack of the land and the simpling .
the finger at the Hoia &apos;s finger directly is to keep up a mini @-@ stick properly .
the child can read corps and feel as a job .
the planet is very high , but it is hopelessly for the child .
however , it is easy to make it easier .
the plank in the game : take a long plank colononla , which has been repeated by the puzzle .
in fact , much more difficult , but much more than a lot to do than in the meantime .
in order to add the burden , we can stay in the plants , tears , and there is also a walking around it .
in addition , the pumps can be placed on the pumps of a child , but this exercise offers an end to all children .
at the same time , it will be a triumph , the ash , ash and air meat burden , as contagious .
child lasts on their feet so that his body is distributed equally and willing to do so .
the Turiscy can keep up with the game .
the verse and simpers are to be done directly .
I will be able to fly , dooking , a balance in training and the difficulty .
the life of a small job is extracted when it comes to a small number of children .
the additional burden will be made on the basis of shoes .
control in order to maintain a neutral approach .
the children themselves have a lot of fumes to do a scam and a plate .
the work on work and the weders .
follow the safety of the child , the prochement , and the hotel itself in a neutral position .
all children &apos;s favourite and a great deal .
at the same time , it is truly effective throughout the body of the whole body .
Sportic instruments were Of ( 10 ) , Säde ( 8 ) , happiness ( 4 ) .
in the Philippines a wide range of mostics in the Philippines , a moctic of travel .
in the light of the red bags , the summer classifications , which have become in itself in the last few years , which , in the last few years , have to put an end on the hand , and which have been able to have dealers in the light of their modest origin , in spite of the price of an orderly price .
it is probably one of the things that have been red by the red copies that have existed in one order and which have no special emotion .
this is simply there , and if there is no room , there is no overlap .
now , however , there is a real victory for beer and motitudes , and the moctic is that they have replaced their homes by the summer months , instead of easy beer copies .
however , this is not only a coastline , but today it is just as popular as a street , and more courageous women in the office even in the office .
however , at this point , however , it is worth making it clear , whether this summer &apos;s summer , or it is worth pointing out , and there is a little more official to postpone it in a more formal case .
however , it is an asset for women who have done a real summer of love for women .
for example , when I read foreign moters , the first thing is that it is the case that the motorghest of the road to the local market is the first thing , and that they can acquire a few tiger , to which the truck of holiday time is , and which is accompanied by the city , on the market and , as a friend , a town on the city .
some bloggers are even so generous that buying the market from the market and sell them to their loyal readers .
in this context , it is worth noting that there is a high level of demand for plastic bags , so that women in the world are going to go in the world ( and men - and men ) , apparently , had to be an area of fish , so that a few were happy to be able to become a happy owner .
in some respects , such a madness is also understandable , because they are corrupts when the mockery is going to be able to buy a few more than a few decades ago .
it is true that , as well as the clever shops , there have been a lack of simple money , and so that it will be self @-@ employed in a luxury sailing and a thousand for the euro .
obviously , that the richer customers should not feel easy to feel , who will be able to see the promentates of low @-@ cost homes .
for example , it is possible to buy Dolce &amp; Gabbana over a thousand , for example .
however , the interpretation of the Hel &apos;s interpretation may be the case of 6 000 euros .
in contrast to most of the motives of construction , it does not come up with some of the big motives , but the story of their story was the beginning of a long way .
it is , in fact , very far from the rest of the Philippines where they have been subjected to a wide range of them .
it is very often the case in the light of the red tape , particularly in the case of export business and the local ones that are very often under way .
it is allegedly coming from a few years of futile technology , and it is quite a series of ordinary corps with the ordinary corps .
however , as we do not have to say so strongly in the red @-@ board , they will be able to stick to them and other materials , which are more individualised and even more active .
for example , in the last time , we are particularly engaged in a series of colours , which have been introduced by red @-@ coloured scams or skimmed .
however , the centreach , in particular , could be sent to an actor in Jane Birkini , which was not before all the most red tiger .
it was , in fact , appropriate to beer copper of all kinds of clothing and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival .
however , it does not play a less role in the popularity of Kotts , but also that caring for them is falling into account and , unlike all other things , these special instruments do not need to care , but also the water and the grubbing @-@ up .
as in the case of trends , as is the case of a classic nature , the brands have come out of all sorts of interpretations .
for example , there can be a red @-@ cut button or a drop in the hands of the power , for example , for example .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classic translation is never going to be the motto , but though .
but what is the classic divide ?
for centuries , there have been a classic copy of the wool bags , which reminds us of my style , is open , and there is short , as well as , as well as , to shoulder .

GMB concerns about investment after McVitie Glasgow factory
the trade union expects to have been confirmed by the leaders of the long @-@ term production plans in the Glasgow factory in the company Glasgow plant .
according to GMB Scotland , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment in the customs .
there are more than 500 people who are produced in Hobnobsi and rich know , and other products are working more than 500 people .
the McVitie owner , Mr Pladis , said that they have invested more than 5 million dollars over the last few years .
the workers and the representatives of the trade union are the first to hear &apos; if something is changing in the activities of the plant .
in the letter sent to the body of the company , GMB Scotland , the McVitie company , was invited to call &apos; spawta concerns in connection with the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines &apos; .
the GMB &apos;s senior organiser Drew Duffy said : &apos; the fact that we cannot be clear from the head of the label to the customs needs and the future investment plan for the future , will be deeply concerned by our members .
there have been a number of generations of families , and the workforce is largely composed of local communities and the people of Glasgow , as an essential pillar in order to ensure decent employment in the region where unemployment is high and there is social housing .
thus , in the context of the jobs , salaries and welfare of the East of Glasgow , and in the context of the chronic damage to production , the cost of living costs and the chronic loss of production , McVitie was so badly needed . &apos;
the High Representative said : &apos; the Director of the Customs Council received a letter from Mr GMB &apos;s Scotlands yesterday , and a company meets him directly because we value our active communication with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between workers and GMB representatives , which was discussed openly about a number of problems .
we discussed the workers , as all the companies operating in the highly competitive and precarious economic climate , we look at our actions at the moment - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure their competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested a more than 5 million dollars &apos; in the customs agreement , a majority of this has gone into production lines and the improvement of operations .
we fully understand the customs and the heritage of production and if there should be any changes in action , the workers and trade union representatives are the first to hear it . &quot;
did the PSG warned from Barcelona to three years ago for convergence ?
Mr Verratti against his interest may regret its interest in the Marco Verratti .
the Paris Saint @-@ Germain do not sign up in the attempt to attract Mr mar his riches , by making it worth GBP 189 million , but whether they were warning from Barcelona three years ago for a record @-@ breaking return ?
this bubble approach has opened up a transition as an end to the transition , and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world stage , which was set at the return of Paul Pogba &apos;s return to Manchester , which was set at the last season by Paul Pogba .
if the transition is completed , you will have the most expensive player in the world , and also the highest paid professional sportsman in the world , who will be able to pay over EUR 500 000 a week after the payment of the PSG .
the Barcelona is , in fact , the way in which the approach to a break @-@ down , as well as in Neyts , because , as a source of a close source of the chair of Catalonia , it confirms that the club is in a club of football for the arrival of his Santox in 2013 .
but do the PSG warned a football world for the opportunity for three years ago ?
if the Manchester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blaise Matuony agreement in 2014 , the Nasser Al @-@ Khelaif , a severe reminder of all clubs , who think about the best players in some PSG .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that if they are concerned about our players , we will be able to accept them and we will contact them with those players , &apos; said Al @-@ Khelaif .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
however , if they are trying to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they must face the consequences . &quot;
the Barcelona seems to have taken away from this limit , as the Spanish club showed an interest in the Central G central player in the summer of Verratti .
the PSG made it clear that they will not allow them to leave and that the Barcelona can become a result of its interest in the event of a setback , chaos in the form of one of its expensive assets .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders .
&quot; the Brexe is seriously threatened by the strangling in Northern Ireland and Ireland , the British and Ireland , the Varadkar first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from this &apos; , added it .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the free movement of people and goods , said Varado .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : to build bridges , not borders , it emphasised .
he said that he would prefer Britain to become part of the European Union , and because it fails to be part of the European single market .
it would maintain the current free trade in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
the second option to make Britain easier to leave Britain is the creation of a European Union and the United Kingdom , explained the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement exists with Turkey , said Varadkar : &apos; surely we could have such a British &apos; .
the alternative to this would be a return to the customs duties that would be a historic division and political failure .
&quot; raise trade , prosperity and peace &apos; , said Irish Prime Minister .
he appointed Brexitit &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that the result may affect the Northern Ireland &apos;s daily lives every aspect .
the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties of Northern Ireland in Belfast .
