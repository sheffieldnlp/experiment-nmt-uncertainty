Four members of the KroCape Verde group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to postal he, in Spain, the so-called KCape ro Group leader, SCrisis Gulevitch, known as the SÃ´ne KCape rovski, was detained by the police in the Italian alliance.
Gulevitch, who was detained in Spain, was arrested in court.
Yesterday, the Court also arrested three suspects in Estonia.
It is suspected that it is members of the so-called KCape Verde criminal association aged between 27 and 57, who commit mainly drug crimes.
In the province of Mala, Spain, the alleged head of the criminal association was detained.
In Estonia, three men were arrested as suspects, one of whom is the leading figure of the criminal association, according to the data collected, and two are members of the criminal organisation.
The data collected indicate that the criminal community had a clear division of roles and tasks.
The objective of the criminal community's actions was to commit drug crimes and thereby generate criminal proceeds, "commented on the head of the pre-trial proceedings in criminal cases, Public Prosecutor VarevoluVerte.
'We do not rule out that there is an increase in the circle of suspects of this criminal offence '.
These are people who have previously been interested in law enforcement, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been essential throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," commented Verte.
The leader of the central criminal police service, Mr Leis, said that detention was preceded by a preliminary investigation lasting nearly one and a half years.
"In the first half of the week, long-lasting work was realised and we were simultaneously detained in Estonia and Spain for suspected crimes."
Leis added that central criminal police officers helped to arrest in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These detentions are another message to criminals that we will also get them from the other end of Europe, "said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that suspected men can continue to commit new crimes when they are in freedom, which is why the prosecution service requested and approved by the Court.
In Spain, a man arrested is waiting for him to be handed over to Estonia.
Under this criminal case, properties, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The criminal case is pre-trial by the Central Criminal Police Office of organised crime and is led by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The City Court of Tallinn in 2005 sentenced SCrisis Gulevitch to blackmail and punished him with a five-year prison sentence.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevitch was considered the second most important child in the world, following the then alliance, Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevitch from Cape Verde came to the source of Estonia in the early 1990s, when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly charged taxi taxi and prostitution on various hotel boards and demanded monthly roof tax from businesspeople.
International joint operations, confiscation of proceeds of crime and court decisions which have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest sentences, the eight accused of the so-called Dikhs criminal offence, who were confiscated with a criminal income of EUR 80 000, or the verdict against nine individuals that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade in illegal cigarettes and the crimes of human trafficking in human beings in the countries of the East Viruya and southern Estonia.
The proceeds of crime confiscated there amount to almost EUR 71 500.
Progress has been made in these criminal matters by police officers exchanging information and prosecutors on a daily basis, and, if necessary, by acting together in any European Union country.
Citizens' rights group warns Missousousoures about travel
The National Association for the AdvanSSof Colored People (NAMA) has warned the black people travelling to Missourisse of a discriminatory policy and racist attack by the State.
The group statement reads: 'The NAMA travel barrier issued per Missouri State, valid until 28 August 2017, calls on all African travellers, visitors and so sourians to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious as they move around the state, given the whole range of suspicious racial events that have taken place recently and have been pointed out here.'
According to NAACP, the group was urged to issue a travel warning both recently in the Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to obtain cases of discrimination, and in the fact that the targets for state law enforcement are objectively targeted by minorities in large measure.
"People's rights are being violated.
They are drawn down because of their skin colour, beaten or killed, 'said the President of NAAC Missouri, Rod Chapel magazine The Kansas City Star.
'We have never complained so closely before '.
This is the first such warning that has been issued by an organisation for a US state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults against black students at Missouri University and the death of Sandersi, a 28-year-old black story from Tennesta.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year under dubious circumstances after having ran out of petrol from the state and without being charged with a crime by the Missouri police.
In addition, a note refers to a recent report prepared by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that in the State, the cars of black drivers are being stopped 75% more likely than those of white men.
'The comment is intended to make people aware and to warn their families, friends and collaborators about what could happen in Missouris' said Chapel.
"People need to be ready, whether it means taking money away or informing their relatives that they are passing through the state."
Based on the latest information from FBI's hate crime programme, 100 hate crime crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, which places the State in the 16th place of cross-section of the country in the same number of cases.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to take a company to court for reasons of discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Association (EBACLU) had previously issued travel notions about Texas and Arizona, following the adoption of the Immigration Regulations by these States, which obliged the local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences, because ACTA LU said that this would increase racial profiling.
Usually, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs against other countries, but recently, interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter-reaction to certain US laws and trends.
Hepatitis: What would everyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver burns, may be caused by five hepatitis viruses of A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses highlight the acute incinerator of liver.
However, the cost of malicious expenditure is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can continue to develop into a liver cirrhoea, that is to say, a liver coral and liver cancer.
The epidemiological Adviser of the Health Agency, Kuulo Kutsar, says that the acute hepatitis disease phenomenon is the same for all types of liver incinerator: Fever, fativism, sweet, spice, barrage, oxystification, calamity, malactivity, meat and excessive disease, and skin and mass scars.
The last disease also comes from the popular name of liver incinerator three diseases.
Children may experience hepatitis without any disease.
It is possible to determine the various types of land burned exclusively on the basis of laboratory data.
Deep hepatitis can go over chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without disease, meaning that you may not know anything about your dangerous condition, which damages your pay.
Mr Kutsar sets out the various forms of hepatitis and describes their progress closely.
Hepatitis viruses of a hepatitis are spreading from an ill to a person and infected us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, sexony, infected person's emissions from strangledge, beds, objects, walking into contact and drinking drugs.
This hepatitis-transmitted infection was caused by family members and carers of the disease, people suffering from chronic liver diseases, sex people infected with infection, men, drug users, passengers visiting countries with A hepatitis tis.
It is possible to prevent infection by vaccinations, in particular by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot and who are at risk of hepatitis A.
Furthermore, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: To wash or disinfect hands before consuming food to wash all fruit and vegetables.
The hepatitis virus is spreading in contact with human blood, drugs injection, pregnancy, honour, blood-contaminated meadows (dentists, pregnancies), blood blood-blood disease, sex with hepatitis-harbinger and hepatitis-patient creations / infants.
The risk group on hepatitis contamination includes injecting drug users, sex partners of infected human beings, sex men with men, survivors of infected mother, family members and carers, blood and other body fluids, health care, rescue workers and police officers, and passengers visiting countries with a high incidence of hepatitis B.
To prevent hepatitis tis tis, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as persons suffering from chronic liver diseases, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
The hepatitis in other preventive measures is: Avoiding the use of alien hygiene and manure tools, other therapeutic tools and needles, grooming and autism, and using condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection or preventing sexual exposure.
Anti-hepatitis B vaccination is part of the national immunisation scheme in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses spread to human blood, drugs injection, pregnancy, honour, blood-contaminated meadows, donors' blood, sexual treatment of a hepatitis drug and hepatitis disease to foeder creations / infants.
Hepatitis C-hepatitis drug addicts, sex partners of infected human beings, sex men, survivors of infected mother, family members and carers, blood and other body fluids are exposed to health care, rescue workers and police officers, persons with HIV infection and passengers visiting countries with hepatitis C.
Hepatitis C is a preventive measure: Avoiding the use of alien hygiene and manure tools, other therapeutic tools and systaldes-needles, fun and autism and condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection.
There is no hepatitis C vaccine.
Hepatitis tis is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which occurs in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Consequently, there are D hepatitis B infections, together with hepatitis B or superinfection in chronic B hepatitis disease.
Hepatitis viruses spread through contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated needles, sexually transmitted and infrequently infected animals.
The Hepatitis hepatitis risk group is chronic B hepatitis viral officers and people not with hepatitis B immune.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination B with hepatitis vaccine, which also protects people from exposure to the hepatitis D virus.
The hepatitis virus is spreading feministic along the orchestra of drinking water and food, including low-bizarre beef, fish and sea shellfish, donors with blood, joint needles and more infected foetuses.
Passengers may be infected by hepatitis-hepatitis in countries with disease.
Hepatitis prevention measures include compliance with hygiene requirements: Washing or disinfecting hands after entry, before cooking and eating, after sick care.
Fruits and vegetables will wash before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and refrain from consuming drugs.
Although over the last round, the four-fold Olympic winners were trying to get away from the race, the 34-year-old Farah ended up in power and won over time 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long ago, leaving the husband of Tania and children on his way after his finiff.
This was a special moment for me.
I very much love my family.
Being on the path with them was wonderful, "said Farah for journalists.
Farah will target the 55,000 and 10,000-metre race in London for the fifth edition.
Everything is possible, if it is believed.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connori died much deeper from the birth of the 19th century and from the early 20th century in Vienna.
But more deeply in history.
Perhaps the louder's information level could have gone off, the narrowly subject of which would have had more influence on the extraordinary story of the portfolio ree allowed in the headlines.
For the time being, some of these guests would be like two books: Good Klimt and his land, the story of Adel Bloch-Baueri, and a much greater and more comprehensive history book from the respected Jewish families and the German occupation, with its subsequent effects in Austria.
The first third of the book is leading to a thriving cultural life in Vienna in the middle, and who itself came to the capital of Austria, can even imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went around Ringstrace or how the Centrali coffee swept all its head when the climate entered.
The concentration of cultural figures was in one of Europe's richest cities and, seeing the name in the book familiar with it, they felt like a gram more culturally.
However, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a town in which there was an untreated arson, and where Europe was the highest level of suicide, creates nothing more for development.
Perhaps, however, every couple of honest paints also add colour to the cultural life in Vienna at the start of the 20th century.
Dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In the last few decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
Almost 1 in 10 people in Vienna were in Sajandidiment.
The parents of Arad were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time the marriage for Arad itself twice opened up to Czech sugar magnaadi Ferdinand Bloch and Climate pose his famous paintings, his father had already become the seventh largest bank in Habsburg Empire.
However, Adelet did not draw all the glamorous life in which he belonged.
If you look at the 'Daam gold', it is hard to believe that the later side of life was infected by this great Lady's socialism and dreamt of travel from the Soviet Union.
In 1963, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband's portfolio from Climate, it was the last six-minute painting officer in Vienna.
A climt ordered at the time cost 4 000 krones, a quarter of the price of a land building well located.
The fact that some of the sports ree suspected the champion's archate with a modelli was not discouraged by the sugar magnat.
As far as the Adelese is concerned, the only sure fact is that the relationship between the modelli and the artist in the course of their work continued to life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - 'Daam gold'.
Good Klimt's masterpiece, Adel Bloch-Baueri Port's extraordinary story, "Varrak 2016, Aldo Randmaa, translated English.
Just before the work started, the climt had been to Ravennas San Vitares in Tunas, and researchers think that it is there that the brilliant mosaic mosages from the Emperor Theodora gave an artist the idea of making the golden Porree Adelest a mosasaiiger.
The climt was presented in its' Daam gold 'in Vienna in 1948, and around at the same time (1907-1908), another golden land was born' modern '.
The arts did not notice the similarity of two women.
How is Hitler linked to creativity?
"I think that, in memory of my friend climate, I owe it to him to make his work available to the public," said Adel Bloch-Bauer a few years after leaving the artist (Climate died in February 1918) to the Director of Belvedere museum and wanted their family's Climate College to go to museums.
Six years before death, the climmer had a marksree prepared from Adelest.
She also asked her husband to leave her two Portuguese treasures and four Good Climate mullahs to Austria Galder in February 1925.
He gave his gloves to the nurses of Mariana and Luca.
One year after the climt had finished 'Austrian Appendix Mona', attempts had been made to access the Akademines of Viin Kaagines, a 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but fell through the drawing board.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes seen as the reason why Jewish professors did not receive him into the Academy, none of his extracts was actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of Galder in Austria referred to in the testament had changed considerably since 1939 - it was important that the rich Jewish garages in Vienna find decent work for the Nazis.
Hitler's personal wealth of art also served some of the work at home, but not those of the climate.
Sixty years after Nazi art robbery, the ten-year-old dispute between the Austrian Government and the heirs of Bloch-Baukers began.
Let me just mention here that when 'Sinnovations' are seen in Vienna in the Belvedere Castle, Adel Bloch-Baueri's' Daami gold 'must be viewed as travelling to New York to Neue Galder.
And, before Vienna, read through the abovementioned book.
Even if you do not plan to go to the quake's work, because my emotion at least, after the closure of the book, more Nazi and Jewish issues than the magic and moll Adi Bloch-Bauer sold to the dollar.
So not so much a sports ree, rather a relatives' life - and a very moving story.
The events were significantly facilitated by the relatives of the Baukers mentioned at the beginning of the book.
17-year-old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonian records
In living terms, gold was 200 m of its own advenue to its own personal record, very close to swimming 2.16.62.
The Tippmark comes from a 17-year old festival every week since it became a 2.16.58 Championship in Canada, the Priit Aavik Ujuration bloc.
The gold finally escaped, or ten-A-finalists.
She went through her distance from 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh prize with a powerful new top level.
From Estonia's record (2.15.13), Alina Kendziori (2.15.13), the Golden has remained a little over half a second.
In Estonia's annual ranking, gold has risen third, and its fresh record of excellence is the fifth ever result of Estonia.
A young hope for the future is beginning at the adult Championships in Canada at 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in balking and 200 mm and 400 metres in bundling.
Last week, Canadian jewellery champions took place in Toronto, and gold also made successful headlines there.
He won 200 m in ammunition with a time of 2.03.22.
So quickly it was flooded as a distant spokesman by the last half in 2008.
From Golden times in Estonia, only the record Estonian Elina Parworka has distanced itself from it.
As a Canadian protagonist, a hundred m medal was won in a great personal record and a new Estonian season marathletes 56.66.
For example, the older Kertu ly Alnek of her year has distanced it by just one hundredth faster.
She reached her top level level with a further 100 m in the opening of a letter of 1.03.69 when she retired.
At a distance of half, he only obtained seven seats when he stunned in the final room 2.17.31.
Gold is currently heading the Estonian ranking at four different intervals.
President Trump goes on holiday, critics burn teeth
The time has come - that is to say a relaxation for the US President, Donald Trudal.
However, as the Truker has so far been one of the President who has taken off the most holiday days, critics are already inciting teeth.
According to the US Security and CNN, the President envisages 17-day leave in a water-free golf club in Bedminster, located in New Jerina.
Although presidential leave began yesterday, the issue of leave against Trumpi has been speaking for a week.
They are complaining too often about the Olympic Games.
It is the President's usual practice to spend a week exchanging his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey in cotton.
Incidentally, the Trump has not been cleared by the President for its 196 term.
For example, George W. Bush has already reached 67 days on holiday, while Barack Obama has half as much as Trump, but 21 days.
However, the Olympic Games tend to forget things quickly.
A few days after becoming President, Trump in his receipt said '60 minutes' that there would be no time for long holidays during his counterpart, because a great deal has to be done.
He also expressed his outrage at Barack Obama's leave three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at that time, 'while Obama is on holiday, he plays golf, the brakes and the jungle groups, journalists in Italy are pulling their heads from the sun'.
According to the officials of the White House, a 17-day golf club visit will not have any slippage.
Instead, it is officially called 'working time' during which the Olympic Games do not have time to read or other memories.
In addition, rest periods had to have a second reason.
That is why the special pension system on the west of the White House is being replaced and therefore all staff had to leave it.
The West also belongs to the Oval Office and the other premises of the President's office.
'I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West in August, if there are 38 degrees and there is no constellation ', said Lindsay Walters, speaking in the White House, who stressed that the President would continue to work during the holiday period.
Where President Trump will spend 17 days, you will get an idea of video.
Block the critics on Facebook: Do not stand for state office unless you tolerate the criticism of the voters.
The father of our country knew a great deal about unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not go long to get him bogged down for everything from internal politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, upset him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
Because, in 1783, Washington said, 'freedom of expression can be taken away from us and, more quickly and in silence, we may be led to slaughterhouses like sheep'.
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
The Hogan's submissions have blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their views on the official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union MOACLU therefore brought him to justice.
The Kuberner's officers tembed the action empty and web comment triumphed out of 'who interests?'.
'It is Facebook, 'many have said.
But that does matter.
And this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazing popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His approval rate is the second best among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not an unwise, responsive click.
It has led the State firmly and has remained firm in its principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool for communication with his constituents rather generously, for example, to present his own brick heads in the wake of the chemical season for the first time.
Therefore, the Governor's website in FTAs is a public forum with official labelling, managed by taxpayers' dollars' paid staff, which is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Chesse, defended the behaviour of the Governor in an interview given to The Washington Posselt, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than a moreation.
However, it is all too easy to paint a picture of online Internet checks, spam deputies or people full of anger.
The post interviewed a number of people who were blocked by Hogan.
This is what they are all about in order to communicate with their elected leaders: The teacher, the owner and passport holders, not Internet checks.
They all said that their comments were respectable, well thought-out and not at all Roma.
In his post, Pastor quoted the Bible, oppressing Hogan's Catholics.
A lawyer from Marylans Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Raman, did not encourage hatred, but rather hate crime.
"I politely agreed that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news reports," he wrote The mail news story in the country of comment.
'nor do I like the idea that, if many people comment on the same subject, some will immediately call it an indifference collective effort rather than admit that it is a great deal of concern to citizens'.
What the governors' office called a 'targeted spam attack' would probably invite others to 'public support'.
The Facebook era allows messages to be easily fitting, simply blocking criticism or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past when, to do the same, workers had to be expelled so that they could gather newspapers with critical leadership letters and burn them or arrest protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that is exactly what happens today, just digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for being toothless on Facebook and other social media.
President Trumpi has taken users of Twitter to court who have been blocked from Twitter.
One of the first martyous sentences on this issue was handed down in Virginia last week.
In Alexandria, Judge James C. Cacheris, the US Commander, decided that the chair of the Loudouni County Council breached the first revision of the constitution when he blocked the voter on his Facebook page.
In Kashtuckys, the Governor Matt Bevin (R) also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers typified his leadership.
And even then Washington had to face up to anonymous checks.
The people wrote letters to newspapers from pseudo-yths such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making the decisions of Washington land.
According to historic documents repeated in the project to collect the signatures of George Washington on the web, he was buried in a cabinet of petitions criticising his views on the agreements of friendship, trade and shipping with Britain.
But he did not force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, differences of opinion and debate are the foundation of our country.
And good governance means accepting this.

It is a rare pilots in Papua mÃ¤ki, a former colony in the Netherlands, which was added to Indonesia in 1969 following a referendum that created controversy, forcing just 1 026 old newspapers to vote before their eyes.
The Dutch supremacy has encouraged the move to move swiftly against the Jakarta Government, which is still keeping the region under its strong control, by keeping out foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially appointed Pope and Western Papua, leaving the eastern part of the island for independent Papua New Guinea.
The majority is both remote and abandoned; in order to get here 90 minutes from Jayapurvis, the capital of the province, will have to fly from Jayapurvis to Nabifix and will subsequently pass a five-hour journey with the rental vehicle.
There is no public transport.

Papua Leone is the poorest province in Slovakia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia.
But it is also a gold-rich country in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Paniai, which is a mountainous province with a population of 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, which belongs to Fritten McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeexports were extracted here with around USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, it is possible to import raw wood supplies with an estimated value of USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for boats because they are responsible for the suffocating presence of a powerful Slovak army.
The 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeexports cost approximately USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150 000 to one of the officers.

The 2016 report by the Chief Official Journal of Birsbane, 'We shall lose all', contains testimony to the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (rape and electricity strikes are particularly prevalent according to another report) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as such incidents take place every week," says the Sri Lankan researcher, Andreas Harsono, Human Rights Watch.
The winds have been watered down even more strongly, as Papua embers have caused the influx of new settlements from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Eighty-five per cent of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demographic change is changing because of the arrival of black-scale economic migrants in the islands of Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes from the People's Assembly of Indonesia.

The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, known as Jokow among the people, pledged to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Pope in his 2014 election campaign.
The former bottle won on its way to Jakarta's presidential Palace in Papua 29 regions of 27, including Paniai.
But the Pope has changed very little and the local people feel cheated.

According to the victims and spectators, under the influence of drunk soldiers hung behind children and deceive them with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shook among the children.
One child, 16 years old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into the house.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral Commission was burnt down and things further estualised the next day.
Approximately 1 000 young Papua scrutinise men, women and children gathered in a football pitch before the local police department and the military command centre to demand justice.
They weed cement-repair boilers and presented a trick of Papua mee's tribe waita-tank, which ran around and buried poultry songs.
Some protesters started to shoot at the police and the military.
On the increase in anger, a bulldozer was sent to the soldiers through the guerrilla. 'Whereas the crowd is more than three times resistance, let them down,' it was said in the official document, which has been shown to be a magazine of time but which has not been given to local media donors.
In Kego Koto, the oldest city of Yeremias Kayme (56), the city of Kenya experienced a threatening threat and called for peace by asking for a crowd to go home.
Nobody had the will to listen.
'When I switched around, I was suddenly shot in the left, 'he said to the magazine in his private colours on the verge of a disability house.
We still do not know who the shoot was, but says that this month the ranks of the soldiers gathered came from.
'The people were many, the icon of the iceberg, 'add him.
Alfius Youw, a local man who saw her shot on her doorstep, said three times.
'I would like to come to him and study him through the body to make sure that he is, 'said the magazine at the time in Yohano, who, like many indicators, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... Santileen."
The Chief Police officer, Yotje Mende, said to reporters that he was only ensuring the safety of his department because it was attacked.
'We must defend ourselves when we are threatened with killing, 'said Vice-President Pudjo Sulistiyo, the spokesman for the Treasury, in 2015.
'This is a matter of life and death '.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and there were many injured.
The news of the killings only came to Jakarti the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokow Jayapuras made a passionate speech in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses in Pope.
'I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in future '.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Wiranto, said that he would introduce an ADR mechanism for the resolution of crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, there were excuses.
"Most crimes occurred a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and the early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes, "he said.
However, speaking time at Jakartas on 5 June, Wiranto withdrew his words saying that he had no intention of creating a Pope mechanism to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said that 'everything will be solved by law'.
Wiranto, accused of crimes against human rights by the UN of more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999, said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Pania, including the events in Paniai.
The families of the victims of the Paniai have accepted such allegations with gloomy mistrust.
'I have been listened to four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress, 'said Yohanes.
'I am tired. '
He says he still lives in fear years on.
'I am afraid, 'he says.
'I am afraid I am being arrested by troops, I am afraid I am shot. '
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view that the people of Paniai fear destroying this incident.
He said that he got the army out of hand after he had helped to bury the four victims.
'Following the bodies of death, the army came to seek me, 'he says.
The celebrations have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Yemeni police shoot village population was shot in Deiyai in neighbouring Paniai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when it became a war between the village population and the head of the construction company, who refused to transport an informed man to hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Rurianus Douw, drowned into a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
The last village population protested on the site against the company's office.
According to the police, village residents stoned police officers, which they responded with warning visits.
However, according to local claims, mobile British people (the police armed by Indonesia) started to shoot at the people, killing a single person.
'We were very panic, we fear retaliation, 'said to the magazine the 29-year-old Dominging Badia i, who lives near hospital and saw injured inputs.
'I have been hiding in my house for two days'.
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and for the police to be pulled back to the region.
The Paniai has always been a problem area for the Government of Indonesia.
The lack of meaningful development nourishes the dissatisfaction of the male, mth, dangand sweet tribes living in Papua haljendatan.
Many of them have joined the Free Trade Organisation (VPL) Association army of GCC insurgents, which, according to its own accord, protects the rights of boats by carrying out casual attacks and kidnappings among Tibetan soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yog and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of protecting the sovereignty of the state, the army has been arresting in Pania over recent years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never appear again.
In the meantime, Paniaths are known as' tragic forgotten site '.
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The small rice sold in most swine is too expensive for local purchases.
B is equally inaccessible.
People grow all their food at breakfast levels, plus some fruit and vegetables.
Farming is the job of women, each of whom can care for four or five bachelors.
They usually keep most of the harvest on the family, while the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten bars cost only 10 000 blocks in Indonesia (75 cents).
Over time, economic imbalances between indigenous boats and new migrants, who have come across since the opening of new routes at Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist are going to be better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Pope users themselves often lack capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business.
'Young people are not interested in leaving the village because there is no jobs or money here, 'says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai tribal Council.
Isolation is keeping the eyes of the world away from Pope.
Furthermore, restrictions on foreign media remain tough.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Pope because 'they did not follow the relevant practices', even though they had been given a rare film authorisation.
According to Mr Kine, Deputy Chair of the Asian department of Human Rights Watch, the election promises made by Jokow have not been implemented to remove restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development.
"Indonesia, from the most uneasy provinces in the East and from the Western Pope reports, is threatening new threats to journalists to reject the Security visa and place a black list," said in his statement.
The lack of a media look means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to its immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries exhorted the Security Agreements, Nauru, Belau, Tupain, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands of the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate 'various large-scale crimes' in Pope, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have also historically supported VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman for Foreign Affairs in Indonesia, dismissed the charges of the charge, saying Jakarta for journalists: 'Democracy and freedom of the press still applies in Indonesia, so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bury'.
The local people want more foreign governments to be noted.
When the Dutch official delegation, led by the Human Rights Envoy of the country, Mr Van Bari, visited Jayapurat on 4 May, the local people interrupted their silence at the meeting, but the source of what they wanted to remain anonymous, urging me: 'We want freedom'.
In Indonesia, there will be new presidential elections in 2019, but boats do not believe that they will vote for Jokow again.
'Jokow is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of the Paniai 'says Hobai, Chairman of the tribal Council.
He wants to tell Jokow that, apart from the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly living under threat from a predatory army, they are struggling with misery due to poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like other boats, consider their vote cast on Jokow to be a debt they have to pay.
'They't need money, they want justice, 'he says.
Despite his ills and intimidation, the families of the captured victims of the Paniai fire were still struggling with the last symbolic resistance they swept in one of the victims' bodies of police stations and military incompetence into the land in question.
Knowing that justice may never be put on its feet, they at least do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
'One of our family members was killed 'says with the head of Yacobus.
'What else can we do? '
Came on the eve of Dubai Torch for the second time now.
On Friday, one of the highest residential buildings in the world was buried in Dubai, forcing hundreds of inhabitants to escape from this 337 metres desert and 79 regular buildings.
This is the second fire that has been ravaged in just two years by the high-ranking, which happens to be called the Torch, the Trupkovytor.
The building was evacuated, none of the injuries were reported and no direct fire causes were presented.
"We sleep and wake up to the fire camps and the fear of people.
We would expect training boats and it took us around 10 minutes to get down the 50th floor, "said to Reuters a resident who called himself George.
According to Dubai's civil protection officers, fire-fighters even deleted at around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and were cooling buildings.
The government said that they were working to ensure shelter for those affected.
This incident may once again raise concerns about the safety of high-quality external materials throughout the world.
An investigation carried out by the Torch Governing Board in the wake of the 2015 fire found that the worst damage was caused by the deressive panels and isolation of the orbit - the external surface.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenportfolio Tower and the ambassadors' panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire there in June, which killed around 80 people.
See: These phones are expected to become sales hubs in the autumn
TEEB and coal are timeframes for technological investors, which will then make phone manufacturers public their new models of excellence.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came to the wall, and new hitt phones are expected for the boys in the autumn as well.
According to the Telecoms marketing and sale Director, Christian jan Seema, today's flagship ships are characterised by an innovative design, an eye fast-track phone, a serse-servani 4K resolution and an ultra-fast process actor.
Samsung Galaxy S8, which is also at the forefront of the Estonian smartphone sales table, gave rise to high visibility in the technology world.
The autumn will allow smart hubs to be even more quickly loaded, more resilient batteries, a better quality camera and greater water and dust security.
He added that rumours can already make assumptions and predict the four top models that probably conquer today's sales age.
These four smart phone top-level models will be available to the shop in autumn this year.
The expected iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the boilers as early as mid-September.
The rumours of what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are spreading greatly.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences alongside the 6s of iPhone, then in the case of the tenth birthday of Apple, it is expected that the new model will be completely different from the previous ones.
Four paints have been spoken about: Black, white, rose and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen covering the entire front-of-the-phone window, lost the home and the fingerprints have been built on the screen.
The founder of Apple design, JonyIve, demands that the new model of iPhone look like a glass.
There has also been talk of an iPhone Ceramic version.
In addition to the elephant, upload-free recharging and an even higher quality camera, faster A11 processes can be expected.
It is certainly one of the most expected smart phones for a year.
The launch of the new model Galaxy merger 8 will take place on 23 August.
There have been many rumours about what the new Galaxy Move 8 will look like.
Admittedly, there is even more to do with the business users and S pen will allow for even greater functionalities.
The telecom fund should have two cameras, one of which is flat-rolled and the other has a telescope with a narrow view.
At present, nobody knows what two taboos are capable of camera, but in any case, it is the Zsung first test, which is definitely comparable to the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
However, we are eagerly awaiting 23 August.
Although Nokia has been selling three smart phones with Nokia 6 this year, there is still a shortage of their flagship - Nokia 8, which is already being presented on 16 August.
We expect from Nokian 5.3-month-round a screen and from Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processes and a more robust passage.
Nokia also talks about aluminium corps and a significant level of water and customs certainty from IP68.
Like the Samsungt, the new model of Nokia has two taboos in the camera, which is produced by an optimist company Zvany.
While Sony-proof flagship has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smart phones with even more innovative functions will be added in the near future.
We are waiting for a smart phone, which is a bit more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or the same camera.
There has been speculation about the new model of Sony that the screen is at least dry.
What reality brings us to see very soon, because traditionally Sony, its autumn flag vessel, has unveiled IFA at international technological level, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
Trump Mexico was pressurised by Trump Mexico for payment of the border wall, according to transcripts leaked telephone calls
The Washington post made public phone calls between US President Donald Trumpi and between Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, Enrique Pena Nieto, President of Mexico, travelled telephone to stop declaring publicly that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American President bowed with him for denouncing the wall publicly, saying, 'You must not say it to the press'.
The Trump has erected his presidential campaign promise to build a long way along the southern border of the United States and to make Mexico pay for this project.
Transcripts were also published from his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals an intense debate.
The Trump said to Turnbull that an agreement by which the United States takes on refugees to Australia is' ridiculous', 'nervous' and 'stupid'; he claimed that the agreement that was made under the Obama Administration would give him the impression of 'lead', as he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
The panel ended its speech by telling Turnbull that 'this was the most unpleasant speech of the day'.
The state court did not discuss a complaint by the city of Liines of OC MRP in the case where the town of Tartu rejected their offer for bus and coach transport between July 2019 and 2029.
It is a letter that rejected Liines in the city of OC MRP at Tartu bus procurement because the offer did not meet the requirements, Anfour Aputin, Head of Government Law Service for Tartu, explained.
This is a procurement process for public transport within the Tartu town, for the period from 1.07.2019 to 30.6.2029.
The city of MRP Liines complained against the decision of the Tartu District Court before the Supreme Court.
The national courts did not take this action.
Although many people complain in the social media that the lungle from the Weekend festival disrupts their night and the entire city is full of sufferers under the influence of drinking, there are also many who have no say at all about the festival lasting on the beach.
I am even positively surprised that the shops were so polite!
I did not see any confusion or discourtesy.
Even if I saw kindness, there is a colossal wave.
'It is all well and good to come, to be pleased and to know the joy of 2004, which has stayed like winter ', he happily adds.
The wave of rubble from the dose is not a shambles.
If he still heard in the middle of the city that music is being played on the beach, now music has not yet reached his home list.
'But, I hope I hear ', he happily says.
The floor in Agnes also talks about the fact that the Grand Festival is rather good for Persons - that is why it makes a significant contribution to the turnover of local merchants.
Furthermore, it welcomes that the summer capital has come to such a large extent.
The woman of the elderly does not care.
Although I am not going to eat any more days on the beach, it is nice that rand has revived.
And it is good that the people are moving, and it has already been so three times', says a woman.
The first time was probably a little worse.
'That perhaps there were complaints', he is wondering.
What he said about the rigour, however, is normal for summer's capital.
"This Weekend is a very good prophet for our little city," Harri, who is hiding on the park.
Life and mÃ¶ll have not been the lifeblood of his life either.
But for what?
We should all pull together.
Think how this interethnic communication is better.
After all, the white man is not shaking.
It does not, although I live there near.
'Good people can make savings and there is no scapegoat ', he speaks.
Visitors coming to enlargement said they were courtesy.
"With bottles, of course, they are a little exaggerated, but young people are young people and Lord's God - let us go, but be people and do it!" She says.
The people on the ground have travelled off somewhere by then, whether to relatives or to acquaintances.
"But generally the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this meals," said Tiina, with her children.
His family's mood of festivals also does not bother, even though it was even further removed from the street last year.
Last summer, the scene was the other way round, we heard more.
We live outside the city itself that, in fact, it treads there quite well around the River Persian, 'he talks.
Pearson cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revitalise business
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3 000 jobs and reduce its distance dividends by 72%, thus launching another restructuring programme to address the dangers of business.
The jobs to be covered, which will be laid off according to John Fallon, the CEO, most likely at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will add to the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May a further GBP 300 million (USD 394 million) reduction programme to try to revive a business that has been hit by the transfer of fast-start digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its partner company, Bertelsmann, Penguin Random House, last month, said that their expectation of a year has not changed since the announcement of a 1% increase in sales of GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

The attack in Kabul: A NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
The suicide bombers, according to officials, attacked military convoys in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing several NATO soldiers and wounded several others.
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreter were injured.
According to unapproved local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the town of Qarabaghi.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have befallen Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 deaths in the Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement said that there was an explosion on Thursday evening when joint patrols with the Afghan army were attacked by 'explosive remnants made by man'.
According to the statement, everything has been injured in a stable state and is being treated in the US military hospital in Bagram Airport.
According to correspondent speakers, the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (Pakistan) are a serious source of concern for NATO forces in Qarabaghi in Bagram.
According to UN data, in the first half of 2017, at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan, some 20% of them in capital.
At the end of July, at Kabul, the car bomb killed at least 30 people, mainly in the Shiite line.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the centre of the city, which has caused most deaths in the country since the US-led forces withdrew the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops and police assisting the country.
According to the correspondent, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
In the EPA, after the decision to postpone the summer regulation was annulled
The United States Environment Protection Agency (United Nations Environmental Protection Protection Agency) annulled the decision to delay the establishment of a Obama regulation obliging states to limit emissions from the summer, one day after 15 states sued the Agency for this move.
In the EPA, it announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday with the 'procedures for determining the content of the shareholder', saying that this demonstrates the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe that we need to engage in dialogue and listen to our partners in our states," said Scott Pruitt in his statement.
Pruth had announced in June the intention of the EPA to defer the levels of ozone content in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level of compliance with the most stringent air quality standard should be reduced by one year to the wall in 2018.
The 15 predominantly democratic states, together with the Columbia community, submitted an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision was unlawful.
President Donald Trumpi's government has tried to bring back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, which, according to Trumpi, is part of a broader plan for growth.
However, these efforts have provoked reactions among democrats and natural conservation groups, which are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that air breathing containing ozone 'may reduce the employability of lungs and increase the risk of suffering from respiratory diseases', such as asthma.
German swine can come pipe.
German pigs and bovine animals may be caught because heavy rainfall threatens the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, Bizberg writes.
This year, it may well be the case that weeks of contamination before harvest can mean that fruit destined for bread can only be fed to animals.
'The quality of the content is far worse than that of the soil and worse than it was in 2015, 'Agravis Raiffeisen was said by Mr Bernhard print.
This year, up to 40% of German nicotine for animal feed, which is fed compared to business as usual, is forecast in Agrace.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all gloves this year.
First of all, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, replaced by a heat wave in June.
In July, German sailors were hit, which has continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned on Northern Germany, where rain hinders the harvest.
So far, only five per cent of the joke has been repeated.
Most of the region has not even begun to harvest, announced local catches in Ceravis.
'This is quite a difficult day ', said Frank Deckert Rendsburg, the senior trader in Ceravis.
Consistency in everything, that is to say the stubborn roof of the internal design of Finns

Mainy Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mainy Garcia, who should be on a collision course to be faced with the most attractive boxing boxing in the near future of up to 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in the office of ESPN in LOS Angeles separately, until Garcia, the defeated World BoHeritage Council athron, walked the other end of the corridor in order to welcome Lomachenkot, the World Trade Organisation Payment zationi sulgambtsch.
Following the unanimous decision of Garcia, the victory of the former four-fold world champions, Adrien Broner, on Saturday, in Showpes, are both on the front page of the ranking.
Garcia extended her better hand and said, 'When will it go, how will it go?
I wish you well. "
Lomachenko protects its belts with Miguel Marrija on Saturday evening at 19 ESPN sites.
When a couple of photos appeared, Lomachenko mÃ¤nejer Egis Climate stated that a possible confrontation between combatants would be a 'perfect measure'.
'I am a former sultsman ',' recalled Garcia.
'I stood up for Bronger [63.5 kg], but I am not so big.
I am small for 63.5 kg.
I want to move downwards.
And it has to move upwards of the frivolous [61.2 kg], and then we can fight.
Fans have called for this.
So let us put it to them. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world needs this fight."
The climate raised the question of whether it should be worthwhile looking at it; it is part of his strategy that he wants to allow Lomachenkol to debate 61.2 kg of class later this year in order to make it possible for a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 noremoti) next summer, who also has an interest in combating Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbelli's match after their friweight in Ford on 23 September.
"Looking at this fight could be worthwhile because the fans have called for this confrontation," said Garcia, later on, that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial package.
"We are the main actors.
No other name can get so much attention.
Whenever they are ready... '
Mrs Garcia said that she regards Lomachenkot as a 'force fighter' and she may go to her desk day.
However, Lomachenko was humble in praising Garcia, saying that he thought the champion of the three divisuals from Riverside was' very slow '; sorry, Mainy... you wanted that noxty'.
According to Garcia, the aim was to show strength and then to bow down.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension is growing in order to meet them.
"This is a struggle that remains to be realised.
No other confrontation arouses so much attention and noise.
I am more than willing to work towards this, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, 'I have been waiting for the best fighters, and Mainy is precisely that.
This will be a good fight. "
Which parts of the world are going to move to Estonia?
Last year, the police and border control authorities (PPA) granted a record number of more than 13 000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
When, for example, last year, a fixed-term residence permit was decided to be issued to 6702 foreign nationals, the figure was 4928.
The offices cannot say how many migrants will ultimately remain permanently in Estonia, but this analysis will be carried out in the Ministry of the Interior.
When, ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year, in recent years, this figure is beginning to close to 2000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased exponentially during the Ukrainian crisis, with 1087 people receiving a fixed-term residence permit in 2014, up from 675 in the previous year.
According to the statistical office, the highest number of Ukrainian citizens is growing in Estonia: Last year, 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia were more than left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and it is natural, due to the difficult circumstances in the country, that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many others are already looking before the family," said Christin Rammus, the spokesperson at the Ministry of the Interior.
In writing. - (PT) The number of Ukrainians authorised to reside on a fixed-term basis was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, even though in 10 years the total number of fixed-term residence permits have been granted to the latter.
If Ukrainians come here largely to work, Russian citizens will be on account of family migration.
"Considering the historical Russian community here, they are also most likely to have the most family ties with people living in Russia," the migrant theatre of the Internal Guard, Helina Meuse, said.
'If you look at where Russian citizens who have been granted residence in Estonia have moved, after Haryana there is an Eastern ViruCountry ', he added and pointed out that around 40% of them were helpless with European Union citizens.
Soil was authorised for a fixed-term residence of 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians seeking residence permits decreased.
"Hype is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence in Estonia," commented Rammus, the Ministry of the Interior press officer, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia's residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
A new residence permit for Estonia will be able to apply for foreign nationals who have lived here for at least three years from last year.
It aims to encourage the rearing of those who have been adapted.
However, a long-term residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased because of the new residence permit.
For example, soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Ukrainians can now change their jobs, and the Estonian state will not stop pointing the finger at whether the pay criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular in the garden - the proprietors of the bad's passport (1029), the Russians (487), the Indians (54) and the young (36).
In total, 1968 people were granted residence permits in Estonia for accommodation purposes, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
The first half of this year already has a total of 1269 such applicants.
In ten years, Nigeria has become strangely a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for residence permits in Estonia.
When three residence permits were issued to the so-called 'gay' in 2007, there were 200 last year.
Students from Nigeria are coming to study here.
In addition, higher education institutions in Estonia are popular, for example, among Georgians, the Chinese and the Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely thanks to the learning games.
They, too, are governed by the rule that wherever the community has come into existence, there will be easier others. "
In 10 years, two people have also moved to Estonia from North Korea, for example, to Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If around 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit a year, that is around 0.46% of the total population.
Even if we add to the citizens of the European Union, migration remains at around a percentage, "the Main commented that the figures are actually small.
A total of 14,822 people travelled to Estonia, according to the statistics office, out of 13 792.
This means that immigration has exceeded emigration for another year.
The majority of those who move are Estonian citizens, but more are out there.
That is why Estonia's citizens' migration balance was in a mine of 2 000 people.
Estonians, in particular, migrate between Finland and Estonia.

In the north-west, however, Maria Tammeoru has a history - old paintings and defendants: 'I can dream of somewhere in the museum for hours and admire the thieves and cracks of old times.
If you take the lead with your stone, you will study and learn about it every day.

Martin Myrsepp of U18 boys: The weapon of the pro-Afghan Captain has now been turned against us.
I am sorry, the fairy tale ran out.
The first thing was that we did not get our feet.
And if there is such a gap on Saturday, there is nothing to do, "Estonia commented on U18 Corvpallical 61: 75 abstentions in Britain in our only basketball, BC Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsel.
Opponents of the wave attacked 28 plates and suffered so much more attacks as a result.
Nor was we prepared for their aggressive defence or attack; it created it.
Many British attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up protection.
In defence, however, they were able to keep their hands everywhere; we were unable to combine.
It has left the team on its feet.
The homework of the opponents was better done.
Myrsepa estimates that Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take off the momentum in the bud.
Last but not least, we had a zero error, but the opponents have already received several quick corners.
Intransigence and intense insistence, which was our weapon on the alagrhop, all turned against us now.
Today we did not have the strength against their aggressiveness.
The flag remained satisfied with its carelessness in Kalevis, Matthias Tass.
In general, tourism can say fine words about the whole team, and until now there has been a united blow.
It is a pity that such aggressive responses had not been met in the past.
Tass has always been self-confident and played out today, but he seemed tired - he has borne quite a heavy burden.
But he made some quite nice moves, which I have seen in the past as trenches, in addition to the guide. "
Terrible figures: The corvpallitany of nesia threw less than 10 points on EM-turnil with three quarters...
The eighteen age class does not apply only to H.B-divisjon Korvpalliturniir in Tallinn, she started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
And, unfortunately, Estonia's gamble with Poland bowed down to antirecorners.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but still after the third quarter, it was 9: 49, or only at the last ten minutes, the opponents took their feet from the gas beet, and the period remained 16: 16.
On both the first and the second quarter Estonia had 4, third point...
In so doing, in the first two minutes, the Estonians hit two pieces of the first four pieces, going on to play 25 pieces, then one in three, and then another 21 tears in the...
Perhaps in almost half an hour, 47 fingers were caught.
In addition, 2 points came from four layers.
There was a reasonable number of losses at that time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland's compliance rate was 33% and Estonia had 13% (68 / 9).
Estonia has started two losses, and on the opening day Portugal had 83: 56 better.
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to supplement the stock
Today, NATO's 1 permanent anti-personnel group arrived in Tallinn for a weekend in order to complement the stockpiles of vessels and prepare for pre-existing exercises.
During the visit, ships are preparing for the accommodation of the seas, thereby giving crews the opportunity to break daily leave.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonia's waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future historical bombings.
'The participation of Estonians in the NATO entity and the joint courses of action they carry out in local waters illustrates our integration with allied forces', says the brigade Artenesto Reinland, the head of the operation and planning department in the vicinity of the naval flotilla.
Since 29 June, NATO will host a permanent anti-personnel group 1 led by the Latvian Navy Captenant Gvido Laudups, who took over from Estonia's naval officers, Johan-Elias, at a ceremony in Riga.
The group's flag vessels are assigned the Latvian naval support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also has a steering seat of a group.
During this semester, the Estonian Navy's mine hunt is also part of the international contingent.
As one of the four groups of NATO's naval management personnel, NATO's 1 permanent mine group is the first rapid response unit, which the alliance can send within five days to different parts of the world.
Between 4 and 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the children of Birgitta Festival, who was born 13 years ago by Maestro Eri, will be detained.
This year, according to Birgitta Festival, according to the art leader of the Municipality of Municipality of Tallinn, Delto Joosti (36), it will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risk Joost: Listeners end up in a 'Travieta' and 'Tosca' class in the world, balletiques from the lummable 'Bolerost' bus' Karlssonini ', and there is no plan for self-productions, which is this time Joseph Haydni's wonderful orchestra' Aastage 'by the same international creative team who, in 2015, brought the Pirivas Halaydni Valley to life.'
Birgitta Festival has much more than just concerts and theatres.
It is larger than any muscle theatre in its normal form.
It is a festival whose snow takes hold and never gets rid of.
Because the experience that the listener receives in this superior and mysterious environment makes human spirits more generous and concerns human qualities in a way that cannot be described.
At risk, you are the art leader of Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Did the shoes of the Maestro Eri Klass not feel a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klaus, it has been very helpful.
She pushed me across my entire schooling career and also supported the start of the adjustment career.
Perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work.
In Klas, the team of Birgitta Festival has been so much bent and, of course, all of this is passed on to me.
It was excellent to join a team that knows exactly how things are going.
It was the great heart of Eri Kestival that gave me the strength to move forward with Birgitta Festival in Tallinn.
And here I am and I can do it!
What could audience this year at the Festival, what are you offering in particular?
We have the artists in England, Latvia, Lithuania and, by the way, the first ballett written on Astrid Lindgren's speech comes as a surprise.
It is' Karlsson lens lb '.
And one criminal nuance in this regard is that the author of this Balolet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a wish to write the act.
Obviously, he has already been living with the Carlsson carpet from his child.
At risk, how could you tear it all down?
It is certainly thanks to my life colleague.
Such work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I am thankfully relieved of it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people as on me, in other words, how I go down every new day.
And this awareness of the tone, of keeping it positive and, in fact, of laughing ourselves in the mirror this morning, has greatly increased my percentage of happiness.
Especially this week, when there are the most important tests, I have been particularly keen to practise this and it works.
Self-absorption boosts the brain and breeds the tone.
That is simply not a word.
I think people are not yet aware of the body offered by the universe to them, but each of us will discover it slowly.
Right now, it is an important moment.
Will you also have some clothes before you take the dirigend?
It is still the case that clothing must be sold off against more comfortable ones.
This is a small moment for ourselves.
But in general, yes, I have no opportunity to rest or to make a little bit of stunning before I speak.
In fact, I even like to engage actively with people, even before dirigendidder takes off.
But come to Birgitta Festival, there are also not a major operatives and ballet friends!
Watch the video with the threat to Jookart!
New results of the age assessment tests for asylum seekers in Sweden were published
In Sweden, asylum seekers were selected for a medical assessment of their age with a novel approach, and the latest results of the test show that more than 80% of the constitutions were assessed as older than 18, but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute for Legal medicine (RLOtsmedicinalverket) started the tests later this year.
The tests were set up to make a more accurate assessment of age during the asylum application following criticism of the Swedish migration agency (migration ambsverket) for failing to correctly determine the age of many allegedly underage refugees.
To date, migration manages to send 68 80 cases to the test and the Institute of Justice has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid-March 2017 and 31 July.
Eighty per cent (2002) were evaluated as 18-year-old or older, and 25 more cases were assessed by the Institute of Legal medicine that the trial 'may be 18-year old or older'.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that man is' probably younger than 18 '.
Tests will only be used if people's age is called into question.
According to John GÃ¶Francson, who works in the Institute of Justice, the results are consistent with those of the past months.
"We do not see much difference between the statistics of the past months; the figures are quite consistent," he said to The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have left their age.
The Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and stated that, in 442 cases, 'there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 or older'.
However, when the newspaper Svensson Dagbladet examined the results of their 581 test, it turned out that in 243 cases, one had declared directly that it would be 18 this year.
This method of medical age assessment, in which smart cocktails from X-ray and field MRI are then allowed to be analysed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some quarters.
One of the sceptics is the endokrinology of the Karolinska Institute, Mr Claude Marcus, whose tasks include assessing people's biological maturity in order to find out whether they were going through the audience sooner or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement currently used should be used.
The establishment of biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we cannot say for sure, we should not pretend that we can, 'he said forestry to history.
But Johan GÃ¶Francson, the Institute of Justice, defended the accuracy of the tests: 'In general, it can be said that there is little risk of dissociating a child inaccurately into adulthood.
Perhaps the biggest figure of around 10% is the risk if you are a little under 18. "

The 20-year-old Kyoto fighter Anna Maria Orel put the London Mil in a nice debate, getting a good 18 seat with 67.307.
After that, MM noorim was a female biscumb, and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for the medals in the future.
The contest went well and gained good experience.
With the first test (64.80), I immediately took up my average result, while in the second (62.80) I risked too much, and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep it clear, "said then after the competition.
I have been looking for my emissions and I am very pleased that I have found it.
Anna Maria Oreli MM's debate ended with a good 18 seats.
Vihmasadu Orelit was not disrupted because, after all, he is going through the winter stage of the LTTE.
'I am potatoes', he said with a small mutiny.
The London Olympic Games had almost a full house of people, did Orel have people around it or were able to turn themselves off?
I was Tajani, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says that it gives more - that is!
If you compete yourself, you can experience it.
After all, it was confirmed that there would be a lot of satisfaction with the MM debate and he still has many good competitions ahead of him: 'I came here with the 32nd or final result of this year's season, I ended in 18th.
That is a very good result.
I am 20 years old and I - that is the only thing that matters.
I take on board a good experience, and on a few days I want to compete on behalf of the medals.
Western Virgina governber announced party change
West Virginia democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced on a Thursday evening with President Trumper that he would change political parties.
'Why it or not, the democrats bleed away from me, 'said Governor Justice.
'Today I say to you, having stood up and thought... today, I will tell you, the Western Tyre, that I can no longer help you as a democratic Governor '.
During the round, the tricks were filled with joy.
"So I will be Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a engineer, I would say to you that it is time to play a different game."
The Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Virginia.
The Trump won in Western Virginias with 42 points, and Justice did not support the Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Formeri, is the only billionaire in the state, proved to be elected in 2016.
Forkness notes that it has coal mines in five states and a coal business in its own right.
Its value is close to USD 1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) published on Thursday evening stating that 'Governor Justice's party change is another blow to the democratic party, which would rather prevent the country from being made better again than would work for it'.
'The only 15 months old and control over the least numerous states in history: The announcement by Governor Justice is simply the most recent wake-up call to the parade, which runs from the very end and is unable to find a positive and united message, 'said RNC representation Ronna Mcdied in the CBS Newsi Statement.

Coe praised fair apology to Russians for Doping Fair
The international rhythm Sebastian Coe, who said that 'Russia's four-day fair apology' for the doping scandal, reiterated that this is not the time to allow sport back to the country.
At the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup, Russia's lightweights, Dmitry Shystophtin said that the ban on competitions imposed on her country is the right one and has a definite aim to combat doping.
He apologised 'to all frivolous classes that have been snatched away in the competitions in the fields of gold and silver meals'.
Despite his comments, IAAF Congress voted to maintain the entry into force of the competition ban introduced in November 2015 after the WADA report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Costa to journalists.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Permanent Union itself recognised that they had rather difficult times and that they would do their utmost to reform the Union."
Furthermore, according to Coe, it was pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own recovery.
"I believe that today has been a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the time to withdraw Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything possible in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate free sportspeople from a damaged system, "he added.
Ninth Russian frivoler who meets strict criteria of IAAF will compete as neutral athletes in the light of World Cup in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF Working Group, Rune Andersson, said on Monday that Russia is not yet meeting a number of criteria for forecasting.
After a presentation to IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that training engineers who are banned are still operating freely.
The electric car revolution is making a significant difference to the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the electricity car revolution change significantly everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, but it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that one place will win and the other will lose out, it will not help smaller mining firms.
Today Glencore coal and oil serve, but in the future, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nicotine will increase in the age of electric cars.
This year, the UK, France and Norway governments have contributed to the proliferation of electric cars, allowing fossil fuel cars to be banned in the coming decades.
Volvo has therefore already known that he is planning to abandon his combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper winter 3 electric cars onto the market.
Bizberg New Energy Finance predicts that over two decades more electric cars will be sold than cars using oil.
'For some metals this alters everything ', the Capital Economics Economics raw material analysts Simona Gambranin to Boliberi said.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, which have been growing in demand for years.
In electric cars there are approximately three times as many answers as in the conventional car, the Glencore report.
Even more answers are needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paris estimates that it will increase copper demand by around 5% by 2025.
An increase in demand for electric cars means further demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and tungsters.
Glencore will benefit from an increasing trend in electric cars from an increase in copper prices and from being the world's largest cobalt producer, the forecast Jeffeffinning Group.
This broker company estimates that other winning electric cars will be won by Fressell-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market reacts to an already changing trend.
This year, 70% of metallic stock coded in London.
The increase in soil prices was 37%.
The answer has also grown by 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore Bank shares rose by 20% in London, having surpassed the price increase to the rival Rio Tin, BHP Billiton and Anglo Caribbean.
On the side of the losers, there are lead companies, such as Recyclex and Campine, which have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of the gas is the batteries supplying the flow of petrol and diesel-powered cars.
Electric cars use liitiulation batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for any other purpose that can overcome the fall in demand," Michael Widmer, the producer of America, the chairman of the Metal Market for Merrill Lynchi, said.
There is still no evidence of the impact of the dwindling trend in the form of a ping price movement.
The pound has been fishing at 17% this year, which is the best metal in London for the main industrial metals.
Investors will only see problems on metal in the long term.
'I am not sure that leads will be so bad because cheap oil will hold conventional cars in competition ', Herwig Schmidt, the head of Triland Metals, said.
If lead demand falls, it will slow.
Perhaps that will be the case in about ten years' time.
However, in the meantime, stricter emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, which are heavily dependent on lead-based batteries for the launch of engines, is being evaluated by the International Organisation for lead and Industry.
Lung metals like aluminium replace steel as a light car can go further with less electricity.
This explains the additional fixed minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes between 2013 and 2016.
This represents 2.7% of the world's GDP for aluminium.
This trend is likely to worsen, says Widmer.
Aluminium has been fishing for 13% this year, as the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers will not.
Ak Srada holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce wonderful cartels.
ArcelorMittal and ash SroadEurope are also trying to develop a lighter melting area from steel in order to counter the minimum.
'The strong steel should be the answer to this development ', says the Exane BNP Paris analysis, Sylvain Brunet.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to the platinum.
Soil took around half of this precious metal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars, Johnson Matthey announced.
"Many raw materials currently high demand, such as oil and posters, may not face high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, the Natixis raw materials analyst.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Platoinate producers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, leader of Uncore, said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025.
In the 10-year perspective, the great hope of the Platinan producers is on hydrogen-based cars developed by Toyota Motors and Hytoei Motos, which rely on the platinum to produce electricity from hydrogen.
Up to now, however, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
'That seems to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars', says Exane BNP Paris from Brunet.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July because the Stuttgart Court banned diesel in the town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How the financial rules for football affect the migration of Neyra to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent the world record transition of Neyra from the Spanish football club in Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequence from UEFA, the steering Board, which dominates the European game and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious League of Maritime Ministers' movement, lies ahead of Paris Saint-Gerth.
The financial rules for fair play (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 will mean that the PSG will have to demonstrate at some point that the takeover of Neyra was financed without huge damage.
Barcelona received â¬222 million ($262 million) only to buy the Brazilians out of his contract, and the remuneration of Neyra will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are some financial aspects of the integration of Neyra into the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to pick up this money to recruit Neyra and add its stars to the banditous rig, given that the team is funded by the governing family of the Qatar energy bank.
Clubs are allowed to spend a great deal on recruiting players, but they must balance this with legal sources of income that enable them to come out of a football club.
FFFP was set up by Michel Platini after being elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into big debt in search of success are actually fraudulent and run the risk of ruin if banks or owners are to give up support.
From 2011, FFP will focus on monitoring these losses instead of the debt of clubs.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich first in 2003 in Chelsea - buying a club with potential and then making huge costs in order to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
FFP during the current three-year evaluation period, which runs until 2018, clubs may suffer losses of up to â¬30 million.
And despite the shameless exclusion of Platini from the presidential office in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules," said last week The infected Pope Andrea Traverso, who is the guardian of UEFA-FP.
Although PSG paid for the Neyra overpurchase clause as a single integrated payment, they will be able to distribute this amount for accounting purposes for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year agreement, which is why it will be possible to show a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
For the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi Manchester Cityga, received the most severe penalties.
A fine of EUR 60 million was imposed on the PSG (currently USD 82 million), which was then reduced to EUR 20 million, and a club was called for to limit the crew of the League of Ministers during the season 2014-2015 to 21 players instead of business as usual.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to rock over the financial institutions by exposing their incomes to businesses linked to owners.
The Ktar company may sponsor the PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is deemed to be above standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that Qatar tourism Authority (PSG) support was worth blowing up.
It has been said that a certain part of the Neyra PSG service may come from Kainfrastructure through payments from the World Cup Management Committee for 2022.
However, the PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neyra could become a member of the World Cup and claim that UEFA's regulatory authorities could easily reveal this manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in any attempt to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not been proactive in discussing the transition to PSG Neyra.
They spoke with The dant on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed, as they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PSG.
The latest reports show that more than â¬10 million in profits from the PSG during the 2015-2016 season are worth around â¬542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have an impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and distribution.
The club expects at least a 30% increase in turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
Spain too, clearly annoyed by the departure of one of the largest football stars, sought to hinder the transition to Neyra, claiming that PSG is in breach of FP.
"This is a clear case of" financial doping "with clubs and country," said La ga President Javier Tebas to Spanish newspaper AS, indicating that the PSG is mainly in Katar.
Arci Wenger, Arsenal hill and club members of the American sporting magnate, shares the view that the state finances the club.
"That is the result of ownership rights and it has changed the whole football landscape completely over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club is a state, it is all possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play as a country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a big player. "

Today 50 years ago: The hurricane storm in Estonia ripped off houses and windows.
The hurricane mentioned for the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August, caused severe damage, particularly to the West, Harulin and RaplaCountry.
In the north-west of Estonia, the wind was over 30 m / s during these days.

According to local communities, the trees behind Paralepa were lagging behind, some were completely lengthy, some were boys.
Everyone saw very depressing, the storm went through hundreds of old trees as a ragby and pragmatism like a war.
Western Viruya was not particularly badly affected in August 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the damage there was great, wrote a communicator of Virumaa in 2007.
The LULPark and Padise Park were swept away from the ground, but our kiss parks were also severely affected.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured at speeds of up to 35 metres per second, around 130 kilometres per hour.
In Tallinn, in the evening of 6.August, one little lead rings had shouted: 'Mother, mother!
Canaries are in the air and are no longer signed! "- Virumaa Official Journal.
In Viljanten, the building of the term 'generation' was destroyed in such a way that it was decided to be demolished at a later date.
The design of the TÃ¼ri ski ski hill, which was later not restored, was not opposed to the lighting storm.
The newspaper Red Tokt wrote on 12 August 1967 that the harvesting of towns and settlements from buried trees and their truck is progressing slowly, and the population could get involved in cleaning work.
Productive fields were also badly affected in the Turin, and the newspaper reported that 'party organisations must be an incentive and a driving force on both flat-rate and fertility corners'.
You can talk about cells if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s.
The Putin wind in Estonia will continue from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul measured the wind at 48 m / s.
The volcano broke down on the island, so the rate of strength measured there could not be accurately recorded.
General bathing areas secret: Night harvesting and bad coastline
Ports of summer also mean less duplication in Tallinn's bathing areas.
'If there is no, people are on the floor, and if not, then there are no people ', the beach says.
In the beach of Stroom in Northern Tallinn, the cameras are kicked.
They are offered by a tractor in the low turns of competition that is plundering platitudes.
In fact, the latter is going through a seven-metre-old sand, chasing out of it a sea war and a risk left behind by people: Puppies, cigarettes and so on.
People still come to rank, regardless of whether water is soed or not.
If there is a beauty, then people are on the floor, and if not, there are no people either ', Alexander Usov, the head of the hospital maintenance work of the company, says Alexander Usov.
There are 6.30 p.m., and there is a bitter correlation in the beach, because the record at 8 a.m. has to be in order for people to be in order.
The job post is already at 4: 00.
Apart from Stroom, he is still watching on the edge of Pirita, Harku Lake, KakumÃ¤e and Palitiaare Pikakar.
The quantity of PrÃ¼m has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can now already assess what is being done for them, "Usov is talking about who has been crossing the island for 15 years.
Before that, when something new was put on hold, it was already the next day.
Now it is already being held what is bearable.
Clean land pricing
One of the biggest entries in Estonian beaches is the repetition of saturated marine rubbish, that is to say adru.
On the Pirita beaches, for example, it has to be transported by 400 000 tonnes from the coastal season.
'It is an incredible amount ', marking Usov.
The second big category is municipal waste, or all that people leave behind.
There are eight large-scale rubbish mines on a one-and-a-half-kilometre coastal region in Stroom, which need to be emptied three times a week.
So much is created by rubbish.
However, cold summer weather has meant that rubbish is one fifth less than otherwise.
The third species comprises abandoned objects.
For the most part, these are cargo flights.
As this harvest, ten agglomerations of the sludge have pulled out of Usov's sand.
They will await the owners on a trail route.
'normally they are coming out more, but this is normal harvest '. She knows that she will soon find them back in the sand.
Children come to rank and take toys to flood them back in the sand.
Landfill is broken down
Erika Scholler, the representative of the management services in the hospital, concedes that the work of the tractor disturbs local communities.
Noise, which runs from night to night, is disrupting the lives of the people living in the neighbourhood.
On the day, however, this work is impossible.
One month has to go through the army twice.
'If we do not do this, the urban section will fine us', Mr Scholler notes.
However, like Pirita, Pikakari and Enlargement, the aim is also to bring Stroom rand to the top quality of the international flag.
"Much more work is needed in Estonia than in Europe to ensure that beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We have more cloth and more stone and harder to live in the sand.
On our beaches, however, there is less rubbish than in other parts of Europe.
When I hear that there is talk of waste on the beach, Mr Martin, living near Stroom beaches, is moving round a circle of journalists and corroboration workers, highlighting the current weaknesses.
There is a picture of the gallery every day of tomorrow.
The problem is birds and puppet slaves who have pulled rubbish bags', Mr Martin says.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour to date, Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the waste bin and will impose on them, for example, cafes, to prevent them from at least in the cities there from news.
Overall, however, Martin is pleased with the development of the Stroom beach.
We can see that the city is taking care of this.
It has become more pleasant with children's fields, lighting and newly asphalt roads.
Once upon a time, it was only possible to travel one way, "said Martin.
Bread in Stroomis: Coins, only coins
The measurement period of the morning has had to be used by 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a island fuel, is strangling along the coast with metal detectors.
He does not believe that something precious will be found today or in the future.
Marine God is not generous enough to do this.
'I have been working on this for a year and have not yet found anything valuable ', says Dmitry.
As a Hobiarchy village, Dmitry's treasuries are some euro coins, bottles and also dangerous pounds that are subsequently thrown in the bin.
Normally, there are coins.
'The Golden, the finger and so on are usually not ', says the island village.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain stable, as weak economic growth and debt alleviation have cushioned speculation on the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that growth is still a sluggish matter, as the hard-pressed incomes of households have put interest rates on hold.
The policy makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6: 2 percentage points to 0.25% and fewer members demand an increase this month because slow economic growth has weakened support.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 from 1.7% and from 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households' incomes would remain as inflation is still expected to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank signalled that the rise in tariffs is necessary to contain inflation due to Brexy over the next few years, and the financial markets may need to have a higher than expected increase in loan costs.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package, which has been launched as a result of Brext.
In February, the Bank will end up with a fixed-term cash scheme that will provide cheap finance to banks, although it said that it is now expected to supply GBP 15 billion more under this scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the Bank says, 'gross domestic product (GDP) remains powerless in the near future as the difficult situation of real household incomes continues to have an impact on consumption'.
On the rates, it was repeated that, in order to mitigate inflation, 'fiscal policy is required to' make some effort 'and' somewhat larger 'than the markets are expected.
The stock is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any jump is gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are comparable to the forecasts for May at 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast of 1.8% growth in 2018 remained stable.
After that news, the pound fell in exchange for the dollar and the euro.
It fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make any changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures, which have raised expectations of a rise in diesel GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% in the last three months to 0.3%.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will gather some momentum at the end of the year.
The Bank's most recent inflation report gave little reason to welcome rising inflation and wretched households, saying that the situation is getting a little worse before the recovery.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent income losses in the next few years, but a significant recovery is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Thanks to the black pound, the growing demand for British production is also stimulating the economy, which is partly offsetting consumers' lower costs.
The decision comes one year after the level was taken last August at 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, which caused the sudden weakening of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to completely breathe life into prices and the economy.
Before the last decision of the Bank, there was a growing demand for higher rates, as inflation had increased pressure on hard-pressed households; in July, three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell last month from 2.6%, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said that excess growth compared to the 2% target was due to the completely weak pound.
The head of the mortgage broker in Coreco, Andrew Montlake, said: 'In view of the recent downturn in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is once again becoming increasingly competitive, as lenders want to work and hope to complete the year positively.
Mr BÃ¶rs seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end, as refinancing, often without service and at low rates, has become increasingly popular. "
10 000 people are writing out of HIV drugs that are controversial
Patients will have access to 'transformative' HIV treatment since September, following a battle held in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England announced that public health is now estimated to make 10 000 people available in the initial three-year clinical trial to pre-exposure prophylaxtis (PrEP) - a tablet that is administered before the recess and which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection in people at high risk by around 86%.
The NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the appeal court backed a ruling last year by the Supreme Court that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, in spite of its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, Executive Director of NHS England, welcomed this launch unveiled on Thursday as' new, far-reaching intervention ', whereas the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as a' pivotal moment '.
Sexual health clinics in London, Bright ton, Manchester, Liverpoolis and Sheffield are among the first to register people; in October, further clinics will follow before the programme is introduced everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-carect prophylaxtis (PrEP) is a cup on HIV medicines that will be taken up before the recess in order to reduce the risk of infection in HIV.
Clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking the PrEP before the recess means that there are sufficient medicines in the body that prevent HIV infections.
These medicines can be taken every day or two hours before the recess.
Among the suitable candidates for treatment are LGBT men, transgender people and people with HIV-infected partners.
These students will find suitable people willing to participate in clinical trials, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-related partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and having chosen a family doctor will also be able to register their wish to participate in a local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed an agreement to get medicines in the hands of international procurement this week.
The clinical trial aims to assess the true potential of the PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended for, and how it is consumed and applied in great cloud.
Stevens said, 'This new wide-ranging intervention should complement and intensify the wide-ranging and increasingly successful fight against HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of humanity's greatest health problems. "
Deborah gold, Chief Executive officer of NAT, said, 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is properly targeted at those who need it and are in a risk-prone phase, offers an opportunity to change Britain's HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risks in England, through this clinical trial funded by the NHS, have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with the partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: 'Now it is essential to ensure that the clinical attempt is quickly rolled out across the country and that no one belonging to HIV risk group is left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been obtained, we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of infection with HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, Minister for Public Health, said: 'The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and misauthorisation of the feet of the government.
Evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to the prevention of HIV and to an end to the spread of infection changing its life.
This clinical test takes us one step closer to full understanding of the advantages of the PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical test is deployed as soon as possible in order to protect people who have exposure to HIV and take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "
However, electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, while Latvia and Lithuania fell.
The difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to 1.94 euro next day, compared to â¬7.71 in June this year, announced the round.
The main reason for the difference in prices is the rich links between Lithuania and Sweden.
In Estonia, the average wholesale electricity price was set at â¬34.33 per megawatt last month and the price increased by 12% compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five percent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price of the electricity exchanges in the Nord half was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose by 12 and 7% respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75% of the hours of last month towards Estonia and 16% of hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining 9% of the hours between the two countries did not take place next day.
Electricity was moving between Estonia and Latvia at 99% of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73% of the hours used all transmission capacity.
In the last trading day of July, according to the Nasdaq OMX market transactions, the electricity exchange price could be around 34 euros per megawatt in August and 37 in September.
The carbon price affecting electricity production increased last month and transactions took place at 5.04-5.47 euros per tonne.
High-speed living - half-order and smart designers have made it the little Earls Court room house.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with passion for building, switched his big Knightsbridge home in 2014 against the Earls Court flat.
This is on the first floor of Queen Anne Tertsen, and the fact that Joanne has not pulled her bags together and sold the flame on is an tribute to a new design.
"Before that, my former fellow Member and I lived on much larger soil in Knightsbridge," said Joanne.
"I asked for something that would be tantamount to the price I have offered.
I was shown that by the Earls Court flat and had the same high sentences.
I sat in it and made an offer the same day. "
Since its first visit, this fifteen-metre corps has passed through a complete innovation unit.
At the beginning, it was one of the Corps with sleeping and complex positioning - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to sleep, and Joanne wanted to add savings and half order to take advantage of the high levels of ambition.
"I wanted a lot of light, a lot of hot air.
These were my demands, 'he said.
He asked for the architecture and design radios of Erfan Azorian Notting in Hillis to take advantage of 3.8 m of the desert and to create a home that is not just a development site but a place in which Joanne can live.
It was not high enough to add two space to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a quasi-order where one could stand.
Mr FÃ¼le had to take a creative approach.
'Metalldesign is quite complex, 'he explains.
"We had to reform our premises so that they were located on each other without needing to bow down.
It was not just a matter of building a platform, but of using steel construction to ensure that the height of the upper and lower spaces is right. "
This move has enabled Erfana to create two rooms with full ears, with a lot of dramatic elements.
Half-time lighting from the Retrouvius window provides an answer to gladity housing under the carpet.
A golden piece of furniture, silver details and retrochinaugural Serge Mouille 'light underscore space.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the inclusion of theatre, space and lighting.
There are mirrors attached at the end of both short corridors, so that it would seem longer.
In Kmidl, the mirror's back-in-the-eye window gives the impression of another tumble window.
The scenes provide a mirror hop for all Joanne's bath clothes and glass requirements.
In addition to housing, the possibility of shutting down part of vegetables if it is not used, creates a more glamorous space of images.
The cumbersome kitchen is nothing new.
In this kitchen, however, it is unique that it is a resurgent door of garage.
'That a little bit of a design effort 'clarifies the MDF, a spoiled by Erfan steel.
'It has a counterweight, which is why it is so simple to roll it out '.
Thanks to the smart use of space and hoarding, Joanne now has 16 supplementary metres, an extra bedroom and a better corridor plan.
'After all, flooring surfaces are what you sell - or what gives property value, 'says Erfan.
'According to the reserve floor, he takes an outdated form of tumble and makes calculations based on the area of underground land '.
Here they have managed to expand the floor, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the premises.
"Materials are what you are touching on and thus help create an emotional link with your home," says Erfan.
'You do not love electricity cable in the pig.
It is important, but it does not inspire heart to speak. "
This shows that good design and increased surface area help do something amazing from a rather standard coral.
In fact, they may even lead to a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
The chief figure, Jensen, is the Chief Arab village in Chicago's cloud, which is competing with a colleague for professional excellence.
You do not read anything other than a worthwhile amount of money, aside from which any ethics forgets.
A woman and three children can only see the man in the early morning and late night.
On the first side of the film, I think it is a version of the business world of the Kaardihouse - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler.
However, the less adjacent element remains, and the moral intention of film-makers is beginning to appear more and more.
Life-changing experience will lead to a boy-infected illness.
Now there must be a choice between professional and family life.
The poet who writes in the offices of architecture forces father to think about the great buildings of Chicago, which are of real importance, such as religion, well-being, love..., without even affecting the catastrophe of the twofold.
After the third semester, where the poet opens the eyes of the father, there is a feeling that film-makers are certainly guided by the aim of curbing the audience, because even the most heart-hearted spectator is unable to keep tears back in the eye of the suffering of a brutal cancer-sick boy.
If the poet falls into the house and his situation seems hopeless, the father will once and for all understand the morality of his work and will do a good job for the old man seeking a good job.
Now, in my mind, I am lucky enough - if there is a label, I reward my delight after a film's coffee, if I am wrong, then the stinct can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that there will be no shortage of coffee - when a husband calls a hospital and a man walks down a corridor in slow motion.
However, it has been extremely healthy, and although her father has just lost her job, it will prove positive, because now it is time to deal with the family.
I can also feel comfortable - I can already predict quite well the end of the American drama.
In truth, the film has been well designed; all the necessary elements exist.
You can get a knife, you can laugh, actors are a good and moral beauty: Money is not the most important thing in life.
It is a film that gets off the ground.
The new staff top of the Trum plans to limit the President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps Mr F. Kelly can do it in real terms.
In that case, it would be the first.
Politico writes that the new staff surplus in the White House intends to limit the flow of information reaching President Trumpin, including news, in the hope that it will keep the balance in the water.
Here there is a plague reporter Joseph h Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new chief staff of the White House, met high officials on his first day of work, he highlighted the key problem President Donald Trumpi in White Mas, which he plans to solve in his hands the receipt of the PEACE bad information into the hands of the President.
Mr Kelly told the officials that the information has to go through him, either on paper or in meetings, because the President would make better decisions if he had good information. "
Mr Kelly's diagnosis seems to be completely logical, but others have also tried to do so and they have failed to tame him by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trumpi's relationship with television goes back decades and, even now he is in the White House, his TV viewing habits have gone nowhere.
'When the candidate Trump was a vice because of unfair media coverage, he was told that his publications were also fair, 'said Sam Nunberg to Policy in February.
Politico tara Palmer wrote at the time that 'Trumpi Twitter, according to the six former campaigners, is the key to running habits of the Trumpi Twitter, to ensure that his personal media consumption also contains a flat chorus of praise'.
Well done.
However, the idea that Trumpi Twitter's use habits have once been 'under control' is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know that the sanders of Trumpi would have been even more surreal without their interference.
We will probably never be able to find out about the remaining charges that the Trump did not issue.
If he managed to rescue his helpless even a few times over, his efforts were worth it.
But nobody has managed to prevent Trumpi from systematically creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of competing climates, people are trying exclusively to promote their own interests by passing on to the Olympic Games material that supports their views on the world stage, but which is not always reliable.
Politico, reflecting the evolution of the whole story, wrote strategically questionable information to the President about the tenacity of the advisors in May.
One example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"The present and former Trumpi are saying that Trump can react to a negative press, particularly with damaging effects, exploding, by cutting off their source.
This also happened at the end of February, when someone happily gave the President a copy of the internet provocative, Charles C. GotNews.com, a website belonging to Johnson, accused the deputies of Katie Walsh of being the white house 'source of several leaks'.
It does not matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of mocking, or that he has provided no concrete evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and recalled them.
The College read the article and started to ask about Wales, which is the subject. "
Goldmacher added that the staff chief at that time, Rhine Priebus, and Rob Porter, head of the White House, have tried to establish a system for the management and documentation of the documents reaching Trumpin. "
How did it succeed?
Mr Kelly is attempting to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader of Priebuss, but the Trump is still an impulse and his assistants are still in competition for influence.
These unchanging factors make Mr Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad will not be able to obtain permission to speak.
In the centre of Tallinn, many foreigners are taking refuge.
Those with whom the leaflet came to the talk acknowledged that they were playing in the old age without the consent of the urban government.
The first is that we found three street musicians who had taken the same amount with them at the gates of Viru.
It was clear to see that musicians with rainfall and smell clothes were the home travellers who would have to spend one of the duchÅ¡ marches.
Despite the adversity, the only woman in the company played a story of acordional rhythm, while one man, alongside him, played three strings in Kong and brought the furthest closer.
The third man was sitting next to them in a house in absentia and smoked a self-prepared, self-employed agricultural enterprise.
Their three chambers did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people that passed.
The Acordion-playing Noemi and Paltel-jet Boeing spoke about kissing the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the inquiry was to collect ticket money for a vessel travelling to Finland on the same day.
On the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for domination in the old age, Noemi and Boeing shake their head.
Firstly, we did not know.
Secondly, we will never stand for more than a day or a few in one town and, in most cases, permits will be granted for a month or something like that.
It makes no sense to pay for it, 'Mr Bob explained.
When, some 20 minutes later, we returned to the gates of Viru, we saw that two women are with musicians and make them go.
The task force complained to the crossroads of the Viru centre with its bags and bags.
There were also three Polish young men present on the Viru street, one of whom played on the sign, the other was charity, and the third had even carried an electronic glass.
"We are here to entertain people to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living," explained the trio from Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that there has to be an urban government licence to speak.
'Of course we do not have it ', he said jokes.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go elsewhere, but you have to try, 'he added.
In July, the Bank of Estonia bought bonds worth EUR 149 million under the public asset programme of central banks in the euro area, and the Central Bank bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank will not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, has explained in the past that the depository scheme of the euro system includes three different purchasing programmes: Financial sector bonds (CMO), asset bonds (ABS) and public bonds (PSPP).
The Central Bank will buy up bonds on the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
The impact of purchases will fall in the production of lower-risk assets, and this will motivate investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, within the framework of the public debt programme, each Central Bank buys its own government bonds, and the bonds of other countries are not purchased.
As no bonds have been issued by the Estonian state, the Estonian bank will make so-called substitution purchases within the limits set aside.
The central banks also shop in those countries where the provision of shares eligible for the purchase scheme is limited.
On the basis of the statement of Mr Hansson, the Bank of Estonia is generally buying bonds from the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds.
The Bank of Estonia will buy bonds as part of the asset buying programme as of March 2015.
In the meantime, the government of Estonia's debt was also bought, but the Estonian bank will no longer buy up bonds in June 2016.
On behalf of the central banks in the euro area, both Elering and Estonian energy bonds will be bought by the Bank of Finland.
Migrants ignore the ditch and return to a 'million business base'.
Some of the most prosperous home owners in the West Midlands have once again found themselves in a fierce confrontation with determined travellers who have ignored the crack of the county to win back their fields away from the cotton.
Migrants have parked their 20 trailers into a prosperous circle of 'millions of businesses' near the street of Solyulli.
They have returned, together with the armies of horses, children and lorries, after they were only shot out of it in May, without being confused by the ditch exiled to prevent their invasion by the Council.
The active group found itself weak in the limits of protection, turning its vehicles away from the unblocked part that was left to walking.
The people of Maruangry have moved to the Soaligulli Council saying that it is' useless to deal with the problem '.
An anonymous person said: 'They moved there on Monday evening after being excluded from Bentley Heathon, where they were stoned.
The Council must be ashamed to take action, because it is useless to deal with the problem.
The migrants were there in May, they were driven to go, and now they are back again.
They came up last night, probably even more so today. "
He added, 'Birmingham County Council knows how to deal with such things by acquiring long barriers to the protection of its parks.
I live on street etsbrook, and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay a total mandate if the Council cannot even hinder such a thing. "
A local person who also wanted to remain anonymous said, 'that is ridiculous; we have just seen the latter leave these travellers, and a new offensive is already under way.
This time, the number has increased, and even the horse has been seen in ruins. '
A representative of the Soksulli Council said, 'we are aware that on the land off the street street street street sbrook, it is unacceptable to have a camp plate, and we are working with the Soksulli police; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
The gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police, calling the number 101.
This will help to create an understanding of the situation for the Court when we present the case to them. "
The Weekend festival will be attended by, among others, the Minister for Culture, Indrek Saar, who is pleased that real world top names have been brought to Estonia.
The question of why it is so important for the Weekend festival Estonians is that it should be asked by all those who are enjoying the festival three days in full.
What he says is that there are real players in the area of enlargement.
'When you look at the level of artists that has been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this musical gesture are taken home - this is often not the case in our jargon ', the Minister for Culture talks.
Which artists on the Festival, however, are the most widely spoken of?
I consider myself to be relatively old, and for the old people of some kind, there is certainly one of the most experienced armies, Armin van Babinet, who stood up yesterday evening.
After all, at some point in time, all of us have complicated our own feet ', he says.
However, he is still highlighting a number of names, such as ChainCOM, Deadmau5, Knifemite.
Of course, our own Estonian players: Starting with NOSET P and they can be read in a whole series.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high, "he says.

Innovation of authors in mid-criticism of car manufacturers to 850 000 diesel vehicles
A day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the Chairman of BMW, the company believes' that there are smarter options than driving restrictions', referring to European cities, including the city of BMW, Munich, which has considered banning or throttling diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will renew their emissions from diesel engines.
No company described these operations as being recalled.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the US to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
At the same time, equipment to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles will increase, making it difficult to keep cars competitive.
While the German car manufacturers are under scrutiny, the Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is also accused of lecturing the powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs referring to the problem.
Companies are attempting to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, who remained silent about the use of so-called 'hidden devices' that made it possible to adapt the face of exhaust gases to the regulations when testing a car, but were brought back in normal driving conditions.
Several Presidents of Volkswagen have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, a former head of the Title of the Visa dynamism Division of the Audi engine Development Department was arrested.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and can go to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, the Audi was drawn into criminal investigations involving Volkswagen in Germany, when the authorities accused the auditing system of installing it in order to circumvent European requirements for gas emissions, thus widening the investigation, which was previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of the author in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen, a manufacturer of securitisation cars, generating a disproportionate proportion of the profits of Volkswagen.
European Union flags will be bought at Estonian schools for EUR 20 000.
By 1 September, the Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags for the Estonian schools to mark the Presidency.
In total, the measurements will be made by 105x158 centimetres of the European Union flag by 570 educational institutions.
Lips are intended to demonstrate in indoor spaces; they must also be carried out in high quality printing techniques with an eye assurance in indoor spaces; the ERR news portal will be moderated.
On the flag label, the text reads: 'Approval of Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union of Estonia'.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the expense of the Ministry of Education, or one flag costs EUR 35.
Journalist murder highlights the growing threat situation in Mexico
Weekly Riodoce workers usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Blue oa, sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars.
But today, under the guise of a personal tragedy, they have gathered to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change our routine.
Two elderly writers will discuss which seems safer: Either to bring children into a office that was the target of a grandiose attack in 2009 or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words to the willing at the head: 'Enemies', 'neutrality', 'allies'.
They ask reporters to provide no stone names, only to have impressions and an internal feeling.
The presence of a government or cartels is suspected of being a list of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who make it dangerous to cover the chaos prevailing in Mexico.
There is no breath of violence, and the more deaths are assembled across the country, the greater of which journalists form part of the Round for the protection of journalists, according to President Enrique Pena Mento's inauguration in December 2012, have been killed by at least 25: 589 journalists since attacks and threats under state protection, and this year, at least seven journalists have been killed.
The latter include their editor and source of inspiration, Javier Valdez Carden, co-founder of Riodoce.
'The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist, 'wrote Valdez in one of its many drug-based books.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence may be felt everywhere on the BilRiodoce building faÃ§ade, a big picture of the average finger-pointing in Valdez, with the letter 'Justice', and two of the 30 reports, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which have been depicted by their slippery glasses, or by a panacopian barrel characteristic of him.
Less than two months after his death, the Portuguese people are discussing common trauma, their nightmare, their hopelessness, their paranoia.
Although a public Prosecutor's office was set up to deal with journalists cases in 2010, only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee on the Protection of journalists.
As in the case of most annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime involving thousands, the number of killers of journalists is rarely brought to justice.
The presence of Riodoce continues to reflect the violence in Sinalo, even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and justice of murderers, the meeting on security, Ibarra, said, is of little use.
'It is very ridiculous to waste our time here at this meeting, 'he says.
"As long as the cause is not known, you will distrust everyone."
Valdez lags from the office of Riodoce in Culiacan, capital of Vallidez, on 15 May.
He managed to travel just a few quarters before having stopped the Red Toyota Corolla, who was forced to leave the car and shot 12 times, supposedly because of the name of the newspaper, which means an interpretative 'twelve river'.
An armed man travelled to the car in Valdez and thus made an accident in its vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two adults.
The rumours spread freely in Culiacan.
However, on the subject of Valdez, there is essentially silence.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of the United States in January, Yaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, because rival clicks are fighting to fill a power vacuum.
It does not matter that a person, or indeed several, is being abandoned every day in the streets of your permits, or that the dead are sliding away from the sorely dreams of double-hatted drug portals, which are larger than many homes.
Let us remember for a moment that the time of peace indicates how precious ports and the maritime state along the lines of drug routes to the United States are headed by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers associated with its work, Riodoce's co-founder and president, Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels that he was unable to defend his friend.
He believes that this murder was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with the Guzman sons of Guzman, who are competing and on war-torn cartel, with Damaso Lopez.
This piece of correspondence could even be alluded to by the gang members suspected of having bought all copies of publications as soon as they were reached in the newspapers.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after having had a crackdown in one of the newspapers that reported the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as a veterant reporter at the Norosian newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50 dollars.
Bojorquez said that Yaloas' it was impossible to deal with the press without touching on the drug problem '.
The newspaper took a long time to be known with its courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising grew.
The Portuguese people liked to express vigorous studies without fear of censorship and readers in a fascinating print, which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was set up, Maria Moors Cabot won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Awards for her Latin American coverage.
In the same year, Valdez's Committee on the Protection of journalists (AKK) won the International Press Freedom of the Press Award for its courage to follow Mexican drug creation wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
'I want to live on, 'he said when he received the AKK Prize.
Last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in your own region.
'We face up to the challenge that the journalist's office brings with it a second chance to play the game.
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths, or why I did not speak about what is going on. '
Riodoce College long for Whodesiraz, a man of joke like madness, a friend who generously shared embryos and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always rolled his barrel.
He went from the office to El Madagascar yabo bar and was always sitting on the same table.
Now they are asking whether his routine love became fatal to her.
His death has also led them to doubt how best to do their job and to stay alive.
"They do not like the rigidity of women, their children, their legitimate businesses, with these secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
'These things should not have been touched, 'said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is strong self-censorship and self-esteem.
Entrusting your instincts.
If it is suspicious, the hotel is thrown away.
According to the editor of Riodoce, Andres Villarrez, the problem is that 'a fragrance can be deceived... and that is how it happened to Jternity'.
He and others say that you no longer have old rules in place, just as they do not apply to the toxic composition of the Tamaulipasis, Veracruz, Guerreiro or other states that are home to the toxic composition of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Suddenly, in the space where Riodoce workers met for security training, mobile phones were no longer permitted; a few days before, it was revealed that the spyware sold only to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers escaped from 40 Â° 6 under the guise of the tree.
The government appointed a more elected office in Riodoce in the four-order building of the Culiacan middle-class neighbourhood.
Some reporters wondered half-joking whether these police officers belong to the 50% of police officers who have been driven by the Governor himself.
Several months have passed since reporters have been travelling to mountainous rural areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
Riodoce's edition this week covered three main beauties.
One of them was the murder of the former poxilegist Julio Movement ar Chavez brother in Yaloas.
Furthermore, they had an revealing story of the spending of government funds on the town of the Governor's home town.
And a group of people were robbed of one of the most expensive restaurants from Culiacan, which is located from a cabinet quarter.
There was no formal announcement of who was kidnapped or how this happened, so caution had to be taken when it was time to write what everyone in the town of Flandrestaurant knows is the favourite place of both drug traffickers and public authorities.
The Portuguese became aware of public documents that a restaurant is registered with the names of a politician who belongs to the prevailing Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption within the framework of widely reported cases.
Villarline asked reporter to write past incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzmani man, who holds the name El Chapo, escaped from the military line.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have been looking to the doorstep in Valdez to find out about the kidnappings from the best sources.
'In the past, we would have known what happened 'said in Villarreal 46 years old, whose body building of broker bodies earned him a shouting name El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels have broken down with our sources."
The office of Valdez has become a beacon for bridges and stickers protesting against the murder of journalists, and the editorial staff have become something they could never have expected of activists in the name of the press.
The Reporter Miriam Ramirez seized a few eyes and moved to the office of local prosecutors next morning to the demonstration for another journalist.
Mr Salvador Amidst the chaos in the Western state of Michoacan, three days after the killing of Valdez.
A body has been found to be burnt down and, according to officials, it is based on DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal all over the country and are highlighting the 'SOS press' phrase as an organised protest against walking routes and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez is in Washington, trying to raise international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
The day after the death of Valdez in meetings with Yaloa Disrupner, Ramirez accused journalists of shouting and killing them of telling the truth.
After that, he asked for him to be diverted from reflecting the government's actions, while worried that he had been affected by his objectivity.
Valdez had said many times that Mexican journalists were 'restricted' to organised crime, complicit state officials and an indifferent society.
In his latest book 'The drug press', he wrote that the reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but are also carried out under the command of politicians and security forces who are in contact with organised crime.
Articulo 19, the media monitoring group, awarded more than half of the attacks on the police and state officials last year.
'In Mexico, you DA, because you want to keep quiet, 'said Ramirez.
The effects are obviously bloody.
Nobody forgets the death of bloggers Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipasis six years ago.
His body was found with a letter that was probably signed by the cartel in LOS Zetas: 'I am here for my reports'.
Alongside her chartered head, she leaked computer bogus and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in Chihuahuahua, in the northern border state of Chihuahuahua, after the killing of the flat correspondent Gay BPI in March.
Others will carry on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their President in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly to the drug cartel with the headline 'What do you want of us?'
Some journalists have fled from the home state or even the country.
This is a nervous decision.
It is difficult to find a job on the wrong track and they still have to stay on the streets to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are being driven down, as probably happened with the part of the photograph Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in Mexico in 2015 three months after Veracruz had fled.
Those who remain on the ground and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that reporting drugs business is frightening her.
"Mexico is on its way to hell and that is why I become reporter," he said.
During a recent midnight of Friday, when the most recent number had already been lumped down, Riodoce editors sat down in front of the office and kiss when all the phones suddenly began to be calibrated.
In Mazatlani, the governor in Mazatlani, 19 people were killed in fire-fighting between rival gangs and security forces.
War continued estuary, as promised by a number of messages left on cartels found in the region.
On the back of the same line, reporters posted a Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
There was a need for change next day.
The upgraded Hutus underwent a new round-off in the region.
Bojorquez piilw to the police on the streets to see if they are vigilant.
If they were afraid, they at least did not show it.
The descending founder under the mass sports ree, which has seen his average finger on the whole blue, has been delivered by Riodoce workers in his footsteps.
'How can one think of closure at all, 'said Bojorquez,' whereas on the same day that Javier killed, a trainee asked me to send him a report to the streets? '
Dinosaur used protective colours to prevent enemies
At first sight, it sounds like a form, albeit rather frightening.
Scientists have now unveiled the first findings of an incredible rhythm estimate discovered by a Canadian mine, which has been so well maintained that experts have described it as' dinosaur Mona Lisat '.
It has been so well maintained that it was even possible to establish that a skin covered by his soomings was a red bow of Brown's colours and his past had been somewhat 'complicated'.
The current Biology report in the magazine described the status as' the most preserved soomaldindinance that has ever been found 'and as one of the best dinosaences worldwide'.
In the case of fossil, it is a new type of nodosaic surgery living in the middle of the cricket age, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good storage in Rudas researchers describing it as' really significant '.
This vegetarian catering covered by Finns has been the best preserved in this type of phosphorus that has ever been found according to National Geodecades.
This was found on 21 March 2011 in Shawn's funk, when he extracted from the Suncor Millenium mine Fort McMurray in Northern Albertas, Canada.
He struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into it.
The newly discovered phosphorus sent the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology museum.
For the next six years, it was designed to extricate the animal from 2 500 pounds (1 100-km).
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to bring the public to the public.
'It is almost credible to see him sleep, 'Caleb Brown, the leading author, a researcher in the Royal Tyrrell museum, said he was sleeping.
"This goes down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaences - dinosaur Mona Lisana."
She went on to find that this vegetation, although covered by soya properties and reminiscent of walking tank, was likely to be seriously threatened by meat-fed dinosaurs.
This dinosaur of sober properties used red and white colours to hide from predators and applied shaking techniques called 'counter-insurgency', which are also used by many of today's animals.
This enabled the dinosaur to get better off the ground and to prevent enemies, according to experts, as major dinosaurs probably kept a hunt.
This presence of the 110 million-year-old family of nodosaic surfaces was first in the news in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell's paleontology museum.
Researchers have now looked at the present and given it the name 'Borealopelta Marmitchelli museum laboratory', mark Mitchell, who was part of a team that spent more than 7 000 hours revealing the animal's hardship.
Thanks to the amazing good maintenance of the father, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to document the shape and size of the Finns in the body.
They discovered a contradiction - a method of protection in animal welfare, which means that it was darker than it was at the bottom of its existence.
Although the counter-hostility is rife, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than today's repackaged animals.
It implies that dinosaur disease was hunted with sufficient force by other dinosaur pressure that evolution preferred to cover up instead of being a lifeblood tactic.
However, most of the animals using modern counter-refuelling - such as scams, pigs or logs - are much smaller and more vulnerable as yields, indicating that nodosasurl had to make a real effort to survive.
"A vigorous hunt of the dinosaur covered by vast and abundant soya beds shows how dangerous it could have been to ride off the dinosaur," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds of Soomus also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was a red boxes.
Researchers will continue to investigate to get indications of this life, including the storing content of this salt podium, in order to find out what the animal is for its last age.
They believe that dinosaur has failed in the dead rivers, thus entering the sea, where it washed over the ocean bed.
At that time, Albertas was as warm as it is now in Southern Florence, and rivers and oceans probably went much further into the internal land than they are today.
"This nodosamic is truly remarkable because it is fully covered by a soomic skin, but it has remained three-dimensional while maintaining the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"As a result, the animal today sees almost the same as in the cricket age.
It does not need to be very imaginative to construct it - it is enough simply to throw our eyes on our eyes and it looks as if he sleep. "
The crisis era was a time when enormous two legs of meat-bearing dinosaurs - heteroshops - flooded.
Although King Tyrannosaurus rex of all of them lived millions years later than Borealopelta, this deluged dinosaur could be hunted by some of his frightening predecessors.
These include Acrocanthoxurus, 38 legs (11.5 metres) long and six tonne-weighting monsters.
Scientists whose recent findings are published in the Journal current Biology believe that Borealopelta uhut was sunk after death in the sea and that it was muzzled.
On 21 March 2011, the title was discovered by Shawn Funk when he extracted from the Millenium mine Fort McMurray in Northern Albertas, Canada.
By the way, the Museum says that it is best maintained in the world, including skin and soya, and it is a complete concentration right up to the wood.
These entities were on average 18 legs (5 metres) long and resumed at up to GBP 3 000 (1300 kg).
It was shouldered by two 20 customs-long ora.
Scientists believe that this soya-covered mixture of flora through current Western Canada until it is disconnected into the sea.
But the submarine buried place of the dinosaur helped to maintain its Finns in an excellent detail.
The remnants of this particular father have maintained so well that mysterious soomic headlines of dinosaur continue to cover skin ice.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geochet magazine: 'Such a level of survival is as rare as a lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Disburnt leather residues continue to cover mysterious soya plates located on animal tricks.
The better front page is sitting next to him, and five of the thieves have been rushed up.
I will be able to count the Finns at his farm. "
How did one activist find an answer to the question 'Who streets?'
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was completely shocked.
Just a day after New York's travel, that was the father of St. Loukas, Airb, who was rented on a dozen bed, sibbed on Facebook.
He ended up in the post of his former fellow school member.
It reads: 'The police killed just 18-year-old youngsters and he is still lying on the street'.
He was confused why nobody else had posted this information to his bed, which is why he closed down Facebook and opened Twitter.
The postal services of the Pidega @ TheeP45 users were repeatedly handed down in her line.
Mr St. silicz from the Loukas region sent in real time to Michael Brown, the death of an unarmed 18-year-old black man murdered by a white police officer in Fergusoni Missouris.
He gave an idea of the existence of Brown's life in the streets, remaining four hours.
'It is crazy, 'thought about Ferreira's additions.
But death was not new for him or for his community.
He put his phone off, but later seen the spark again this evening, reporting people's rally to Canfield Drive.
There were photographs of police and shellfish, and a man who claimed to be a father of Brown and kept a label 'my unarmed son was killed by the Fergusoni police!'
He watched a real-time stream where the police officer stood before a group of protesters with a grave dock.
In the second video, another police officer, he said: 'I kill all... animals'.
A Ferrelli will remember how he struck himself from the point of view: 'That is unusual'.
'This is not the kind of murder to which we are accustomed and which we could call typical '.
I felt frightened at this point.
I was angry and I cried. '
He booked a return flight and travelled home the following day.
Having buried at 23: 00, she went on to her six-year-old daughter and decided to travel to the two-day Ferguson next morning.
What happened next three years with Ferrelli and Fergusoni is central to the new 'Whose street?' ('Who streets?'), which will be presented in cinemas on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and defeat, strength and firmness from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who are on the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell, together with a daughter - who had a flowing broker and had a fine with it - was driving towards Fergusoni, they once again spoke about a subject that they had discussed many times before this morning - about black experiences and living conditions.
'Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights? 'Recalls its question.
'We are currently travelling to Fergusoni because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that is not right '.
'I could not take him on board, 'said Ferrell later.
'What is happening now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
It needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
It must learn about the activist and organisation, but it must also feel different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we must do to free ourselves and to free ourselves.
Even if I can bring him up in such a way that he does not personally experience cruelty racism, he is no different from any other Muslim girl.
I feel I would do him a disservice if I would protect him from this world. "
The first stop they did in the Fergusoni hands was on the South Florissant - from the police station to the ground, which had become a sort of camp where activists were waiting for news about the police officer, Darren Wilson, who was not at long last charged.
There, Mrs Ferrell and her daughter combined forces with local business owners who produced southern products.
They put together food bags and helped to distribute them to the protesters.
A new type of activist began to slow down for a Ferrelli.
'My activist changed utterly after 9 August, 'he said, saying that, when he was a student at Missouri-St. Louisi University, he was President of the Association of pupils of Small Sciences and focused on inequalities in food justice and health in black communities.
"I had no experience of organising.
All this was simply lazy. '
Weeks later, a film co-director, Sabaah Folayani, met during a statement of protest by Ferrell evening.
Folayan said that he and the film operator, Mr Alvarado-Farrar, simply wanted to document what is going on.
The question came up as a Ferrelli: 'Do you try to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited?'
Such scepticism was due to countless cases in which people - often white - come into the community and try to profit from its rigidity and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: 'We had heard that the voice of people born and growing in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do that differently'.
Folayan had already beaten his hands with Damon Davs, a fellow director in the region who was well-known activists for prisoners sentenced to death.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrelli and for the other six local films, the 'Whose street Process?' Team, following the shooting of Brown, followed for years.
'In this documentary, nobody talks for us or with us, but we speak for ourselves, 'said Davis.
"It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that is how I am portrayed."
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrelli - it was to show that the movement is not about 'the head of salvation', but about bringing the community together ', as Folayan said, he became the most open party to the film.
As a result, 'Whose street ets?' Surprisingly personal aspects of the life of Ferrelli, such as love and marriage with her wife, are documented.
'I felt as if I had naked, 'said Ferrell, laughing over the first time that he had seen his ready urban act.
"But I realised that there is a need for a certain level of vulnerability when it comes to doing this job and to humanising black people."
Moreover, the Ferrelli story underlines and refocuses the role of the black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators who, following the killing of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager in the social media in 2012, invented the hashtags # BlackLivesMatter, are gay.
'In its leading role, black homosexual women have generally kept the movement in place, 'said Ferrell', precisely because we have to fight repeatedly on several fronts.
Roma homosexual women must bear the full burden. "
Folayan agreed, pointing out that "mobility really is kept alive by black women and many of them black women."
He says, however, that 'This is not about any type of equal opportunities' - Ferrelli was not chosen as the focal point of the film because of his identity.
'You were someone who gave the right energy, 'she said.
"But it is no coincidence that he was there right at the front line, because a black homosexual woman living in such hubs is much at stake.
His energy can be perceived through the screen. "
At the same time, the news cameras Fergusona have long disappeared, but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile.
The suspended sentence imposed on a Ferrell for blocking the road will last for another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in a region he calls home, simply a 'huge freedom threat'.
However, she still attaches importance to the mantra she has eaten since she went to the Ferguson street as a whole three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "
7 g on how to overcome the mystery after Weekentries
Some of the stubborn fishermen will find that, after a scarce pipe, they will find out what they are suffering from, hence help.
Or it is on the basis of the saying 'Let's avoid a poker, a pyramid'.
But this is only an unavoidable postponement and a proper health thread.
What can you do to make yourself felt better this morning after the Weekess trall or other pipes of tomorrow and tomorrow, and get to grief as painlessly as possible?
Joo Water.
Alcoffwas came down and then, after a great deal of luck in the morning... or even possibly alcohol.
As the body loses a lot of liquids when using alcohol, it has to be recovered in some way.
Along with water, minerals and mixture are also flourished out of the body, and it is good for Jewish mineral waters.
Since the buck has often become irritated since it was snuckled, it is particularly good for it to have a bubble-free or just light-touch situation.
Let us walk.
Surely it would not pay to go back to the grandmother - it could turn out to be a fatal falsehood.
But light walking helps the body to recall once again what it feels like to be alive.
Sleeping in Telsat and sleeping in a potasy is a more time-consuming way to obtain a healthier piece of legislation.
Give the body energy back gradually and cautiously.
If you are already entering a vehicle from yesterday's overflight, it is certainly not worthwhile trying to charge a heavy fat barrel.
For example, a fresh volume containing the presence of fruit residues is regularly placed on the market as a body.
If health is already suffering around lunch, for example, one could try to wedle.
And a little later on, it turned out.
There was no coffee.
This diutraum will free up your body from its last error.
As has already been said, water and volume have your friends.
Contribute to painkillers.
If you get a painkiller this evening to prevent polobster, your tax will not only have to deal with alcohol but also with paratsephanuts or ibuprophets and will lose sight.
So they are paying even more, and in the future the boys will be worse off.
Moreover, painkillers are not going to stay long anyway in the Senate.
If you take a painkiller this morning, then you will do it with a blank thin - it will upset your already battered sweat.
Or, if a partner is not taken, then it can get through itself well.
It is something like walking, but walking is not going to be a fiasm.
However, too active a pace and outrageous a hangover were avoided - a physical effort should be moderate during the boomerang season.
Joke.
The words of friends-friends of the times, the easy fun and the nail about himself and others (suffering).
The Lady and the woman may not be driven off by the boy, but they certainly make it easier to tolerate.
For once, the pohmell is going through anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University workers are being sought as suspects in murder
According to the police, Professor and university at Northwestern University are being searched nationwide, who have become suspicious of having found the bodies of men with deadly pacions to be found in a Chicago luxury coral.
According to the Cook county's trials, on Monday, two 42-year-old Wyndham Lathemi and 56-year-old Andrew Warreni were arrested on account of their alleged involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleu's death.
According to the documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleu died after repeated betrayal.
According to the warning issued to the community by Chicago's police station, the body was discovered on 27 July.
Police officers got a telephone war and found themselves on the arrival of a victim in the Grand Plaza Corterary, whose body had several torturers.
According to the officials, the scene of Cornell-Duranleu was recognised as dead and the investigators thought about married murder, while the police actively seek two suspects.
Ms Lamos has been working as co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In a statement sent as e-mail, Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for Public Relations at university, said that Ms Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and has been prohibited from entering the cities of the University of Northwestern.
"This is now a criminal act being investigated by the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern is working with researchers," said Cubbage.
Warren is senior assistant in Oxford University finances.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: 'We have been in touch with the British police and are ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way we can'.
Moreover, the statement stated that the Warreni colleagues were shocked and willing to extradite themselves.
Anthony Guglielm, head of the Police Department in Chicago, urges the authorities, on suspicion, to give itself to the authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are increasingly busy in defining the exact location," said Guglielm.
According to Guglielm, suspects can be sought by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielm said that the police had received a telephone call from the grey camp of the Grand Plaza Corterhouse, who had just received a chrypine hint that something had happened in the corps No 1008.
According to the police statement, this was a good sight.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July either.
He said that the security cameras confirmed the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building.
"We believe that Professor Lathaw and victim had a relationship," added Guglielm.
The Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to the public: 'The police are currently working to find out the background to events and the victim and are exploring various motives, including the possibility of a family dispute'.
Retail companies that help your company avoid becoming the next Up
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e-commerce start-ups, but the polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even if she promised to ensure anonymity, some workers did not trust this process.
'The system was simply not consistent and objective 'said Errett, who is running the CE company Madison Reed, a company operating in San Francisco, with 75 employees.
So he called on external actors to help.
Start-ups dealing with new types of human resources are emerging, helping businesses to find out what their workers know.
By developing and licensing software that aims to measure worker involvement, they allow companies to carry out spot surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases allow them to bypass C level managers and turn directly to the Bureau.
'There are now tools such as Strava and Fitres designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your business? 'Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO, Redwood City start-up, Glint, whose software tools are used by companies to measure worker inclusion.
According to Errett, in the three years that she has used Glinti, she has received a much better overview of what she thinks and knows its workers.
In addition to the conduct studies and surveys directed at specific teams, it provides a company heat card, which gives an overview of which departments have most complaints and which leaders have the lowest support, enabling them to identify the causes.
Companies have begun to realise that they must stay up to date with their culture of work, so as not to change the next Ubig, which has been riddled with scandals ever since the former employee published a blogging service describing a hostile environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and conformity area may be worth more than USD 1187 billion by 2020 according to the website of statistics on financial transactions in Let s talk floor.
Against the background of the dubious reputation of Uber, the start-up company IACS, which operates in Colorado, helps businesses prevent and detect inappropriate conduct, this year saw an interest and an increase in activity.
The Code has almost 600 customers, including Airbus, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a customer.
Like Glingi, the reformed cent allows companies to send adapted impulse surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and look at areas of problem with heat cards.
It also offers an anonymous text of message that enables workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the executive director, complaints go directly to the Bureau.
'Public opinion has been forgiven by regulatory authorities, 'Patrick Quinlan, the founder and executive director of the convergence census, said.
I quote: If a company is found to treat its workers badly or to be unethical, the company may face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, the departure of workers and court cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby COM, a restaurant with more than 25 000 employees at 500 sites, has been using the convergence cent for more than a year to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and to provide a simple way of communicating with the company headquarters.
If a worker wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find a telephone number or e-mail address at the Corporation headquarters, then he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, James Vitrano, the general adviser, said that there was no good way of monitoring workers' complaints.
However, now that the company is using the pattern cent, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices, which did not previously reach the leaders acting in offices in other cities or states, can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360 degree experience of staff," said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Satellite risk Management Group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and worker involvement much more seriously in 2002, in other words, after the audit company Arthur Andersen failed in relation to the Enron scandal.
However, only when the social media became mature did businesses realise that they could not stop their black-washing openly from hiding online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Control cent provide their software services by charging companies periodically for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors, who have supported both start-ups.
The convergence fund was funded in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Customs Capital, thereby increasing the value of the capital collected to USD 47 million.
In November, Bessemer invested USD 10 million in Venture partners, increasing the company's total funding to USD 60 million.
Such investment will not come as a surprise given the interconnectivity between companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that modern workers expect more jobs than ever.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely contributions on the table.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
'When people are happy in the company, they feel they are being listened to and satisfied with the work they are doing, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company 'said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of the Global benefit and Workers' experience, LinkedInis, who is using both the fabric and the Glinti.
Investors will make a profit if companies in their portfolio do well; companies will do well if employees are committed and involved.
If the third party analytical tools allow for an increase in the commitment and involvement of workers, we will not be surprised that they will receive support.
The possession of data on worker participation is important, according to experts from the working culture.
However, this data will be useless if the company's successors do nothing about it.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it could raise expectations that changes are to be made.
And if changes are not made quickly enough or not at all, this could cause disappointment and reduce worker involvement.
'If you ask for 4 000 proposals, you must be ready for 4 000 conversations, 'said Kotter International's President Russell Raath, who has seen companies making a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
'because, if things are not completed, the workers will think: 'Did you actually listen to me?
Are you concerned?
And if you do not care, why should I care? '
According to Errett, the Madison Rhine, which is now carrying out six studies among employees, has been able to implement measures on the same day that the problem has been reported via Glinti.
And after receiving feedback from workers frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she managed to reorganise several crew in the company and to provide communication training to address the problems.
However, Ruby Satellite age will collect new data on staff and it is hoped that in the long term this will result in a longer-term commitment by workers in an industry known for its high turnover.
'If you are not committed to transparency, you will lose people, 'said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose business. "
The remaining star of the euro area is the Baltic: Income growing fast
Although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bizberg is writing a reference to the ECB report.
According to the ECB, since 1999, total economic output per head has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
This success is due to low debt, fast-growing institutions and business-friendly and free-market policies.
"The Baltic States, together with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where there has been a significant convergence between the EU average per head of unit GDP and per head of purchase."
Although the aim is that total economic output per head equates to a richer Western Europe, in 2015, the total output of the Baltic economies per capita amounted to just 2 / 3 of the average of 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Balans to seek better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the local population is far from enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
The Czech Republic and Poland thought this about the economies of their countries a little less than half of those surveyed.
NCAA decision to cancel the two-yearly trends will change Bruinsi's days long
It is almost 23 when a host of UCLA players stop talking at the edge of a new exercise in a university city.
Some of them have tightened their backs by revealing the efforts of their training camp during the first day.
For a large proportion of the team, these Christmas minutes provide medium-day breaks.
After three hours of row, participants in the race will return to the WNGman football club before returning to 6.30 meetings next morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," said Jim Mora, a Bruinsi trainer, just before Monday became Tuesday.
NCAA's decision to cancel the trends twice a day in order to reduce the burden of players has, in fact, made their days longer - at least until half-time with finished examinations on Friday.
For this reason, the first three training sessions of UCLA were timed to start at 19.15 in order to fit in with the already tight schedule of players.
The transition from two legs per day means more days with a trend: The start of the Bruges training camp was raised almost a week ahead than in the previous season and, for the first time, during the Mora six Westwinning season, training sessions are taking place during summer courses.
They plan to run until 20 August to 18 trenches before the formal preparations for the opening game in Texas A & M take place in September.
According to Mrs Mora, she is in favour of a change of the NCAA rules, although it adds another item to the high schedules of players.
"They have a huge burden three or four days and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they break through this challenge; they are struggling, they are nice young people.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it will be really good. "
Once the camp has come to an end, UCLA training will close down, which is no easy task at all given the clear view of the boarding plate close to their fields and the departing Luskini centre, the high class hotels that have already escaped from the protective network of gates with football.
Since this weekend, the hotel Bruges players are occupying, but Mora recognised that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco.
'implement security measures, 'said Mora.
"This is a real concern and it is hardly exaggerated to think people can rent a box and filter there.
If you have a record of your training, you can do a good deal with it.
But we are using a security team there and at 8 parking stations.
We will do our best to use it.
I will try not to worry very much about that.
We have a plan in place. "
The tolls for Sapyare-Ivanova's election union born of the centre-centre, the electoral alliances set up by Kristiina Ojuland from the reformed party, forced out of UNESCO, are at least as much as the political parties in local elections this year, to show our Tallinn and our departments the business community of businessmen.
The chickens will be read in the autumn, and the key question will be whether they will all have sufficiently frustrated constituents.
Who will remain with the Sahel?
How small the support force of Edgar Saderare has decreased may be expected from events organised to honour his electoral union.
One Member of the Assembly of State, some former and current central partisans and many unknown faces - is this the composition of the electoral Union?
And why, in Tallinn, are some of the true proponents and friends of Sadogare shutting down their candidacy, can they see that the 'Saderare list' of champions, led by corruption and corruption abuses, is becoming a reality?
Under the umbrella of the Municipality, a filmed musical curve in Russian, attended by the older city of Lapland; and in every respect by an original computer game in which Prime Minister JÃ¼ri Ratas must avoid the loth and slaves on his way in wars - is this the way that the centre party is striving for the first time for the votes of 16 and 17-year-old voters to be allowed in the ballot boxes?
We look forward to seeing other parties' perceptions of the young electoral campaign.
If the channel 2 or TV3 looks at black spots instead of entertainment since the beginning of August, two options remain: To accept that in future, only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV and English France24 channels, or to surrender dozens of TV operators each month.
There are probably also those who, in the first place, openly rejoice in the free televisions, but in the end - albeit reluctantly - are paying for television and advertisements.
The deafening music, the lungle public and rubbish left on the streets are almost all unpleasant side phenomena on every major music festival.
However, if they do not want to be part of a meal themselves, it is worth going home to discover the country instead of pain - and leaving the Coptic room for sleeping on the margins of the festival.
Washington changes the rules of the Green Card
Media publications are cited by President Donald Trumpi, who said that a new US immigration plan is planned which will change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan envisages a reduction in legal immigrants of 50 000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republican people and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money because it will change the way green cards are issued to citizens in other countries by the US.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process gives priority to the candidates who speak English and who have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy, "said Trump in the US media outlets.
Siblinto young people are moving to towns, pensioners are returning to the countryside.
Yevseyev Anatoly continues to have the tradition of the famous monkeys of the Maana River gold mine.
She is working 140 kilometres from her home to Maana's tributaries at the gold station in Kuvai.
It is a tough job: Two months in a row of 12 hours' work, and then only 10 days at home and again.
In the three years of the Archordered, Anatoly has only seen the culmination once.
'There is a stark order: Going in, it is being thoroughly checked that the vig does not lead, and going out that gold does not take it ', speaks Anatoly.
Mare Piho converdal in Haida village with the local seto Jaani, who has told him a great deal about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture that remains in Siberian chickens will also influence home-seals, as it is quite simply so shocking, considers Piho Mare the most advanced pigs investigated.
His first investigative trip to Siberia this year will take 30 years.
During that time he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year.
How much did Siberia still emigrate at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in order to become a land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I would argue that 8 000.
I calculated this in the words of Siberian men who have themselves thought about it.
It is difficult to say precisely because up to 30 people were able to come in one group at the time, but only a man was given a passport.
The passport was awarded to only one, but it had children, nurses, etc., returned to a woman.
Look at how large this territory was here!
It was many times greater than the historic Setomaka.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
Setos came here as farmers, but their lives changed because here they ended up in regions that were linked not only to agriculture but also to the river (palgitation), to gold mines, to industry.
For example, in New-Petseris, many semen later went to work in the salvaged town of Krasnodorkovsk-45 (where Soviet power was built by the uranium plant - J. P. - when it was formed.
Did fathers represent a majority of the population at that time in this region?
Yes, they were living in tandem.
Furthermore, the tradition of marriage and multi-nicism preserved for a long time.
Seven to eight children in families were common.
How much is Siberian Seals culture different and different from that of mother-land?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same.
They gave rise to a great deal of hot air.
They did so (ideas for money) themselves, but they always made a distinction between what was included and what had been done here.
Climate change has been heavily influenced by the traditional rigidity of the pig, because here it is cold.
The changes proposed were made.
For example, Setomaka was salt, but here meat was simply frozen.
Where are Siberian villages and what lives are there? / graphics: Alari Paluminutes?
The link to the mother country was spiritually strong, which was considered very important.
It seems to me that this country is now starting to give back to it, is beginning to affect it.
Those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho is thinking of the Estonian Seals delegation, who came to Haida village Seto Kingdom Day at the beginning of July and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
What is still here is shocking.
"It is so easy to come and get off the ground because the city has a wonderful location: At the railway beer and at the crossroads of the roads," says Reigo Tamm from Taps.
The city is not just a military capital for a long time, we have plenty of nature, sport and culture, and the pirate becomes every corner.
Tapa is a top-heap city!
Along the River White through Link, there is a small island where the images of malpractice tend to be hung.
'This beautiful site does not look like a train window ', muheleb Reigo.
Anyone who does not fear cold water can flood in the river because the river is full of sources.
I have been flooding there, you can live!
River water can keep a long wait and can simply do romantics - you can look at the flow of the river and think about life and behind it.
I, too, have been there with my bride.
From Rangoon to Tampere, apart from anything else, the river has been getting used to their aariaries between three bridges: 'That place is on the ground, no one may come back when their stories are numbered'.
"The playing field opens a wonderful view of de Tapale, but there are also health professionals where you can drink, you can skie the winter, and now, for example, you can play design cgolf - golf courses have been made, the supermarket can borrow from sport."
The old protagonists are, of course, there with their own system, but I have not yet got there.
Obviously, my colleague, Mrs Rasmus Golden, must be invited to the village of Tapale because she has experienced a discgolf fan and she has the heels.
Perhaps he will lend me.
Reigo and MÃ¤nnikull were completely inseparable from the current period of childhood.
At least during hundreds of hours.
There are many tears left on this mountain, many disappointments, and you can live in my sporting life.
Not to mention the batteries and spices that have broken down.
'The whole city is now full of construction works, all this becomes unknown ', praising Reigo.
However, the old and tired-tired pipe building is a very attractive place where ski discoveries are played.
I am pleased that in 2012, the head of R.A.A.A.A.M adopted my idea and had to make a sound summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season 'Alejali Karenin' has just passed, on 11 August, the railway station is' walking 'when the old patchwork is moved around in the 1980s.
"Between 11 and 13 August, Tapa is the city of Tapa Day, which has seen open house cafÃ©s and rival cultural events, including a peace secret, taking place just over a period of time, and which recommends a visit to the city of 9 / 11.
In a small three-quarters, 1 May sunshine is already a museum dating back to 1994.
'The house is a small house, but the exponents are well and vast in their information ', the Reigo site, full of the history of the Tapa town, most of which focuses on rail and war.
Reigo muzzles that, if you go through all the recommended sites, you have a long way to go, but fortunately, small towns are full of cafÃ©s.
"We have such good feeding places and sometimes you get the feeling that you are abroad, you describe it."
Educated and young soldiers who have come to Tapmad spend a lot of time in coffee-cafÃ©s, and the wall is sitting there with the feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but that this international company is together.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
The wars, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal hijacking
Television canal bTV quoted a Ministry of Foreign Affairs who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegally tending.
On the island of Sithonia, on 1 August morning, the police arrested a group of illegally commissioned people, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to television channel bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing harsh penalties on anyone who is caught in a clean space that is not intended to do so.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the Court can impose fines.
The wolves who teach the white are breaking sheep.
Farmers on the shelves will have to give the wolves a box again, year after year, 'teaching materials' - the wolves who have apparently taught the dry have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, the wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, 23 sheep and eight have been injured, writing the Hiiu site.
Soil was the number just three, a year before 124.
In syndrome with the upheavals, there is also data from the Environment Agency that the wolf areas of soil in Hifin were not born and information from the Hicow Council that this year, two wolf washing areas were fixed on the island.
On Monday night, the junta in Kabul broke off from 15 sheep in Kabul and injured 18 survivors.
Three days ago, in the early morning, the junta buried one sheep in the country of the village of Rehetia and seriously injured the other, to whom an emergency killing had to be made.
Clear rules for handling GM crops
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a coordination front on a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOs) and on a draft law amending plant protection law.
The amendment to the law does away with the creation of a separate collection of data both for GM crops and for business operators, using a plant health register in the future.
Furthermore, the GM farming community operator is being amended to have prior agreement with the person engaged in beekeeping.
Although, at the moment, GM crops are not cultivated in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence between GM and non-GM crops.
That is at least until there is a decision to declare Estonian GMO-free, "Sigmar mouth, Head of the plant Health Department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs, said.
"However, we must take into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors,"
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the collection of data and the training of GM crop sites and handling establishments in GMOs VS, introduces requirements for handling GM crops and for starting economic activities.
Specifically in relation to beekeeping, the current obligation of GM farmers to inform beekeepers about the cultivation of GM crops from the start of cultivation is replaced by an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with apiculture before cultivation begins.
The draft law has been sent to the Ministries for coordination.
All interested parties will have the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the content system and, if they so wish, to give their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes affect, in particular, those working in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the farming profession.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize mon 810 - has been authorised to be grown.
So far, however, none of the Estonian farmers has been interested in the cultivation of GM crops.
This is due to the fact that Estonia is absent from the magic floor, the European corn media, for which mon 810 is resistant.
Likewise, this magic line has been extended to the southern regions, and it is not suitable for our climate conditions in May.
In order to ensure this certainty, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 on possible GM organisms for detecting possible pollution in the seeds of various surapeseed, maize and soya-rape cultivated in Estonia.
The analysis of the samples carried out showed that seeds were not present abroad and the study concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties in Estonia did not contain GMOs.
The previous one, in turn, may conclude that there is no consciously cultivation of GM crops in Estonia, and it has also been confirmed that there has been no random contamination.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United colour in Nemanja Maticu in the form of the 'genius'
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited in the form of Nemanja Maticu in the form of a genius, after a central player against Samconventions o made his debate on Wednesday evening.
GBP 40 million from Chelsea, bought over from Chell in Dublin, started off in the latest seasonal match between UEFA Super Cupi line in Madrid on Tuesday 2-1 victory in the algorithms, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on the offensive.
However, aside from the seasonal Asian history of Blues, Maticel was sorely lacking in beating, and only 45 minutes were approved; this must be rectified by the Premier League before the start of the Premier League.
'she needs time, but she has experience, intelligence, genius thinking - she has a football mindset, says Mourinho.
"We will help it to get a form as soon as possible."
Like the author, the Aviva stadium started other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romeva lu Lukashenko and Mourinho stood out quietly at the start of the season with his male starting point.
The Independent public this week that Mourinho still wishes to recruit three football clubs, but he confirmed that the club had already done 'excellent work' by concluding three of his four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club for managing to realise three of the four things," she added.
"I am even happier if they can deliver four things, but they have worked hard for me."
Another gender dissident walked his feet on the GSM Embassy on 1 August and this time in Muhus.
The murder murder observer Mati Martinson gave us the first monthly son to be equipped with the accompanying Sdyves, and this washing force is already blowing around, has left the ground and joined the Great Embassy in the Bay of Mullutu.
This is because of the fact that there is no grain fields in Christianity, the voice of the islands writes.
This Tuesday, rather late for toring the cucucumbers, another puppet became on the embassy, on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of embassies is, in fact, an international project transported by ASwoboda Leito and Ivar Ojans.
Soil was supplied by a puppet called Mati's GSM-accompanied Srupves Turkey.
"His actions are all on the internet: How he travelled to Spain, got back on the German-Polish border for a long time and then came to Saareland," Martinson spoke.
The British inventor install a microchip in his body to get a hand-in-hand house and car.
The British inventor became the first person in a country to have a microchip installed so that he can only open his own example, get into office and even launch a car.
33-year-old Steven Northam had the pleasure of installing a tiny chip between his pÃ¶ld and his finger of naming, and is now offering this service to businesses and private individuals through their BioTeq company, who want to make life easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant-anestesiologist in the county of Hampshire in Hanoi, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
Technology is similar to that of microchips installed on cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure.
The Northwest company will also replace the snow of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, asking for GBP 300 per lock.
This child's father has installed the technology at his home now and in his car BMW Z4, which will get off the ground when he has his hands on the wheel.
Concerning the White House cost taxpayers thousands
According to the military documents published at the time, the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicopter last month for an event involving American production in the south of American production cost the taxpayers as much as USD 24 000.
The Green and White colours Sikorsky VH-3D, known as' Marine One 'during the President's session, was the centrepiece of the event promoting the American construction programmes in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, senior officials of the White House, Vice-President Mike Pence and White House, reported on his way to industrial products from all 50 states.
A helicopter built in Connecticut was fitted with a bull from reputation, a fire-fighting car from Wisconham and a fire-fighting plane made from Missister.
According to the Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) documents responsible for operating Helicopter, the White House called for the presence of a helicopter with a command, the FARGO, a bit of 36 hours before the helicopter landed for the 'extraordinary' event in the south.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually high-profile event," said HMX-1 commander a day before the event, in an e-mail, to his arrogance, to the Deputy officer managing the navy in the aviation sector.
The message stated that the helicopter arrives in the southern horror at around 7 a.m. on 17 July morning for a start-up event of 7: 00 and will remain there until the war broke down between 18 and 21: 00.
Attached was the fact that, if departure from the White House were to be delayed, a return flight would need a different elephant because of the restrictions on working time.
The initial flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the security team of the escot kept the aircraft near its ground for all its time.
It was not possible to read out in the documents at the time of the magazine whether or not another apipe was finally needed.
The Hatch Act bans federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could violate this provision.
'We asked whether it was in breach of the Hatch law, and we were told that it would not go wrong, 'we wrote a commander.
'It seems that you have no choice, 'responded to the Deputy leading officer.
The White House declared the 'American made in' event and the Hatch Act would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The President supported the health reform efforts under discussion at the time in the Senate and praised efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of a aircraft known as "Marine One or Air Task Force" for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them as a purely photocopy is unusual.
In February, the Trup was brought to the attention of President boarding during his first campaign event in Floridas Melbourne, and he is sliding from Twitter's account messages complaining about the way in which the plane was used by his predecessor's President.
"White Matel is very pleased with the slogan" America made, "which included products from all 50 countries made up of American workers in material," said Lindsay Walters, the editor of the White House press officer.
HMX-1 teams often carry out tests around Washington and in the horror of the South to get used to putting the US President in a White house with a slim of centimetres.
When the Trump was at the G20 Summit in early July in Germany, 58 samples took place in the HMX-1 White House's care.
According to the official, the "American-made" flight mission was included as the norm for the monthly study flights.
The helicopters of the Eskaadr were flying for a further 11 hours on that day for 'non-presidential support missions'.
According to the White House, none of the others burden the taxpayers' money for this event.
According to Sikorsky's representative, the company was not involved in organising exhibitions at the southern horror.
HMX-1 does not maintain the budgetary documents of President flights and the precise costs of the event are difficult to find out.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence 'hourly prices for the financial year 2017, VH-3D has a compensation rate of USD 24 380 per hour.
In Eskaadr's documents, a flight long from its main naval base, Quantico, was nominated for 30 minutes from Virgin both directions.
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is well below its amount.
"Calculating taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates of reimbursement include many other irreversible costs that will be taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2011 rand study, the Ministry of Defence's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The former spokesperson of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of a helicopter at the time.
'The point is to show things made in America this week, 'Spicer said.
"And I know Sikorsky and Connecticut State are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose job depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So of course it is right to highlight this. "
It is not clear whether Trump was exposed to a helicopter in the southern horror as part of the event or not, but he was hiding behind the fire-fighting car.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky addressed representatives by referring to media publishers about their products of joke in their personal aircraft fleet.
'I know SikorskÃ¡ very well, 'he said,' I have three products. '
Gri Å adeiko - In tears peace and joy came through
Mil Daeshot in 2011 was hit by Å adeikok in the last area, 800 m beverages were walked and the stadium took the leaf away with the beach.
Just before that, he had received zero in the New Year in China.
Helsinki 2012 wealth of low-cost injuries, but in London, it received its place in sixty 13 points 23.
However, I have continued.
Moscow Mil, in 2013, received an onward injury on Estonia's schedules, following an opening day.
Two years later, Beijing won the 15th seat and played the Olympic orum, but that too had wanted more of a sportsman to be disappointed.
The worst cathedaliclone passed through Å adeiko only last year when it was not possible to obtain a letter from the first half of the Amsterdam EESC.
I would just like to bring together, even once, a proper multi-competition.
Once again, 'Siko sprayed.
Worse still, a month later, his Olympic competition in Rios broke the first barrier due to his re-evastery.
The time had to be taken down - is it necessary to continue with 7 matches at all?
Is the two-day effort worth all this?
Neiu thought for a long time but found peace itself.
I was able to think twice about it!
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience, but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to cure ourselves and to think about it.
"I knew I would not yet be putting my finger in the home straight," Afghanistan is talking about its self-cleansing.
I was able to turn a clean page and go forward with a new momentum.
Treener Anne hill said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of carelessness, but he realised that, above all, the athlete himself had to make it clear.
After all, he was so betrayed by everyone.
It was difficult to tolerate.
'Gri said, however, that he is not giving up and he wants to prove to himself what he is worth ', says memories.
Now there is some peace in him.
It will do so for its own pleasure.
The contest came back in May, when Å adeiko set up a new Estonian record number of 6280 points at the Gscenarios.
During a high-level competition, he improved his personal peak heat requirement with almost a metre (13.89) and ran a record near-time barrier.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not at all capable, but only the first hunger of competition was extinguished.
The memory that guided him for years says that Å adeiko is a black student.
She is a sportsman ready; she is well trained.
If something is wrong or wrong, then he says it straight away.
It feels its own body and trusts its sensibilities.
That is what we must do.
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we will follow it up.
A new approach has also been found in Afghanistan.
'I am not the one who is doing the utmost in the trong forecast ', he says and he says that the most important thing is obtaining the right recognition, because it also ensures a good outcome.
Baby babies happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Å adeikok by loved ones.
Both his former fellow apprentices in Mari hill and sister Grete recently became parents and many competitors have received support from new weather citizens.
'It has been quite interesting ', says Å adeiko.
One alcohol with drinking is synonymous with 'training'.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is such a great wine fans that he believes that wine can be better trained than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is neuroscientist at the University of Yale.
His message is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and ideas, but about the 'very active' grappling process.
Wrapping, shaking wine, enjoying it and perceiving it in a aftertaste will put our brain into work in order to create taste for wine.
According to Sheperdi, wines do not actually contain tastes, but taste arises from the way in which the wine stimulates the brain.
He brings the brain into the line of 'seeing' colours.
"Taste is not wine, taste creates a taste for wine," says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, the number of sue and even the heart that man produces.
Sheperd, of course, feels wine is not full of habit.
'Action must be more ', says.
If you get too much fat, the system is over-cold.
Excessive drinking can do harm instead of benefiting brains - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glass with wine, loss of memory, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity risk being drunk.
10% of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia pay less than colleagues
The figures from the staff search company Fontes reveal that 10% of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia are paid less than their colleagues.
The 10% pay gap between men and women writes the portal in Geenius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector's pay survey.
A total of 8 577 posts were examined.
63% of posts were worked by men.
"Although only 3 companies said that the pay gap is between men's and the rest of companies think there is no pay gap, on average, men's monthly basic salary is 10% higher than men's and men's total salary, on average 8% higher than that of women," the Foncrates analysis Ilmar North foota said.
Cycose 3 season advertising clip: Now that Pablo Escobar has gone, Netflix hitsel takes centre stage in Cali kartel.
Despite the fact that in the second season of the 'Narcose', the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed, Netflix's sari is far from over.
The third and fourth season has been confirmed by the streaming service and the first has already been produced by the advertising clip, which is crippling with the horns with new pathogens.
In the third season, DEA pays its attention to the richest drug business organisation in the world - the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful crushes, such as Fortune 500 companies, with more bribery to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis), Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is leading relations with Mexico and Chepe SantaPPC z London (Pepe Rapazote) is operating in New York.

According to the UN, Afghan women's role in politics depends on
On Wednesday, the head of the United Nations Mission for Afghanistan said that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a part in them.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women stand for election in local councils, three women stand as vice-president and more than 30% of the newly registered voters are women.
"Emphasising the importance of women's role cannot be exaggerated," he said in a statement made on Wednesday.
The elections can only truly represent the people and be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban, for their part, have threatened the electoral process, which coincides with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes consultative.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to the Haysmal, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent electoral Commission for Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes every effort both large and small.
There is always too little time in common, but the trenn is a good opportunity to combine meeting, play, closeness and burdens.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you were in the summer, living pigs are always with you, and you will remember with your fine voice very much: 'Let us now go down to the trend!'
Without insulation, it is a good thing to have a normal game of gold or to slip down the coast.
All are the pillars of staging feet and darkness - who would like to take the form of a sleep-blown sand code during the summer?
It is wonderful to have children instead of chicken!
Firstly, it is secure and comfortable, and the rate of severity is gradually increasing at the same pace as the force of the trainer.
Advanced villages with quite high children can also be made.
The child is reading the balance, reading the corps and feeling the ability to be high and important.
Larger children may at the same time make their own heating.
The scale of the movement lies in the problem of land and in the foolishness of hands.
To keep the finger straight, please keep the mini-abbreed properly.
The child can read the flames and feel like a trainer.
The planet is a tremendously but hopelessly boring exercise for a child.
But it is easy to make things easier!
Game-plank: Take a long planade Colonboard to clean up.
In fact, it is more difficult than usual, but much easier, to do than one's hand can in the meantime be given to a friend.
To add the burden, you can keep a planade, a small toy, and walk around in this location.
More than anything, the little child can be planted onto the shelves, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
While cracks are flowing in the sand, the bogus, ash and cooker meat are getting a strain like a infection.
A child walks on to the feet in such a way that his body is distributed equally beforehand and behind.
Security can keep the door on its hands.
Walking the walk and walking directly.
The word can fly, relax, be a balance between training and difficulty.
The life of a small train is an excuses when it gets small things in every coming up.
The extra burden is being imposed by the bail-out.
Scrutiny to keep the switch in a neutral position.
Children themselves have much more pleasure in carrying bovine animals and posters.
Chat and pulse heating.
After the child's safety, their hanging, and the hotel's back in a neutral position.
The favourite and great fun of all children!
At the same time, the whole body trend is really effective for the elderly.
The sports tools were Ott (10), SÃ¤de (8), happiness (4).
A journey from the Philippines to the heart of moefles from the wider world, known as the Sulgkot
Booked bags are the summer class, which in recent years has become one of its own valuable products, even though one of the right smokesperson has to hang at his hands and to which merchants, despite its modest origins, have been able to use an additional price label appropriate to his plate.
A red coke is probably one of the things that has existed in the age of justice and that has not aroused much emotion.
It simply exists and, if it does not exist, there will be nothing at all.
Now, however, the breeders are about to make a real victory, and moefers have switched their musical designer bags to the very simple beating bags for the summer months.
However, it is not only a coasthouse, but today it is just as popular as it is today, and more courageous women are even going to walk in the office.
However, it is worth making it clear in this regard whether such an oral summer is still sitting or whether it is worthwhile rejecting the label and laptops a little more formal.
However, the wealth of hospitality has made beans a true summer love for women.
When I read foreign fashion logistics, for example, the first thing that comes to mind is that moisoghurts are the first thing to do with holiday trips to the local market and buy themselves some beer bags that then have a lifetime of holiday and which are accompanied by rigour, the market and also friendship on the ground.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more wolf from the market and sell them or give them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting, however, that there is such a high demand among readers for women in the real world (and men!) apparently to go to each other's shores in order to be able to become a happy owner of some homes.
In some ways, this madness is understandable, because these are the queues when it is possible to buy just a few tens of euros in a modus operandi in one of the motherings.
It is true that the clever traders have also discovered a simple way of earning money here, so that more sophisticated luxury brands also sell sisters for a few hundred and a few thousand euros.
Obviously, so that richer customers do not have to feel as easy to die, who try out with some cheap bags.
For example, Dolce & Gabbana can buy more than EUR 1 000 in beer bags.
However, for the interpretation of Chancellender's interpreter, around EUR 6 000 can go out.
In contrast to most of the mosaic buildings, however, the comrades do not come from a great Cape Verde at all, but from a far-off perspective.
Indeed, breeders are said to come from far from the Philippines, where they have been overwhelmed.
The red tape in the past is there, in particular, an export business and very often does not see the local circle.
Admittedly, the nanotechnology originates from the 14th century and is rather routine with the usual corpus.
However, as beer bags do not need to be red as much as coral, they can combine musters and other materials that make the home more individualised and, by extension, more acclimatised.
For example, in recent times, there are particularly trendy bags with red-coloured paints or skin bogs.
However, the letters of formal notice may, in particular, be sent by actress Jane Birkini, the most counterfeited beer of which was not seen before.
She has adapted her beer to all kinds of clothing complexes, and she did not even regard it as much to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
However, the popularity of the Copts nowadays does not play a smaller role either, nor does it mean that caring for them is a hot head and, unlike all other summer products, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but it also gets the water and the wet.
As in the case of trendy robbers, after classical appearance, brands have come up with all possible interpretations.
For example, if you want to, you can buy a red box from your beer or a tiny piece of rubbish.
It is worth remembering, however, that a classic beer will never go from fashion to beer.
But, what is the classical beer?
For centuries, such a red copy of beverages, which resembles a flat from its style, has been classified as being open and short, as well as from beer, pitfalls.

GMB concerns about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The company is waiting for confirmation by the managers of the mature producer McVitie plant of long-term production plans at the Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has kept quiet about the future of the investment at customs level.
More than 500 people work in the Hobnobsi and rich know-how and other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the object in the last couple of years.
There were more employees and trade union chairmen 'are the first to hear' when something changes in plant activity.
In a letter sent to the site of the company, GMB Scotland called for 'to allay concerns about the lack of funding for modernising production lines'.
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said, 'The fact that we are not getting clarity from the head of the object about the business needs of Customs and the future investment plan makes our Members deeply concerned.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, as a vital pillar for decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social exclusion.
So in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the east of Glasgow, Brext, the rise in living costs and the chronic decline in production require a thriving manufacturing company in McVitie. "
The Pladise representative said: 'Only yesterday, GMB Scotr received a letter from Iceland and the company replies directly because we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between workers and representatives of the GMB in the Customs Area, where several problems were discussed openly.
We discussed at the time with workers that, like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are looking at our actions from the current point of view - and this applies to all our businesses and all our sites - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added, 'In recent years, we have invested more than GBP 5 million in the Customs Security Objective, most of which has gone to production lines and improvements.
We fully understand the legacy of Customs as an object of manufacturing, and if there are any changes to the object, workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear of it. "
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago of approaching Neyra?
La li may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in efforts to attract Neymar into his ranks by making an offer of GBP 189 million to buy him, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record conquest?
This paternalistic approach has opened the summer as a transitional window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to destroy more than double the current world record of buying, which was set up in the last season by Paul Pogba returning to Manchester Unitemis for GBP 89 million.
Once the changeover has been completed, Neyra will result in the world's most expensive player and, at the same time, the most paid professional player in the world, which will receive more than GBP 500 000 per week after taxes from the PSG.
Barcelona is known to be angry both by its approach and by its breaking-down of Neyra, although the source close to the Catalansansansi Board confirms that the club has always cared for football since its arrival in Santoise in 2013.
But did the President of the PSG warn the football world of this possibility three years ago?
While Manchester City showed interest in concluding the Blair agreement in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs that think about the best play and recruitment of some PSG.
'I am not worried because they know that, when they concern some of our players, we will be able to welcome them and contact their players, 'said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But when they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players, they have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have gone beyond this limit because the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in Marco Verratti, the medium-sized player of the PSG.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow an Italian departure under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a setback as a result of this interest by removing one of their precious assets in the form of Neyra.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexitit, not borders.
"Brexi is seriously at risk of losing a stone between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," warned Varadkar on his first visit to Northern Ireland in June.
'I cannot imagine who would benefit from it ', he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for current people and goods to move freely, said Varadkar.
'This is our vision for the future: Building bridges, not borders', he emphasised.
According to the former, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and as it fails to do so, he would remain part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade agreement between the Irish Republic and the UK.
Another way to streamline Britain's departure would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explaining to the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: 'Certainly we could have one with Britain'.
The alternative to this would be to return to customs posts that would declare historical divisions and political failure.
"Raise trade, prosperity and peace," said the Prime Minister of Ireland.
He mentioned Brexitit as' our generation's challenge 'and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of daily life in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met leaders of the main Irish parties when he visited Belfast.
Avand, through its first half-long triathon, Ironman can go through everyone.
Today, Otelul, in the winter capital, was held as the largest trilateral lotteries in the Baltic States, when around one and a half-a-long Ironman competition was born from nearly a thousand trialogues from thirty countries.
A total of 70.3 miles consisted of a total of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life has culminated in a sign from Avet.
'I thought it would be difficult and, in the end, it was difficult ', pointing out Avand finiÅ¡i.
In spite of the complexity, Avet said that it is actually a triathon that is affordable for almost everyone.
'It is not the dance that kills, it kills the pace ', he said, suggesting that with a good speed, everyone will reach the final straight.
Except for Ott Sepp: 'It is all well and good, but unfortunately it cannot go swimming'.
Avand had been eagerly on the way to a trend since February.
From 4 to 5 hours a week, but 10 hours a week later.
With time 05: 34: 12, he reached 27th in general terms.
Although Avand lost both to Raio Piiro (time 04: 59: 53) and to JÃ¼rgen Ligle (time 05: 06: 37), she won other so-called 'prominent class' competing.
Last year, Tanel Padar, acting as a 'good example', lost his life in seven minutes (time 05: 41: 54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05: 50: 23), Kalev KrNew and Raivo E. Tamm with around one hour (times 06: 31: 53 and 06: 45).
The overall winner of Ironman's capture in OtepÃ¤Ã¤'s series was John Moldan, a German, with a time limit of 3: 58: 27 Estonians were the best Ivo Great times 04: 14: 09.
Among women, the Danish man, Helle Frederiksen, won with time 04: 24: 01, with Estonians Maria JÃ¤nese, who lost almost half an hour to Frederiksen and received 04: 58.
Avand ran from 1.9 km to 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He stood out for 410.
