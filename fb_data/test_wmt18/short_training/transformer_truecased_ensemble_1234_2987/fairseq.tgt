four members of the Group of Cape Verde were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to Mr Posselt , in Spain , the police ap@@ prehen@@ ded the leader of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape K@@ alli@@ ro@@ vo Group &apos; in Estonia , S@@ bel Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , who is known in the criminal world under the name of S@@ pin@@ K@@ Cape ro@@ v@@ ski .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , who was detained in Spain , was arrested on the court &apos;s list .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
it is suspected that the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde &apos; criminal community members aged between 27 and 57 years of life , who commit mainly drug crimes .
in the province of M@@ ala Mi@@ ja@@ s in Spain , the alleged head of the criminal community was detained .
three men were detained in Estonia as a suspect , one of them collected according to data is the leading figure in the criminal community and two are members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicate that tasks and roles were clearly shared in the criminal community .
the purpose of criminal activities was to commit drug crimes and thus to earn criminal proceeds , &quot; commented on the head of pre @-@ trial proceedings , Public Prosecutor Va@@ gio Ver@@ te .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; added the Prosecutor .
it is people who have previously been interested in law enforcement authorities , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Ver@@ te stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common@@ place for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; said Public Prosecutor Ver@@ te .
the head of the central criminal police service , ago Le@@ is , said that detention was preceded by a preliminary investigation of nearly one and a half years .
&quot; in the first half of the week , long @-@ term work was realised and , at the same time , in Estonia and Spain , we suspected of committing crimes , &quot; he said .
Le@@ is added that central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are yet another message to criminals that we will get them from another European end , &quot; said Le@@ is .
the information that has been gathered so far clearly indicates that men suspected of being in freedom can continue to commit new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office requested their arrest and also approved by the court .
a man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
in this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation .
the pre @-@ trial proceedings in criminal matters are carried out by the central criminal police &apos;s organised crime office and run by the prosecution service .
in 2005 , the city of Tallinn was convicted of blackmail by S@@ hi@@ Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch and punished him with five years &apos; imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ š@@ i was regarded as the second most important man in the criminal world in Estonia following the G@@ end@@ ar@@ meri@@ e , Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , from Cape ro@@ vo@@ s , emerged from the Estonian Alliance at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Ad@@ mittedly , he taxed tax@@ i drivers and women on various ho@@ tels and ordered a monthly ro@@ tation tax on business@@ men .
international joint operations , confiscation of proceeds of crime and entry into force of judicial decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest judgments , the eight accused of the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ ye@@ v criminal offence , who seized EUR 80 000 of criminal proceeds , or the judgment against nine individuals that Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v created a criminal connection in 2006 aimed at illegal trafficking of illegal cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in Eastern Vir@@ u@@ land and southern Estonia .
it has a total of around € 71 500 in confis@@ cated criminal profits .
in these criminal matters , it has been a success that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and , if necessary , act together in any country of the European Union .
civil Liberties Group war@@ ns of Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ se travel
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ Guard of the People of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ Ps ) has warned the people of the Muslim population travelling to Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ se for discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the State .
the Group &apos;s statement states : &apos; the NA@@ SR issued for the State of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i State , valid until 28 August 2017 , calls on all Iraq@@ is to be particularly attentive and very careful when moving across the country , taking into account the suspi@@ cious racial events that have recently taken place in the country and have also been pointed out here &apos; .
according to NA@@ C , the group urged both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law to issue a travel warning , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that the targets for the state &apos;s law of law @-@ enforcement defenders are , to a large extent , minorities .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
they are pul@@ led down because of their sk@@ in col@@ ours , beaten or killed , &quot; said R@@ od Cha@@ pel , President of NA@@ AR@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints before . &quot;
this is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for the US State .
the group referred to events such as racist insul@@ ts against black students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black S@@ and@@ er@@ si .
the S@@ and@@ ers died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , after he had run through the state of petrol and was arrested by the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the comment refers to the recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which shows that in the State the cars of black car drivers are hal@@ ted by 75 % more likely than those of white drivers .
&apos;@@ The comment is designed to make people aware and to warn their families , friends and collabor@@ ators of what might happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it is to involve the money of distance or to inform relatives that they pass through the state . &quot;
based on the latest figures from the F@@ B@@ I hate crime programme , 100 hate crime crimes were documented in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is in 2015 , which places the state in a cross @-@ border 16@@ th place in terms of the number of similar offences .
the travel warning is also a response to the new law of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which makes it difficult for a company to be brought to court for reasons of discrimination in search of housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( American Civil Liberties Union ) had previously issued travel barriers for T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona following the adoption of immigration laws by these states , which obliged local authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration because , according to AC@@ L@@ U , it increases racial profiling .
usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter @-@ reaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or inc@@ in@@ eration , may be caused by five different types of he@@ pati@@ tis A , B , C , D and E virus .
all these vir@@ uses highlight the acute bur@@ st of the li@@ ver .
there is , however , chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B and C , which can develop into a li@@ ver ro@@ ck , in other words , a li@@ ps and a li@@ ver cancer .
the epidemi@@ ology Ad@@ vis@@ er of the Health Agency , Ku@@ ul@@ o Ku@@ abi@@ r , says that acute he@@ pati@@ tis disease is the same for all types of sk@@ im@@ med infection - f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ gue , rub@@ ble , birth , o@@ liberalisation , cru@@ el@@ ty , grey emissions , horse mackerel , meat and excess pain , and s@@ wine and li@@ mas@@ ters .
the last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of the li@@ ver &apos;s bur@@ ner , y@@ el@@ low disease .
children can undergo he@@ pati@@ tis without disease .
the various types of cyanide can only be identified on the basis of laboratory research data .
he@@ pati@@ tis may turn to chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and go decades without disease phenomena , which means that man may not know anything about his or her dangerous pay @-@ off disease .
Mr Ku@@ nil@@ r points out various forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their cul@@ mination more closely .
a he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading from a hospital to humans and infec@@ tious us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , through se@@ als , emissions of infected human beings from hand and hand to food , soil , objects , contact and consumption of drugs .
a he@@ pati@@ tis was carried out by family members and carers of the disease , people suffering from chronic diseases , sex people with infection , sex men with men , drug users , and passengers visiting countries with a he@@ pati@@ tis A high spread .
vaccination can be prevented , in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling a lot and at the he@@ pati@@ tis A risk group .
furthermore , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands before eating food , to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
the he@@ pati@@ tis vi@@ ral virus is spreading in the circulation of a person &apos;s blood , in the treatment of drugs , in in@@ duc@@ tion , in honour , in the use of blood @-@ contaminated fo@@ e@@ der ( den@@ tists , pregnancy ) , in donor blood , in the sex of he@@ pati@@ tis suff@@ e@@ rers , and in he@@ pati@@ tis disease to animals / new@@ born .
the risk group of he@@ pati@@ tis infection includes drugs , sex partners of infected human beings , sex men , new@@ born mothers of infected mother , sick family members and carers , health care , rescue workers and police officers , as well as passengers visiting countries with high he@@ pati@@ tis B .
in order to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis , it is possible to vacc@@ in@@ ate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vacc@@ in@@ ate people from the risk group , as well as those suffering from chronic diseases , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
there is a he@@ pati@@ tis of other preventive measures : non @-@ ref@@ ra@@ ining from the use of stran@@ gers &apos; hygiene and man@@ ik@@ y@@ sis devices , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ stal@@ de @-@ coun@@ ters , toma@@ toes and au@@ g@@ mentation , and the use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection or prevention of sexual risk @-@ taking .
vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis b is part of the National immun@@ isation Scheme and free of charge for children in Estonia .
He@@ pati@@ tis C vir@@ uses spread when dealing with the blood of the sick , when it comes to drug injec@@ tion , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic , au@@ g@@ mentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated fo@@ et@@ uses , donor blood blood , the person of he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ h@@ all in sex and he@@ pati@@ tis hospital for animals / new@@ born babies .
the risk group of he@@ pati@@ tis C @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis drug users , sex partners of infected person , sex men , inf@@ ants of infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police officers , persons with HIV infections , and passengers visiting countries with he@@ pati@@ tis C .
the He@@ pati@@ tis C is a preventive measure : refrain from the use of alien hygiene and man@@ he@@ y@@ l devices , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ s @-@ coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors , toma@@ toes and au@@ g@@ mentation , and con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
A@@ he@@ pati@@ tis causes he@@ pati@@ tis D virus , which is multi@@ plying in the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B virus .
as a result , D@@ he@@ pati@@ tis D infections , together with he@@ pati@@ tis B or super@@ information , occur on chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B suff@@ e@@ rers .
A@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread exposure to blood and other body liquids , contaminated spiri@@ ts , relatives and rarely infected animals .
d he@@ pati@@ tis risk group is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B infections and people who do not have immunity from he@@ pati@@ tis B .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis B vaccines , which also protects people from he@@ pati@@ tis D infection .
E@@ he@@ pati@@ tis vi@@ ral vir@@ uses spread by weight to drinking water and food , including low heat @-@ treated beef , fish and marine car@@ ro@@ ts , donor blood , psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c and infected animals .
passengers may be infected with high levels of E he@@ pati@@ tis in countries .
the measures to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis are compliance with hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands after the fire , before food production and eating , after care for the disease .
fruit and vegetables are was@@ hing ahead of consumption , avoiding eating little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption .
although , over the last few months , competitors tried to get rid of a four @-@ fold Olympic winner , 34 @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ara@@ h ended up in power and won 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
the F@@ ara@@ h did not think long , bringing the hus@@ band T@@ ania and the children with him after the fin@@ ch .
this was a special moment for me .
I am very much counting on my family .
being with them was wonderful , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h for journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h is focusing the fifth edition of the London title on a gol@@ den du@@ mp of 5 000 and 10 000 metres .
everything is possible if it is believed .
despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ norm in Da@@ am gold , G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti &apos;s mas@@ ter@@ piece , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri &apos;s wonderful story of &apos; one of the art works of much deeper than the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna &apos;s cultural life .
but even more deeply in history .
it would have been possible to get more influence on the exceptional nature of the portfolio , which is to say , a s@@ le@@ ep cut in the coff@@ ee , a narro@@ wer topic .
at the moment , there would be two books between some of them : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t and his pain@@ ting &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , the story of A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , and a much more extensive and comprehensive history of H@@ on@@ ourable Jewish families and the German occupation , with its aftermath effects in Austria .
the first third of the book leads to a thri@@ ving cultural life in the middle of Vienna , and who himself entered the Austrian capital , can hardly imagine how life was going around R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ s more than a hundred years ago , or how all its heads were turned when the climate inva@@ ded .
the concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the rich@@ est cities of Europe , and when we saw the name familiar in the book , some of them seem to be more cultural than a gram .
however , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a city where there was an un@@ treated ar@@ son in the vo@@ ir and was the highest level of suicide in Europe does not add anything to the development of the story .
or perhaps , however , every couple of fair ter@@ rain also adds colour to the cultural life of Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in the last decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had explo@@ ded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
nearly one in ten people in Vienna had an exchange of views .
parents , too , were new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time the aid for the A@@ vian was opened twice by the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ ad Fer@@ din@@ ja B@@ lo@@ ch@@ ga and the customer in his famous pain@@ ting , his father had already become the seventh largest bank in H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg &apos;s E@@ mp@@ ire .
however , the whole life of the gla@@ ci@@ ers to which he belon@@ ged did not go .
if you look at the &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end @-@ of @-@ life infection was that great @-@ like da@@ m soci@@ alism and dre@@ am@@ t of a trip to the Soviet Union .
by 19@@ 07 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s luggage from Climate , the last moment was the pain@@ ting mak@@ er in Vienna .
the cli@@ m@@ t ordered 4 000 kro@@ ons at the time , a quarter of the price of a good @-@ place rural house .
the fact that some of the mar@@ ks@@ rs were not intimi@@ dated by the mo@@ del@@ li of the mas@@ ters , the sugar mag@@ na@@ ti .
as far as the dele@@ gate is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between mo@@ del@@ li and the ar@@ tist in the course of the work continued until the end of life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; .
G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti &apos;s C@@ up , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri Corpor@@ ate , exceptional story , &quot; Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , Al@@ do R@@ and@@ land , who translated English .
shortly before the start of the work with A@@ dele@@ ga , Ra@@ ven@@ nas San V@@ ita@@ le had visited the climate , and the investi@@ g@@ ators think that it was precisely there that the wonderful mo@@ sa@@ ic countries , the Em@@ pe@@ ror na The@@ o@@ dor@@ f , gave an artificial idea of making a gol@@ den portfolio called A@@ dele@@ dele@@ dele@@ te as a mo@@ sa@@ ic .
the climate was presented in his &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; in Vienna in 19@@ 08 and , at the same time ( between 19@@ 07 and 19@@ 08 ) , another gol@@ den country was born &apos; novel &apos; .
artistic his@@ tori@@ ans did not notice the simil@@ arity of two women .
what about nature is Hitler ?
&quot; I think I am indeb@@ ted to him to make his hand available to the public , &quot; said A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer a few years after the departure of the ar@@ tist ( Kli@@ m@@ t died in February 19@@ 18 ) to the Director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere muse@@ um and wanted their family &apos;s cli@@ m@@ ti to go to the muse@@ um .
six years prior to the death penalty , the customer had a t@@ ree of one of the A@@ dele@@ gates .
he also asked her hus@@ band to leave her two sports courses and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti landsca@@ pes to Austria Gal@@ eri in February 19@@ 25 .
he has written his notes to Mari@@ ana and Lu@@ i .
one year after the cli@@ m@@ t had finished the &apos; Austrian Mon@@ a &apos; annex , Vi@@ in Ka@@ carri@@ art de A@@ ka@@ de@@ mine had attempted to escape 17 @-@ year @-@ old Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , but failed in a foot@@ note .
although Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is sometimes seen as a result of the fact that Jewish profes@@ sors did not accept him in the anti @-@ S@@ ca@@ de@@ my , none of his cul@@ min@@ ants was actually Jewish .
in any case , the role of the Austrian Gal@@ er , referred to in Mrs Bu@@ il@@ ding , had changed considerably by 19@@ 39 - it had become important to find decent works from the rich Jewish arts in Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal mus@@ cle of art also served some work at home for the A@@ s , but not for the climate .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the artistic rob@@ ber@@ y of the Naz@@ is , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute between the Austrian Government and the he@@ irs of B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer was launched .
it should only be noted here that if the &apos; S@@ novel &apos; is seen in Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle in Vienna , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ er &apos;s &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; must be seen to travel to New York to Ne@@ ue Gal@@ eri .
and before Vienna , read the aforementioned book .
even if you do not plan to look at the work of the climate , because at least my emo@@ tion , after the closure of the book , the subject of laugh@@ ing and ha@@ ir was sold more than USD 135 million ago and mode@@ ll A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer .
so not so much a t@@ ree , but rather a family emb@@ assy - and a very moving story .
there was a significant simplification of the way in which the Bau@@ ots &apos; relatives at the start of the book were communicated .
17 @-@ year @-@ old sw@@ im@@ ming in Canada was very close to Estonia &apos;s record
in eating , gold was very close to the personal record of its own 200 m se@@ li@@ flow@@ ing , flooding 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 .
the Ti@@ pp@@ mark comes from the 17 @-@ year @-@ old festi@@ val every week since the Canadian H@@ on@@ ori@@ an Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship received 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 , the Pri@@ it A@@ ope &apos;s U@@ ju@@ gation blo@@ g .
gold has finally esca@@ ped a tenth A @-@ fin@@ alists .
in Fin@@ ally , he went through a distance of 2.@@ 15.@@ 76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful March .
Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) , a member of A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or@@ n , remained a little over half a second .
in Estonia &apos;s ranking of all times , gold rose third , and its fresh personal top mark is the fifth ever result of Estonia .
the young hope of the future lies at the launch of Canadian adult Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships of 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in bal@@ fire and 200 m@@ m and 400 m@@ m in bun@@ dling .
last week , Canadian ju@@ gg@@ ers &apos; champi@@ on@@ ships took place in Tu@@ on@@ to and gold made successful start @-@ ups there .
he won 200 m in bal@@ fire with a sil@@ ver man &apos;s time of 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
this distance was sw@@ am@@ ped so quickly by the last resort in 2008 .
Estonia has been distan@@ cing itself more quickly from the Gol@@ den era than Estonia &apos;s record B@@ SE .
as a sta@@ r living in Canada , a film of 100 m@@ m v@@ anis@@ hing v@@ ines won an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season with 5@@ 6.@@ 66 .
for example , her grand@@ mother Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k has distan@@ ced it by just one century faster .
he reached an additional 100 m in the opening of a brief@@ ing in the opening of a brief@@ ing in the z@@ oo .
for half a longer distance , he won only the seventh seat when he s@@ le@@ ep at 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 in the fin@@ alists .
gold is currently leading the fin@@ est in Estonia on four different distances .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics insu@@ red teet@@ h
the holiday season is in hand - it is also a mess for the President of the United States , Donald T@@ ru@@ m .
however , as the T@@ ru@@ mp has so far been one of the President who has taken the most holiday days , the critics are already we@@ aring teet@@ h .
according to the US Guard and CN@@ N , the President intends to have 17 days &apos; leave in an un@@ sea@@ ted gol@@ f club in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , located in New Jer@@ sey .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , the anti @-@ T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has been speaking for a few weeks .
they are cas@@ ting too much on the Olympic Games .
it is precisely that the President has the time for a weekend in his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey in cotton .
incidentally , the T@@ ru@@ mp is not the cle@@ arest President in his 19@@ 6 term of office .
George W@@ . Bush , for example , has already reached 67 days on holiday , while Barack Obama has reached half the T@@ ru@@ mp , only 21 days .
however , things are ten@@ ding to be forgotten quickly by the Olympic Games .
the days after becoming President , in T@@ ru@@ mp , he said , &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , that there would be no time left for long holidays during his team , because there is a great deal to be done .
he also expressed his outra@@ ge about Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
the current President wrote on Twitter at the time : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , plays a gol@@ f , the brak@@ es and the j@@ ung@@ le concer@@ ts are on the brak@@ es and the journalists in Haiti are putting their heads in the wind &apos; .
according to white house officials , 17 @-@ day gol@@ f club visits to pol@@ len are not a bet@@ ra@@ p .
instead , it is officially called &apos; working leave &apos; , during which the Olympic Games do not have time to read or other pro @-@ sporting activities .
in addition , there was another reason for working leave .
it is precisely that the western system of the White House is being replaced , which is why all staff had to leave it .
the West Bank is also based on O@@ val@@ ka@@ r and other presidential premises .
&apos;@@ I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West in August if there are 38 degrees and no con@@ glom@@ er@@ ations &apos; , the speaker of the White House , L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , who stressed that the President would continue to work during his leave .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp will spend 17 days , you will get an idea of a video .
blocking critics from Facebook to theory do not stand for state posts if you do not tolerate the critics of the voters .
the father of our country knew a great deal about unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to bul@@ l him for everything , from internal politics to his political principles .
of course , he was anno@@ yed by the criticism .
but he did not force his critics to remain silent .
because , in 17@@ 83 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and that , in dar@@ k@@ ness and silence , we could be led by sheep to massac@@ res &apos; .
this brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land ku@@ ber@@ ner Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who is struggling to be more in Washington .
the Ho@@ gan has blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the American Federation for Freedom of Citizens ( American Civil Liberties Union ) has therefore brought it to court .
the Ku@@ ber@@ ner officers &apos; office te@@ mb@@ ed the action empty and web commen@@ ta@@ tes sli@@ pped away from reactions in a style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos;
&apos;@@ This is just Facebook , &apos; many people said .
but that counts .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
this is an ama@@ zing popular Governor of the Re@@ publi@@ can in an overwhelming democratic state .
his approval rate is the second highest ranking among the 50 Governor of the country .
Ho@@ gan is not a reac@@ tive sight .
he has led the State firmly and remains strictly firm on his principles .
in addition , it has used its main tool in communicating with its voters quite b@@ lun@@ tly on Facebook , for example , presenting its own ro@@ ck head after the che@@ mis@@ try for the first time .
thus , the Governor &apos;s co@@ ws are a public forum with official labelling , managed by staff who pay taxpayers &apos; dollars to block people visiting Kenya unnecessary and , ultimately , dangerous .
in an interview given to Washington Posselt , the spokes@@ man of Ho@@ gan , defended the behaviour of the Governor , arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than a mo@@ del@@ ling .
however , it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet controls on the web , spa@@ w@@ ns or people full of hatred .
the post spoke to a number of people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
this is precisely what they are people who communicate with their elected leaders : the teacher , the owner of the company and the passport , and not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ table , thought @-@ out and not ro@@ sy at all .
Pas@@ tor quoted the Bi@@ ble in his post , highlighting the K@@ gan Catholic movement .
the lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan from Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ m Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not inci@@ te hatred , but rather hate crime .
&quot; I have repli@@ ed poli@@ tely that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news , &quot; he wrote The post news story in his country of comment .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that when many people comment on the same subject , some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort instead of acknowledging that it is a lot of citizens &apos; concerns . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s officials called &apos; targeted jun@@ k attack &apos; would probably invite others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the age of Facebook makes it easy to reconcile messages by simply blocking criticism or dele@@ ting negative comments .
it is much cleaner than it was when , in order to do the same , workers had to be expelled , so that they gather newspapers with critical edit@@ orial edit@@ orial letters and bur@@ n them or arrest protest@@ ors and force them to remain silent .
but that is exactly what is happening now , just digita@@ lly .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media too@@ th@@ less .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has brought Twitter users to court who have been blocked from Twitter &apos;s stream .
one of the first key judgments on this matter was made last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is , the US civil servan@@ t , decided in Alexand@@ ria that the chair of the Man@@ aging Council of Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i Coun@@ ty violated the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the vo@@ ter from his Facebook page .
Mr K@@ tu@@ ck@@ ys also visited AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter for use by Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in@@ it ( R ) .
this should not be so difficult .
in Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar effect on the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters da@@ red his way of leadership .
even then , Washington had to face anon@@ ymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers from pseu@@ ud@@ on@@ y@@ ms such as Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , making the decisions of Washington land .
according to historical documents repeated in the Water @-@ based George Washington project , he sw@@ am@@ ped the c@@ abinet with petitions criticising his views on the agreements on friendship , trade and shipping with Britain .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , differences of opinion and debates are the foundation of our country .
and proper management means accepting this .

&quot; I saw R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ance C@@ lu@@ b being built , and now we see the club blow@@ ing in full gl@@ ory with this event , &quot; said R@@ aff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; players see the path in their best shape , it is in a perfect state .
Jer@@ ry has done an excellent job in setting up this place .
he is a keen supporter of the gol@@ f game and proud of what has been achieved here .
this will allow a wonderful presentation of the path . &quot;
an Eng@@ lis@@ h@@ man is ever looking forward to being able to defend the champi@@ on@@ ship for the first time , although the man has won both the European Toubon and the European challenge in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this is a very special feeling , &quot; said Sou@@ th@@ por@@ tis &apos;s be@@ ating player .
&quot; I was unable to defend my Ex@@ t@@ rema@@ du@@ ra O@@ Antwerp title because it was taken away from my competition calendar one year after my victory .
it is mathema@@ tical to come back to this chic@@ ken .
this is an excellent place for gol@@ f playing .
I remember the memor@@ ies of last year , for me and for my wife Shar@@ on , last year &apos;s victory was a special one .
it was a very special time that we will always bear in our hearts . &quot;
on the ground of the country , G@@ ary Or@@ r will also return to the competition once again , who joined the European Union of se@@ gen@@ i@@ us in the beginning of this year when he received 50 .
this is his first event in Scotland following the participation of A@@ ber@@ de@@ en asset Management Scottish O@@ pen@@ il in 2013 .
&quot; it is always a little bit more important to play at home , &quot; said Hel@@ en@@ s@@ bur@@ gh &apos;s man Or@@ r .
&quot; there was a good deal to be done , but at the same time you are also looking at the extra .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and I have shown quite a decent gol@@ f game .
I am satisfied with the progress made so far . &quot;
the former MasterCard &apos;s winner , ian W@@ oo@@ s@@ na@@ m , and the champion of the se@@ eni@@ me Association , Paul Bro@@ ad@@ hur@@ st , Ro@@ ger Chap@@ man , mark James and mark Mc@@ N@@ ul@@ ty , will join in Tri@@ o .
Or@@ r and former Ry@@ der Car@@ ika Cap@@ tain S@@ am Tu@@ rance are two of the six Scottish people in the competition , the rest being Andrew O@@ ld@@ cor@@ n , Ste@@ p@@ hen Mc@@ Allis@@ ter , bill L@@ ong@@ mu@@ ir and ross D@@ ru@@ mon@@ d .
access is free of charge , and car par@@ king costs a car with one passenger GBP 5 and GBP 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds go to the char@@ ities Pro@@ buying Can@@ er UK .
poverty and death in the gold @-@ rich country of Indonesia
when Mr De@@ ge@@ i &apos;s dinner is produced , he will not use lead .
he sel@@ dom uses even po@@ ts .
the Indon@@ esi@@ an authorities , in the capital of the Mun@@ ici@@ pality of Papua province P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , in the majority of the pu@@ p@@ pet , place the house tur@@ n@@ ine in the local language in place in the direct replacement of a bar called &apos; no@@ ta &apos; .
in half an hour &apos; time , there will be a fire in a coal slu@@ dge , and there will be a lot of sk@@ in with un@@ be@@ ating hands .
De@@ ge@@ i is sitting from elsewhere on the floor of Peru , he does not have anywhere and , at the same time , he is also doing his daily ho@@ mework , for example , was@@ hing the water of cra@@ fts from a ne@@ ar@@ by sex .
the role of the bridge is being played in an un@@ covered do@@ se .
as he is the four women of his hus@@ band , he has not been allowed to take care of any fields .
Pol@@ ü@@ ga@@ a@@ mia is common here on May .
late working may , however , be dangerous for most of the men of the island , and many of them drink hard , and there are still soldiers here .
&quot; no one da@@ res to go around after five o &apos;@@ clock in the village , &quot; he says .
this is a rare pilot in Papua mä@@ ki , a former Dutch col@@ ony , which was integrated into Indonesia in 19@@ 69 following a referendum that created controversy , in which only 1 0@@ 26 prisoners were forced to vote in front of the forces .
the movement towards a government of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , which has freed the Dutch people from the rule of law , is rapidly proving to keep the region under strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially split into P@@ ope and Western P@@ ope , so independent Papua New Guinea remained east of the island .
the majority of the whe@@ el is both remote and de@@ ser@@ ted and , in order to get here , 90 minutes from Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ i , the capital of the province , will have to fly to N@@ abi@@ ana and then pass a five @-@ hour journey with a ren@@ tal car .
there is no public transport .
the city of approximately 19 000 inhabitants is made up of t@@ ree be@@ aches surrounded by se@@ mb@@ s and covers la@@ in@@ ous iron ro@@ of@@ s , which have been transformed into a different y@@ o@@ ke .
very few indicators have taken the road here , not to mention journalists , nor have there been almost any foreigners here .
prior to the arrival of Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago &apos;s boats were mar@@ ches with a God called T@@ ame@@ e .
there were other changes .
&apos;@@ We were not used to wear such clo@@ thes , &apos; says De@@ ge@@ i , referring to our colour @-@ hand@@ ful tur@@ b@@ une , the fire on the plu@@ us@@ tery and the English .
&quot; before that , we only had a plant cow in the body . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
but it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
just 100 km away from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , a mountainous province with a population of 153 000 in New Jer@@ sey , is the largest and most lu@@ cra@@ tive gold mine in the world , G@@ ras@@ berg , which belongs to the company F@@ re@@ export Mc@@ Mor@@ an , which operates in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x .
in 2015 alone , F@@ re@@ ports extra@@ cted approximately USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ per .
in addition , it is possible to con@@ tend with consumer timber stocks , estimated to be worth USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are a source of suffering for boats , as they result in the suff@@ oc@@ ating presence of a powerful Iranian army .
a study from The New York Times in 2005 showed that F@@ re@@ export paid approximately USD 20 million to local troops and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including USD 150 000 to one of the officers .
P@@ ope attempts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den h@@ all and are rou@@ tin@@ ely bet@@ ra@@ yed .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 69 and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Iranian army .
according to the Asian Committee on Human Rights , the mass killing of the genocide in the moun@@ tains of Papua tri@@ bes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide .
last year alone , over 3@@ 900 peaceful prote@@ sters were arrested by the Colom@@ bian police in the region .
the 2016 report of the Grand Dis@@ tri@@ ct of Bir@@ s@@ b@@ ane , entitled &apos; We shall lose all &apos; , contains testi@@ mony to the atrocities committed last year , such as extra@@ judicial executions , torture ( rape and electric blow@@ s are particularly common according to another report ) and brutal repression of peaceful protests .
&quot; it is difficult to summarise the number of victims , as such incidents take place every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , a research@@ er of Human Rights Watch , Indonesia .
the blockade has been lifted even more strongly , as Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new set@@ tle@@ rs from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the inhabitants of Indonesia , Jaa@@ va , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ es .
the white head@@ lines are sold in the open can@@ na@@ bis and with mixed vegetables by ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do , which are st@@ olen along with ground level .
they cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started selling chic@@ ken and vegetables more cheap@@ ly than local boats on the traditional market , &quot; explain the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ita@@ lians born in P@@ ani@@ a@@ is who worked in Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ i , the capital of the province .
&quot; Sy@@ ma@@ ma @-@ ma@@ ma @-@ ma@@ ma &#91; women &#93; pain@@ ting boats will therefore lose their market share . &quot;
the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , who is known to be among the people as Jo@@ ko@@ w , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to address these inequalities and human rights violations in P@@ ope .
the former pu@@ mp won 27 constitu@@ encies , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , on his way to the presidential Pal@@ ace of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta .
however , the P@@ ope has changed very little and the local classes feel chea@@ ted .
&quot; our hearts have been broken because , in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he would fulfil our hopes of restoring justice , &quot; says apprenticeships .
in fact , only two months after Jo@@ ko@@ w took office in October , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i was in a low position .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the bo@@ xes s@@ tun@@ ned on Christmas when two Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers appeared in the dark .
the children who met told them that they should include the front lights .
according to the words of the local passport , Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ eba@@ i , one of the soldiers insul@@ ted their voting tone and returned later with four soldiers .
according to the victims and the specta@@ tors , in the run @-@ up to the children were driven by soldiers and beaten by their gun@@ s .
then one of the soldiers was shot among children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , was so bru@@ tally beaten that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , the building of a close electoral commission was bur@@ nt down and things were even more pressing next day .
around 1 000 young people in Papua men , women and children gathered in a football pit@@ ch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they were we@@ aring cement bul@@ bs and putting forward Papua me@@ e pa@@ go tri@@ ck@@ ery wa@@ ita @-@ tan@@ ts@@ u in which poultry s@@ ongs were bu@@ ried around and bu@@ ried .
some prote@@ sters started to le@@ cture the police and the military .
&apos;@@ I@@ f the crow@@ d is more than three times resistance , let them go down , &apos; according to a formal document , which has been seen by the magaz@@ ine , but which has not been issued to local media publications .
Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , the city of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , the older city of Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ me ( 56 ) , felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking for a crow@@ d to go home .
no one had the will to listen .
&apos;@@ W@@ hile I was suddenly shot in the left , he said in his magaz@@ ine at the t@@ reas@@ ure of a t@@ ree in his German col@@ ours .
we still do not know who the fire was , but it says that the soldiers &apos; ri@@ gs gathered in the month came from .
&apos;@@ There was a lot of people , a great deal of swe@@ at , &apos; he adds &apos; .
the local man , Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , was shot three times , saying that he had been shot .
&quot; I would like to wait for him and I went through him as a body to make sure that it is with him , &quot; said the magaz@@ ine at the moment in Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who uses only one name as many indicators .
&quot; I saw him dead ... S@@ novel le@@ en . &quot;
the chief inspe@@ ctor of Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said to repor@@ ters that he only guaranteed the security of his department because it was attacked .
&quot; we need to defend ourselves when we are threatened to kill , &quot; said Vice @-@ President P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , the spokes@@ man of Papua police in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prote@@ sters were killed and there were many injured .
the news of killings arrived in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta@@ il only on the next day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra made a passion@@ ate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses to be dealt with in P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that he would introduce an alternative mechanism for dealing with human rights crimes .
but almost immediately the ex@@ cus@@ es were also followed .
&quot; most crimes happened a long time ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and early 200@@ 0s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
however , when speaking about the magaz@@ ine on 5 June in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to with@@ drew his words by saying that he has no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in P@@ ope .
instead , he said &apos; everything will be resolved by law &apos; .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in P@@ ope , including what happened in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i have accepted such claims with g@@ loom@@ y mistrust .
&quot; I have been heard four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&apos;@@ I am ti@@ red &apos; .
he says that he is still living in fear years later .
&apos;@@ I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&quot; I fear that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I will be shot . &quot;
he ven@@ d Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed the opinion that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are afraid of this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after helping to bur@@ y four victims .
&quot; after bur@@ ying the bodies , the army had to look to me , &apos; he says .
the celeb@@ rations have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the inhabitants of the village of the Indon@@ esi@@ an police were shot in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i , neighbouring P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
one person was killed and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , when he went to war between the inhabitants of the villages and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an informed man to hospital .
this man &apos;s population , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ w@@ ned into ne@@ ar@@ by rivers , died on the way to hospital .
the recent inhabitants of villages prote@@ sted against the company office at the construction site .
according to the police , the inhabitants of the villages were le@@ c@@ turing police officers with stoning , which the latter responded to with aler@@ ts .
however , according to local claims , mobile Bri@@ tons ( the Iranian military police ) started to shoo@@ t at the people , killing one person .
&quot; we were in great panic , we are afraid of reven@@ ge , &quot; said Assis@@ tant Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and saw the in@@ sec@@ ts of those injured .
&quot; I have beaten myself in my house for two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and for the return of the police to the mobile Bri@@ gade from the region .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ i has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development is feeding the dis@@ satisfaction of honey , m@@ oni , dan@@ s and da@@ m@@ mal tri@@ bes living in Papua hal@@ j@@ enda@@ eva &apos;s central memory .
many of them have joined the army of Liber@@ a Papua re@@ bels ( V@@ PL ) , who claim to defend the rights of boats by or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra@@ ting attacks and kid@@ napp@@ ings among Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers .
some V@@ PL leaders come from P@@ ania , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ g and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , over the last few years , under the pretext of &apos; defending national sovereignty &apos; , the army has arrested in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them will never appear again .
among other people , P@@ ani@@ ans are known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty fe@@ eds dis@@ satisfaction .
the low ri@@ ce sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
the Lei@@ b is just as un@@ available .
people are growing all their food themselves mainly from the Bah@@ á &apos;@@ clock , plus a little fruit and vegetables .
agriculture is the work of women , each of whom can care for four or five base fields .
they usually hold most of the harvest to the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten bases cost only 10 000 sites in Indonesia ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have deepen@@ ed between heavy boats and new migrants who have arrived in a great deal since the opening of new routes at N@@ ab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
the P@@ ope himself often lacks the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the village because there are no jobs and no money here , &quot; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , President of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ bal Council .
segregation keeps the eyes of the world out of the P@@ ope .
in addition , strict restrictions remain on foreign media .
French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ bridge L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were expelled from P@@ ope at the beginning of this year because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they had been given a rare film permit .
according to the Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch , P@@ com@@ m K@@ ine , the Vice @-@ President of the Asian department , Mr Jo@@ ko@@ w &apos;s electoral pledges have not been implemented to lift the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development .
&quot; journalists seeking reports from the most peaceful provinces in Papua ang and from the West P@@ ope in Indonesia face new threats to the rejection and black@@ list of Eurodac visas , &quot; said in his statement .
the lack of a press watch means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esi@@ an Government is largely limited to Papua near neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries , Li@@ beria , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ pain , Mar@@ shall Islands and Sol@@ om@@ on Islands , urged the UN Human Rights Council to examine &apos; various large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in P@@ ope , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the same countries have historically supported V@@ PL .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , the spokes@@ man at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed the charges for the group , saying to the press : &apos; in Indonesia , democratic order and freedom of the press are still in place so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bur@@ y &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to be noticed .
when the Dutch official delegation visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra on 4 May , headed by the human rights Ambassador of the country , Mr Van B@@ ari , the local people interrupted the meeting but , according to the source of anon@@ ymous desire to remain silent , urging that &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
new presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019 , but the boats do not believe they will vote again in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w .
&quot; Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man with good intentions , but people around him who are involved in the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i will say Ho@@ ba@@ i , President of the tri@@ bal Council .
he wants to give Jo@@ ko@@ w an understanding that , apart from the fact that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i live under the threat posed by the pre@@ da@@ tory army , they are struggling with misery due to poor education and health services .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , like other boats , regard their voice to Jo@@ ko@@ w as the debt they have to pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and intimidation , the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i fire were able to cope with the last to@@ ken opposition to Madagascar , which swe@@ pt one victim &apos;s body dead into a police station and the army &apos;s response to the land in question .
knowing that justice can never be done , they at least do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a shot .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
ne@@ eding to sw@@ allow Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch &apos;s pil@@ ots for the second time .
on Friday , one of the world &apos;s largest housing stor@@ ms in Du@@ ba@@ i was ea@@ ten , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to escape from this 3@@ 37 me@@ tre and 79 regular buildings .
this is the second fire that has been ra@@ va@@ ged for just two years by the high h@@ all , which is called the Tu@@ rin case , the T@@ hu@@ vi@@ ku@@ r .
the building was evacu@@ ated , none of the injuries were reported and no direct fire @-@ related causes were submitted .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and wa@@ ited for the fire sub @-@ prime and people &apos;s fears .
we would wait for the t@@ our down and we had about 10 minutes to get down to 50 order , &apos; said to Re@@ u@@ ser a single person who called himself George .
according to Du@@ ba@@ i civil protection officers , fire fighters were also deleted at around 4 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning at local time ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and ja@@ iled the building .
the government said they were working to ensure shelter for those affected .
this incident may once again raise questions about the safety of high @-@ level materials used on foreign soil around the world .
during the investigation carried out by the steering Board in Tu@@ ch after the fire in 2015 , it was found that the most damage was suffered by As@@ sa@@ thi@@ ans - the de@@ cor@@ al panels and insu@@ lation of foreign space .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of T@@ ow@@ er , the London G@@ ren@@ er portfolio , and the As@@ sy@@ rian panels , could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire there in June , which killed around 80 people .
see : these phones are likely to receive sales spots in the autumn
language and coal are the time for technological games , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um came to sale , and new h@@ it@@ t telep@@ hon@@ es are expected for po@@ ele@@ rs in the autumn .
according to the Tele@@ 2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Se@@ mother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by an innovative design , an eye @-@ s@@ hand@@ ner , a ser@@ ser @-@ servan@@ i 4@@ K resolution , and a fast @-@ track process .
Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , a great e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant in the technological world , has also reached the top of Estonia &apos;s smar@@ t@@ phone sales table .
in the autumn , even more smart cal@@ ib@@ re , more resilient bat@@ teries , a higher quality camer@@ as and greater water and customs security will be allowed .
he added that , on the basis of the rum@@ ours , you can already specu@@ late and predict four top models , which are likely to con@@ qu@@ er today &apos;s sales tables .
these four smart phone top models will reach po@@ inter@@ s in the autumn of this year .
the expected i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach po@@ lep@@ han@@ ts by mid @-@ September .
however , the rum@@ ours that the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are spreading greatly .
if i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not lead to significant differences between i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , Apple &apos;s 10th birth@@ day is expected to see the new model completely separate from previous ones .
there have been four col@@ ours : black , white , ro@@ ck and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one of the elements of the new design is probably a screen covering the entire telephone front , a copy has been lost and a fingerprints screen has been built .
the Apple design leader J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve demands that the new i@@ P@@ hone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk of an i@@ P@@ hone version .
in addition to the horizon , the un@@ man@@ age@@ able charging and even higher quality camer@@ a can be expected to accelerate the A@@ 11 process .
it is certainly one of the most expected smart phones in the year .
the outs@@ ourcing of the new model G@@ ala@@ x@@ y hood 8 will start on 23 August .
there have been a lot of rum@@ ours about what new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y jet 8 will look like .
Ad@@ mittedly , even more business users are meant , and S pen allows even greater fun@@ ction@@ alities .
the Tele@@ phone should have two camer@@ as , one of which is a la@@ in@@ ur@@ t and one with a narrow view to tele@@ sco@@ pes .
at the moment , no one knows what the camer@@ as are capable of , but in any case it is the first test of Sam@@ sun@@ g , which is certainly comparable to i@@ P@@ hone 8 in terms of quality .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August .
although Nokia has sold three smart phones this year with Nokia 6 , their flagship vessel - Nokia 8 - is still missing , which is already being presented on 16 August .
we are waiting for a screen stret@@ ching from 5.@@ 3 to 5.@@ 3 dust and for a fast @-@ track Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ nap@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and a more durable bat@@ tery .
in the case of Nokia , there is also talk of alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and significant levels of water and customs security IP@@ 68 .
like Sam@@ su@@ ng@@ one , the new model of Nokia has two qu@@ eu@@ es produced by Z@@ e@@ iss , an opti@@ mist .
once the S@@ ony firm flag has been X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um up to now , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smart phones will be added in the near future , with even more innovative functions .
we are waiting for a smar@@ t@@ phone that is slightly more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least with the same good or better camer@@ a .
on the new model of S@@ ony , it has been specu@@ lated that its screen is at least hot .
what the reality is , we can already see very soon , as traditionally S@@ ony has unve@@ iled its autumn flagship ship at the International Technolo@@ gical University IF@@ A , which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year .
according to trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts le@@ ak@@ ed by telephone calls , T@@ ru@@ mp Mexico pressed for payment of the border wall .
the Washington post unve@@ iled telephone calls between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i and Mexic@@ an and Austr@@ alian state leaders .
on 27 January , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ o , the President of Mexico , travelled to T@@ ru@@ mp , to end public pro@@ cla@@ mation that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President stro@@ ke with him for his public condemnation of the wall , saying : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ mp mp set out his presidential campaign &apos;s promise to build a long selle@@ r and age on the southern border of the United States that Mexico would pay for this project .
the trans@@ cri@@ p@@ tors were also published in his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turmes , which reveals a ten@@ se debate .
T@@ ru@@ mp said to Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l that the agreement whereby the United States takes refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; stu@@ pid &apos; , that the agreement that was made during the Obama Government would give it the impression of &apos; lead &apos; , as it has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the T@@ ru@@ mp ended the speech by telling the Tur@@ ku that &apos; this was the day &apos;s most un@@ pleasant speech &apos; .
the Supreme Court did not take a complaint with the city of O@@ C MR@@ P in the case where the city of Tar@@ tu rejected their offer for bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 20@@ 29 .
it is a letter rejecting the supply of Tar@@ tu buses and coach procurement in the town of O@@ C MR@@ P , as the offer did not meet the requirements , Mr An@@ neli A@@ pu@@ tin , President of the Tar@@ tu City Service , explained .
this is the procurement of public transport within the Tar@@ tu city for the period 0@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 @-@ 3@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
the city of MR@@ P Li@@ delegations referred to the Supreme Court of Justice for the decision of the Tar@@ tu Dis@@ tri@@ ct Court .
the Supreme Court did not act .
while many people in the social media complain that the cli@@ p from the We@@ ek@@ ise festi@@ val is disrup@@ ting their night and the whole city is full of brak@@ es in the run , there are also many who do not have any bad words about a lasting festi@@ val .
I am even positively surprised that the brak@@ e was so poli@@ te in the shop !
I did not see any mis@@ gi@@ vings or mis@@ cour@@ tes@@ y .
even if I saw the Gulf , I will say a nice wave .
&quot; it is nice to come , be and enjoy the joy of a winter that has remained like a winter , &quot; he will gla@@ dly add .
the cu@@ mber@@ some wave of rub@@ b@@ ish is not destroyed .
if , in the middle city , he still heard that music is being played in the be@@ aches , then now music has not reached his home e@@ tho@@ s .
&quot; but I hope I hear , &quot; he will gla@@ dly say .
Mrs Ag@@ nes , who talked with a study , also says that the Grand F@@ esti@@ val is rather good for the ski@@ es - it is a great contribution to the turnover of local merchan@@ ts .
he also welcomes the fact that the summer capital has come to such a large extent .
the woman of family life does not .
although I am no longer on the coast , it is nice that rand has revi@@ ved .
and it is good that the people are moving , and this has been the case three times , &apos; says a woman .
the first time was probably a little worse .
&apos; then perhaps there were complaints &apos; , he is wondering .
however , what he said is normal for the summer capital cities .
&quot; this We@@ ek@@ ise is a very good pro@@ ph@@ et for our small city , &quot; says Har@@ ri , who is hiding in the park .
life and the m@@ ö@@ ll have also not put his life in the b@@ reat@@ h .
but for good@@ ness ?
we should all pull together .
think about how it would be better to communicate between nations .
after all , the music man does not appear .
this does not happen , although I live near there .
&apos;@@ Wel@@ l people can save and there is no pa@@ use &apos; , he says .
visitors who come to the ski@@ es are , he said , cour@@ tes@@ y .
&quot; they have , of course , joined them a little , but young people are young people and motherhood and God - give us a hand , but be people and we can do it ! &quot;
decent residents have travelled to somewhere by then , either to relatives or to acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces .
&quot; however , overall , the festi@@ val has a positive impact on life - people like this me@@ dal , &quot; says Per@@ sian as a Ti@@ ina with children .
his family &apos;s und F@@ esti@@ val also does not distur@@ b , although last year it was even further removed from the street .
last summer , we heard more .
we live outside the city that it actually goes far beyond the coast of the Per@@ sian river , &apos; he talks .
Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revive business
the British educational company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that it will cut 3 000 more jobs and reduce its interim dividen@@ ds by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with the threat of business .
these jobs , which , according to John F@@ all@@ on , are likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will be added to the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced in May a plan to cut costs under the third cost reduction programme by another GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) to try to revive a business that has been hit by the transition to high @-@ speed digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell last month &apos;s participation in Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House to its partner company Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , said that their expectation for a year had not changed since the sales income increase was announced to GBP 2.@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year .

attack in K@@ abu@@ l : suicide attack killed by NATO soldi@@ er
the suicide bom@@ ber , according to officials , attacked military con@@ vo@@ ys in the capital of Afghanistan in K@@ abu@@ l , killing one NATO soldi@@ er and w@@ ounding several others .
in NATO &apos;s statement , five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to local reports , three civilians were killed in a incident in the town of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi .
this bom@@ bing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month , with more than 30 people killed in the Her@@ ati mos@@ que attack on Tuesday .
on Monday two people were killed near the Iraqi E@@ mb@@ assy in K@@ abu@@ l .
NATO &apos;s statement said that there was an explosion on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ ro@@ l with the Afghan army was attacked &apos; by man @-@ made explo@@ sive body &apos; .
according to the statement , everything has been injured in a stable state and is treated in the US military hospital in Bag@@ ra@@ m airport .
according to the Cor@@ respondents , the Taliban and group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( Mexico ) , are a serious source of concern for the forces in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ h in Bag@@ h@@ dad , NATO .
according to the UN , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which nearly 20 % in the capital city .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l mainly killed at least 30 people in the S@@ hi &apos;@@ F .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed in central city by a major bomb attack , which has led to the most deaths in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country &apos;s military and police forces .
according to the correspon@@ dent reports , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
EPA annul@@ led the decision to postpone the regulation after shar@@ ks
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency ) annul@@ led the decision to delay the implementation of the Obama Regulation , which obliges states to limit emissions from the summer , one day after 15 states referred the Agency to court for this move .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday with the designation procedures for the &quot; Ma@@ in content &quot; of 2015 , saying that it demonstrates the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage in dialogue and listen to our national partners , &quot; said Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t , the head of the EPA , in a statement .
the P@@ ru@@ it@@ t had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the level of share@@ holder content in its various parts of the country to measure pollution in order to determine where its level of compliance with the highest air quality standard would have to be reduced by one year until 16 in 2018 .
15 main democratic states , together with the Colom@@ bian community , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has tried to bring back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , is part of a broader agenda for growth .
however , these efforts have provoked reactions among the democrats and nature conservation groups , who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that the brea@@ thing of ozone @-@ containing air &apos; may reduce the employability of Cop@@ ts and increase the risk of disease in res@@ pira@@ tory diseases &apos; , such as as@@ th@@ ma .
German cigarettes can come from pigs .
German pigs and cattle can come with pi@@ pes , as heavy rain threatens the European Union &apos;s second largest wheat producer , wri@@ tes B@@ animal berg .
this year , it can be said that the centuries of sa@@ tu@@ ration before harves@@ ting may mean that fruit intended for bread production can only be fed to animals .
&quot; the quality of wheat is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said A@@ gra@@ vis R@@ ai@@ ff@@ e@@ is@@ en &apos;s analysis of Bern@@ hard Nepal .
this year , up to 40 % of German n@@ ight@@ m@@ are for animal feed , which is from mil@@ l to business as usual , is forecast in A@@ gra@@ tis .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have been exposed to any weather this year .
first of all , the winter was too dry .
then came the cold spring , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
in July , Germany was hit by the dra@@ ma , which has continued in August .
many eyes have been turned to northern Germany , where the rain hin@@ ders harves@@ ting .
so far , only five per cent of nic@@ ot@@ ine has been repeated .
most of the region has not yet recovered , notified the local bu@@ yer of the harvest in C@@ era@@ vis .
&apos;@@ Th@@ ese are quite difficult days &apos; , the senior trader in C@@ era@@ vis , Frank Dec@@ ker@@ t R@@ end@@ s@@ burg , said .
Com@@ pli@@ ance in everything , i.e. the ro@@ cks of the internal design of Fin@@ ns
nature plays its part in the inter@@ night of mes@@ h homes because , through large win@@ dows , the equ@@ ated views of Sa@@ ima@@ a fish@@ ers reach many ( life ) rooms .
every step will be marked by our attempts by our northern neighbours to create both sh@@ ell@@ fish and perfect ( energy @-@ saving ) homes .
the ability of Fin@@ ns to use wood as construction and processing materials , fur@@ ni@@ ture and beau@@ ty is also worthy of deforestation and compliance .
Vir@@ g@@ ling techniques and smart solutions can be found in mes@@ h houses both as a buil@@ der and ( home ) archite@@ cts .
it is clear there that black , white and grey colle@@ ctions , if they are supplemented by wood ton@@ es and to@@ pi@@ pes , may be very desperate .
good ideas can go on a week later , because the F@@ air will run until 13 August .
Tar@@ vi@@ ans and sp@@ ices suggest that this kit@@ chen is often cop@@ ied .

M@@ sole y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
Mr V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and Mr Gar@@ cia , who should be on the brink of col@@ lisi@@ on in order to face up to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg in the most attractive po@@ ker in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were at the second end of the corridor to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , World Bo@@ avier Coun@@ c@@ il , in the presence of ES@@ P@@ N , in L@@ ge@@ le@@ s An@@ ge@@ les , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ winning World Bo@@ assies Coun@@ c@@ il , to the other end of the day , to welcome the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , the World Bo@@ Thurs@@ z@@ ation@@ i sul@@ g@@ weight che@@ que .
following the unanimous decision of Gar@@ cia , the victory of the former four @-@ time world champion , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er , on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ 157 , both comb@@ at@@ ants belong to the top of the table .
Gar@@ cia extended his hand better and said , &apos; Ho@@ w does the summer go , che@@ em@@ pi@@ on ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko is defending his bel@@ ts against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ v on Saturday evening at 19 ES@@ P@@ N .
when a few photo@@ graph@@ s were found , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko &apos;s memory ne@@ j@@ er E@@ gis Kli@@ mas stated that a possible confrontation between the mili@@ tants would be &apos; perfect measure &apos; .
&quot; I am a former consul@@ tant , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I called for B@@ ron@@ er &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small about 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move down@@ wards .
and he must move up to half the weight &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the F@@ ans have asked for this .
let us then help them to do so . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
in the climate , the question was whether it should be worthwhile to look at it , and this is part of his strategy to allow L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to debate the end of this year at 6@@ 1.2 kg in the class to make it possible for next summer to meet with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ vans ) , who also has an interest in combating Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ li &apos;s match match after their ligh@@ ter celeb@@ rations on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as f@@ ans have called for this opposition , &quot; said Gar@@ cia later , saying that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial package .
&quot; we are the key players .
no other name can attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that he considered L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t as a &apos; force fighters &apos; and could go to his Saturday match .
however , Mr L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was modest in pra@@ ising Mrs Gar@@ cia , saying that she felt that the three di@@ vis@@ j@@ on champi@@ ons from Ri@@ ver@@ pool were &apos; very slow ; sorry , M@@ ae@@ y ... you wanted this no@@ distant &apos; .
according to Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show the strength of the blow@@ s and then to bo@@ w .
both confirmed that they felt that the tension between them is increasing in order to reach a challenge .
&quot; this is a fight that awa@@ its realisation .
no other confrontation aro@@ uses so much attention and s@@ lan@@ der .
I am more than willing to work on this , &apos; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best comb@@ at@@ ants , and M@@ ae@@ y is precisely that .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
what world events are being moved to Estonia ?
soil was extended and issued by the police and border control authority ( PP@@ A ) record more than 13 000 residence permits to third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work , study or family .
when , for example , a fixed @-@ term residence permit was decided to be issued to 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , the number of Ita@@ lians was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the agencies cannot say how many migrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia , but such an analysis will be drawn up by the Ministry of the Interior .
when nearly 500 Ukrainians were home to Estonia ten years ago , in recent years , this figure will close to 2 000 .
the number of applicants for a residence permit rose dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis , with 10@@ 87 people receiving fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , up from 6@@ 75 in the previous year .
according to the statistical authority , the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing most in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than left .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has always been big in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already facing , &quot; said Kris@@ tin Ram@@ mus , the spokes@@ man at the Ministry of the Interior .
the number of long @-@ term resident Ukrainians , even higher than the number of Russian citizens , had been granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit , even though in 10 years the lon@@ gest @-@ term residence permits have been issued to the latter .
if the Ukrainians come to work mainly here , then Russian citizens for family migration .
&quot; given the historic Russian community here , they are more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said Hel@@ ina Me@@ ing , an internal protection institute .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen you look at where the citizens of Russia who have been granted Estonian residence permit have moved to live , Har@@ ju@@ maa is now Eastern Vir@@ u@@ land &apos; , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them have been mar@@ ried with a citizen of the European Union .
soil was granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 16@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased .
&quot; compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested for Estonia to be established permanently , &quot; the spokes@@ person at the Ministry of the Interior , Mr Ram@@ mus , explained that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia &apos;s residence permit has remained more stable for years .
the new residence permit for permanent entry into Estonia will allow foreigners who have lived here for at least three years to apply for the previous year .
it aims to encourage the eman@@ cip@@ ation of people who have been adapted .
however , a long @-@ term resident residence permit requires five years , for example .
for the new residence permit , the extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased .
for example , soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to change their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be able to point the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit was popular at the same time as the holders of a bad passport ( 10@@ 29 ) , Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , Indi@@ ans ( 54 ) and n@@ ig@@ er@@ ans ( 36 ) .
a total of 19@@ 68 people were able to live in Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and just as many Chinese .
with the first half of this year , the total number of such applicants is already 12@@ 69 .
in 10 years , surpris@@ ingly Nigeria has become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence .
when three residence permits were issued to Fin@@ ns in 2007 , soil was 200 .
Nigeria is coming to learn from this university .
higher education institutions in Estonia are also popular , for example , among Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely thanks to learning games .
for them , too , the rule applies that , where the community has come forward , there will be others more easily , &apos; added Ram@@ alla@@ h .
in ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , just as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit per year , this is about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if you look at the citizens of the European Union , migration will remain around a percentage , &quot; the Netherlands commented that the figures are actually low .
in total , 14 8@@ 22 people died in Estonia , according to the statistical office , 13 7@@ 92 .
this means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration .
most of those who move are Estonian citizens , but there are more of them among those who leave .
therefore , Estonian citizens &apos; migration balance with 2 000 people was in decline .
Est@@ oni@@ ans in particular mig@@ rate between Finland and Estonia .
M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture Pr@@ inc@@ s@@ sim@@ ood of C@@ ou@@ ture tri@@ cks with sa@@ ts , chic@@ k@@ ens and t@@ we@@ ed .
however , there is a history for Maria Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u - old pain@@ ts and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream for hours somewhere in the muse@@ um and ad@@ m@@ ire the thi@@ ev@@ es and cra@@ ts of the old era .
if you go a long way , you will study and learn more about it every day .
this is a joy of disco@@ very !
the world of M@@ ou@@ ture C@@ ou@@ ture can look like some living alien , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much you are in your life !
as a friend , I have a whole sa@@ il full of the w@@ ounds of cou@@ ture that I have created .
because , and it is not his fault that he does not live in Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ oo@@ s and does not go on a red bed every day , he wants to wear the most beautiful bro@@ kers , and he is suffering !
you can live your own life special !
the ar@@ tist does not recognise the gap between the sh@@ ining events and the grey day .
it was this reasoning that put the rolling stock into the countryside , between forests and fields in Estonia , into people who often do not reach the m@@ ood .
for example , a colle@@ gi@@ um was presented in comparison , J@@ even@@ vis and Per@@ lo mo@@ e@@ alle@@ el , where 45 mo@@ del@@ li Ro@@ yal de@@ fi@@ le@@ e filled the entire street .
in Tallinn , there is often a han@@ g in the shop , there is a sti@@ r of dignity , but there is more emo@@ tion elsewhere - s@@ log@@ vo , rising up , you want to be than@@ ked .
a large proportion of the audience had to be heard just now , but now they are the f@@ ans of M@@ ou@@ ture .
if you over@@ shoo@@ t people &apos;s expectations , they are spiri@@ ted !
and I like the feeling that I am with my mo@@ tive like the summer .
Per@@ nus had a 50 @-@ me@@ tre red car@@ pet , a whole @-@ way street full of stic@@ kers , it seemed that they would not come to an end !
Mrs Maria also does not recognise the mo@@ tive that animal creation must be presented by a super@@ sta@@ r , she is happy to bring ordinary women .
I often invite my own customers - they have always come with pleasure .
after all , this is the la@@ x of experience , the island of the ice cur@@ tain in a wonderful k@@ ni@@ fe !
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own perfor@@ man@@ ces , I am always behind the ground to give things the last meat as a hope@@ less player .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow a calm look on the floor .
Mrs Maria is this type of mo@@ el@@ o@@ gy , who wants not only to play a representative role , but to be involved in everything .
I have my sis@@ ter in the wind , most of the colle@@ ctions I myself carry out .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to find out .
I am never far from my nature and I am not afraid of work .
it is not limited , it is also a matter of injec@@ tion , logistics , organisation , organisation - everyone has to ju@@ mp off the day of a woman of one tem@@ per@@ ate .
for these hours of work , fana@@ tics are still suffering enormously .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a happy day !
I am still very lu@@ cky - it is like an un@@ stop@@ p@@ able jo@@ ke : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compli@@ ments .
it has been said many times that in my bro@@ kers there is a ma@@ gy - they make themselves feel like a printing ta@@ il .
the gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ ous t@@ reas@@ ure that Maria talent made known overnight has long since remained a C@@ ou@@ ture signal to date .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p U@@ 18 boys : weapons of al@@ ag@@ ru@@ pi@@ tur@@ ni@@ pe for Est@@ oni@@ ans were now turned against us .
the damage , the fair@@ y@@ tale , ran out .
the first thing was that we could not get in our hands .
and when there is such a big difference in the table , there is nothing to do &apos; , Estonia commented on U@@ 18 cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ po@@ ts 61 : 75 falling to Britain , our only cor@@ v@@ pal@@ te , BC Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ sel .
opponents took 28 Pal@@ ace from the tsunami and were so much more assa@@ ul@@ ted as a result .
we were also not prepared to protect them agg@@ ressi@@ vely , nor to attack them ; it created it .
many of the attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
in defence , however , they managed to keep their hands in hand everywhere , we could not combine .
it created the team from its feet .
the work of the opponents was better done .
according to M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ pa &apos;s estimates , Estonia should have made more tac@@ tical mistakes in order to withdraw the anti @-@ missile season .
the last quarter - we had zero error , but the opponents have already received a number of quick records .
In@@ ad@@ missi@@ bility and a heavy offensive , which was our weapon on the al@@ ag@@ ru@@ pi@@ tur@@ ni@@ r , all now turned against us .
today we did not have the strength against their aggressive behaviour .
the M@@ y@@ r@@ hin@@ t remained satisfied with his neg@@ ligent Kal@@ ev@@ is , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s .
security in general can say good words about the whole team , so far there was a single shock .
it is a pity that such an aggressive response had not been met before .
T@@ as@@ s has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but it seemed that he was ti@@ red - he has borne quite a heavy burden .
but he made some quite nice ges@@ tures , which I have seen in the past in the tr@@ en@@ ches , adding a men@@ tor .
hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous figures : the E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ r , in the cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ tion of ne@@ ps , thre@@ w less than 10 points ...
the U@@ 18 age classes do not apply only to the young men &apos;s emi B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ tur@@ ni@@ ir in Tallinn , who started in Dublin the day after yesterday .
and Estonia &apos;s game with Poland was , unfortunately , in the area of anti @-@ qu@@ eu@@ es .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , there was 9 : 49 , or only in the last ten minutes , opponents took their feet from the gas beet and 16 : 16 .
in both the first and the second quarter , Estonia du@@ mped 4 , third point 1 ...
at the same time , in the first two minutes , two pieces were caught by the Est@@ oni@@ ans in the first two minutes , but then 25 pieces of play , then one y@@ el@@ low , and then another 21 te@@ ars ...
perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 fin@@ gers were tab@@ oo .
in addition , 2 points came from four free wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths .
the losses were a reasonable figure of this time , 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland had 33 fin@@ alists and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , while on the opening day , 83 Portuguese people had to be admitted : 56 .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement the stocks
today , NATO &apos;s 1 permanent mine group arrived for a weekend in Tallinn for a planned port visit in order to supplement vessels &apos; stocks and prepare for prospe@@ ctive practices .
during the visit , ships are preparing for the landing of the sea and , at the same time , giving cre@@ ws the possibility of a pa@@ ro@@ gue holiday .
following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in the waters of Estonia in order to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations in search of historic explo@@ sive rem@@ nan@@ ts .
&quot; the participation of Est@@ oni@@ ans in the NATO unit and the co @-@ oper@@ ative training they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the alli@@ ed forces , &quot; said Ar@@ to Rein@@ land , the chief of the Operation and Planning Department in the Com@@ man@@ der of the overseas fleet .
since 29 June , NATO will head a permanent delegation of mines from the Latvian Na@@ vy Cap@@ tain , G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , who took over the tasks of the group at a ceremony in Riga from the Estonian naval officers Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as Sel@@ ja@@ b .
the group &apos;s flagship ship is L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , a Latvian naval support vessel , which also operates as a group leader .
this semester , too , includes the Estonian na@@ vy &apos;s mine hun@@ t and Sakharov .
as one of the four groups of vessels subject to the NATO naval board , NATO is the 1 permanent mine group of primary rapid reaction teams , which may be sent to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - On 13 August , the P@@ iri@@ ta mon@@ as@@ tery &apos;s mu@@ tu@@ aries will once again become a place where Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , launched 13 years ago by Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ Children , will be held down .
this year , Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val will be a beautiful , powerful and unprecedented , according to the artistic leader of the city of Tal@@ har@@ onia , Mr J@@ oo@@ sti ( 36 ) .
risk to J@@ oo@@ st : the &apos; Tra@@ vi@@ ita &apos; and &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; clas@@ s@@ room , bal@@ le@@ ti@@ la@@ replies from B@@ ole@@ ro@@ st , &apos; Kar@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ in &apos; , and there is also no shortage of own production of the scheme , this time Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ n &apos;s wonderful or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra &apos; , by the same international team of creators who brought him to the P@@ iri@@ y@@ la@@ h in 2015 .
Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has much more than just concer@@ ts and theat@@ re answers .
this is higher than any music theat@@ re in its normal form .
it is a festi@@ val whose s@@ now takes power and never gets rid of it .
because the experience that the lis@@ ten@@ er receives in this sup@@ erior and sal@@ va@@ ble environment puts human sou@@ ls ring@@ ing and touches on human beings in a way that cannot be described .
risk , you are the first anniversary of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val &apos;s art leader .
did the Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ Children &apos;s sho@@ es not feel a little big ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been very helpful .
he went through me all my student career and also supported the restoration career at the beginning .
perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work .
in K@@ las , the team of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has had so much ch@@ arity and , of course , all of this goes to me .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going .
it was precisely the great heart of E@@ ri K@@ ars that gave me the strength to go ahead very well with Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val in Tallinn .
and here I am and I can do it !
what could the audience at today &apos;s festi@@ val become , what are you offering in particular ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , as a surprise , the first bal@@ le@@ tt written on by Mrs L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i comes to presentation , among other things .
it is &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson l@@ b &apos; .
and one criminal nu@@ ance of this is that the author of this bal@@ le@@ t is the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser , J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ inning , who himself expressed a desire to write this act .
apparently she has already had a car@@ a@@ ture of Kar@@ l@@ sson , who has already lived in the b@@ reat@@ h of her child .
at the risk , how are you che@@ ering all of this ?
it is certainly thanks to my life partners who support me .
such work requires a system of support and a lot of love , and I am lu@@ cky to have it .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tion does not depend so much on other people as I myself , in other words , how I am going against every new day .
and this awareness of keeping the tone , keeping it positive and actually s@@ mil@@ ing ourselves into the mir@@ ror of the morning has greatly increased my happy percentage .
especially now this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen on it and it works .
na@@ ming itself acts as an act of a@@ mus@@ ing and raising the tone .
that is simply not a word .
I think people are not yet aware of the body that the univer@@ se offers them , but each of them will discover it slowly .
now , this is an important moment .
is there also a ri@@ tual before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di powder is taken ?
there are still , clothing must be replaced against more comfortable ones .
this is a small moment for ourselves .
but , generally speaking , I do not have the opportunity to pu@@ mp or make a small stra@@ w before I speak .
in fact , I even like to talk actively to people , even before di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di@@ um takes place .
but come to Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , what is also to be discovered here is not a particularly big operator and a bal@@ le@@ t friend .

new results of tests on the age of Swedish asylum applicants have been published
in Sweden , the latest results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the constitu@@ tions were assessed older than 18 , but not all believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for medicine ( R@@ asy@@ ts@@ mutilation in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started with tests at the beginning of this year .
the tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of the age during the asylum application after the Swedish Authority for Migration ( I@@ OM ) criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly juven@@ ile refugees .
up to now , 68 8@@ 80 cases have been sent to the tests by mig@@ ver and 24 81 tests have been issued by the Institute for Justice between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July 2017 .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 years old or older , and in 25 more cases , the Institute of Justice assessed that the test &quot; may be 18 years old . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , it was concluded that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
tests will only be used if the age of the person is questioned .
according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son , who works in the Institute of Justice , the results are consistent compared with those of previous months .
&quot; we do not see a big difference compared to the statistics of previous months , the figures are quite consistent , &quot; he said to the newspaper The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have chosen their age .
the Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that , in 4@@ 42 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person studied is 18 years old or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson ska Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the results of their 581 test , it became clear that in 2@@ 43 cases , a person had declared directly that he would receive 18 this year .
this medical age assessment method , whereby smart th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic r@@ ö@@ n@@ t@@ gen@@ i@@ ters and fields MR@@ T are carried out , has been criticised in some quarters .
one of the sceptics is the endo@@ k@@ rin@@ olo@@ gist of the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute , Claude Mar@@ cus , whose tasks include assessing people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through the audience sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement method currently being used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say firmly , we should not pretend to be able , &apos; he said forestry to the newspaper .
but Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son , from the Institute for medicine , defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that the risk of leaving the child in@@ appropriately into adul@@ th@@ ood is low .
the biggest risk , or around 10 % , is if you are a little under 18 . &quot;
9 indications that you could for@@ give you more de@@ arly .
you were more expensive on Friday and spent a night with someone else .
the summer is painful , because you have so many nice times and memor@@ ies together .
I would like to for@@ give him , but is it time ...
Y@@ our Tan@@ go lists nine signs which show that you regret and can for@@ give him more expensive .
it seems more expensive to understand the seriousness of the situation and to work hard to resolve it .
it is more expensive to deal with the problem that led it to a second @-@ hand bed bed .
pay is no longer in a defen@@ sive position .
he sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for his actions .
he is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
he agrees that he has made a serious mistake and genuinely tries to improve the situation .
he is attentive and he is trying to communicate with you with pleasure .
at the same time , without pressure , he is rus@@ hing to get you through .
they are not denying what has happened , nor are they trying to make it un@@ noticed .
it is more expensive for you and for you to understand why your in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ence came about .
you talk about this , and also about how to avoid it in the future .
you need to communicate better and assess each other &apos;s needs .
your more expensive attitude and actions have helped you to develop our condolences against his mis@@ carriage .
a more expensive commitment and behaviour have created the basis for your proximity to be restored .
you have made progress as a couple to believe again in your unity and your relationship .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old new@@ er , Anna Maria O@@ rel , made a beautiful debate in London with 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7 places of good 18 .
after that , M@@ M no@@ ori@@ m was a female j@@ ung@@ le , and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for med@@ als in the future .
the contest went well and gained a good experience .
with the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , I immediately took advantage of my average result , the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) risk too much and the third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) I was able to keep it very clear , &quot; said O@@ rel after the contest .
I chose my emissions , and I am very pleased that I found it .
Anna Maria O@@ re@@ li M@@ M &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 seats .
Vi@@ h@@ mas@@ ad@@ u O@@ reli@@ t did not mix because he is after all training him through the TEC stage .
&apos;@@ I am afraid &apos; , he said a little bit more .
the London Olympic Games had almost a full house of the people , did O@@ rel have people around themselves , or were they able to turn themselves off ?
I was Mr Tajani , but in a positive sense .
everyone says it adds - that is the case !
if you compete yourself , you can experience it .
he then confirmed that he will be satisfied with the M@@ M debate and he is still waiting for a lot of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 3@@ 2nd outcome of this season , the last outcome of which is the last one , I finished in 18 places .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and M@@ il - that is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of the med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina ku@@ ber@@ ner announced party change
the Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ a , that he would change political parties .
&apos;@@ L@@ et it or not , but the democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I say to you , having than@@ ked you hard and thought for ... today , I say to you , the West must , that I can no longer help you as a democratic Governor . &quot;
explanations of joy were g@@ rub@@ bed in the mi@@ xing .
so I will be Re@@ publi@@ can , &apos; added Justice &apos; tomorrow .
&quot; as a engine@@ er , I would say to you that it is time to play another game . &quot;
the T@@ ru@@ mp had previously promised a big announcement at the gathering of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
T@@ ru@@ mp won 42 points in Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
Justice , which is the only billion sta@@ r in the state , according to For@@ ter@@ ford , was elected in 2016 .
Ford notes that it has coal mines in five states and that it has a coal business from its own father .
his value is approximately USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday evening , the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) published a statement that &apos; Governor Justice &apos;s party exchange is yet another blow to a democratic par@@ ade that would prevent the country from improving again rather than working for it &apos; .
&apos;@@ A mere 15 months of enqu@@ iry and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent wake @-@ up to a par@@ ade that is out of the beginning and cannot find a positive and united message , &apos; said R@@ N@@ C representation , R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ Daniel C@@ B@@ S New@@ si in his statement .
it is hardly surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
Ur@@ met , who is in the medical tent on the We@@ ek@@ ise , told the girl yesterday that pos@@ ters had had to be distributed quite a lot .
Vil@@ ls and mar@@ bles are fundamental , ex@@ cus@@ es and light cras@@ hes .
of course , also the main , ab@@ sen@@ tia and foot@@ wear .
according to Ur@@ me@@ ti , visitors come to the festi@@ val with false foot@@ wear , and so there are problems .
the media have also had to help a few visitors with major injuries - there have been some s@@ care@@ mon@@ gering and also one piece of foot@@ wear .
we have also made c@@ r@@ è@@ ches when someone has pul@@ led the hand or the finger .
we are doing less here , we are sending a hospital more .
see the video as to whether the brak@@ es on the media for the treatment of po@@ ta@@ ble@@ t are also asking for a pain@@ kil@@ ler .
Co@@ e praised the Russians for their fair apolo@@ gies for the anti @-@ doping scandal .
the international r@@ ally of the Ker@@ ge@@ an , S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , praised , according to his words , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apolo@@ gy &apos; for the doping scandal , but repeated that now is not the time to allow sport back to the country .
at the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World C@@ up , the Russian fri@@ vol@@ ous comp@@ ound , D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lit@@ h@@ tin , said that the competition ban imposed on his country was right and has a firm aim to combat doping .
he apolog@@ ised &apos; from all ligh@@ ters who have been cut off the gol@@ den and sil@@ ver med@@ als in competitions &apos; .
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on competition in force since the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) report found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia in November 2015 .
&quot; I think it was a very honest response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Costa to journalists .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself acknowledged that they had had had rather difficult times and that they are doing their utmost to reform the al@@ union . &quot;
he was also pleased , according to Co@@ e , that Russia accepted the criteria for its own rein@@ statement .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the proposal of the working group that this is not the time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything possible in the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean spor@@ ts@@ people from the system that has been breached , &quot; he added .
Eigh@@ teen Russian ligh@@ ters who meet the strict criteria of IA@@ AF will compete as neutral ath@@ le@@ tes at the World C@@ up in London on Friday .
on Monday , R@@ une Andersson , head of the IA@@ AF Group , said that Russia did not yet meet several criteria for rein@@ statement .
following a presentation to the IA@@ AF Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that trained engineers who have been banned are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution makes a significant difference to the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
little because the electric car revolution makes a significant difference from the fuel market to infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although mining gi@@ ants like G@@ len@@ core can say that they will win from one place and lose another , smaller mining companies will not help .
G@@ len@@ core coal and oil are currently serving , but in the era of electric cars , the demand for co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ kel will increase .
this year , governments in the United Kingdom , France and Norway have contributed to the proliferation of electric cars , which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades .
therefore , Vol@@ vo has already known that he is planning to abandon an internal combustion engine , and T@@ es@@ la is bringing cheaper bread 3 electric cars onto the market .
B@@ animal berg New Energy Finance forecasts predict that over two decades electric cars will be sold more than cars using oil @-@ produced fuels .
&quot; with regard to some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ in B@@ ee@@ ber@@ g , Capital Economics &apos;s raw material analysis .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as co@@ balt and li@@ thi@@ um , which have been growing demand for years .
electric cars have approximately three times more cop@@ ies than the conventional car , declaring G@@ len@@ core .
even more answers are needed at charging stations , which is why Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that it will increase demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ gan@@ ans .
G@@ len@@ core will benefit from a growing trend in the price of electric cars and from the fact that there is the largest co@@ balt producer in the world , predicted by the J@@ eff@@ itative Group .
according to this bro@@ ker company , the winners of the second electric car race are F@@ re@@ export @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ mas Min@@ er@@ als .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of the London me@@ tal stock exchange line has lan@@ ded .
soil prices were 37 % .
the answer has also been 14 % this year , mainly due to economic growth .
G@@ len@@ core excise duty rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price rise to the ri@@ val Rio T@@ oni@@ p Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ oni and Ang@@ lo Guard .
on the side of the losers , lead companies such as Rec@@ y@@ ht@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine are companies that have to adapt to the new era .
the main end @-@ use of the P@@ L is the bat@@ teries supplying the start @-@ up of cars with petrol and diesel engines .
electric cars use flow@@ ers .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael W@@ id@@ mer , the Governor of the Bank of America Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ ch , who analysed the metal@@ lic market .
the effect of a generous trend in price formation has not yet been noticed .
P@@ li@@ i has been fishing 17 % this year , with it being the best me@@ tal in London for the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems for metals in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition , &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the manufacturer of the me@@ tal bro@@ ker Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ s .
if lead demand falls , it will be slow .
this may be the case in about ten years &apos; time .
in the meantime , stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which are often dependent on advanced lead @-@ based bat@@ teries at the launch of engines , will be assessed by international lead and by the organisation of inquiry .
light metals such as alu@@ mini@@ um are replaced by steel , as a ligh@@ ter car can go further with less electricity .
this explains an additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes between 2013 and 2016 .
it accounts for 2.7 % of the world &apos;s output of alu@@ mini@@ um .
this trend is likely to grow , says W@@ id@@ mer .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um has reached 13 % this year , as rising demand from car manufacturers has led to market shortages .
steel producers do not .
ak S@@ hal@@ ding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce wonderful car lights .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal is also trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down from Europe to oppose the minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris &apos;s analysis , Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to pla@@ ice .
soil took about half of this precious me@@ tal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , announced the me@@ tal fin@@ er Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ teries .
&quot; many of the raw materials currently facing high demand , such as oil and pla@@ te , may not have a high demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ makers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , leader of the Un@@ core , said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 .
in the 10 @-@ year perspective , the great hope of the Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ at@@ ine manufacturers is that To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ mun@@ i Mo@@ to@@ si have been developed on hydrogen @-@ based cars that depend on a pla@@ te in order to generate electricity from hydrogen .
so far , however , this technology has not yet commercially justified itself .
&quot; it seems to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P from Paris to Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers suffered a major set@@ back in July , as the S@@ tut@@ t@@ gar@@ t court banned diesel in the home city of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how financial rules for football affect Ney@@ ra &apos;s transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the ram@@ pan@@ t spending of European football clubs do not prevent the world @-@ wide shift of Ney@@ ra from the Spanish football club in the French club Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequence from UEFA , the steering Board , which domin@@ ates the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in the market movement of the pres@@ ti@@ gious League of Me@@ is@@ Ministers , is still ahead of Paris to Saint @-@ Ger@@ May .
the financial rules on fair play ( F@@ F@@ P ) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that the PS@@ G must prove at some point that the transition to Ney@@ ra was financed without huge losses .
EUR 2@@ 22 million ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) was paid to Barcelona for the fact that the Brazili@@ ans were able to buy out of his contract , and the salary of Ney@@ ra will reach tens of millions of dollars per year .
here are some financial aspects of moving to the French club of Ney@@ ra .
there is no doubt that the PS@@ G will be able to get such money out for the recruitment of Ney@@ ra and to include its sta@@ rs in the clo@@ ak , given that the team will be funded by the family governing the Ka@@ tar power plant .
clubs have been allowed to spend a great deal on recru@@ iting players , but they have to balance this with legal sources of income that enable them to come out of them in football .
F@@ F@@ F@@ P was set up by Michel Pla@@ tini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs that fall into debt in search of success would actually deal with fraud and risk sw@@ ind@@ ling if banks or owners were to give up support .
from 2011 , the F@@ F@@ P will focus on monitoring these losses instead of the debts of clubs .
this change means that the business model that Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch first used in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ sea - buying a club with potential and then spending heavily to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of F@@ F@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs may suffer losses of up to EUR 30 million .
and despite the fact that Pla@@ tini was dismissed in 2015 with shame from the presidential office , his successor , Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , remains committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; F@@ F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is the guardian of UEFA @-@ s F@@ F@@ P last week .
although the PS@@ G ta@@ tus for the over@@ purchase clause in Ney@@ ra is one integrated payment , they will be able to distribute this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the agreement .
Mr Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , so it will be possible to demonstrate a transitional fee of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
for the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G , together with Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga from Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , received the most severe penalties .
a fine of EUR 60 million was imposed on the PS@@ G ( USD 82 million at the moment ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million , and a club called for the crew of the League of Me@@ is@@ Ministers to be restricted to 21 players during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of the normal 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to over@@ sha@@ ke the regulatory authorities by ex@@ posing their income through companies linked to the owners of the club .
the Ka@@ tar company may spon@@ sor the PS@@ G , but if the value of spon@@ sorship is considered to exceed standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as a formal income .
this was the case in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of Q@@ a@@ tar Tourism PS@@ G &apos;s support was blow@@ ed up .
it has been said that certain parts of the Flemish PS@@ G service may come from Q@@ a@@ tar through contributions from the World C@@ up Board of 20@@ 22 .
however , the PS@@ G and Q@@ a@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ ra could become a member of the World C@@ up and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities are easily able to expose such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on the PS@@ G mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition pro @-@ actively with the PS@@ G .
they talked to The Taliban , provided that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , because they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PS@@ G .
the latest reports show that the PS@@ G earned more than € 10 million in profits during the 2015 @-@ 2016 season at around € 54@@ 2.4 million .
data from the last financial year have not yet been published .
the PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ ra will have a positive impact on spon@@ sorship transactions , trade and s@@ nus .
the club expects an increase of at least 30 % in turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract .
Spain too , having clearly irri@@ tated the departure of one of the largest football sta@@ rs , tried to block the transition of Ney@@ ra , claiming that the PS@@ G would breach F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with the club and with the state , &quot; said CoR President Javier T@@ eb@@ as AS to the Spanish newspaper , referring to the fact that the PS@@ G belongs mainly to Q@@ a@@ tar .
Ar@@ sen@@ al mä@@ ne@@ j@@ er Ar@@ ţ@@ W@@ en@@ ger , a club belonging to the American sports mag@@ na@@ ge , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights and it has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to the state , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a major player in the country . &quot;

together with the extension of Christianity &apos;s operational geograph@@ y , there has also been an increase in the number of people who have earned their place on the plane .

today 50 years ago : the unprecedented storm in Estonia , which was kno@@ cking on houses and win@@ dows .
this hur@@ ric@@ ane of the century , which , on 6 and 7 August , caused great damage , particularly to the West , Har@@ ju@@ ria and the Black Sea .
in the north @-@ west of Estonia , over 30 m / s were on the wind during these days .
in my old drink in Ba@@ vari@@ a , a bot@@ tle from a map to another , and a match with the hands to support them .
everything was blind and mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous , such as the world stage .
T@@ aa@@ mal has already l@@ ent ro@@ of@@ s from houses , in 2002 , a magaz@@ ine from the old Mrs L@@ inda K@@ uro@@ va Ha@@ va@@ va was recalled by Estonian nature in an interview .
L@@ inda hus@@ band saw his lo@@ ved t@@ reas@@ ure collapsed .
but what are you going to do with your hands , where are you going to fight such a storm ?
the sea came under the window , from win@@ dows in the water &apos; , Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us Kal@@ da , who lived on the streets , spoke of Mrs L@@ inda then .
the fact that the roads were full and that the operation of the railway station had been flying to 20 @-@ 30 metres , L@@ inda most shar@@ k sto@@ res , just like next morning .
according to the local authorities , the cages behind Par@@ ale@@ pa were lagging behind , some were completely fu@@ n , some were boys .
everyone saw very de@@ pressing , the storm went through beautiful old trees as ra@@ g@@ ina and pragmatism like a war .
Western Vir@@ u@@ land was not particularly badly affected in August 1967 compared to Western Estonia , but the losses were high there , the Vir@@ u@@ maa Official Journal wrote in 2007 .
Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ u L@@ fossil Par@@ k and P@@ ad@@ ise Par@@ k were swe@@ pt away from the ground , but our cab@@ in par@@ ks were also severely affected .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured at speeds of up to 35 metres per second , or around 130 kilometres per hour .
in Tallinn , M@@ eri@@ expression , on the evening of 6.@@ August , one of the few lead ca@@ ts had sh@@ ou@@ ted : &apos; mother , mother !
the channel is in the air and will no longer be signed ! &quot; wrote Vir@@ u@@ maa Journal .
at the time of the storm , the Bu@@ il@@ ding of the generation in Vil@@ j@@ an@@ di@@ land was so terri@@ fied that it was subsequently decided to be disman@@ tled .
the August pipeline was not opposed to the design of the T@@ ü@@ ri &apos;s ski moun@@ tains , which were later not restored .
on 12 August 19@@ 57 , the newspaper Red T@@ uro@@ t wrote that the restoration of towns and settlements from land@@ locked trees and their vehicles is progressing slowly , and the population could be involved in cor@@ ro@@ gation works .
crops were also severely affected in Tu@@ rin , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party organisations must be an incentive and a gu@@ ide@@ line for both cor@@ ps and fer@@ tility harves@@ ts &apos; .
Or@@ ka@@ des can be talked about if the average wind speed exceeds 3@@ 2.7 m / s .
the water@@ shed wind in Estonia will remain on 2 November 19@@ 69 , when Ru@@ h@@ nu@@ l was measured at 48 m / s .
the island of V@@ ain@@ d@@ story broke a me@@ tre , so it was not possible to register exactly the speed of the strong wind that was measured .
secret of holiday be@@ aches : night cleaning and poor coastal weather
cold summer weather also means less cor@@ ro@@ tation in the be@@ aches of Tallinn .
&apos;@@ I@@ f there is no , people are on the coast and , if not , there are no people &apos; , there is a cor@@ man@@ der .
in the S@@ tro@@ om of the city of Northern Tallinn , the camer@@ as are pre@@ da@@ tory .
they are offered by a me@@ chan@@ ical tra@@ ctor on low turns of competition , which is falling behind the pla@@ tin@@ um .
in fact , the last seven @-@ cent goes through the dep@@ ths , pic@@ king it out of sea lit@@ ter and people &apos;s shel@@ ved risk : bot@@ tles , cigarettes and so on .
people are still coming to ran@@ k , regardless of whether the water is warm or not .
if it is beautiful , then people are on the coast , and if there are no people , then there are no people , &apos; the management of the private company Ha@@ ab@@ er@@ sti will be said by Alexander U@@ so@@ v , the head of the cor@@ ro@@ gation works .
there are 6.@@ 30 p.m. , and there is a bitter ho@@ le on the coast , because at 8 o &apos;@@ clock a pla@@ te must be in order for the people .
it is already at four o &apos;@@ clock .
apart from S@@ tro@@ om , he is still keeping an eye on the coast of P@@ iri@@ ta , Har@@ ku La@@ ke , Ka@@ ku@@ mä@@ e and Pal@@ ar@@ a@@ are P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ari .
landfill amounts have fallen .
years ago , it was much more .
people can now already assess what is being done for them , &quot; says U@@ so@@ v , who has harves@@ ted the migrants for 15 years .
before it was the case that , when something new was defe@@ ated , it had already been broken next day .
now , what is on the coast is already being kept .
price of clean be@@ ach
one of the biggest works in the Estonian be@@ aches is the repetition of the rub@@ b@@ ish , known as ad@@ ru .
for example , on the coast of P@@ iri@@ ta , 400 000 tonnes have to be ship@@ ped from this coastal season .
&apos;@@ This is an incredible amount &apos; , marks U@@ so@@ v .
another large category is municipal waste , that is , all that people are leaving behind .
there are eight large @-@ scale rub@@ b@@ ish sein@@ ers at a semi @-@ kilometre in S@@ tro@@ om , which need to be emp@@ ted three times a week .
so much is created by rub@@ b@@ ish .
however , cold summer weather has meant that rub@@ b@@ ish is a fifth less than otherwise .
the third species are abandoned .
these are mostly children &apos;s TV spots .
this time , U@@ so@@ v has pul@@ led out of the sand ten metres of slu@@ dge .
they remain waiting for owners to go down the underground wood route .
&quot; they usually come out more , but this is normal harves@@ ts , &quot; and it is already well known that it will soon find them again in the sand .
children come to ran@@ k and take toys to bur@@ n them into the sand again .
landfill is broken down
Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler , the spokes@@ man for administrative services , admitted that the work of the tra@@ ctor is disrup@@ ting local life .
noise , which runs from night to night hours , is disrup@@ ting the people living in the neighbourhood .
on the day , however , this work is impossible .
in one month , the rand has to go through twice .
&quot; if we do not do so , we will be fined by the urban section , &quot; Sch@@ ol@@ ler notes .
however , like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ari and Per@@ sian , the aim is to get S@@ tro@@ om rand below the quality of the international flag .
&quot; compared to Europe , there is much more work in Estonia to care for be@@ aches , &quot; says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more ad@@ ru , more ki@@ ds and more difficult to go to the sand .
but there is less rub@@ b@@ ish in our be@@ aches than elsewhere in Europe .
when we hear that there is talk of rub@@ b@@ ish , Martin , living near S@@ tro@@ om be@@ aches , takes an un@@ soli@@ cited inter@@ lo@@ cu@@ tor of journalists and cor@@ ro@@ gation workers , highlighting current weaknesses .
there is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is with birds and wood sla@@ ves , who have pul@@ led the rub@@ b@@ ish bags down &apos; , Martin says .
although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the rub@@ b@@ ish and , for example , put them on the ro@@ of@@ s in order to prevent at least birds from going on there .
in general , however , Martin S@@ tro@@ om &apos;s be@@ aches is satisfied with developments .
we can see that the city is taking care of this .
it has become more pleasant with children &apos;s fields , enligh@@ tened and newly as@@ ph@@ alt roads .
it was once the case that only one way could be travelled on the ground , &quot; Martin notes .
findings of the village in S@@ tro@@ om@@ is : coins , only coins
a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Dimit@@ ri , who , as a ar@@ bi@@ ter , is sa@@ iling the coast@@ line with a me@@ tal me@@ tal me@@ tal , has had to be exploited .
he does not believe that , today or in the future , he will find anything worthwhile .
sea ang@@ els are not generous enough to do so .
&quot; I have been working on this for one year and I have not found anything worthwhile so far , &quot; says D@@ mit@@ ry .
as a ref@@ rig@@ eration , in D@@ mit@@ ry , there are some euro coins , bot@@ tles and also dangerous p@@ ounds in the Mun@@ ici@@ pality of D@@ mit@@ ry , which are later thrown in the dus@@ t@@ b@@ in .
normally there are still coins .
&quot; culture , fin@@ gers and so on are not usually the case , &quot; says the island &apos;s fuel .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level as weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have sof@@ tened speculation in relation to the increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain a lo@@ opho@@ le , as household incomes have put interest rates on hold .
policy makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MP@@ C ) voted 6 : 2 for 0.@@ 25 % retention and fewer members this month demand an increase because slow growth has weakened support .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank cut its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in rates is necessary to contain inflation from Bre@@ x@@ on over the next few years , and that the expected increase in lending costs on the financial markets could be necessary .
Members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package on the economy , which was launched in Bre@@ x@@ t .
in February , the Bank will put an end to the fixed @-@ term finance scheme , which will provide banks with cheap funding , even though it said that it is now up to GBP 15 billion to go ahead with this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; GDP ( GDP ) will remain gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the near future , as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
as regards the rates , it was reiterated that some &apos; fiscal policy effort &apos; was needed to alleviate inflation , and this &apos; somewhat higher &apos; than is expected in the markets .
the Eurosta@@ rs is currently predi@@ cting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any benefit is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
the forecast for 1.8 % growth in 2018 remained .
after this news , the p@@ ound fell against the dollar and the euro .
women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.@@ 31 and 0.@@ 4 % to EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to growing hopes of an increase in the GDP ratio from 0.2 % in the second quarter to 0.@@ 3 % in the previous three months .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will start to boost a little .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave little reason to re@@ jo@@ ice households suffering from rising inflation and ab@@ ject wage increases , saying that the situation will go a little worse before improving .
it was added that monetary policy could not prevent income shocks in the next few years , but a significant recovery is expected towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
the heavy p@@ ound also encourages the economy to increase demand for British produce , partly compensa@@ ting consumers for lower costs .
the decision will come one year after the fall last August at 0.@@ 25 % after the shocking EU referendum , which caused a sudden weakening of the p@@ ound .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to fully brea@@ the life into prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last decision , there was a growing demand for an increase in the rate , as inflation had increased pressure on hard households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected and is expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excess growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak p@@ ound .
Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , govern@@ or of Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ ga@@ ges , said : &apos; in view of the recent downturn in exchange rates , the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again , as creditors are losing their jobs and hoping to finish the year in a positive way .
the Böge exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as re@@ financing , often without service and at a low rate , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS announ@@ ces HIV medi@@ cation for 10 000 people in conflict
patients will have access to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; treatment for HIV prevention since September , following the battle against whether the N@@ HS should finance the medicine .
N@@ HS England announced that public health will now make an estimated 10 000 people available for an initial three @-@ year clinical trial - a pre @-@ posi@@ tioning officer ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t that is man@@ ned before the interim procedure and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people by around 86 % .
the N@@ HS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported the ruling of the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS is able to pay for Pr@@ EP , despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Simon Ste@@ 3.2 , Executive Director of N@@ HS Eng@@ land , welcomed the launch announced on Thursday as &apos; new swee@@ ping intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as &apos; momen@@ t@@ ous moment &apos; .
sexual health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ l and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to register people , and in October , there will be further clin@@ ics before the programme is introduced anywhere in England by April 2018 .
exposure to HIV infections is a pre @-@ pre@@ phy@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) , which will be taken before the incident in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV to people at risk of infection .
Pr@@ EP before taking a break means that there are sufficient quantities of medicines in the human body that prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure .
the right candidates include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are HIV @-@ infected and do not receive treatment .
respondents identify suitable people willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate in a local sexual health clin@@ ics in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and N@@ HS England signed an agreement to get medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the clinical test aims to assess the true potential of Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who is treated and how it is consumed and implemented in a large cloud .
Ste@@ eda said : &apos; this new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and intensify a comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
this is another milestone in the fight against one of mankind &apos;s greatest health problems for more than three decades . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , Chief Executive of NA@@ T , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
the Pr@@ EP , if it is properly targeted at those who need it and belong to risk groups , offers an opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic .
since September , people with a high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool which is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with a partner , thereby improving many lives , through this clinical attempt funded by the N@@ HS .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian Green , Executive Director of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Foundation , said : &apos; now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is quickly launched and that no member of the HIV risk group is excluded .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been obtained , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
the Minister for Public Health , Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , said : &apos; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the cen@@ sus of government sho@@ es .
evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will bring us a step closer to full understanding of the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
it is now important that a clinical trial is put in place as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV and to move us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.@@ 94 compared to € 7.@@ 71 in June this year , announced by Ele@@ ring .
the main cause of the price gap is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , the average electricity price for electricity was EUR 34.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ tt hour last month and the price increased by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania the price fell by five percentage points to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ tt hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 17 and the Nord Stream systemic price of electricity exchanges was EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t @-@ hour .
prices rose by 12 and 7 % respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity was moving from 75 % last month to Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine % of the hours between the two countries did not happen next day .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity reached 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the hours were used by all transmission capacity .
according to transactions in the Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X market on the last July trading day , the price of electricity in August could be approximately 34 and EUR 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour in September .
the price of carbon dioxide , which is affecting the price of electricity production , came up last month and transactions were worth 5.@@ 04 @-@ 5.@@ 47 per tonne .
living in higher life - half @-@ order and smart de@@ sig@@ ners have turned it into a house for the small Ear@@ ls Court of Justice .
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker who is a passion@@ ate building innova@@ tor , changed his home of the Grand K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in 2014 against the Ear@@ ls Court Cor@@ ter .
it is based on the first order of Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ ţ@@ i , and the fact that Jo@@ anne has not pac@@ ked her bags and sold the fla@@ ts has been a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived on much higher soil , together with a former life com@@ pass in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tanta@@ mount to the price I have offered .
I was shown this by the Ear@@ ls Court Cor@@ ter and had the same high waves .
I knew about it and I made an offer on the same day . &quot;
since its first visit , this 93 @-@ me@@ tre cor@@ ps has passed a full innovation gap .
at the beginning , it was a s@@ lee@@ ping flat and a complex sta@@ r - a kit@@ chen had to be s@@ le@@ ep in order to reach a s@@ lee@@ ping pi@@ pe ; Jo@@ anne wanted to add savings and qu@@ asi @-@ order to exploit high levels of talent .
&quot; I wanted high , big win@@ dows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he is asking Er@@ fan Az@@ ad N@@ ot@@ ting for the architecture and de@@ sig@@ ner of Du@@ ck &amp; shed to take advantage of the 3.@@ 8 m e@@ ars and to create a home that is not just a development site , but a place where Jo@@ anne can live .
it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create a qu@@ asi @-@ order in which to stand .
the Er@@ fan had to approach things in a creative way .
&quot; Me@@ tal@@ l@@ construction is quite complex , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise the premises so that they are located on each other , without having to bo@@ w to each other .
it was not just about building a platform , but about using steel design to ensure that both the upper and lower space is right . &quot;
this emphasis allowed Mrs Er@@ fan@@ i to create two full @-@ blo@@ wn fla@@ ts with many dramatic elements in the room .
a half @-@ way street will be opened up from the old @-@ fashi@@ oned R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us window to the gla@@ ci@@ ers &apos; surface .
the gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ spe@@ ct Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille &apos;s light highlight the style of space .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in the addition of theat@@ re , space and traffic lights .
at both stages of a short corridor , mir@@ rors have been added to enable it to appear longer .
in K@@ night , the mir@@ ror is giving the impression of a second @-@ tu@@ p window .
in the course of the exercise , the cen@@ tre@@ piece of care for all Jo@@ anne &apos;s eating ri@@ des and glass requirements is a reflection .
housing is accompanied by a false opportunity to close the vegetables if it is not used , creating a more den@@ se space .
cu@@ mu@@ lative kit@@ chen is nothing new .
however , with this kit@@ chen , it is a unique fact that this is a type of u@@ prising in the gar@@ age .
&quot; it did a little bit of design work , &quot; explains the Black D@@ F , which has been spo@@ iled by Er@@ fan ter@@ as@@ as@@ tron@@ om@@ y .
&quot; this has a counter@@ weight , which is why it is very simple to reject it . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and maintenance , Jo@@ anne now has 16 additional kilometres , an additional s@@ lee@@ ping permit and a better cor@@ ter plan .
after all , what you sell - or what gives value to property - is the words Er@@ fan .
&quot; Kin@@ nis@@ var@@ ro@@ l takes an outdated form of tu@@ p and makes calculations based on an area of oil . &quot;
here they have been able to increase sur@@ ger@@ y , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to the space .
&quot; materials are what you are missing and thus help to create emotional links with your home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ You do not love the electricity c@@ ables in my se@@ ine .
this is important , but it does not make the languages more attractive . &quot;
this shows that a good design and an increased area of land will help to make something ama@@ zing about a rather normal cor@@ al .
in fact , they may even give rise to a desire not to leave , as happened with Jo@@ anne .
the chief figure , Jen@@ sen , is Ch@@ ic@@ ago , a pe@@ la@@ gic village operating in the pil@@ l of Ch@@ ic@@ ago , who is competing with my colleague for his profession@@ alism .
it does not count on anything other than the amount of money that has been earned , but it for@@ gets any ethics .
his wife and his three children only see the man on his property and late night .
in the first part of the film , I find myself in the idea that this is , after all , a version of the business world - even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s speech man@@ e@@ er are similar .
what the film goes on , however , the less cha@@ otic element remains , and the mor@@ alising intention of film @-@ makers is beginning to appear more and more .
life @-@ changing experience will be the main contra@@ ctor &apos;s son &apos;s disease .
now there must be a choice between work and family life .
the po@@ et dre@@ aming from the Ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ tics Office makes father think of the great buildings of Ch@@ ic@@ ago about matters of real importance such as religion , welfare , love ... without even addressing the catastrophe of the twin sectors .
after the third st@@ oma@@ ch , where the po@@ et opens the eyes of father , there is a feeling that film @-@ makers are certainly driven to meet the target , because even the most stu@@ b@@ born eye @-@ mak@@ er is unable to keep te@@ ars back in the face of the suffering of a doctor &apos;s cancer po@@ et .
if the po@@ et falls in his house and his situation seems hope@@ less , the father will finally understand the mor@@ ality of his work and make good work for the elderly .
now I am lu@@ cky in terms of my own la@@ yers - if the fil@@ ter has a suspect , I will reward my sense of vision after a film coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , then you can praise the st@@ y@@ ard for at least one surprise .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ice coff@@ ee will be lost - when a hus@@ band calls a sick and a man is rus@@ hing to the Pal@@ ace of the corridor in the slow motion .
however , the Po@@ e@@ g has been ama@@ zing , and although his father has just lost his job , it will prove to be positive , because now it is time to deal with the family .
I can also feel very well - I can already predict the end of the American dra@@ ma quite well !
in truth , the film has been well constructed , all the elements needed to do so are there .
you get to the Council , you can lau@@ gh , you have good and moral beau@@ ty : money is not the most important thing in life .
this film is well introduced by surprise .
the new staff over@@ head is planning to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F@@ . Kelly will actually manage this .
in that case , it would be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff@@ ing over@@ head of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope that it will balance the gap .
here , there is a full report from Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ l :
&quot; when John F@@ . Kelly met high officials on his first day of work , the White House revealed a key problem with President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ ges Ma@@ in , which he intended to address in the hands of the President Assad .
Mr Kelly told officials that information had to go through him , either on paper or at meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried to do so and have failed to monitor his media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades and , even now that he is in White Ma@@ mas , his television observation habits have not gone anywhere .
&quot; when the candidate , T@@ ru@@ mp , was a pa@@ use for dis@@ honest media coverage , to show him that he was also fairly reflected in the publications affecting him , &quot; said S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg Poli@@ ti@@ co@@ s in February .
Poli@@ tic@@ o tara Pal@@ mer wrote at the time that , according to the six former campaig@@ ners , T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter &apos;s behaviour is key to ensuring that his personal media consumption also contains a s@@ ong of praise . &quot;
good luck .
but the idea that the habits of using T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaig@@ ners will know something that the rest of us do not know that the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i bonuses would have been even more hear@@ tening without their interventions .
we will probably never be able to know about the sh@@ ut@@ down that the T@@ ru@@ mp did not postal .
if he was hel@@ ple@@ ss , if he could save a few times the w@@ ounds , his efforts were worth doing so .
however , no one has been able to prevent T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i from constantly creating po@@ lem@@ ics .
part of the problem is that , in Val@@ ges Ma@@ in , which consists of competing fac@@ tions , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception , by transferring materials to the T@@ ru@@ Olympic Games that support their world views , but which may not always be credible .
Poli@@ tic@@ o , which reflects the whole story , wrote in May the advis@@ ers &apos; tendency to feed the President with information of strategic value .
one of the examples described by the repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is :
&quot; the current and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i sub@@ mits that T@@ ru@@ mp can react to negative press events , particularly adverse effects on inf@@ ants , explo@@ ding , entr@@ en@@ ching their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone gave the President a che@@ er@@ fully copy of the Internet provocation Charles C. G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com , a website belonging to Joh@@ n@@ son , which accused the chief de@@ pu@@ mp of staff , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , of being a white house &apos; source of multiple le@@ aks &apos; .
it is no matter that Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of his admi@@ ration , or that he did not provide any specific evidence , or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
the T@@ ru@@ mp read the article and started to ask for the subject of Wales . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , the then staff chief , Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us , and Head of the White House , had attempted to establish a system for managing and docu@@ menting the documents reaching T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader from Pri@@ x , but the T@@ ru@@ mp is still an impul@@ se and his hel@@ ple@@ ss will continue to compete for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Mr Kelly &apos;s mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans from abroad will not be allowed to speak .
there are many foreigners in the city centre of Tallinn who are prac@@ tising foreign affairs .
those with whom the conference came to light acknowledged that they were playing in the old room without the permission of the city government .
we first found three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who had taken the same amount of co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils with Vir@@ u &apos;s gates .
it was clear to see that mus@@ ici@@ ans with co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils and broken clo@@ thes were in ab@@ sen@@ tia , who would be spending one du@@ š mar@@ r .
despite the humili@@ ation , the only woman in the company was playing a par@@ ia@@ h in a@@ cor@@ di@@ al , while a man , alongside him , was calling for a gesture in his three faces and the Russians closer .
the third man had sat alongside them in one of his own houses and smo@@ ked a cor@@ di@@ al self @-@ prepared far@@ ce .
their three cha@@ mbers did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the people who have passed .
Mr Bo@@ b , who has played with Mr No@@ emi and the pal@@ lia@@ tes , said that he was be@@ ating the streets for both fu@@ n and money .
the purpose of the exhibition was to collect ticket costs on a ship travelling to Finland on the same day .
on the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for ro@@ tation in the old age , No@@ emi and Bo@@ b were sha@@ king their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stay in one town for more than a day or a few , and in most cases we will be granted a month or something like that .
it makes no sense to pay for this , &quot; explained by Bo@@ b .
when we returned to Vir@@ u &apos;s gates about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in mus@@ ici@@ ans and are going to go .
this team came to gri@@ ps with the cros@@ ses and bags of Vir@@ u Centre in ab@@ sen@@ tia .
three Polish young men were also present on the streets of Vir@@ u , one of whom played a fifth , another k@@ ni@@ fe , and the third had even contributed to electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people enter@@ tainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and live , &quot; explains the tri@@ o pi@@ pe M@@ iv@@ os@@ h .
according to M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there must be permission from the city government to speak .
&quot; of course we do not have it , &quot; he said it jo@@ king .
but we hope that , when people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
of course , when the police comes , we go elsewhere , but it must try &apos; , he added .
the Bank of Estonia purchased bonds worth EUR 149 million under the Public Pri@@ vate Company Programme of the Central Ban@@ ks of the euro area in July , while the Central Bank &apos;s bond portfolio increased to a total of EUR 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank does not provide more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , has made it clear in the past that the assets of the central banks of the Euro@@ system are covered by three different purchasing programmes : the bonds covered by the financial sector ( VIS ) , property @-@ backed bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public bonds ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases reduces the production of low @-@ risk assets and encourages investors to take greater risks .
as a rule , in the framework of the public debt programme , each central bank bu@@ ys its own government bonds , and the bonds of other countries are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is making so @-@ called &apos; replacement shopping &apos; within the amount allocated to them .
the central banks also shop in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian bank generally bu@@ ys the bonds of the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds , according to H@@ ans@@ son &apos;s confirmation .
the Estonian bank purchases bonds under the asset buy @-@ up programme as of March 2015 .
in the meantime , Ele@@ vate bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian bank will no longer buy bonds around Ele@@ ction from June 2016 .
on behalf of the central banks in the euro area , both Ele@@ ven and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds are purchased by the Finnish Central Bank from June .
migrants ignore degrees and return to &apos; millions of business building &apos;
some of the rich@@ est owners of the West Mid@@ lands have once again found themselves in a fier@@ ce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the une@@ le@@ cted bureaucra@@ ts of the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or to win back the stra@@ w away from their cotton .
migrants have par@@ ked their 20 tra@@ ilers near the streets of So@@ ker@@ ul@@ l , who ris@@ ked a wealth of millions of business .
they have returned , together with the army of hor@@ ses , children and lorries , after they were shot out there only in May , without letting themselves be confused with the bureaucra@@ cies that were complaining of in order to prevent their invasion by the Council .
the active group found a weak place in the limits of protection , turning its vehicles through an un@@ blocked part that was left to the po@@ cket .
the people of M@@ aru@@ ang@@ ry have been conta@@ cted by the So@@ mus@@ ul@@ li Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless in dealing with the problem &apos; .
a anon@@ ymous resident said : &apos; they cop@@ ied there on Monday evening after their exclusion from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ y , where they were st@@ oring fur@@ ni@@ ers .
the Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were delayed and now they are back again .
they came to more yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with such matters by finding long barriers to protect his par@@ ks .
I live on the street et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k , and I am not happy that I must continue to pay a mandate for a total tax if the Council is not even able to block such a thing . &quot;
a local resident who also wanted to remain anon@@ ymous said : &apos; this is ridiculous ; we have only seen the latter leave these migrants , and a new offensive is already under way .
this time , the number has increased and even the horse has been seen in the grass@@ land . &quot;
&apos;@@ We are aware that in the land near the street et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k route , we are working with the So@@ mus@@ ul@@ l police and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
the gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling the number 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ na festi@@ val will also visit , among others , the Minister for Culture , In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is pleased to have been able to bring real world names to Estonia .
the question as to why the We@@ ek@@ ise festi@@ val is so important for the Est@@ oni@@ ans is that it should be asked by all those who enjoy three days at the festi@@ val .
however , he will admit that the real players in his area have come to Cre@@ te .
&quot; looking at the level of artists that has been able to be brought home to Estonia , the absolute top names of this mus@@ ical gesture - often not in our h@@ all - are spoken of by the Minister for Culture .
however , which festi@@ val are the artists who speak most about Sa@@ art ?
I consider myself to be relatively old and , for some old people , one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ new@@ re@@ n , who stood up last night .
after all , according to his pos@@ ter , all of us , at some point , have complicated our own feet , &apos; he says .
however , he also points out a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ havens , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ bels .
of course , our own Estonian players too : starting with NO@@ avier P and they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , this well @-@ known concentration of names is very high , &quot; he says .

Au@@ di upgra@@ des up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the midst of criticism by car manufacturers
the day before the Au@@ di announcement , B@@ M@@ W said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of B@@ M@@ W , the company believes that &apos; there are smarter alternatives than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the town of B@@ M@@ W , Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that he would upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines .
no company described these operations as a call for withdrawal .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide em@@ itted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and could cause as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , the cost of equipment installed for neutr@@ alising emissions from diesel vehicles for the car industry is increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of ring@@ ing powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs referring to the problem .
companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , who was silent on the use of so @-@ called &apos; pe@@ dest@@ rian devices &apos; , which allowed emissions to be adapted to regulations when testing a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
several Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month a former president of the Au@@ di engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
former President Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Au@@ di in Germany was drawn into a criminal investigation into Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen when the authorities accused the installation of the audit system in order to evade European emissions requirements , thereby extending the investigation , which was previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Au@@ di in the investigation may be a major blow to Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , a manufacturer of luxury cars with a disproportionately large proportion of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen &apos;s profits .
Estonian schools are acquiring EU flags for EUR 20 000 .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency .
a total of 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 c@@ enti@@ metres of the European Union &apos;s flag will be 5@@ 70 educational institutions .
flags are intended to be made available in in@@ door rooms , they must also be carried out in high quality printing techniques with a sense of assurance in in@@ doors , and the ER@@ R news portal will be facilitated .
there is a text on the label : &apos; Kin@@ gi@@ tus for Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education , or one flag costs EUR 35 .
murder of journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
the workers of the weekly newspaper , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , usually gather on Wednesday days to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the State of Y@@ al@@ oa , which is so@@ wn by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ stop@@ p@@ able drug wars .
but today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their rou@@ tine .
two parents &apos; wri@@ ters are discussing which seems safer : either to bring children to their office , which was the target of the gran@@ dio@@ se attack in 2009 , or to leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the leader : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutral &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask repor@@ ters to provide the names of each water in every place without ne@@ eding evidence , enough impres@@ sions and in@@ ner feelings .
the presence of government or car@@ tels is suspected of drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists alike , of being a sca@@ pe@@ goat who makes it dangerous to reflect the chaos that exists in Mexico .
violence is not a wake @-@ up call , and the more the bodies across the country accumu@@ late , the majority of which are journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists , have been killed since the appointment of President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Montre@@ to at least 25 in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 journalists have been killed in at least seven countries following attacks and threats under public protection and have so far been killed in this year .
the most recent deaths include their edit@@ or and source of inspiration , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as , co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote one of his many books on drug violence .
his absence gives a deep feeling , even though his presence can be felt anywhere in Uganda Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Bu@@ il@@ ding a big picture of Val@@ de@@ z , together with the letter &apos; Justice &apos; , and two repor@@ ters from 30@@ n@@ ines , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , carries T @-@ shir@@ ts , which have been portra@@ yed with his s@@ le@@ ep glas@@ ses or the face of the ama@@ te@@ ur attached to him .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death , and Re@@ por@@ ters will discuss a common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , their dream , their paran@@ o@@ ia .
although a separate prosecution service was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been brought to justice by the Committee on the Protection of journalists .
like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime @-@ related murders , the number of which amounts to thousands , the kil@@ lers of journalists rarely reach justice .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edit@@ orial continues to reflect the violence in your country , even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and justice of murde@@ rers , the meeting on security , known as I@@ bar@@ ra , is of little use .
&apos;@@ It is very nice to waste your time in this meeting , &apos; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , you will dis@@ trust everyone . &quot;
Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of the State , Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , on 15 May morning .
he managed to travel just a few quarters before two men stopped his red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ roles , forcing him to leave the car and shot 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which means &apos; twel@@ f@@ th river &apos; in translation .
an armed man went to the Val@@ dez car and made an accident near it .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adults .
the floo@@ ded spread freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
however , there is basically only silence about Val@@ dez .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition of the United States in January , Y@@ our authorisation has been one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country , as ri@@ val mon@@ ks are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
it does not matter that a person or even a number of people are left behind every day on the streets of your permission , or that the dead are sli@@ pped away from the double @-@ fashi@@ oned swe@@ ets of drug gan@@ gs , which are greater than many homes .
let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one car@@ tel is headed by a sea state with valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , the co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and the President , Is@@ May Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , feels that he was unable to defend his friend .
he believes that killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
the first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons on a competing and military car@@ tel with the S@@ ik@@ ame@@ he D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z .
this piece of correspon@@ dence could have been allu@@ ded to by the suspect gan@@ gs , who bought all the cop@@ ies of the publication as soon as they reached the newspapers .
another mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security after there was a ra@@ mp in another newspaper in the same story .
Val@@ dez was leg@@ end , both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he existed forever .
he worked in 2003 as a ve@@ ter@@ an@@ repor@@ ter in the No@@ ro@@ este newspaper when he joined five colleagues to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said &apos; It was impossible to deal with the press without tou@@ ching on the drug problem &apos; .
the newspaper pic@@ ked up with its courageous and fair publicity , and sales and advertising grew .
Re@@ por@@ ters were keen to publish vigorous studies without fear of censorship and read@@ ers in a s@@ le@@ ep print of which they could read stories that no one else da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was founded , the newspaper won the pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot Award for his Latin American reports .
in the same year , Val@@ dez &apos;s Committee for the Protection of journalists ( AK@@ K ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow Mexic@@ an drug creation wherever it leads .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&apos;@@ I want to live on , &apos; he said by adopting the AK@@ K Prize .
last October , in an interview given to Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV , he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Y@@ al@@ o@@ a .
&quot; mayors will accept the challenge of the journalists &apos; office being accompanied by a second chance to play the game .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not say what is going on . &quot;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ gi@@ ate lon@@ el@@ les Val@@ de@@ z , a jo@@ ke who ro@@ p@@ pered like mad@@ r@@ us , a friend who divided embry@@ os and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their support to his rou@@ tine .
he always gave his village a bar@@ rel .
he went from the office to El Liberties y@@ ab@@ o bar and was always sitting on the same des@@ k .
they are now asking whether his stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness became fatal to him .
his death has also cast them in doubt about how best to do his job and stay in life .
&quot; they do not like the ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity of their women , their children , their legitimate businesses , with their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result , even in the best times , is strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination .
trust in your in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
if it is a matter of suspi@@ ci@@ ously , it is a matter of keeping out .
according to the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ al , the problem is that &apos; fra@@ gran@@ ce can be dece@@ ived ... and so it was with J@@ avi@@ er@@ ga &apos; .
he and others say that you no longer have old rules , just as they do not apply in Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ k , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ ros or other states which are home to the toxic composition of lu@@ cra@@ tive smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in a space where the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only the but@@ ter@@ house sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in front of the house , two police officers sought a rela@@ xation of 40 degrees .
they were appointed by the government by a more elected Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office in a four @-@ time building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s central neighbourhood .
some repor@@ ters won@@ dered half jo@@ ke whether these police officers were among the 50 % of the police officers who have themselves been dis@@ credi@@ ted by the Governor .
several months have passed since reports have been travelling to mountainous areas where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gan@@ gs .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s announcement this week dealt with three main features .
one of them was the murder of former po@@ x@@ leg@@ end Ju@@ li@@ o fü@@ ar Cha@@ vez ven@@ na in Blue al@@ o@@ a .
in addition , they had a reve@@ aling story of spending government funds on the town of the Governor .
and a group of people was kidna@@ pped from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants , from the c@@ abinet of the public Prosecutor &apos;s office to the quarter .
there was no official announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how it happened , so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows is a place for drug dealers and public authorities alike .
Re@@ por@@ ter learned from public documents that a restaur@@ ant was registered to the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institu@@ tional Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
recently , several IR@@ P Governor has been accused of widespread corruption in court cases .
Vil@@ lar@@ line asked the repor@@ ter to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Gu@@ z@@ man , who wear the name El Chap@@ o , esca@@ ped a military visit .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have sought a co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il in Val@@ dez in order to obtain information on kidna@@ pping from the best sources .
&apos;@@ In the past , we would have known what happened , &apos; said the 46 @-@ year @-@ old Vil@@ lar@@ k , whose body construction has earned him the name El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all channels of communication have broken down with our sources . &quot;
the Val@@ de@@ z office has become a reser@@ vo@@ ir to bridges and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the edit@@ orial workers have become something they could never expect from Morgan activists on behalf of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez seized a few eyes and moved to the local public Prosecutor &apos;s office next morning for another journalist .
Mr Salvador A@@ va disappeared in the Western State of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an three days after the murder of Val@@ dez .
a dead body has been found and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists have become more vo@@ cal across the country and underline the phrase S@@ OS press as an organised protest against pa@@ vements and buildings .
on this day , President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington in an attempt to gather international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
the day after the death of Val@@ dez , in meetings with the Governor of Blue oa , the Ra@@ mi@@ rez authorities accused journalists of dro@@ pping and killing them for telling the truth .
after that , he asked for him to be diver@@ ted from the government &apos;s activities elsewhere , concerned that hatred has affected objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ guilty state officials and an indifferent society .
in his last book on the &apos; drug press &apos; , he wrote that the repor@@ ters are killing not only drug gan@@ gs , but also under the command of politicians and security forces who are at the mer@@ cy of organised crime .
Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , awarded more than half of the attacks on the police and public officials last year .
&apos;@@ In Mexico , because you want to keep quiet , &apos; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
murder obviously has a bloody effect .
no one will forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ ger Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ k six years ago .
he was found dead with a letter that probably had been signed by a car@@ tel L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
alongside his pain@@ ted head , computer glass and e@@ lep@@ han@@ ts were found .
some publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the northern border state of El Nor@@ te , Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , following the killing of their correspon@@ dent , Ai sla@@ va B@@ atti@@ hi , in March .
others will pass on as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do did after the murder of their President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly spoke to the drug car@@ tel with the slogan &apos; What do you want of us ? &apos;
some journalists have fled from home states , or even from the country .
this is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
in theory , it is difficult to find work , and they still have to look on the streets in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes they are being driven behind them , as was probably the case with the photo@@ graph Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered three months after the sin@@ king of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z in 2015 , together with four women in Mexico .
those who remain in place and continue to work will have to dance around risky decisions on a daily basis .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to become a po@@ et , recognises that the reporting of drug trafficking frigh@@ tens him .
&quot; Mexico is on the way to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
at a recent mid@@ night of Friday , when the latest number had already been s@@ ounded , the edit@@ ors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat in front of the office and plun@@ dered the be@@ er when all phones suddenly started to be cal@@ ib@@ rated .
19 people were killed according to confirmed data in the fire exchanges between ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ is .
the war es@@ c@@ ala@@ ted , as did a number of messages from car@@ tels found in the region .
on the basis of the same pa@@ vements , repor@@ ters made news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website using a mobile phone .
a change was needed in the front of next day .
a further exchange of fire in the region was seized by the KG@@ B .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pi@@ il@@ us towards police officers to see if they are vigilant .
when they were afraid , they did not at least show this .
workers in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce were we@@ aring under a massive ban@@ ner under which his average fin@@ gers can be seen for the whole blue , under his foot@@ steps .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w can one think of closure , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; whereas on the same day that Javier was killed , a tra@@ ine@@ e asked me to send a report to the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur@@ us used protective col@@ ours to prevent enemies
at first g@@ lance , it looks like a form , albeit rather frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now unve@@ iled the first findings of the incredible r@@ hy@@ th@@ m size discovered by Canadian min@@ ers , which has been so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; din@@ osa@@ urs Mon@@ a Lis@@ a &apos; .
it has even been so well preserved that it was even possible to find out that the lea@@ ther covered by his coff@@ ee was a red boo@@ m and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
a report published in the newspaper newspaper on the Bi@@ ology described the existence as &apos; the best preserved so@@ om@@ ance rate ever found &apos; and when &apos; one of the best Cur@@ ricul@@ um read@@ ings worldwide &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new type of no@@ do@@ sa@@ x@@ y that lived in the middle of the seas@@ ons , between 110 and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly good retention was carried out by scientists who describe it as &apos; truly significant &apos; .
this plant nutri@@ ent covered by soya has , according to the magaz@@ ine National Ge@@ o@@ dic , best preserved the type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus that has ever been found .
it was found on 21 March 2011 by Sha@@ wn functional when he extra@@ cted Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um in For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
he struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into it .
the ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus identified was sent to the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ y@@ gia muse@@ um .
for the next six years , it was designed to extra@@ ct 2 500 p@@ ounds ( 1@@ 100 kilometres ) from the land unit .
after all this hard work , the end result is now finally ready for the public to be brought forward .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you put a little eye on your eyes , you can almost believe he s@@ le@@ ep , &apos; said Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , the leading author , the theat@@ re Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell , in the muse@@ um where the present is being v@@ anis@@ hed .
&quot; it will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osa@@ ur - Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &quot;
when he studied lea@@ ther , he found that this vege@@ tarian worker , although covered by soya and rese@@ mb@@ les wal@@ king tan@@ k , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food din@@ osa@@ ur .
this high @-@ profile din@@ osa@@ ur used a red and white colour of protection to hide from pre@@ da@@ tors and applied shel@@ tering techniques , which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
this allowed the din@@ osa@@ ur , according to the experts , to be absor@@ bed and enemies to be prevented , as he was likely to be hun@@ ted by major din@@ osa@@ urs .
this figure of 110 million old @-@ year @-@ old family of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ s first arrived in news in May and is now visited in the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um .
researchers have now studied and given it the name of the Bo@@ eh ope@@ l@@ ta Mar@@ mit@@ chel@@ li muse@@ um mark Mitchell , a famous team that spent more than 7 000 hours to reveal the pain .
thanks to the ama@@ zing quality of his father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the so@@ y@@ ings on the body .
they discovered a contradiction - a common method of protection in the animal state , which means that the de@@ ser@@ t of the present was a dark man than the lower .
although there is a common sense of objec@@ tivity , the findings come as a surprise , as Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta is much higher than the animals living with a def@@ er@@ ral today .
this suggests that the din@@ osa@@ ur was sufficiently actively hun@@ ted by other meat @-@ feed din@@ osa@@ ur that the evolution preferred to be a survi@@ v@@ ous policy instead of a confrontation .
however , most of the animals used today for re@@ tali@@ ation - such as fear , se@@ als or me@@ als - are much smaller and more vulnerable to harves@@ ts , indicating that no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us had to really work to survive .
&quot; the vigorous hunting of the din@@ osa@@ ur , which is covered by huge and abundan@@ t so@@ aps , shows how dangerous it could have been to the animals kidna@@ pped from the din@@ osa@@ ences of the cri@@ tic era , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds of diabe@@ tes also revealed that a din@@ osa@@ ur &apos;s sk@@ in was a red bed .
scientists will continue to set up an investigation in order to obtain indications of this life , including the retained content of this gender style , in order to find out what the animal would last to war .
they believe that the din@@ osa@@ ur has fallen into the dead rivers , thereby entering the sea , where he had sun@@ k in front of the ocean .
at the time , Alber@@ tas was as warm as it was today in South Flor@@ ence , and rivers and oceans were probably far beyond the internal land .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us is truly remarkable , as he has been fully covered by so@@ di@@ ous sk@@ in , but he has also remained three dimensions , preserving the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal today looks almost the same as in the age of cri@@ pp@@ ers .
in order to recon@@ stru@@ ct it , there is not much imagination to use - it is enough simply to pre@@ ach bridges and it seems to be like s@@ lee@@ ping . &quot;
the crisis era was the time when there were massive movements of meat @-@ feed din@@ osa@@ urs - he@@ tero@@ po@@ ts - on earth .
although their Ro@@ man Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x lived many millions more years later than Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , some of his frigh@@ tening predecess@@ ors could be s@@ tun@@ ned by this du@@ mped din@@ osa@@ ur .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ sa@@ ur@@ us , 38 leg@@ s ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) , a long and six @-@ tonne mon@@ ster .
scientists whose recent findings have been published in the magaz@@ ine are currently Bi@@ ology believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta was s@@ tun@@ ned after death in the sea and this mu@@ z@@ ambi@@ que slu@@ dge .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn functional was discovered when he extra@@ cted For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray from the Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine in Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
according to the muse@@ um , it has been the best preserved in the world of so@@ di@@ um proportions , including lea@@ ther and soya , and it is a complete concentration up to the pu@@ mps .
these assumptions were on average 18 leg@@ s ( five metres ) long and spar@@ ked up to GBP 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .
two decades of customs inva@@ ded it .
scientists believe that it was through the current Western Canada , which was covered by soya , until it was sw@@ am@@ ped into the open sea .
however , the place of absor@@ bing the din@@ osa@@ ur under the sea helped to maintain its characteristics in an excellent detail .
the gla@@ ci@@ ers of this particular father , coal , have so well preserved that my@@ g@@ arch@@ ic so@@ om@@ ers are still covered by sk@@ in ice moun@@ tains .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote in the magaz@@ ine of National Ge@@ o@@ dic : &apos; such sta@@ teh@@ ood is as rare as a l@@ ot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
De@@ fied sk@@ in bears are still covered by the creation of my@@ ste@@ rious so@@ di@@ um sto@@ res on the ground .
a better front is lying alongside him , and five of the assets have been blo@@ wn up .
I will be able to count the so@@ ws on his winter . &quot;
how did one activist find an answer to the question of &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll received a complete shock .
just a day after the trip to New York , that was the birth@@ place of St@@ . Lou@@ ise Air@@ b@@ n@@ b on a le@@ ak@@ ed bed , on Facebook on the phone .
he came on top of the post of his former school compan@@ i@@ ons .
it read : &apos; the police killed a young 18 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ence , and he is still on the street &apos; .
he was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his stream , so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
P@@ ide@@ ga @ The@@ e@@ P@@ suc@@ ah &apos;s user &apos;s mail was repeatedly distributed on his time@@ line .
Mr St@@ . Sy@@ n@@ chron@@ ous from the Lou@@ ise region sent a real @-@ time ta@@ g to Michael Brown , the death of an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Fer@@ gus@@ on Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is .
he gave a picture of the life of Bro@@ w@@ n , which was found on the street , for four hours .
&apos;@@ It is cra@@ zy , &apos; thought of the Ferreira amendments .
but death was nothing new for him or for the community .
he put his phone off , but later this evening he looked again at the spar@@ k announced this time that people were gathered in Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
J@@ ag@@ ati photo@@ graph@@ s of the police and the people who were afraid of the police and the man who claimed himself to be the father of Brown and kept the label &apos; The Fer@@ gus@@ on police killed my un@@ armed son &apos; .
he watched a real @-@ time flow where a police officer stood before a group of prote@@ sters with gra@@ ves .
in the second video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Mr Fer@@ rell will remember how he has caught himself from the point of view : &apos; it is unusual &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is not a murder of this kind that we are ac@@ custo@@ med to and which we could describe as typical &apos; .
I felt horri@@ fied at this moment .
I was ang@@ ry and I met . &quot;
he boo@@ ked a return flight and travelled home the following day .
having bu@@ ried at 23 o &apos;@@ clock , she went to her father for his six @-@ year da@@ u@@ ghter and decided that they would travel to Fer@@ gus@@ on next morning .
what happened next three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ gus@@ on is the central theme of the new docu@@ mentary &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; . ( &apos; whose streets ? &apos; ) , which will be presented in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who than@@ ked for their answers .
when Mrs Ferreira , together with her da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a li@@ ps@@ y stic@@ ker in the back and beaten it - travelled to Fer@@ gus@@ on , they re@@ talked about a subject that they had repeatedly talked about before this morning - about the experience and living conditions of the mus@@ ici@@ ans .
&quot; remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &quot;
&quot; we are now travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ on because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys , and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on board , &quot; said Ferreira later .
&quot; what is happening now is ... the cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it must know and see this and grow in the middle of it .
he must learn about activist and organisation and , at the same time , also know the different la@@ yers of experience and living conditions of the mus@@ ici@@ ans , and what we must do in order to be free and free .
even if I succeed in bringing him up in such a way that he does not personally copy brutal racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel I would do him a dis@@ service if I were to protect him from this world . &quot;
the first stop they did in the vic@@ inity of Fer@@ gus@@ on was through the South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ ti - the police station in the middle of the road , which had become a kind of camps where activists were waiting for news about the police officer , Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not ultimately charged .
there , Mr Ferreira and his da@@ u@@ ghter joined forces with the local business owner , who produced lunch crops .
they brought together food homes and helped to distribute them to the prote@@ sters .
for Fer@@ rell , a new type of activist has slowly started to take shape .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ ise University , he was the President of the Union for Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organisation .
all this is simply a pi@@ pe . &quot;
weeks later , during the Ferreira evening demonstration , a film co @-@ director Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ i met .
Fo@@ lay@@ an said that he and the film operator , Mr Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , simply wanted to document what is happening .
the question of &apos; are you trying to document what is happening or to find a story that can be used ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to profit from its legitimacy and resilience .
Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born and growing in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard , and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Fo@@ lay@@ an had already put his hands in hand with the co @-@ director D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ ati , the ar@@ tist in the region , who was known as activists for prisoners sentenced to death .
his involvement made the project attractive for Fer@@ rell and for the six other local communities who were watched for years following the shooting of Brown .
&apos;@@ In this docu@@ mentary , no one is speaking to us or to us , but we are speaking to ourselves , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; it was important to me how these people are portra@@ yed , because that is how I am portra@@ yed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rell - the intention was to show that the movement is not about &apos; donor leader , but about bringing together the community &apos; , as Fo@@ lay@@ an said - he was the most open party to the film .
as a result , the &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; ? &apos; sur@@ prises personal aspects of the life of Fer@@ rell , such as ru@@ th@@ lessness and marriage with his wife .
&apos;@@ I felt , as I would be earlier , &apos; said Ferreira , laugh@@ ing over the first time that he saw the city .
&quot; however , I realised that this work and the humanity of the black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
what is more , the Fer@@ rell story emphasises and re@@ places the role of black L@@ GB@@ T women in the wider Black Sea Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three initi@@ ators of the movement , who thought out in the social media in 2012 following the killing of the black teen@@ ag@@ er Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , the h@@ ash@@ tag@@ s # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter , are homosexu@@ als .
&quot; in leading role , Muslim women have kept the movement across the board , &quot; said Ferreira , &quot; and this is precisely because we have to fight continually on many fronts .
Roma women must bear all this burden . &quot;
Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed , stating that &apos; movement is indeed alive by black women , and many of them are black homosexu@@ als &apos; .
he says , however , that &apos; this is not a case of creating a level playing field &apos; - Fer@@ rell was not chosen as the focus of the film because of his identity .
&quot; he was someone who had the right energy evening , &quot; he said .
&quot; however , it is no coincidence that he was directly located on the r@@ index , as black L@@ GB@@ T women live in such hu@@ bs is a lot at stake .
his energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , news camer@@ as Fer@@ gus@@ on has long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the conditional sentences imposed on Fer@@ rell during the demonstrations for blocking the road will last another 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region he calls home@@ lessness simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
however , he still considers the man@@ tra he has been eating since he went to the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ on a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing other than our chains to lose . &quot;
7 examples of how to overcome the We@@ ek@@ ise du po@@ ta@@ ble@@ t
some of the most stu@@ b@@ born me@@ chan@@ gers will find help after a little bit of pi@@ pes .
or from the saying &apos; Be@@ yond po@@ h@@ mel@@ le &apos; , the cra@@ dle of the stick &apos; .
but this is only an inevitable postponement and a good word for health .
what can you do to make sure that , after today and tomorrow &apos;s We@@ ek@@ ise tr@@ all - or other pi@@ pes - you feel better in the morning and get the po@@ pp@@ y out as pain@@ fully as possible ?
Jo@@ o Water .
it was under fire and , after a great deal of pi@@ le in the morning ... or , if possible , even alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it must somehow be recovered .
together with water , miner@@ als are also being thrown out of the body , and se@@ sta@@ p is a good ha@@ ir of mineral water .
since , after being s@@ tun@@ ned , the swe@@ at has often been irri@@ tated , it is particularly good if it is free of soil , or only ligh@@ tly ga@@ m@@ bled .
let &apos;s walk .
surely it would not cost the grand@@ mother to bur@@ n the trees with po@@ pp@@ y - it could prove fatal to be a wrong decision .
but a simple walk @-@ out helps the body to recall once again what it is like to be alive .
S@@ lee@@ ping in T@@ el@@ gis and s@@ lee@@ ping boys is a more time @-@ consuming way of getting a whole .
give poor energy back gradually and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are already on the ver@@ ge of over@@ drinking yesterday , it is certainly not worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
for example , a fresh volume containing t@@ reas@@ ure f@@ ab@@ ric@@ s is slowly placed on the market as a body .
if the health of the South is already suffering , for example , the w@@ ed@@ ding could be tried .
and a little later on , it is clear .
a coff@@ ee was avoided .
this sof@@ ter will free your body from the last water .
as has already been said , water and volume have your friends .
there is a contribution to pain@@ kil@@ lers .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler to prevent po@@ h@@ l on the evening , you have to deal with par@@ at@@ se@@ ta@@ mo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ ph@@ et , not only with alcohol , but also with the ability to do so .
so they will pay even more and , in the future , boys will be worse .
in addition , the anal@@ ge@@ si@@ cs will not remain in the j@@ ung@@ le for a long time .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler in the morning , you will do it with an empty k@@ ni@@ fe - it irri@@ ta@@ tes your already ti@@ red swe@@ at .
or if you do not have a partner , you can do it well .
it is about the same thing as wal@@ king , but it does not become org@@ as@@ m when it comes to wal@@ king .
however , too active a pace and an outrageous bet were avoided - during the po@@ pp@@ y season , the physical effort should be moderate .
go a jo@@ ke .
the words of friends of time with friends of friends of time have been spoken , the easy hand and the na@@ era am@@ ic@@ ably over both himself and others ( suffering ) .
N@@ ali and na@@ vi@@ er may not be doing a po@@ cket , but they will certainly have a ligh@@ ter chance of being tolerated .
once again , the po@@ h@@ me@@ ll goes over anyway !
Professor of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and staff at Ox@@ ford University are sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , profes@@ sors of the University of North@@ w@@ ester and the University of Ox@@ ford are being sought nation@@ ally , who have been suspected of finding a single Chi@@ ic@@ ago luxury cor@@ ps for men with death w@@ ounds .
according to judicial documents from the C@@ oo@@ k Coun@@ ty , on Monday , arrest warrants were issued for 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i , accused of being murdered at first instance because of their alleged involvement in T@@ ren@@ ton H. Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u .
according to the documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ allo@@ u died after repeated Naz@@ is .
according to the warning that Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s police station issued to the community , the body was found to be dead on 27 July .
police officers received telephone calls and found a victim from the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house , whose body had several tow@@ ers .
according to the officials , the Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ tag@@ u event was sentenced to death and investi@@ g@@ ators are treating co@@ aches as murder , while the police are actively seeking two suspects .
La@@ Patrick has been working as co @-@ profes@@ sors of micro@@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at the University of North@@ w@@ ester since 2007 .
in a statement sent as e @-@ publishing , Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , Vice @-@ President of University , said that La@@ dows had now been temporarily removed from work and is forbid@@ den to enter the cities of the University of North@@ w@@ ester .
&quot; this is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of North@@ w@@ ester works with researchers , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ arre@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant in the finance department of Ox@@ ford University .
the representative of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to help US research authorities in every way possible &apos; .
furthermore , the statement stated that War@@ ren@@ i colleagues were shocked and wanted to be ex@@ tradi@@ ted .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , Head of the Communications Department of Ch@@ ic@@ ago , urges suspects to give themselves to the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are , but we are increasingly intensively defining the exact location , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , suspects can be sought by local , regional and national authorities .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police had received a telephone call from the chief Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house , who had just received a k@@ ry@@ p@@ tic hin@@ t that something had happened at Cor@@ ps No 10@@ 08 .
according to the police , this was a ma@@ gic specta@@ cle .
it is not clear , according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , whether the event itself was also taking place on 27 July .
he said that the security camer@@ as confirm the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ mil and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the leadership of the Grand Pla@@ za sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police are currently working to identify the background of events and victims , and is looking at various mo@@ tives , including the possibility of a family dispute &apos; .
firms that help your businesses avoid getting next U@@ b@@ B
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ up company , but the polls were un@@ profitable .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is leading the company Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , which sel@@ ls e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees in San Franc@@ is@@ co@@ s .
it therefore called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups with new types of human resources are emerging , helping businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software to measure the involvement of workers , they allow companies to carry out f@@ lash surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , provide anon@@ y@@ mity and complaint hot@@ lines for workers and , in some cases , allow them to by@@ pass the level C leaders and address directly to the Bureau .
&apos;@@ There are now tools such as Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ bps for monitoring health , but where is F@@ it@@ bi for your company ? &apos; asked Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O of Red@@ wood City start @-@ ups G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ sts are used by companies to measure worker inclusion .
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , he has received a much better overview of what he thinks and feels by workers in three years of his use of G@@ lin@@ ti .
in addition to inquiries and specific teams , it offers a company &apos;s thermal card , which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , enabling it to identify the causes .
companies have started to understand that they have to stay in touch with their work culture so as not to become the next U@@ b , which has been re@@ bel@@ led in scandals since the former worker published a blo@@ g mail which described an ab@@ omin@@ able environment in which those who da@@ red to speak were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , the desire to have an overview is a profitable business option .
global governance , regulation and compliance can be worth more than USD 118@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the financial ethics statistics website L@@ et &apos;s talk .
Den@@ ver@@ is Col@@ or@@ ad@@ os , a start company which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , observed an interest and an increase in activity this year against the background of the dubious reputation of U@@ beria .
there are almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber recently registered himself as a customer .
like G@@ lin@@ gi , the coalition companies will be allowed to send tailor @-@ made impul@@ se polls , gather confidential answers in real time and look at the problematic areas of heat maps .
it also offers anon@@ ymous messages to enable workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has been an@@ cho@@ red by regulatory authorities , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , foun@@ der and CE@@ O .
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act une@@ th@@ ically , it could face serious consequences , such as consumer boycot@@ ts , the departure of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by communautaire , restaur@@ ant clothing , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of operation , has used inactive cen@@ sus for more than a year to ensure workers &apos; awareness of the rules and procedures and to provide a simple way of communicating with the headquarters of corpor@@ ation .
when a worker wanted to report a problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address at the company &apos;s headquarters , make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously .
this was often a da@@ m@@ ning and in@@ convenient process , and Mr Parish &apos;s general advis@@ er , James Vit@@ ran@@ o , said that there was no good way of monitoring workers &apos; complaints .
however , now that the company uses coali@@ cen@@ ti , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices , which did not previously reach leaders in other cities or offices located in states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I have the opportunity to get closer to the hol@@ low experience of the workers of 3@@ 60 degrees , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who chairs Ru@@ by hood &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; and we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and worker involvement more seriously in 2002 , after the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Andersson collapsed due to ethical irregularities in relation to the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they could not prevent their black was@@ hing from being hi@@ jac@@ ked online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Vienna are offering their software as a service , paying companies perio@@ dic@@ ally for the use of their products .
it is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors , who have been in favour of both start @-@ ups .
3.4 million dollars were financed in February by companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected at USD 47 million .
the G@@ lin@@ ti invested USD 10 million in November in B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , increasing its total funding to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise if we take into account the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ tedness between companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more research shows that today &apos;s workers expect more jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are just on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy in the company , they feel they are being listened to and that the work they do is satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ tis , who has a general benefit and employee experience , who uses both Integration cen@@ ti and G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors will earn revenue if companies in their portfolio do well ; businesses will do well if workers are committed and involved .
if analytical tools on the third side promise to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , we are not sure that they will be supported .
having data on the involvement of workers is important , according to experts in professional culture .
however , these data will be useless if the company &apos;s supervisors do not go along with them .
in fact , when a company asks for feedback from its employees , it can generate expectations that changes are ahead of us .
and if changes do not take place quickly enough or at all , this could cause disappointment and decrease the involvement of workers .
&quot; when you ask for 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; said K@@ ot@@ ter International President R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&apos;@@ because if things are not brought to the end , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Netherlands , which is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via G@@ lin@@ ti .
and , after receiving feedback from disappointed workers on the pace of decision @-@ making and quality of communication , he was able to re@@ organise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems .
however , Mr Tavares is collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in industry , known for its high labour turnover .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you are not committed to transparency , you will lose people , &apos; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose customers .
and if you lose your customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
euro area ice sta@@ r is in the Baltic : incomes grow rapidly
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , B@@ animal berg wri@@ tes with reference to the ECB report .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
there is a low debt burden behind success , fast @-@ growing institutions and business @-@ friendly and free @-@ market @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where the EU average has been substantially closer to the purchasing power of the reactor per capita . &quot;
although the aim is for the total output of the economy per capita to be equivalent to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2 / 3 / 15 of the average of the 2 / 3 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led the bal@@ ls to seek better wages abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic at all .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are doing very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was thought little less than half of those questioned about their economies .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel trends twice a day makes Bru@@ in@@ si &apos;s days long
it is almost 23 o &apos;@@ clock when tro@@ chi@@ ond U@@ C@@ L@@ A football clubs stop talking at the end of a new exercise in a team &apos;s city .
some of them have put their backs on the back , reve@@ aling their efforts in the first day of the training camp .
for a large part of the team , these Christmas minutes offer a mid@@ day break .
the players involved in cu@@ cu@@ mbers are going to learn after a three @-@ hour shift back to a common life test before returning to the W@@ avier man football club at 6.@@ 30 meetings next morning .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday became Tuesday .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel the trends taking place twice a day to reduce the burden of players has actually made their days longer - at least until the end of the day - to one side on Friday .
for this reason , the first three operations of U@@ C@@ L@@ A were prompted to start at 19.@@ 15 in order to fit players into the already tight time@@ line .
the transition from two strikes per day means more days - the beginning of the Bru@@ in@@ si training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season and , for the first time in Mor@@ a &apos;s six W@@ es@@ tw@@ ard season , there will be workshops during summer courses .
they have 18 March plans until 20 August , before starting formal preparations for the opening game against T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M in September .
according to Mor@@ a , he is in favour of a change in the N@@ CA@@ A rule , although it adds another item to the close schedu@@ les of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they break themselves through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that when it comes to Saturday and we have more time , it will be a very good thing . &quot;
once the camp is closed , U@@ C@@ L@@ A &apos;s operations will be closed , which is not an easy task , however , given the clear view of the par@@ king pla@@ te close to their fields and the remote L@@ us@@ kin@@ i centre , a higher @-@ class hotel that has already esca@@ ped from the net of protection around the gates .
since this weekend , ho@@ tel Bru@@ in@@ si players are occupying , but Mor@@ a acknowledged that there could be problems with free tobacco during the season .
&quot; we are implementing security measures , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real concern , and it is not exagg@@ erated to think that people can fil@@ ter a rent and a t@@ our from there .
if you have a record of a train , you can do a good deal with it .
but we are using a security team there and 8 par@@ king stations .
we will do our best to use it .
I will try not to worry very much about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the cost of the German @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va electoral union , Kris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ and , who was expelled from the Reform Party and the ECB , to the forces of Maria Kal@@ j@@ ete , who were forced to join forces in the hands of our Tallinn and the parties , seems to be at least as much as the political parties involved in the local elections this year .
however , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointed voters .
who will remain with the Sahel ?
if the support team of Ed@@ gar Sa@@ lev@@ are reduced , the events organised for his election union can be predicted .
one of the members of the national assembly , some former and current middle parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and why , in Tallinn , are some of the fai@@ th@@ ful sympath@@ ies and sis@@ ters of Sa@@ du@@ are prevented from standing for election , can it be that the list of &apos; Sa@@ du@@ are &apos; companies , which are suspected of corruption and corruption crime , is becoming a reality ?
on the Russian po@@ em of a film @-@ driven music cal@@ de@@ o , on the part of the municipal@@ ity , attended by the city of Las@@ na@@ mä@@ e ; and in any sense by the original computer game in which Prime Minister J@@ ü@@ ri Ra@@ tas , the Prime Minister , has to avoid l@@ om@@ ni@@ pe and hur@@ ric@@ ans on his way - is that the central party , for the first time , is seeking the votes of the 16@@ th and 17 @-@ year @-@ old voters to be admitted to the ballot bo@@ xes ?
we look forward to the perception of other political parties of the youth electoral campaign .
if the Kan@@ al 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 view@@ ers , instead of the beginning of August , are confronted with black h@@ oles , there will be two options : to accept that in future , only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn TV and English @-@ language Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels or to dis@@ pen@@ se with 10 TV operators each month .
there are probably also those who openly re@@ jo@@ ice at the start with free television experience , but in the end - albeit reluc@@ tantly - pay for television and advertise@@ ments .
In@@ numer@@ ical music , fol@@ ding people and the rub@@ b@@ ish left on the streets are un@@ pleasant by @-@ products of almost every major music festi@@ val .
however , if you do not want to be part of the ocean , you have to go home rather than pain - and leave the s@@ lee@@ ping place for the lun@@ g sum to the festi@@ val .
Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
media publications are quoted by President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan provides for a 50 000 @-@ year reduction in the number of legal immigrants , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Re@@ publi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill goes to the two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law reduces poverty , increases wages and sa@@ ves billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , as it changes the way in which green cards are issued to US citizens from other countries .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process gives an advantage to the candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and to the skills that will benefit our economies , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp in the US media publications .
Si@@ beria se@@ to young people are moving back to the city , pensioners , to land .
J@@ ev@@ se@@ ye@@ v A@@ na@@ tol continues the tradition of the famous se@@ to gold min@@ ers along the River Ma@@ ana .
she works 140 kilometres from home to Ma@@ ana extra time in Ku@@ vai as a motor driver .
it is hard work : two months of work without rest days , and then only 10 days at home and again .
during the three years of work in the Ar@@ ch@@ tel , A@@ na@@ tol has seen the cul@@ mination only once .
&apos;@@ There is a res@@ ounding procedure : when you go into it , you will check thoroughly that the reference does not lead , and when you go out that you do not take it &apos; , you will talk A@@ na@@ tol .
M@@ are Pi@@ ho , speaking in the village of H@@ ai@@ da , to the local se@@ to Ja@@ ga , who has spoken a great deal to him about the memory of his family in Si@@ beria .
the archa@@ ic culture still preserved by Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ pes will also affect domestic se@@ als , as it is quite simply so shocking that it thinks the most far @-@ sighted mix@@ tures of Pi@@ ho M@@ are .
his first investigation trip to Si@@ beria will be 30 years later this year .
during that period , he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year .
how much did Si@@ beria still mig@@ rate at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took this into account in the words of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to men who have thought about it themselves .
it is difficult to say precisely because up to 30 people could come to one group at that time , but only a man was given a passport .
the passport was given to only one , but it was children , sis@@ ters and women .
look at how great this territory was here .
it was many times greater than that of his@@ tori@@ an .
after all , it was necessary to educate , to manage it in some way .
S@@ et@@ in@@ os came here as farmers , but their lives changed , because here they came to areas that were not only agricultural but also river ( pal@@ gi@@ par@@ ation ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New Pet@@ F , many pigs later went to work in K@@ ras@@ no@@ jar@@ sk @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P@@ . ) when it was formed .
did the se@@ tos then represent a majority of the population in this region ?
yes , they lived collectively .
in addition , a long tradition of marriage and a lot of child@@ birth has long been preserved .
seven to eight children in families were common .
how many cultures of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ pes diff@@ ered and different from those of the mother country ?
they are different , although what was said here was once the same .
they gave rise to a great many popular ideas .
they then also made their own ( ideas of the people ) , but they always made a distinction between what had been brought about and what had been done here .
climate change has been heavily influenced by the traditional ri@@ val@@ ry of se@@ als , because it is cold here .
the changes have been proposed .
for example , S@@ et@@ oma@@ al meat was s@@ kin@@ ned , but it was simply frozen here .
where are the villages of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ de and what life is living there ? / graph@@ ics : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ends
the link with the mother country was spiri@@ tually strong , it was regarded as very important .
it seems to me that now this Se@@ tu@@ ony is going to return to it , it will affect them .
those girls who have lived here in families have listened to ama@@ zing stories .
Pi@@ ho is thinking of the people of the Estonian se@@ to@@ de delegation who came to the day of H@@ ai@@ da village Se@@ to the Kingdom in early July and lived in homes for four days - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is very easy to come and also go , because the city has an excellent location : in the railway link and at the crossroads of the roads , it says Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m , who comes from T@@ ap@@ y .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a lot of nature , sports and cultural places , and the car@@ rot gets in every corner .
T@@ ap@@ a is a ti@@ p @-@ po@@ p city !
there is a small island along the River White , which runs through the L@@ in@@ era , where the Ta@@ mil@@ s tend to be hi@@ jac@@ ked .
&apos;@@ This beautiful place does not appear on the train window &apos; , ha@@ ils Re@@ ig@@ o .
those who do not fear cold water can flood in the river because the river is full of resources .
I have been there , you can do it !
the river will be able to keep a long time and just do a ro@@ man@@ tics - it will be possible to look at the flow of the river and to think ahead of life and behind .
I have also been there with my own names .
O@@ oper@@ is@@ ol@@ ist Tam@@ m has , apart from anything else , been on the river between three bridges : &apos; that place is along the city , no one may come to answer if their stories are heard &apos; .
&quot; there is a wonderful view of T@@ ap@@ y , but there are also health professionals where you can drink , winter ski@@ es and now , for example , play a dis@@ gol@@ f game - gol@@ f tra@@ cks have been made , chains can be borro@@ wed from sports centres , &quot; Re@@ ig@@ o is leading .
old pro@@ cess@@ ors are there , of course , with their own system , but I have not yet been able to play there .
obviously , my colleague , Mrs Ras@@ mus , must be invited to visit T@@ ap@@ ale , because she has experienced a dis@@ c@@ gol@@ f@@ im@@ ble@@ r and she has a label .
perhaps he will lend me !
Re@@ ig@@ o and M@@ än@@ ni@@ ku@@ ll were in@@ separ@@ able from the current period of childhood .
at least during hours .
there are many te@@ ars left to this memory , many dis@@ appointments , and you can live in my sporting life .
not to mention the bel@@ ls and su@@ ici@@ des that have broken .
&quot; the whole city of the city is now full of construction works , all of which will become unknown , &quot; ren@@ ders Re@@ ig@@ o .
however , T@@ ap@@ a &apos;s old and ti@@ red building is a very attractive place to play oral disco@@ veries .
I am pleased that , in 2012 , the head of R@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ M adopted my idea and had to make a summer theat@@ re with his theat@@ re .
although this year &apos;s theat@@ re season &apos; Ale@@ mber K@@ aren@@ in &apos; has just been completed , on 11 August the railway station &apos; El@@ lu@@ wake &apos; , when the old building is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; from 11 to 13 August , the city of T@@ ap@@ a is the day of the town of T@@ ap@@ a , which has opened the doors of the v@@ ine@@ yards and clo@@ thes of cultural activities , including the popular t@@ reas@@ ure , speaks of Re@@ ig@@ o , who recommends to visit the city from 9 to 11 years .
the muse@@ um has already been in 1994 since 1 May in a tiny three @-@ house .
&apos;@@ The house is small , but there is a great deal of publicity and information enormously &apos; , applau@@ ds Re@@ ig@@ o &apos;s place , which is full of the history of the city of T@@ ap@@ a , most of which focus on railways and sis@@ ters .
Re@@ ig@@ o mu@@ ds that if you go through all the recommended sites in T@@ ap@@ al , you will go a long way , but fortunately the small town will be full of coff@@ ers .
&quot; we have such good eating places and sometimes when you sit in coff@@ ee , you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad , you describe it .
educated and young soldiers who have come to T@@ ap@@ y spend a lot of time in pu@@ mps , a sta@@ r sitting there is a cu@@ rious feeling that you are in Estonia and your home town , but there is such an international company together .
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to stories from the French or the Americans .
the wars , yes , we are moving a lot !
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ dering
Tele@@ can@@ al b@@ TV quoted a foreign minister who reported that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ dering .
in the morning of 1 August , the police arrested people who illegally ordered a group on the island of Si@@ th@@ onia , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free ten@@ dering and are already imposing heavy penalties on all those who are caught in a spa@@ w@@ ning place that is not intended for it .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
the w@@ ol@@ ves that teach the young people are breaking the sheep .
farmers on the shel@@ f have yet again had to give their her@@ ds a &apos; lesson &apos; - the w@@ ol@@ ves that have taught the w@@ ol@@ ves , apparently , have already broken a lot of sheep .
this year , the w@@ ol@@ ves in the Hi@@ i@@ u coun@@ ty have broken sheep three times , 23 sheep and eight have been injured , writing the Hi@@ i@@ u page .
soil was only three years before 124 .
there are also data from the Environment Agency at the birth of Mur@@ ms that soil was not born on the Hi@@ shel@@ f and that the advice from the W@@ allo@@ on Council is that two w@@ ol@@ ves have been fixed on the island this year .
at the Ö@@ ö@@ l on Monday , the w@@ ol@@ ves unle@@ as@@ hed 15 sheep in the village of K@@ abu@@ l and injured the 18 survi@@ v@@ ors .
in the morning morning morning , the w@@ ol@@ ves in the village of Re@@ he@@ bas@@ la were breaking one sheep in the pas@@ ture and seriously injured the other , who had to be struck by an emergency .
rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law amending the Law on the Environment of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and plant protection products .
the amendment to the law remo@@ ves the creation of a separate collection of data for both genetically modified ( GM ) crops and operators , using a plant health register in the future .
in addition , the obligation to have prior agreement with the designated person dealing with beekeeping will be amended by the GM crop mak@@ er .
although there is currently no increase in GM crops in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as there are no decisions to declare the Estonian GMO @-@ free , &quot; said S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , the head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and the public sectors , in addition . &quot;
the draft law repe@@ als the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of data on GM crops and operators , lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and for the start of economic activities .
specifically with regard to beekeeping , the GM crop farmer is replaced by an obligation to inform bee@@ keepers of the start of GM crops with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with bee@@ keepers before starting cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to the minis@@ tries for coordination .
all interested parties will have the opportunity to famili@@ arise themselves with the information system of the draft proposals and , if they so wish , to give their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , those in the plant farming sector , bee@@ keepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10 - has been authorised to grow .
so far , however , no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops .
the reason for this is that there is no ma@@ gic bul@@ let in Estonia , a European shadow media on which mon 8@@ 10 is resistant .
it has also been extended to the southern regions , and this in May is not appropriate for our climate conditions .
in order to be secure , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various su@@ ici@@ des , maize and soya vari@@ eties grown in Estonia .
the analysis of the sam@@ ples carried out showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soya vari@@ eties in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms .
in turn , it can be concluded that in Estonia , GM crops are not deliberately culti@@ vated , and it was also confirmed that there has not been random contamination .
J@@ ose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho thinks Manch@@ ester United in the form of N@@ eman@@ ja Ma@@ tic@@ u , &quot; genetic &quot;
J@@ ose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manch@@ ester United States has recru@@ ited &apos; gen@@ i@@ us &apos; in the form of N@@ eman@@ ja Ma@@ tic@@ u , after having opposed the central player Sam@@ lov on Wednesday evening .
a player bought from C@@ hel@@ mer for GBP 40 million started in Dublin in the last seasonal game in the UEFA Su@@ per C@@ up@@ i line against Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 in the initial ind@@ ent , while Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Pe@@ re@@ ira were free to go on attacks .
however , having left behind Blu@@ es &apos;s seasonal ban on Asia , Ma@@ tic@@ l was badly in need of sw@@ im@@ ming and only received 45 minutes , which , according to M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , must be corrected by a firm prior to the start of the Pre@@ mi@@ er League season .
&quot; he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , gen@@ i@@ ous thinking - he has a football mind@@ set , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to achieve a form as soon as possible . &quot;

the In@@ dependent public this week revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wants to recruit three football players , but confirmed that the club had already done &apos; excellent work &apos; by concluding contracts with three of its four priority options .
&quot; I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four , &quot; he added .
&quot; I am even hap@@ pi@@ er if they can do four things , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
another warm po@@ et took the foot of the GSM E@@ mb@@ assy on 1 August and this time in M@@ uh@@ us .
M@@ ati Mar@@ tin@@ son , an observer living in S@@ hu@@ ves , received the first cu@@ mber in S@@ hu@@ ves , and this was@@ hing cell is already flying around , has left the was@@ hing ground and joined the great night of the Mul@@ lu@@ tu @-@ Great Gulf .
this is because , after all , there are no fer@@ tility fields , the island &apos;s voice is written .
this Tuesday , in order to break the course relatively late , the accompanying person received another po@@ et , and that was on the island of M@@ uh@@ u .
according to Mar@@ tin@@ son , the installation of emb@@ assies is , in fact , an international project carried out by A@@ emit@@ r Lei@@ to and I@@ va@@ r O@@ j@@ ara .
soil was supplied with a po@@ et called M@@ ati GSM E@@ mb@@ assy in S@@ fragile ves Turkey .
&quot; his actions are all on the internet : how he went to Spain in winter , back a long time in the German and Polish border , and then in Sa@@ are@@ land , Mar@@ tin@@ son spoke .
the British inven@@ tor was able to in@@ sta@@ ll a micro@@ chi@@ p in his own body in order to get access to a hand@@ ler &apos;s house and car .
the British inven@@ tor became the first person in a country to have a micro@@ chi@@ p installed so that he can only open his own example , get into office and even launch a car .

he has joined forces with Dr Ge@@ off Watson , a consul@@ tant @-@ an@@ es@@ te@@ si@@ olo@@ gist of the Ro@@ yal hospital in Win@@ ch@@ ester Han@@ ts , to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards .
technology is similar to that of micro@@ chi@@ p installed on ca@@ ts and bags , and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure .
the North@@ am company is also changing the s@@ ongs of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chi@@ p , asking for GBP 300 per s@@ now .

White House &apos;s audit cost to taxpayers thousands
according to military documents unve@@ iled in the magaz@@ ine , the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicop@@ ter last month for an event involving American production to the southern taxpayer cost even USD 24 000 .
the green and white colour S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , ter@@ med &apos; Marine One &apos; during the presidential par@@ don , was central to the event in Val@@ ges Ma@@ in on 17 July .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , senior officials of the Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence and the White House reported on industrial products from all 50 countries on their move .
a helicop@@ ter built in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ t was spon@@ sored together with a cl@@ one from the reputation , a fire bri@@ gade from W@@ is@@ con@@ ten and a pal@@ let made in Mis@@ sis@@ si@@ pp@@ y .
according to the documents of Mrs H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) , the chief c@@ abinet responsible for the operation of H@@ eli@@ Cop@@ ter ordered the presence of a helicop@@ ter in the military office of the White House to take a little 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter for the &apos; extraordinary &apos; event in the southern hor@@ ror .
&apos;@@ I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &apos; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 kom@@ and@@ ö@@ r a day before the event was launched in an e @-@ mail to his sup@@ eri@@ ority , the Deputy Assis@@ tant officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
the message stated that the helicop@@ ter would come to the southern hor@@ ror on 17 July morning at 7 : 00 , and will remain there until the same night between 18 and 21 is cleared .
it was added that if the departure of the White House were to be present , a second e@@ pa@@ thy is needed because of the restrictions on working time .
the original air crew was in the helicop@@ ter during the event and the security team of the es@@ tu@@ r remained close to the aircraft throughout the period of its stay on the ground .
it was not possible to read out from the documents we have just given to the magaz@@ ine whether or not the other e@@ tho@@ s were eventually needed .
the H@@ at@@ ch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes .
documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 examined whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked if it was in breach of H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law and we were told that it would not ri@@ p , &apos; wrote the com@@ man@@ der .
&apos;@@ It seems that you do not have a choice , &apos; answered the Deputy Minister for the lead officers .
the White House declared the &apos; made in America &apos; event as a formal event , and H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law would not have covered it .
but even official events have political under@@ ton@@ es .
the President backed the efforts of health reform at the time in the Senate and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in check .
the use of an aircraft known as &apos; Marine One &apos; or Air Force &apos; for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them purely photo@@ graphic is unusual .
in February , the T@@ ru@@ mp came to the attention of the President &apos;s plane at his first campaign event in Flor@@ idas Mel@@ bour@@ ne , and he is sli@@ pping from Twitter &apos;s account messages complaining about the way in which his predecessor &apos;s flight was used .
&quot; White l Ma@@ l is very pleased with the exhibition &quot; made in America , where products were represented in all 50 states made by American workers , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the spokes@@ man of the White House .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often carry out experi@@ ments around Washington and in the southern hor@@ ror in order to get down to the white house of the President of the United States with a c@@ enti@@ metres .
when the T@@ ru@@ mp was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House ordered 58 sam@@ ples .
according to the official , a flight crew made in America was considered to be the norm for a month &apos;s study flights .
on that day , Es@@ ka@@ r helicop@@ ters fly another 11 hours for &apos; non @-@ President @-@ related support missions &apos; .
according to the White House , no other actor in this event has burdened the taxpayers &apos; w@@ alle@@ ts .
according to the representative of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , the company was not involved in carrying out evi@@ ctions on the southern hor@@ ror .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 will not preserve the budgetary documents of President flights and the precise costs of the event will be difficult to identify .
however , according to the Ministry of Defence &apos;s h@@ our@@ ly prices for the financial year 2017 , V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D has a compensation rate of USD 24 380 per hour .
the Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r &apos;s documents indicated a flight length of 30 minutes from its main base , de Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o airport Vir@@ g@@ in both directions .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using helicop@@ ter is well below that amount .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated reimbursement rates is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimated compensation rates include staff , care and many other irreversible costs , which will be taken into account for annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 rand study , the Ministry of Defence does not include staff costs , but they cover fuel , maintenance and contract costs .
the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an S@@ hari@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ter at the time at the event .
&quot; the point is to show the things made in America this week , &quot; said S@@ pho@@ er .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ t State are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are probably hundreds , if not even thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , on which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the T@@ ru@@ mp was exposed to a helicop@@ ter in the southern hor@@ ror , or not , but he was hiding behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
within the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky addressed representatives by hand@@ ing out media ou@@ tle@@ ts about company products in his personal aircraft fleet .
&apos;@@ I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ ská very well , &apos; said President , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .
G@@ ari Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o - Ver@@ y arrived in peace and joy
the 2011 M@@ il D@@ ae@@ tis hit Š@@ ade@@ i@@ ko@@ t in the last area , 800 m drinks were a foot@@ wear , and the sta@@ di@@ um was taken away with the can@@ na@@ bis .
just before that , he had received a zero leap away from the University of China .
in 2012 , Helsinki was a wealth of cheap injuries , but in London , it received 60 13 points 23 .
I have continued , however .
after the launch of the 2013 Moscow M@@ M@@ F , Estonia &apos;s record time @-@ on @-@ the @-@ spot was the pro@@ tag@@ on@@ ist of a remote hy@@ per@@ ro @-@ stick .
two years later , he became the 15@@ th seat of Beijing and fulfilled the Olympic Games , but that was more than what he wanted to be a disappointment to the ath@@ le@@ tes .
the Ras@@ ke@@ d@@ ali@@ p@@ u was only passed through the soil of Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o when the outcome of the Amsterdam E@@ mb@@ assy was not received a letter at the beginning .
I would just like to put together a proper multi @-@ contest once or for all .
once &apos; , spra@@ yed Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
worse still lies ahead : a month later , his Olympic contest in Ri@@ os was already in the first hur@@ dle .
time had to be taken down - was it necessary to continue with the seven competition at all ?
is the two @-@ day effort worth all this ?
N@@ ei@@ u thought a long time , but found peace .
I could think twice !
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time for us to treat ourselves all and think twice .
&quot; I knew that I am not going to put my dog on the screen , &quot; S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o is talking about his self @-@ cle@@ ans@@ ing .
I was able to turn a clean page and move on with a new impetus .
T@@ re@@ en@@ er Anne hill said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of neg@@ ligence , but he realised that , above all , the spor@@ ts@@ man himself had to get to the bottom .
after all , he was so repres@@ sed by everyone .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; however , he said he is not giving up and he wants to prove what he is worth , says remember .
now there is some kind of peace .
he will do so to his credit .
the contest came back in May , when the Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o set 6@@ 280 points at a new Estonian record at the G@@ öt@@ z@@ ise multi@@ val .
in a high @-@ level competition , he improved his personal top @-@ class bul@@ let with almost a me@@ tre ( 13.@@ 89 ) and ran a record near @-@ peak cur@@ ve .
then there was a feeling of multiple competition that it was not at all a ceiling of ability , but it was only the first hunger to be defe@@ ated .
he has been instru@@ cted for years by a mountain saying that Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o is a Muslim student .
she is ready to be an ath@@ le@@ te , she is a good training .
if something does trouble or is wrong , then he says it immediately .
it feels its own body and has confidence in its own sense .
that is what we need to do .
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we follow it .
the new approach has also been found in Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
&apos;@@ I am not the one who makes the trend to the maximum &apos; , he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right hour , because it also provides a good result .
baby wal@@ ks of young children are happy
the good emo@@ tion has also offered close luck to Mr Š@@ ade@@ i@@ ko@@ u .
both his former friend , Mar@@ is hill and nur@@ se Gre@@ te , recently became parents and has received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;@@ It has been quite interesting &apos; , says Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
one alcohol whose drinking is tanta@@ mount to &apos; training &apos; .
Li@@ ves@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is a mother of such a great wine game that he believes that wine gets better trained than any other thing in the world .
She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist of the University of Y@@ ale .
his message is not about alcohol , or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
by c@@ rying the w@@ ool , by compli@@ cating wine , enjoying it and perce@@ iving it , we are putting our brain into work in order to create a taste for wine .
in the words of She@@ per@@ di , water cells do not actually contain tas@@ tes , but taste arises from the way wine stimu@@ lates the brain .
he makes it a comparison as to how the brain &apos; sees &apos; colour &apos; .
&quot; taste is not wine , taste creates wine as a swe@@ et , &quot; says She@@ per@@ d .
things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , the amount of our age , our summer and even the amount of coal produced by man .
She@@ per@@ d , of course , ad@@ mits that wine is not full of Jews .
&quot; there must be more , &quot; he says .
if you take too much lon@@ ge@@ vity , the system will be over@@ loaded .
excess wine drinking can harm brain rather than profit - according to a 2004 study , people who drink more than three glass lines with wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity .
10 % of staff in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay for colleagues
the figures from the staff search company Fon@@ tes reveal that 10 % of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia are paid less than their colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , wri@@ tes the portal Ge@@ eni@@ us .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay study .
a total of 8 5@@ 77 posts were examined .
63 % of posts were employed by men .
&quot; while only 3 companies said that the pay gap is in favour of men and that the rest of the companies believed there is no pay gap , in reality , the average salary of men per month is 10 % higher than that of women and the average annual salary of men is 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said Fon@@ crates analy@@ sts Il@@ mar Nordic a .

according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
on Wednesday , the head of the UN mission for Afghanistan said that elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
the leader of the United Nations Assistance Mission , Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , said that hundreds of women stand for election in local councils , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; emphasising the importance of women &apos;s role cannot be exagg@@ erated , &quot; he said in his statement on Wednesday .
elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process .
local council elections in Afghanistan and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with the transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is transferred cal@@ mly from one democratically elected government to the next .
according to Mr Ha@@ ys@@ om , women &apos;s strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan is increasing .
according to the independent Ele@@ ction Commission in Afghanistan , 1.2 million women have registered from 3.@@ 6 million registered voters .
the joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both large and small .
there is always too little common time , but the trend with the stic@@ ks offers a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
and what a convenient solution - wherever you were in the summer , live animals are always accompanied by the summer , and you will remember with your fine voice im@@ pati@@ ently : &apos; let us now go to the wall ! &apos;
A@@ stu@@ rias with insu@@ lation - It is a very good thing to have a normal game of gold or a flag of the coast@@ line .
a single is the foundation for survival in the form of sho@@ es and tuna - who would then like to take the form of sand s@@ lee@@ ping from the la@@ kes during the summer ?
it is nice to use children instead of a chic@@ ken !
firstly , it is secure and comfortable , and the race is gradually growing at the same pace as the training and force .
it is also possible to make villages with quite large children .
the child teac@@ hes the balance , counts the cor@@ ps and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
larger children can at the same time make their own villages .
the extent of the movement is determined by the land shortage and you are pul@@ ling up .
keeping the fin@@ gers straight , the ball mini@@ ab@@ ically properly detained .
the child can read the fla@@ mes and feel like a le@@ c@@ ture@@ r .
the planet is an extremely exciting but hope@@ less exercise for the child .
but it is easy to do it .
play @-@ plan@@ k : take a long plan@@ gu@@ Col@@ on@@ n from which to get through .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much easier to do if , in the meantime , a friend can be given a hand .
if you add the burden , you can keep a plan@@ ade , a little tur@@ f , and you can walk around it .
the additional difficulty is to make a smaller child sit on the trees , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
at the same time as the cra@@ cks on the sand , the tri@@ gg@@ ers , the ash and the ch@@ lor@@ ine meat burden will become as conta@@ gious as they were .
a child wal@@ ks on his feet in such a way that his body is distributed equally in advance and behind .
for security , you can keep your hands in hand .
all wal@@ ks and sis@@ ter straight up .
it is possible to fly , cut off , strike a balance and be difficult .
the life of a small engine@@ er is an ex@@ hor@@ tation if he gets a small deal in every fire .
the extra burden will be pre @-@ emp@@ ted .
checks to keep the mark in a neutral position .
children themselves have a lot more to do with ch@@ lor@@ ine meat and pla@@ ice .
the bat@@ teries and w@@ ed@@ ding .
follow the child &apos;s safety , the name of the fields , and the hotel in a neutral position .
the fav@@ ou@@ rite and big fu@@ n of all children !
for the elderly , however , the whole body trend is truly effective .
the sports tools were O@@ tt ( 10 ) , S@@ ä@@ de ( 8 ) , happ@@ iness ( 4 ) .

B@@ oo@@ ked bags are the summer class , which has become a product in its own right in recent years , which is even to be han@@ ged at the top of the hand , and which , despite its modest origin , traders have been able to display a price label in line with the mes@@ h .
there is probably one such thing that has existed once in the life of the law and which has not been aro@@ used much emo@@ tion .
that is simply there , and if there is no , there is nothing at all .
now , on the other hand , be@@ er bags are making a real race , and mo@@ ef@@ ers have changed their head@@ scar@@ ves against simple be@@ er bags for summer months .
this is not only a coast@@ line , but today it is just as popular as a street , and more courageous women even walk it into office .
it is worth making it clear here , however , whether you are still sitting in the summer , or whether you are still paying a sign and a s@@ lap@@ ping computer to reject a little more official summer .
however , the wealth of tolerance has made be@@ er bags a real summer love for women .
for example , when we read foreign fashion logistics , the first thing is that mo@@ e@@ o@@ gh@@ ur@@ ts will prove to be the first thing to do with holiday trips to the local market and obtain some be@@ er bags , which are then the tru@@ ck of a whole holiday period , and which will be accompanied by be@@ aches , the market and also , as a friend , in the lur@@ king of the city .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are even so generous that they buy a hea@@ vier w@@ ol@@ f on the market and sell or give them to their loyal read@@ ers .
in doing so , it is worth noting that there is such a demand among read@@ ers that women ( and men ! ) in the real world would probably be involved in each other &apos;s fishing zone in order to become a happy owner of some homes .
in some ways , this mad@@ ness is also understandable , because it is rare to have these regimes when , in the fashion of yesterday , it has been possible to buy some sort of thing into the h@@ aste for just a few EUR 10 .
it is true that white traders have also found a simple way of ear@@ ning money here , and so more luxury br@@ ands are sold for a few hundred and -@@ 1 000 euros .
obviously , in order to ensure that the richer customers do not have to feel easy to die , who are pro@@ claiming around with some cheap bags .
for example , D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a can buy over EUR 1 000 of be@@ er bags .
however , for the interpretation of the Chan@@ gel bre@@ g@@ ko@@ t , a sum of EUR 6 000 can be found in the circulation .
however , unlike most of the mo@@ tives , be@@ er bags do not come from some major Cape Verde , but they were born far from being the case .
it is said that the be@@ er bags come far from the Philippines , where they have been we@@ aring them widely .
there is , in particular , a dumping of exports , and there is very often no mention of local practices .
it is said that the 14 centuries of nur@@ sing technique origin@@ ated and is quite a series of normal cor@@ ps .
however , since be@@ er bags do not need to be as hard red as cor@@ ps , they will be accompanied by mus@@ cles and other materials that will make the dog more person@@ alised and , by extension , more oper@@ ative .
for example , in recent times , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y bags in which pa@@ ints or s@@ kin@@ s have been thrown in .
however , cop@@ ies can , in particular , be sent to the ac@@ tress J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , the largest bun@@ dled be@@ er of whom had not been seen before .
it was precisely that it su@@ ed the be@@ er with all kinds of clothing complex and it did not even have to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
nowadays , however , the popul@@ arity of the applicants does not play a smaller role , nor does it mean that caring for them is a hot head and , unlike all other summer produc@@ tions , they do not have to be ca@@ red for by special means , but also water and w@@ et .
as is still the case with men@@ tor@@ ing initiatives , apart from the classi@@ cal appearance , the br@@ ands have come out with all possible interpretations .
for example , if they so wish , they can obtain a red @-@ shir@@ t or a tiny ba@@ g .
it is worth remembering , however , that classi@@ cal be@@ er never goes from mo@@ use , but from be@@ er flu .
but what is the classi@@ cal be@@ er , then ?
for centuries now , such be@@ ver@@ ages have been classified as &apos; red @-@ shir@@ ts &apos; , which rese@@ mble their style cor@@ ps , have been opened up and are short , as well as be@@ er , cri@@ pp@@ ers .

G@@ M@@ B is concerned about investment at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant
the trade union expects the leaders of mature producers and Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to be reas@@ sured of long @-@ term production plans at the G@@ las@@ go@@ w factory .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment .
more than 500 people work in the case of H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich know @-@ how and other products .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s owner Pla@@ dis said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years .
there were workers and trade union chair@@ men &apos; is the first to hear &apos; when something changes change in the operation of the factory .
in a letter sent to the head of the company , G@@ M@@ B Scotland asked Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to &apos; alla@@ y concerns about the lack of funding to modernise production lines &apos; .
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the site on the business needs and future investment plan at the time makes our members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely made up of local communities and people around G@@ las@@ go@@ w , a vital pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social housing .
therefore , in terms of jobs , wages and welfare in the east of G@@ las@@ go@@ w , and in the Bre@@ x@@ t , rising living costs and a chronic reduction in production , a thri@@ ving production company in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e is badly needed . &quot;
the Pla@@ dis@@ e representative said : &apos; the head of the customs seat only received a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ ten yesterday , and the company will respond directly to him because we value active contact with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers in customs and representatives of the G@@ M@@ B , which openly discussed a number of issues .
we then discussed with the workers that , like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are reviewing our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million on the Customs site , most of which have gone into production routes and improvements in operations .
we fully understand the heritage of customs as a production site and , if there were any changes in the activities of the object , the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach to Ney@@ ra ?
la li may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main does not give up in its efforts to attract Ney@@ mar into his ranks by making an offer of GBP 18@@ 9 million for his storage , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record con@@ quest ?
this vicious approach has opened the summer as a transitional window , and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the current world record of buying more than twice as much as GBP 89 million in the previous season with the return of Paul Po@@ g@@ ba to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ u .
once the transition has been completed , Ney@@ ra will become the world &apos;s most expensive player and , at the same time , the most highly paid professional ath@@ le@@ tes in the world , who will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from the PS@@ G .
Barcelona is also ang@@ ry , both because of the approach and the break @-@ up of Ney@@ ra , although the source close to the Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ i leadership confirms that the club has always taken the best care for football since its arrival in San@@ to@@ ise in 2013 .
but did the PS@@ G President warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blair Agreement in 2014 , N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all clubs who think about recru@@ iting some of the best players in the PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that , when they concern some of our players , we will accept them and contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have taken over this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the central player of the PS@@ G , Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they would not be allowed to leave the level under any circumstances and that Barcelona could become a set@@ back as a result of this interest by removing one of its precious assets in the form of Ney@@ ra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t .
&quot; Bre@@ x@@ it is in serious danger of breaking the w@@ ool between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r during his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , he stressed . &quot;
according to the hor@@ ror , Britain would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as it fails , will remain part of the European single market .
this would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
another way to make Britain &apos;s departure smoo@@ ther would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said : &apos; surely we could have this with Britain &apos; .
the alternative to this would be to return to customs points , which would declare historical division and political failure .
&apos;@@ T@@ o bring about trade , prosperity and peace &apos; , the Irish Prime Minister said .
he called Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of the daily lives of Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met leaders of the main Irish parties when visiting Bel@@ fast .
the first half @-@ long tri@@ ath@@ on note , Av@@ ja : I@@ ron@@ man , can go through everyone .
today , in the winter capital of O@@ te@@ han@@ l , the largest tri@@ at@@ lon@@ i@@ um in the Baltic States was held , when a half @-@ long I@@ ron@@ man contest took over a thousand tri@@ ath@@ le@@ tes from more than thirty countries .
7@@ 0.@@ 3 miles of design consis@@ ted of 1.9 km of sw@@ im@@ ming , 90 km of cy@@ cling and 2@@ 1.1 km of cy@@ cling .
among others , the first tri@@ ath@@ on of her life was also a sign of Av@@ ja .
&quot; I thought it would be difficult and , in the end , it was difficult to do so , &quot; said Av@@ ja fin@@ i@@ ch .
despite the complexity of Av@@ ja , it is actually a tri@@ ath@@ on that is affordable for almost everyone .
&apos;@@ It is not the lights that kill , but the pace kills &apos; , he said , suggesting that , at a comfortable pace , almost everyone will reach the finishing line .
except O@@ tt Se@@ pp : &apos; everything is fine , but unfortunately he cannot swi@@ m &apos; .
Av@@ ja had already taken a keen lead since February .
at the beginning , 4 @-@ 5 hours a week later , but ten hours a week .
time 05 : 34 : 12 achieved 27@@ 60 places in overall terms .
although Av@@ and lost both to R@@ ai@@ o Pi@@ adz@@ ic ( time 04 : 59 : 53 ) and to J@@ ür@@ gen L@@ ig@@ ale ( time 05 : 06 : 37 ) , she won other competing champi@@ ons in the so @-@ called &apos; prominent classes &apos; .
last year , Tan@@ el Pa@@ da@@ r , who was a &apos; good example &apos; , lost A@@ van in seven minutes ( time 05 : 41 : 54 ) , journalist S@@ ten Te@@ pp@@ an in 16 minutes ( time 05 : 50 : 23 ) , Kal@@ e@@ v K@@ r@@ new and Ra@@ iv@@ o E.

I@@ ron@@ man &apos;s char@@ t of O@@ te@@ pä@@ ä , a German , Johannes Mol@@ dan , was crow@@ ned with 3 : 58 : 27 , Est@@ oni@@ ans were the best I@@ vo Grand time 04 : 14 : 09 .
among women , the Danish Hel@@ le Fre@@ der@@ ik@@ sen won 04 : 24 : 01 : 01 , Est@@ oni@@ ans , Maria J@@ än@@ ese , who lost nearly half a hour to Fre@@ der@@ ik@@ sen and obtained 04 : 58 : 58 .
Av@@ ja went through 1.9 km of sw@@ im@@ ming with 42 minutes and 14 seconds .
he came out of 4@@ 10 positions .
