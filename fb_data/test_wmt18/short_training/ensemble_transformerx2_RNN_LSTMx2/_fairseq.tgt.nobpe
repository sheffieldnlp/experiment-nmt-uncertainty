four members of Cape Verde Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to Mr Posselt , the police in Spain detained the leader of the so @-@ called KCape rovo group , Slashvich Gulevich , who is known in the criminal world under the name of SpinKCape rovski .
Gulevich arrested in Spain was arrested on the court &apos;s trial .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
according to suspicion , the so @-@ called &apos; Cape rovo &apos; criminal Community members aged between 27 and 57 years of life , who commit mainly to drug crimes .
in the province of Mala in Spain , the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained .
in Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of which has been collected according to the criminal community , and two are members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicate that the roles and roles of the criminal community were clearly divided .
the purpose of criminal activities was to commit drug crimes and thus serve the proceeds of crime , &quot; commented on the head of pre @-@ trial proceedings , Public Prosecutor Vagio Verte .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; added the Prosecutor .
it is people who have previously been involved in the law enforcement authorities , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become commonplace for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; commented on the Prosecutor Verte .
the head of the central criminal police service , ago Leis , said that detention was preceded by a preliminary investigation of nearly half a year .
&quot; in the first half of the week , the long @-@ term work was realised and , at the same time , in Estonia and Spain , we suspected of crimes , &quot; said .
Leis added that central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have a good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil card .
these detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can also get them from another European search , &quot; said Leis .
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that , in the absence of a doubt , men can continue to commit new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office requested their arrest and the Court also approved it .
a man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
in the context of this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized in order to ensure confiscation .
the criminal court proceedings are carried out by the central criminal police Office for organised crime and led by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the city &apos;s city of Tallinn was sentenced to blackmail in 2005 and punished him with a five @-@ year imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gulevit≈°it was held the second most important man in the criminal world in Estonia following the Marathkov , Mr Nikolai Tarankov .
Gulevich , from Gulevich from Cape Verde , emerged from the Estonian Union at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Admittedly , he was taxing taxi drivers and prostitution and demanding a monthly tax on businessmen .
international joint operations , the confiscation of criminal proceeds and the entry into force of judicial decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest court rulings , the so @-@ called &apos; Dikayev criminal &apos; , eight accused persons who have been confiscated by EUR 80 000 in criminal proceeds , or the judgment against nine persons in 2006 , that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal community aimed at illegal trade in cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in Eastern Viruland and in southern Estonia .
there is a total of EUR 71 500 of the confiscated criminal income there .
in these criminal matters , it has been a success that police officers exchange information and prosecutors every day with foreign colleagues and , if necessary , act together in any case in the European Union .
civil rights group warns of Mistral travel
the National Association for the Advantes of Colored People ( NAPs ) has warned the people of the Muslim state of Missourisi for discriminatory policies and racist attacks .
in the statement of the Group , the &apos; Missouri State of the State of NASR &apos; , which applies until 28 August 2017 , calls on all the African Americans to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious when moving around the country , taking into account the suspicious racial events that have recently taken place in the state and at this point &apos; .
according to NAPs , the group urged the group to issue a travel warning , both the recent Missouri law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that the state of law targets for the purpose of the law of the State &apos;s law is , to a large extent , minorities .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
they are being drawn up because of their skin colour , beaten or killed , &quot; said Rod Chapel , President of the NAP , The Kansas City Star .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints before . &quot;
this is the first such warning that has been issued by the organisation of the US State .
the group referred to events such as racist insults against black students at Missouri University and the death of 28 @-@ year @-@ old musicians from Tennesta .
the Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year after he had run through the state of petrol and the Missouri police arrested without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the comment refers to the recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri , which shows that in the state , the cars of black car drivers are halted by 75 % more likely than those of white drivers .
&apos;The comment is for people to be aware and to warn their families , friends and collaborators for what might happen in Missouris , &apos; said Chapel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it is to be involved in the bail @-@ out or to inform relatives that they are going through the state . &quot;
according to the latest figures from the FBI hate crime programme , 100 hate crime crimes were documented in Missouris in 2015 , which places the state in a country &apos;s cross @-@ border position in terms of the number of similar offences .
the travel warning is also a response to the new law of Missouri , which makes it difficult for a company to be brought to court for reasons of discrimination in search of housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( ACLU ) had previously issued travel barriers to Texas and Arizona , following the adoption by these states of immigration laws , which obliged local authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration , because , according to the ACLU , it increases racial profiling .
usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .
Hepatitis : what could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
Hepatitis , or incineration , may be caused by five different - A , B , C , D and E hepatitis .
all these viruses highlight the acute burst of the liver .
however , the worst cost is chronic B and C hepatitis , which can develop into a circus , or a lip , a lip and a liver cancer .
the epidemiology Adviser of the Health Agency , Kuulo Kuusar , is saying that acute hepatitis disease is the same for all types of liver incineration - fever , fatigue , rubbish , birth , oliberalisation , cruelty , grey emissions , horse mackerel , meat and excess pain , and swine and limasters .
the last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of the liver burner .
children can undergo hepatitis without disease .
the various species of combustion can only be identified on the basis of laboratory research data .
extreme hepatitis can go to chronic hepatitis and go for decades without disease , which means that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous disease .
Mr Kunilr highlights different forms of hepatitis and describes their culmination more closely .
the hepatitis virus is spreading from a disease to humans and infectious us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , on the way to the sex , on the hands of the infected person and on food , soil , objects , contact and consumption of drugs .
a hepatitis hepatitis was carried out by family members and carers , people suffering from chronic pay , sex people , sex men with men , drug users , the high spread of hepatitis A .
vaccination can be prevented by vaccinations , in particular by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot and hepatitis A risk group .
in addition , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to wash or disinfect hands , before eating food , to wash all fruit and vegetables .
hepatitis viral viruses spread to the blood of the sick man , drug injection , therapeutic , augmentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated sites ( tootherapets , pregnancy facilities ) , donor blood , hepatitis hepatitis , sex with the person of hepatitis and hepatitis sufferers .
the hepatitis hepatitis risk group includes drug users , sex partners of infected people , sex men , newborn mothers , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , healthcare , rescue workers and police officers , and passengers visiting countries with hepatitis B .
in order to prevent hepatitis , it is possible to vaccinate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vaccinate people from risk groups and , in addition to chronic pay @-@ related diseases , HIV infections , sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes .
hepatitis other preventive measures are : refrain from the hygiene and manure of strangers , other sharp tools and systalgic @-@ councillors , tomatoes and augmentation , and the use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection , or prevention of sexual risk @-@ taking .
vaccination against hepatitis is part of the national immunisation scheme in Estonia and free of charge for children .
Hepatitis C viruses spread when dealing with the blood of a sick person , drug injection , therapeutic , augmentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated foetuses , donor blood , hepatitis hepatitis , sex sex and hepatitis hospital for animals / newborn babies .
C @-@ hepatitis @-@ hepatitis @-@ infected drug users , sex partners of infected people , sex men , infant infant mothers , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids are exposed to health , rescue workers and police officers , HIV @-@ infected persons and passengers visiting countries with hepatitis C .
C hepatitis preventive action is : refrain from the hygiene and manure of strangers , other sharp tools and systalgic @-@ councillotteries , gooking and augmentation , and the use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection .
there is no vaccine against hepatitis C .
Ahepatitis is caused by hepatitis D virus , which is multiplying in the presence of hepatitis B .
this is due to the presence of hepatitis B , with hepatitis B or superinformation , of chronic B hepatitis .
the hepatitis virus is spreading exposure to blood and other body liquids , contaminated with needles @-@ counters , sexually and rarely infected animals .
d hepatitis risk group is chronic B hepatitis viral and non @-@ hepatitis B people .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against hepatitis B , which also protects people from infection with hepatitis D virus .
hepatitis viral viruses spread by feeble means of drinking water and food , including low heat @-@ treated animal meat , fish and marine carbons , donor blood , joint systalls and infected animals .
passengers can be infected with high levels of hepatitis E in countries .
Epatitis preventive measures are the enforcement of hygiene requirements : to wash or disinfect hands after boarding , prior to food production and feed , after the care of the sick .
Fruits and vegetables are washing before consumption , to avoid eating little hot @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , only safe drinking water and to avoid drug consumption .
although the last round of competitors tried to get rid of a four @-@ fold Olympic winner , 34 @-@ year @-@ old Farah final sgel found strength and won 26.49.51 .
the Farah did not think long enough , after the finalists , with the husband Tania and children .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much welcome my family .
it was wonderful to be with them , &quot; said Farah journalists .
Farah is targeted in London at the fifth edition of 5 000 and 10 000 metres of golden dump .
all of this is possible if it is believed .
despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connorm in Daam gold , Gustav Klimti , the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch @-@ Baueri , the extraordinary story of &apos; one art works from birth to the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna &apos; .
however , more closely in history .
the inflammatory information on the subject would perhaps have been watered down in the bud , a narrower subject would have been allowed to have more influence on the extraordinary nature of the title .
at the moment , it would be like two books : Gustav Klimti and his painting &apos; Daam gold &apos; , the story of Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri , and a much larger and more comprehensive history of the Honourable Jewish families and the German occupation , with its subsequent effects in Austria .
the first third of the book is in the middle of a wedding Vienna cultural life and who , in the Austrian capital itself , can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago life was going around Ringstrass , or how the Centrali coffee turned all its heads when the climate was introduced .
the concentration of cultural characters was high in one of the richest cities in Europe , and when you see the name familiar with the book , some of them seem to be more cultural than a gram .
at the same time , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where untreated arson and the highest level of suicide in Europe was , as if nothing else , it adds to development .
or perhaps , however , every couple of couples &apos; lips will add to the cultural life of the 20th century in Vienna .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
the Sajandium was almost one in ten people in Vienna .
parents were also newcomers in Vienna , but by the time when the aid for As was opened twice by the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Blochevery and the Klimman in his famous painting , his father had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire Empire .
however , the Adelet &apos;s life , which he belonged to , has not been drawn up .
if you look at the &apos; Daam gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end @-@ of @-@ life infection was a more beautiful socialist and dream of a trip to the Soviet Union .
for 1903 , when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband &apos;s luggage from the Klimtitis , the last moment was the painting maker in Vienna .
the climt paid at the time 4 000 kroon , a quarter of the price of a good location for the rural house .
the fact that there was a suspicion of the modelli of the masters of the masters , the sugar magnati , was not discouraged .
as far as the deletion is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between the modelli and the artist created during the work continued to the end of life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connor - &apos; Daam gold &apos; .
the Gustav Klimti Cup , Adele Bloch @-@ Baueri , an extraordinary story , &quot; Varrak 2016 , Aldo Randland .
just before the start of the work with the Adelega , Mr Ravennas San Vitale was in charge of telecommunications , and the investigators think that it was precisely there that the wonderful mosars of the mosaic Easter , Theodora , gave an artificial idea of making a golden tree as a golden piece of fashion .
the Klimt presented his &apos; Daami gold &apos; in Vienna in 1908 and at the same time ( in 1907 @-@ 1908 ) , one of the golden land &apos; Snovel &apos; was born .
artistic historians did not notice the similarity of two women .
how does Hitler relate to nature ?
&quot; I think that , in my friend , Mr Klimti , I am owed to him to make his work available to the public , &quot; wrote Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer a couple of years after the departure of the artist ( Klimt died in February 1918 ) to the Director of the Belvedere museum , and wanted their family to go to the museum .
six years before the death penalty , the Kliml had been drawn up .
he also asked for the husband to leave his two sports courses and four Gustav Klimti landscapes to the Austrian Galspecial .
in his truths , he gave the floor to Mrs Mariana and Mr Lui .
one year after the climt had finished the &apos; Austrian Mona lisa &apos; , it had attempted to escape from the Viin Kawart de Akademine , Adolf Hitler , but failed to be a footnote .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ Semitism is considered to be the reason for the Jewish professors not to be admitted to the anti @-@ Semitism , none of his culminers was actually Jewish .
in any case , the Austrian Galspecial task referred to in the case of Maria Maria Galspecial had changed considerably by 1939 , which had become important in the search for the work of the Vienna rich Jewish art collections .
Hitler &apos;s personal art musicians also had some work at home , but not those of the Klimti .
Sixty years after the artistic robbery of the Nazis , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute between the Austrian Government and the heirs of Bloch @-@ Bauer .
in this regard , it should be noted that if &apos; Snovel &apos; is seen in Vienna in Belvedere Castle , Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer &apos;s &apos; Daami gold &apos; must be seen to travel to New York to Neue Galspecial .
and before Vienna , the aforementioned book will also be read .
even if you do not plan to look at the work of the climate , because at least my emotion , after the closure of the book , was more Nazi and Jewish than the magic and modell Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer resold for USD 135 million .
so , not so much a tree , rather than a magic embassy - and a very moving story .
it significantly facilitated the orientation of the events at the beginning of the book of the Baudis &apos; relatives .
17 @-@ year @-@ old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonia &apos;s record
in the event of life , gold was very close to the personal record of its own 200 m seliflowing , flooding 2.16.62 .
the Tippmark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ old pirates every week since the Canadian cheese Championships received 2.16.58 , the Priit Aope &apos;s Ujugation blog .
in the last instance , ten years &apos; A finalists &apos; .
in Finally , he went through a distance of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful top @-@ level .
Alina Kendziorn , Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.15.13 ) remained a little over half a second .
Estonia &apos;s all @-@ time ranking rose by the third , and its fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of all the times in Estonia .
the young hope of the future lies in the launch of Canadian adult Championships of 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in balballs and 200 mm and 400 mm .
last week , Canadian cheese championships took place in Toronto , and gold made successful start @-@ ups there .
he won 200 m in a silver bullet with 2.03.22 .
so quickly , this distance was swamped by the last year in 2008 .
the Golf has gone through faster than ever in Estonia only a record Estonian record of Elina Parevika .
in Canada , a vibrant guardian won 100 m medal in the baltulation of a wonderful personal record and 56.66 of the new Estonian season .
for example , the old Kertu ly Alnek of his year has distanced it by just one century more quickly .
in his personal excellence , he reached a further 100 m in the opening of a letter of 1.03.69 when he entered into a seamless swamp .
on a longer distance , he has only reached the seventh place when he became a finalist 2.17.31 .
gold is currently leading to four different distances from the Estonian season .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics insured teeth
the holiday time is in the hands of the US President , Donald Trumple .
however , as the Trump has so far been one of the President who has taken the most holiday days , the critics are already wearing teeth .
according to the US Guard and CNN , the President intends to have 17 @-@ day leave in the Bedminster , which is located in New Jerseys .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , the anti @-@ Trumpi leave has already been spoken for weeks .
they are asking the Olympic Games for too frequent treatment .
it is the President &apos;s practice to spend a week in his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey &apos;s cotton .
incidentally , Trump is not the most puzzled President in his 196 term of office .
for example , George W. Bush has already reached 67 days on holiday , Barack Obama has less than Trump , but 21 days .
however , things tend to be forgotten quickly by the Olympic Games .
a few days after becoming President , he said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; in Trump , so that there will be no time for a long holiday , because there is a great deal to be done .
he also expressed his outrage about Barack Obama &apos;s leave three years ago .
the current President wrote on Twitter at the time : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , plays a golf , it is on the brakes and the jungle concerts , journalists in the country are in the sun &apos; .
according to the white house officials , 17 @-@ day golf club visits to pollen have no place .
it is officially called &apos; working holiday &apos; , during which there is no time for the Trul to read or for other forms of action .
in addition , there was also a second reason for working leave .
it is precisely that the white house is being replaced by a Western @-@ style pension system , and therefore all staff had to leave it .
the West is also located in Ovalkacabinet and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West in August , if there are 38 degrees and there is no conscription , &quot; said Lindsay Walters , who stressed that the President will continue to work during the holiday period .
where President Trump will spend 17 days , you will get an idea of video .
blocking critics from Facebook to do not stand up for the Head of State if you do not tolerate the criticism of the voters .
the father of our country knew a great deal about the unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans loved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to turn him into a bullet for everything , from internal politics to his political principles .
of course , he was annoyed by the criticism .
however , he did not force his critics to remain silent .
because , in the year 1783 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and , in darkness and silence , we could be led by sheep to the massacres &apos; .
this brings me to Maryland kuberner Larry Hogan , who is struggling to be more in Washington .
the Hogan has blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the Union for Freedom of American Civil Liberties ( ACLU ) therefore referred to the Court of Justice .
the Kuberner officer &apos;s officials tear the action empty and web commentates slide away from reactions in a style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos; .
&quot; this is just Facebook , &quot; said many .
but that is what counts .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan .
it is an amazing popular republicist in the democratic state .
his approval rate is the second highest ranking among the country &apos;s 50 Governor .
Hogan is not an unthinkable response .
it has led the state firmly and remains strictly firm in its principles .
in addition , it has used the main tool in communicating with its constituents quite deliberately on Facebook , for example , after the chemical waste , for the first time in a stubborn presentation of its own rock .
thus , the Governor &apos;s cows are a public forum with a formal label , which is managed by the staff of taxpayers &apos; dollars to block people who are visiting Kenya and , ultimately , dangerous .
in an interview with Mr Chastel , the representative of the Hogan press , defended the behaviour of the Governor of the Governor , claiming that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a modelling .
however , it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet trollers on the web , spawers or people full of hatred .
the post spoke to a number of people who have been blocked by Hogan .
and that is what they are the people who are in contact with their elected leaders , the owner of the company and the passport , not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were disrespectful , thought @-@ out and not at all .
Mr Pastor quoted the Bible in his post , with the emphasis placed on the Catholic Church .
the lawyer from Marylan Bowie , Lakshm Sarma Raman , did not instigate hatred , but rather hate crime .
&quot; I said politely that I am disappointed , because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &apos; he wrote The mail news story in the heading .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , when many people comment on the same subject , some of them immediately call it an indifferent collective effort , rather than acknowledging that this is a great deal of concern with citizens . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s office called &apos; targeted spam attack &apos; would probably invite others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era allows messages to be easily matised by simply blocking criticism or deleting a negative comment .
it is a much cleaner thing than the old , when the workers had to be sent out to do the same , so that they gather newspapers with critical editorial letters and burn them or arrest protestors and forced them to remain silent .
however , that is exactly what is happening now , just digitally .
the Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media .
President Trumpi has brought to court Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter &apos;s stream .
one of the first signs of court rulings on this subject was made last week in Virginia .
Mr James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control of the County of Loudouni has violated the first revision of the Constitution , when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page .
Mr Ktuckys visited the ACLU Facebook and Twitter for the use of him , Governor Matt Bevinit ( R ) .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar impact on the Internet .
between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers and anonymous writers dared in his way of leadership .
and even then Washington had to face anonymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers such as Juricola , Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , making the decisions of Washington land .
according to the historical documents collected by George Washington , the web @-@ based George Washington project , he swamped the cabinet with petitions criticising his views on the British friendship , trade and shipping agreements .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , special opinions and debates are the foundations of our country .
and the right leadership means accepting this .
Ronan Rafferty hopes on the comfort of the territory of Renaissance Cclubs
the former European Chairwoman Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of the home territory in the next three days , when the East Lobor Renaissance Club golf courses take place 25 .
the Northern Ireland , which was in the vicinity of Archerfield Linony last year , ahead of the last round before Paul Ealhighlighted , is a new place for manoeuvre , and is playing the role of the club founder and executive leader , Jerry Soledi , instead of the seat of the club .
&quot; I saw how Renaissance Club was built , and now we see how the club is blowing in full glory , &quot; said Rafferty .
&quot; the players see the path in their best shape , it is in a brilliant state .
Jerry has done an excellent job in building this place .
he is a keen supporter of golf games and is proud of what has been achieved here .
this will allow the path to be presented perfectly . &quot;
an Englishman is ever looking forward to being able to defend the championship for the first time , even though the man has won both the European Toubon and the European challenge in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this is a very special feeling , &quot; said Southportis &apos;s beating player .
&quot; I could not defend my Extremadura OAntwerp title because it was taken off after a year after my victory .
it is natural to come back to this chicken .
this is an excellent place to play a golf .
I remember the memories of last year , and my wife , Mrs Sharon , was a special victory for last year .
this was a very special time , which we will always be at the heart of our hearts . &quot;
on the soil of the country , Gary Orr , who joined the European Year of Creativity , will return to the competition once he received 50 .
this is his first event in Scotland following the participation of Aberdeen asset Management Scottish Openil in 2013 .
&quot; it is always a little more meaningful to play at home , &quot; said Helensburgh man Orr .
&quot; Denmark had a good deal to do , but at the same time , you also have an additional feeling .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and I have shown quite a decent golf game .
I am satisfied with the progress made so far . &quot;
the former MasterCard &apos;s winner , ian Woosnam , and the champion of the seafood , Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , mark James and mark McNulty .
Orr and former Ryder Captain Sam Turin are two of the six chambers in competition , the rest of which are Andrew Oldcorn , Stephen McAllister , bill Longmuir and ross Drumond .
access is free of charge , and car parking costs GBP 5 per passenger car and GBP 10 per car with two or more passengers .

poverty and death in the gold @-@ rich country of Indonesia
if Mr Degei &apos;s dinner is produced , he will not use lead .
he seldom uses even boys .
the Indonesian in Papua province Paniai , the capital of the Municipality of Paniai , places the house in the house of a house in the place of direct fire in the local language .
in half an hour &apos; time , the coal @-@ fired sludge will be taken from fire and skinned with unbearable hands .
the Degei is sitting on the other floor of the furniture of furniture , and yet it is also doing its daily homework , for example , washing the bath water from a nearby sex .
the role of the hole will be played by unscrupulous support .
since he is the four women of his husband , he has not been appointed to take care of any contempt .
Polygaamia is common here on May .
it may be dangerous to work late , however , most of the men of the village are unemployed and many of them drink hard , and there are still soldiers here .
&quot; no one dares to go around after five o &apos;clock in the village , &apos; he says .
this is a rare pilot in Papua m√§ki , which is the former Dutch colony , which was brought under Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum , which was forced to vote in front of the forces .
the movement towards the government of the Netherlands , which has freed up the power of the people of the Netherlands , is fast @-@ track against the government of Jakarta , which is still keeping the region under its strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially split into the Pope and the Western Pope , so that the independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island .
the majority of the wheel is both remote and abandoned , and in order to arrive here , 90 minutes from the capital of the province , Jayapuri , and then go through a five @-@ hour journey with a rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city of around 19 000 inhabitants is made up of tree houses surrounded by bars and covers lainous iron roofs , which have been converted into different tone for the yellow boxes .
very few indicators have taken place here , not to mention journalists , and there have been hardly any foreigners here .
prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries , Mee Pago paints a God called Tamee .
there were also other changes .
&apos;We were not used to wear such clothing &apos; , &apos; says Degei , referring to our colourful approach to the market , to the plug and to the private sector .
&quot; before that , we have only had a plant cow . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
however , it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
just 100 km away from Paniao , which is a mountainous province with 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey , is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , which belongs to Fbetg McMoran , a company operating in Phoenixis .
in 2015 alone , around USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copies were extracted from Freport .
in addition , it will be possible to galvanise the supply of consumer timber , which is estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these riches are the source of the suffering of boats , as they result in the presence of a powerful Indonesian army .
the New York Times 2005 study showed that Freport payments in the period 1998 @-@ 2004 cost local military and military units around USD 20 million , including USD 150 000 to one of the officers .
Pope attempts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden and are routinely re @-@ routed .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1969 , and thousands more have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the army in Indonesia .
according to the Committee on Human Rights in Asia , the mass killing of the genocide in Papua tribal mountains in the 1970s was a measure of genocide .
last year alone , over 3900 peaceful protests were arrested by the police in Indonesia .
the 2016 report on &apos; We will lose all &apos; by Burma &apos;s Archbishop , contains testimony to the atrocities committed in the past year , such as extrajudicial executions , torture ( one second report shows that rape and electric shocks are particularly widespread ) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; the number of victims is difficult to read , because such incidents will take place every week , &quot; says Andreas Harsono , a researcher of Human Rights Watch .
Krums are still more strongly closed because Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new settlements from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demographics are changing because of the Muslim economic migrants coming from the inhabitants of Indonesia , Kalimantan , Sumatra and Sulawes islands .
Prince songs are sold in the gallery and with mixed vegetables to gado @-@ gado @-@ gado , which are serted together with the ground level .
local cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables from local boats on the traditional market , &quot; explains the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Italians born in the Paniais who worked on behalf of the province of Jayapuri .
&quot; Syrians Fronmama @-@ mama &#91; women &#93; will therefore lose their market share . &quot;
the President of Indonesia , Joko Widodo , who is known as Jokow , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Pope .
the former pump won the presidential Palace in Papua 29 constituencies 27 , including Paniai .
however , the Pope has changed very little and the local feel cheated .
&quot; our hearts have been broken , because in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jokow in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes in terms of restoring justice , &apos; says .
in fact , only two months after the resignation of Jokow in October , Paniai was in a low position .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the Roma were singing to Christmas , when two Indonesian soldiers were blinded by a motorcycle .
children have told them that they should be included in the front lights .
according to the words of the local passport , Yavedt Tebai , one of the soldiers insulted their voting tone and later returned to four soldiers .
according to victims and spectators , in drink @-@ driving soldiers , children were driven by children and beaten them with their guns .
then one of the soldiers shot among children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yulianus Yeimot , was so cruel that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , the building of the close electoral Commission was burnt down , and the next day , things were even more .
around 1 000 young men , women and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police and military management centre in order to demand justice .
they were carrying out direct repair chips and presented Papua mee pago to waita @-@ tantsu , during which poultry songs were buried around and buried .
some protesters started to lecture the police and the military .
&apos;If the mass of the population shows more than three times resistance , let them down , &apos; it was said in a formal document that has seen a magazine , but which has not been issued to local media publications .
the city of Kego Koto , the oldest city of Yeremias Kayme ( 56 ) , felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained , asking for a crowd to go home .
nobody was willing to listen .
&quot; turning me to the left , I was suddenly shot in the left , &quot; he said in his magazine at the time of the treasure of a tree in his German colours .
we still do not know who the fire was , but it says that the soldiers &apos; rigs gathered in the month came from .
&quot; there was a lot of people , a lot of children in the House , adding it .
the local man , Alfius Youw , has been killed three times , according to a witch .
&quot; I would like to come to him and in his body to make sure that it is with him , &quot; said the magazine at Yohanes , who uses only one name in many of the indicators .
&quot; I saw that he has died ... Snovel leta . &quot;
the chief inspector of Papua police , Yotje Mende , said to reporters that he was only responsible for the security of his department , as it was attacked .
&quot; we must protect ourselves if we are threatened to kill , &quot; said Vice @-@ President Pudjo Sulistiyo , the spokesman of Papua police , in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protestors were killed and many injured .
the news about the killings reached Jakartail only next day .
three weeks later , Jokow Jayapura made a passionate speech where he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses that took place in Pope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would introduce an ADR mechanism to address human rights crimes .
however , almost immediately , excuses were also followed .
&quot; most crimes happened long ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and the early 1990s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
on 5 June in Jakartas , on 5 June , Wiranto withdrew his words , saying that he has no intention of creating a Pope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything will be resolved by law &apos; .
the Wiranto , who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in relation to the death of more than 1 000 people in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved , including what happened in Paniai .
the families of the victims of the Paniai have adopted such claims with a gloomy mistrust .
&quot; I have been heard four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Yohanes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that , years later , fear is still alive .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I fear that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I am shot . &quot;
his brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid of this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bury four victims .
&quot; after the burying of the bodies , the army had to look at me , &apos; he says .
the celebrations have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the inhabitants of the village of Indonesia were shot in Deiyais , neighbouring Paniai .
one person was killed and 17 wounded , including children , when he went to war between the inhabitants of the villages and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an unconscious man to hospital .
this male people , 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ravianus Douw , who drowned into a nearby river , died on the road to hospital .
the recent village &apos;s inhabitants protested at the site of the company &apos;s office .
according to the police , the people of the villages were storing the police , which was followed by the latest alerts .
however , according to the local authorities , mobile Britons ( Indonesia &apos;s military police ) started to shoot at the people , killing one person .
&quot; we were in great panic , we are afraid of revenge , &quot; said 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and saw the insect of those injured .
&quot; I have beaten myself two days in my own house . &quot;
the Deiyai Parliament has called for the police officers involved to be held accountable and for the withdrawal of the police from the area of mobile Brigade .
Paniai has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the meals , moni , dans and dammal tribes living in Papua bad .
many of them have joined the army of Liberation ( VPL ) insurgency , which , according to its own , protects the rights of boats , by organising attacks and kidnappings among the Indonesian soldiers .
some VPL leaders come from Paniao , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
in response to this , the army , under the pretext of protecting the sovereignty of the country , has been arrested in Paniai over recent years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them never appear again .
among the people of Papua people , Panians are known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty feeds dissatisfaction .
the low rice that is sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
the Leib is the same unavailable .
people are growing all their food themselves , mainly at the helm , in addition to a little fruit and vegetables .
farming is the work of women , each of whom can care for four or five base fields .
they usually keep most of the harvest to the family , the rest is sold on the local market .
ten batates cost only 10 000 Indonesian sites ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have deepened between inshore boats and new migrants , who have arrived at the Nabire airport from the opening of new flight routes .
these few jobs , which exist , go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
the Pope himself often does not have the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the village because there are no jobs and no money , &quot; says John Gobai , Chairman of the Paniai tribal Council .
segregation keeps the eyes of the world away from the Pope .
in addition , strict restrictions on foreign media remain .
at the beginning of this year , French journalists , Franck Escudie and Babridge Longchamp , were expelled from the Pope , because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they had been given a rare film licence .
according to the Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch , Pcomm Kine , the Vice @-@ President of the Asian department , has failed to implement Jokow &apos;s election promises to lift the restrictions on transparency and development reports .
&quot; in Indonesia , journalists from the most eastern provinces and the Western Pope reports are threatening to face new threats to the rejection and blacklisting of a visa , &quot; he said in a statement .
the lack of a press watch means that international pressure on the government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua near neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries were encouraged by Tonga , Nauru , Belau , Tupain , Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands to examine the &apos; various wide @-@ ranging crimes &apos; in Paniai , including the shooting of Paniai .
the same countries have historically supported VPL .
Arrmanatha Nasir , the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed the accusations of a group by saying Jakartas to journalists : &apos; Indonesia still applies democratic order and freedom of the press so that evidence of human rights cases is difficult to bury &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to notice .
when the Dutch official delegation visited Jayapura on 4 May Jayapura , the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , was interrupted by the local people at the meeting , but the source of anonymous desire to remain silent , urging : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , the new presidential elections will take place in 2019 , but the boats do not believe they will vote in favour of Jokow again .
&apos;Jokow is a man with good intentions , but the people around him who are involved in the shooting of Paniai &apos; say &apos; Hobai , President of the Council &apos; .
he wants to give Jokow to understand that , in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army , they are suffering from poor education and health services .
according to Gobai , the people of Paniai , like other boats , regard their voice to Jokow as a debt that has to be paid .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite the misfortune and intimidation , the families of the victims of the Paniai fire were still coping with the last symbolic objection to the landing of one victim &apos;s body of police and the army in response to the land .
knowing that justice may never be put on its feet , they will at least not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Yacobus with a halt .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
needing Dubai Torch &apos;s pill for the second time .
on Friday , there was one of the world &apos;s most senior housing storms in Dubai , forcing hundreds of people to escape from this 337 metre and 79 regular buildings .
this is the second fire that has been ravaged in just two years , which is being called on to happen in Turin , or Tusvikur .
the building was evacuated , none of the injuries were reported and there were no direct fire @-@ related causes .
&quot; we sleep and wake up to the fires and people &apos;s fears .
we would be waiting for a tree and we took around 10 minutes to get down to the 50th order , &apos; said to the Reuterans one person who called himself George &apos; .
according to Dubai civil protection officers , fire fighters were also deleted at around 4 o &apos;clock this morning at local level ( 00.00 GMT ) and jailed the building .
the government said that they are working to ensure shelter for those affected .
this incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on high @-@ level external soil in the world .
during the investigation carried out by the steering Board in Torch after the 2015 fire , it was found that the most damage was suffered by Assyrians - the decoral panels and isolation of the external surface .
the British police have said that they believe that the London Grenportfolio Tower isolation and a fast @-@ track panel could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June , which killed around 80 people .
see : these phones are likely to be sold in the autumn
language and heart are the time for technological games , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony XZ Premium came to sale , as well as in the autumn , new hitt telephones are expected .
according to the Tele2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Semother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by an innovative design , an eye @-@ fast sner , a serser @-@ servani 4K resolution on the screen and the ultra @-@ fast process .
Samsung Galaxy S8 , which has also reached the top of Estonia &apos;s smartphone sales table , was a great elephant in the tech world .
in the autumn , it will allow for a more tidal high @-@ speed charger , a more resilient , high @-@ quality cameras and greater water and customs security .
he added that , on the basis of rumours , you can already speculate and predict the four top models that are likely to be conquered by the streets .
these four smartphone excellence models will reach poppers in the autumn of this year .
the expected iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach polephants in mid @-@ September .
however , what the new Apple model looks like , and what it can do , is spreading a lot .
if the iPhone 7 did not lead to significant differences between iPhone 6s , Apple &apos;s tenth birthday is expected to see the new model completely separate from previous ones .
there has been talk of four colours : black , white , rock and chromium .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the entire telephone front , has lost their homes and fingerprints have been built on the screen .
Apple &apos;s design director JonyIve demands that the new iPhone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk of the iPhone version .
in addition to the horizon , the unmanageable charging and even higher quality cameras can be expected to accelerate the A11 process .
it is certainly one of the most expected smart phones in the year .
the prior order of the new model Galaxy will start on 23 August .
there has been a lot of rumours about what the new Galaxy is going to see .
Admittedly , even more business users are meant , and the S pen will allow even greater functionalities .
the Telefont should have two cameras , one of which is a lainurt and the other with a narrower view of television content .
at the moment , no one knows what two of the cameras are capable of , but in any case it is the first test of Samsung , which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8 in terms of quality .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August .
although Nokia has sold three smartphones this year with Nokia 6 , there is still a lack of their flag - Nokia 8 , which is already being presented on 16 August .
we are looking forward to 5.3 @-@ dust screens and ultra @-@ fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processes and more resilient avenues .
in case of Nokia , there is also talk of aluminium corps and significant levels of water and customs security IP68 .
like Samsungevery , Nokia in the new model has two camera , which is produced by an optimist company Zeiss .
if Sony &apos;s firm flag has been XZ Premium so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smart phones will be added in the near future , with even more innovative functions .
we expect a smart phone that is slightly more modest than XZ Premium , but at least the same good or better cameras .
on the new model of Sony , it has been speculated that its screen is at least hot .
what the reality is , we can already see very soon , because traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flag vessel at the International Technological University , IFA , which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September .
according to transcripts leaked by telephone calls , Trump Mexico pressed for the payment of the border wall
the Washington post unveiled the telephone calls between the President of the United States , Donald Trumpi , and the Mexican and Australia Heads of State .
on 27 January , Enrique Pena Nieto , the President of Mexico , went to the President of Mexico , to stop public proclaiming that he does not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President , with him , with his public condemnation of the wall , said : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the Trump set out his presidential campaign to build a long @-@ term wall and age on the southern border of the United States , so that Mexico is paying for this project .
the transcripts were also published in his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turnbull , which reveals an intense debate .
Mr Trump said to Mr Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on refugees from Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; nervous &apos; and &apos; stupid &apos; , and he said that the agreement that was made during the Obama Government would give him the impression of &apos; lead &apos; , because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the Trump ended the speech by telling Turnbull that &apos; this was the most unpleasant speech of the day &apos; .
the Court of Justice did not take a complaint on the case of the city of OC MRP in which the Tartu city has rejected their offer for bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 2029 .
this is a letter which rejected the OC MRP city of Litu Tartu buses , as the offer did not meet the requirements , explained Anneli Aputin , the President of the Tartu City Service .
this is the procurement of intra @-@ Tartu cities for the period 01.07.2019 @-@ 30.06.2029 .
the city of MRP Liine referred to the Court of Justice for the decision of the Tartu District Court .
the national court did not take this procedure .
although many people in the social media complain that the Weekt Festival is disrupting their night and the entire city is full of the brakes , there are also many who have no negative say on a lasting festival .
I am even positively surprised that the supermarket was so polite !
I did not see any ambiguity or courtesy .
even the Gulf I saw , &apos; says a wave .
&quot; it is good that it is coming , and it is known to be a joyss , which is a winter like a winter , &quot; he will gladly add .
a wave of bullying from the dose is not destroyed .
if , in the middle of the city , he still heard that music is being played in the rank , then the music has not yet arrived at his home .
&quot; but I hope I hear , &quot; he will gladly say .
Mrs Agnes , too , talks about the fact that the Grand Festival is rather a good thing for the skies , which will make a significant contribution to the turnover of local merchants .
in addition , it welcomes the fact that the summer capital has come to such a large extent .
the woman of Peolans does not .
although I am no longer on the coast , it is nice that rand has revived .
and it is good that the people are moving , and that has been the case three times , &apos; says a woman .
the first time was probably a little worse .
&apos;then perhaps there were complaints &apos; , he is wondering .
however , what he said is normal for the summer capital cities .
&quot; this Weekise is a very good prophmo for our small city , &quot; says Harri , who is hiding in the park .
life and m√∂ll have also not been hit by his daughter .
but for that ?
we should all pull together .
think about how it would be better to communicate between nations .
after all , the music man does not appear .
that is not the case , although I live near there .
&apos;Well people are able to save and there is no paint &apos; , he speaks .
the visitors who have come to the skies are , he said , courtesy .
&quot; they are , of course , a little exaggerated with the bottles , but young people are young people and the issance - let us go , but be people and we can do it ! &quot;
the people who have travelled to this end have travelled to a distance , whether to relatives or to acquaintances .
&quot; however , in general , the festival has a positive impact on people like this medal , &quot; talks with children in Tiina .
his family , too , is not distracted by the Festival , even though it was copied even further last year .
last summer , we heard more .
we are living in a city outside that , in fact , there is a lot of miles away from the coast of the river , &apos; he is talking about it .
Pearson cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revitalise business
the British educational company Pearson said on Friday that it will cut 3 000 jobs and reduce its interim dividends by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to tackle the threat of business .
the jobs that are being created , according to John Fallon , are likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , will be accompanied by 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring .
Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs by another GBP 300 million ( USD 394 million ) under the third cost reduction programme , in order to try to revive business that has been hit by the transition to digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell last month &apos;s participation in the Penguin Random House to its partner companies Bertelsmann , said that their expectation for a year has not changed since the 1 % increase in the sales income was announced in the first half of the year to GBP 2.05 billion .
on Sunday , the rainy season will continue to soar .
in Estonia , on Sunday , the sun with the rainy season comes from the sun , the wind outbreaks are sometimes very strong .
in Estonia , the Ecolabel must be clarified in the cloud .
there are a number of sides of the hook , perhaps there may be a drawback .
the south @-@ west and the west of 5 @-@ 11 , the outbreaks up to 14 , islands and coasts up to 18 m / s .
air temperatures are 13 @-@ 17 degrees .
the day will come with a mixed picture .
there are several sides of the hook , there is a chance of being put in place .
the south @-@ west wind of 6 @-@ 12 , the outbreak of up to 15 , islands and the coast up to 20 m / s .
air temperatures are 18 @-@ 21 degrees .
attack in Kabul : suicide attack killed by NATO soldier
the suicide bomber , according to officials , attacked military convoys in Kabul , the capital of Afghanistan , killing one NATO soldier and wounded several of you .
the NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to local reports , three civilians were also killed in the incident in the town of Qarabaghi .
this bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in the Herati mosque attack .
on Monday , two people were killed in Kabul near the Iraqi Embassy .
the NATO statement said that the explosion of Thursday evening took place when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by &apos; man @-@ made explosive body &apos; .
according to the statement , everything has been injured in a stable state and is treated in the US military hospital in Bagram .
according to the Correspondents , the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( Mexico ) , are a serious source of concern for the forces in Baghdad in Qarabaghi .
according to the UN , at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , the car bomb in Kabul was killed by at least 30 people in Kabul .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the centre of the city , which is the most deadly military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the President of the United States , Donald Trump , is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country &apos;s military and police forces .
according to the Correspondents , the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf Ghan .
the EPA annulled the decision to postpone the regulation after the sharks
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA ) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama @-@ Time Regulation , which obliges states to limit emissions from the summer , one day after the 15 states complained to court for this process .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday with the designation procedures for the &quot; Main content &quot; of 2015 , saying that it shows the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our national partners and listen to them , &quot; said Scott Pruitt in a statement by the head of the EPA .
the Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the rates of shareholder content in the various parts of the country , in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to meet the highest standard of air quality in 2018 .
15 mainly democratic states , together with Columbia , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President Donald Trumpi &apos;s government has tried to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to Mr Trumpi , is part of a broader plan for growth .
however , these efforts have provoked reactions among the democrats and nature conservation groups , who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that the breathing of ozone @-@ containing air &apos; may reduce the ability of Copts to work and increase the risk of respiratory diseases &apos; , such as asthma .
German pigs can come from pigs .
Germany &apos;s pigs and cattle can come with pipes , as strong rain threatens the European Union &apos;s second largest producer of wheat , writes Banimal berg .
this year , it can be said that weeks of saturation before harvesting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry will only be fed to animals .
&quot; the quality of the content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said Agravis Raiffeen &apos;s analysis of Mr Bernhard Chilla .
this year , up to 40 per cent of German nightmare for animal feed , which is fed in comparison with the usual one , is forecast in Agravis .
German farmers , as well as their European colleagues , have been exposed to any weather this year .
first of all , the winter was too dry .
then came the cold spring , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
in July , Germany hit Germany , which has also continued in August .
many eyes have been turned to northern Germany , where the rain hinders harvesting .
so far , only five per cent of the nightmare have been repeated .
the majority in the region has not yet been harvested , the local harvest purchaser in Ceravis .
&quot; this is quite a difficult day , &quot; said Frank Deckert Rendsburg , the senior trader in Ceravis .
consistency in everything , in other words , the rocks of the internal design of Finns
nature is playing its part in the internight of mesh homes , because through large windows , Saimaa &apos;s finite views reach many ( life ) rooms .
every step will be marked by our northern neighbour &apos;s aspiration to create both shellfish and perfect ( energy @-@ saving ) homes .
Iwl , and also compliance with the wood use of Finns , deserves to be used as building and finishing materials , furniture and beauty .
Virgling techniques and smart solutions can be found in mesh houses , both as a builder and ( home ) .
there is a great deal of evidence that the black , white and grey links , if they are supplemented by wood tones and toapes , can be very desperate .
good ideas can go on a week later , because the Fair will run until 13 August .
Tarvies and spices suggest that this kitchen is often copied .
the √ñ√∂l adopted today &apos;s line on the Weekise Festival Balticen and Martin Garrix did all he can to remember as the last speaker .
the people had a real turn in the time of Mr Battisti - a song , a humble , a tanker was danced .
when I finish , the Common mass of protein was dispersed from the beach of the city of wheat .
we will bring you to the gallery , where there are all the pictures that our photographs tried on Weekise in three days &apos; time .
you are certainly also some of them , you are looking for yourself !
Msole y Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mlony Garcia , who should be on a collision course in order to face up to 66.7 kg in the most attractive poker in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in the ESPN office in LOS Angelein , in separate tobacco , until Garcia , the unwinning World Bounch Council light champion , the other end of the corridor in order to welcome Lomachenkot , the World Bounch sulgweighch .
following the unanimous decision by Mrs Garcia , the victory of the former four @-@ time world champion , Adrien Broner , on Saturday in Showtime , both combatants belong to the top of the table .
Mr Garcia extended his better hand and said : &apos; how does the summer go , cheempion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
Lomachenko protects his belts against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 19 ESPN .
when a couple of photographs were found , Lomachenko &apos;s memory , Egis Klimas , said that a possible confrontation between the militants would be &apos; perfect &apos; .
&quot; I am a former consultant , &quot; recalled Garcia .
&quot; I have been calling for Broner &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small about 63.5 kg .
I want to move downwards .
and he must move towards a lighter weight &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
Fans have requested this .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
in the climate , the question raised was whether it should be worthwhile to look at it ; it is part of its strategy to allow Lomachenkol to debate the end of this year at 61.2 kg in order to make it possible for the next summer to meet with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 novans ) , who also has an interest in fighting Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbelli &apos;s match with the winner of the Foruval of the easy title of 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as the fans have called for this confrontation , &quot; said Garcia , saying later that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial package .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name is able to attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Mrs Garcia said that she considers Lomachenkot to be a &apos; force fighters &apos; and can go to his Saturday match .
however , Lomachenko was modest in praising Garcia , saying that he felt that the three divisjon champions from the Riverpool were &apos; very slow &apos; ; I apologise , Mlony ... you wanted this nodistant &apos; .
according to Garcia , the aim was to show strength and then to boy .
both confirmed that they feel that the tension between them is increasing .
&quot; this is a fight that looks forward to realising .
no other confrontation arouses so much attention and slander .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Garcia .
Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters and the Maey is exactly that .
this is a good fight . &quot;
what is going to be moved from the world &apos;s events to Estonia ?
it extended and issued a record of over 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia , study or family .
if , for example , the soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit to 6702 foreigners , then the figure was 4928 .
the agencies cannot say how many immigrants will finally remain in Estonia , but this analysis will be drawn up in the Ministry of the Interior .
when nearly 500 Ukrainians per year in Estonia a year ago , in recent years , this figure will be close to 2 000 .
the number of applicants for a residence permit increased exponentially during the Ukrainian crisis , with 1087 people in 2014 receiving fixed @-@ term residence permits , up from 675 .
according to the statistical office , in Estonia , the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing most , with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia , more than a Gulf .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been very high in Estonia all the time and , due to difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already in front of the family , the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior , Kristin Rammus .
the number of Ukrainian citizens who have been granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens , even though in 10 years the most fixed @-@ term residence permits have been issued .
if Ukrainians come to work here , Russia &apos;s citizens will be on family migration .
&quot; given this historic Russian community , they are also most likely to have the greatest family ties with the people living in Russia , &quot; said Helina Meuse , the Internal Protection Academy .
&quot; if you look at where the Russian citizens who have received a residence permit from Estonia have moved to live , Harjuland is now Eastern Virgland , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them have been married with the citizens of the European Union .
soil has been granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit was reduced .
&quot; compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested for a permanent stay in Estonia , &quot; explained by the press representative of the Ministry of the Interior , Mr Ramon , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years .
a new residence permit for Estonia will be able to apply for at least three years for foreigners who have lived here for the previous year .
its aim is to encourage the attraction of the people who have been adapted .
however , a long @-@ term resident residence permit requires five years , for example .
for the new residence permit , the extension of the old residence permit has obviously been reduced .
for example , soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to change their work and the Estonian state will no longer be pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit was popular at the same time as the holders of a bad passport ( 1029 ) , the Russians ( 487 ) , the Indians ( 54 ) and the nigerans ( 36 ) .
a total of 1968 people received a residence permit for Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese .
with the first half of this year , the total number of applicants is already 1269 .
in 10 years , surprisingly , Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for the Estonian residence permit .
when three residence permits were issued in 2007 , the soil was 200 .
there are lessons to be learned from Nigeria in this university .
the Estonian higher education institutions are also popular , for example , among Georgians , the Chinese and the Turks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely thanks to learning games .
for them , too , the rule is that where there is a community , there will be others more easily , &apos; added Ramallah .
in ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , as much from Laos and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four Uruguay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , it is about 0.46 % of the total population .
even if you look at the citizens of the European Union , migration will remain around a percentage , &quot; commented on the fact that the figures are actually small .
in total , 14 822 people died in Estonia , according to the statistical office , 13 792 .
this means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration .
most of them are Estonian citizens , but there are more of them among those who leave them .
this is why Estonia &apos;s citizens &apos; migration balance with 2 000 people was in decline .
Estonians , in particular , migrate between Finland and Estonia .
Mlong Couture Princess of Couture tricks with sats , chickens and tweed
however , in the North West of ideas , Maria Tammeoru , there is history - old paints and defendants : &apos; I can dream of a few hours somewhere in the museum and admire the old @-@ old thieves and crats .
if you go along with something , you will study and learn about it every day .
this is a joy of discovery !
the world of Couture , which is long ago , may seem to be alien to some , but the designer does not think so .
you yourself decide how much you are in your life !
as a friend , I have a whole sail full of the wounds of couture that I have created .
because , and it is not his fault , he does not live in the Hollywood and does not go on a red bed every day , he wants to wear the most beautiful brokers , and he is suffering !
you can live your own life special !
the Moeartificial artist does not recognise the gap between the shining events and the grey day .
it is this reasoning that put the rolling stock in Estonia into rural areas , between forests and fields , to people who often do not reach the mood .
for example , a comparison was presented , for example , in Jevenvis and Perlo moealleel , where 45 modell King defilee filled the whole street .
in Tallinn , there is often a hang in the shop , a young person is stunned with dignity , but elsewhere there is more emotion - slogvo , rising up , you want to thank you .
a large part of the audience was just as news , but now they are the fans of Mlong Couture .
if you overshoot people &apos;s expectations , they are spirited !
and I like this feeling that I am in my motive like the summer .
Pernus was a 50 @-@ metre red carpet , a whole street full of stickers , it seemed that they would not come to an end !
Mrs Maria also does not recognise the motive that animal creation must be presented by a superficial superficial , she will be happy to see ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always been happy to come .
after all , this is the lax of experience , the harvest on the Laval stage !
I am so sorry that I have never seen my performance , I am always behind the ground to give things the last meat as a hopeless act .
my nervous would not allow calmly to look at the Chamber .
Mrs Maria is this kind of motto , who does not just want to play a representative role , but to be involved in everything .
I have my sister in the wind , most of the collections I myself carry out .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to discover .
I am never far from my nature and I am not afraid of work .
it is not limited to the subject , but also to the style , logistics , organisation , organisation - everyone has to jump off the day of a woman &apos;s day .
these hours of work are still huge for fanatics .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is simply a day full of joy !
I have been very lucky - it is like an unstoppable joke : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compliments .
it has been said many times that my brokers have a land - they make themselves feel like a printing .
the guerrilous guests that Maria talent made known overnight have long been left to date for the Couture signalling .
Mr Martin Myrsep U18 boys : the weapon of the Estonians &apos; alagrupie is now turned against us .
the damage , the fairytale , ran out .
the first thing was that we could not get our desk .
and if there is such a big difference in the table , there is nothing to do with the Estonian U18 corps 61 : 75 in Britain , our only NBRA has played a corvball , BC Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsep .
opponents attacked 28 Palace and received so many more attacks .
we were also not prepared for their aggressive defence and attack , it created .
many of the attacks on the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
however , in defence , they have been able to keep their hands everywhere , we could not combine .
it created the team from its feet .
the homework of the opponents was better done .
according to Myrsepa , Estonia would have to make more tactical errors in order to take up the anti @-@ insurgency .
the last quarter - we had a zero mistake , but the opponents have already received a number of quick harvests .
Inadmissibility and a close offensive , which was our weapon on the alagrupiturnil , now all of us were opposed .
today , we had no strength against their aggressive nature .
the Myrhint remained satisfied with its negligent Kalevis , Matthias Tass .
security in general can say good words about the whole team , to date there was a single shock .
it is a pity that such an aggressive response had not already been met before .
Tass has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but it seemed that he was tired - he has borne quite a heavy burden .
however , he made a very fine move , which I have seen in the past in the trengthens , added a mentoring .
terrible figures : EM @-@ turniiril , in the basket of the kidneps , threw less than 10 points ...
the U18 age classes do not only apply to the young men &apos;s emi B @-@ divisjon corvpalliturniir in Tallinn , who started in Dublin the day after yesterday .
and Estonia &apos;s game with Poland was , unfortunately , in the area of antiquity .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , the situation was 9 : 49 , or only in the last ten minutes , opponents of the gas family and 16 : 16 : 16 .
in both the first and the second quarter , Estonia dumped 4 , third point ...
at the same time , in the first two minutes , the Estonians hit two pieces of the first two pieces , but then there were 25 pieces of the game , then one yellow and then 21 to wait ...
perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 fingers were taboo .
in addition , 2 points had to be made in four free tones .
there was a reasonable number of losses in this time , 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland was 33 and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , on the opening day , it had to be recognised 83 : 56 on the right .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement the stocks
today , NATO &apos;s 1 permanent group of mines arrived in Tallinn for a week &apos;s planned port visit to Tallinn , in order to supplement the stocks of ships and prepare for pre @-@ existing exercises .
in the course of the visit , ships are preparing for the landing of the sea , giving crews the opportunity for a parogue holiday .
after the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future historic explosive operations .
&quot; the participation of Estonians in NATO and their co @-@ operation in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the allied forces , &quot; said Arto Reinland , the chief of the operation and planning station in the Compliance of the Sea fleet .
since 29 June , NATO will be led by a permanent anti @-@ missile group in Latvia , Gvido Laudups , who took over the tasks of the group at the ceremony in Riga from the Estonian naval officer Johan @-@ Elias Seljab .
the group &apos;s flag vessel is LVNS Virsaitis , the Latvian naval force , which also operates as a leader of the group .
this semester is also part of the Estonian naval mine mine and anti @-@ fire zone .
as one of the four groups of NATO naval forces under the auspices of NATO , NATO is a permanent mine group of primary rapid reaction teams , which can be sent to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - On 13 August , the Pirita monastery &apos;s mutuaries will once again become a place where 13 years ago , the maestro Eri Klasta Festival , who was called upon to survive by 13 years ago .
this year &apos;s Birgitta Festival can be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented , according to the Christian leader of the city of Tallinn &apos;s philosopher ( 36 ) .
the risk to Joost : Cuba will reach the classroom of Traviata and Tosca , balletilaanswers from the &apos; Bolerol &apos; Karlssonin , and neither will it be possible to produce its own production , which is , this time , Joseph Haydn &apos;s wonderful orchestra , a response to the same international creative team that brought him to the Pirita in 2015 . &quot;
Mrs Festival has much more than just concerts and theatre answers .
it is more than any music theatre in its normal form .
it is a festival that takes power and never gets rid of it .
because the experience that the listener receives in this superior and salvable environment puts human souls ringing and concerns human beings in a way that cannot be described .
the risk is the first year of Birgitta Festival &apos;s art leader .
did the maestro Eri Klaskins not feel a little big ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , there has been a lot of help .
he went through my entire student career , and also supported a career at the beginning of the divatisation career .
perhaps it is thanks to me that it is easier for me to continue his work .
in Klas , the team of Birgitta Festival has had a great deal of good and , of course , all of this goes on to me .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going .
it is precisely the great heart of the Er Kars that gave me the strength to go well with the city of Tallinn in the Filharmony of Birgitta Festival .
and here I am now and I can do it !
what could the audience at the Festival today , which you offer in particular ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , as a surprise , the first ballett written on Mrs Lindgreni &apos;s cheese .
it is &apos; Karlsson lb &apos; .
and one of the notorious nuances in this regard is that the author of this balleum is the Latvian composer , Juris Karlsons , who himself expressed a desire to write it .
apparently , he has already lived in the Carlsson carature of the Karlsson .
to the risk , how are you all the nuances ?
thanks to my support for life , I certainly do .
this work needs a system of support and a lot of love , and it is fortunate that I have a great deal of love .
and I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people , as I do myself , in other words , how I am going against every new day .
and such an awareness of the tone , of maintaining the positive and , in fact , of laughing ourselves into the mirror of the morning , has made a significant increase in my happy percentage .
in particular , this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen to do so and it works .
the naming of oneself is an act of amusing and raising the tone .
that is not just a word .
I think that people do not yet know half of their own body that the universe offers them , but each of them will be able to discover it gradually .
right now , it is an important moment .
is there any ritual before the dirigend was taken ?
there are still , clothing must be replaced against more convenient ones .
this is a small moment for ourselves .
however , in general , I do not have the opportunity to pump or make a small straw before I speak .
in fact , I even like to engage actively with people , even before the dirigendium took place .
but come to Birgitta Festival , what is also to be discovered here is not particularly large @-@ scale and balleans .
see a glaring video with the risk of Joostiga !
new results of tests on the age of Swedish asylum applicants were published
in Sweden , among the asylum applicants , the latest results of the test show that more than 80 % of the constitutions were assessed as older than 18 , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for medicine ( Romtsmedicinalverket ) started with tests at the beginning of this year .
the tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of the age of age after the Swedish Authority for Migration ( IOM ) criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly minors .
to date , 68 880 cases have been sent to the tests by Migransverket , and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 24 81 tests between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed for 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older , and in 25 cases , the Institute of medicine assessed that the test &quot; may be 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older . &quot;
the 432 cases concluded that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if the age of man is questioned .
according to Johan G√∂ransson , who works in the Institute of medicine , the results are consistent with those of previous months .
&quot; we do not see a great difference in comparison with the statistics in previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &apos; he said to the newspaper The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been able to choose their age .
the Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that , in 442 cases , &apos; there are references to the fact that a researcher is 18 years old or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson ska Dagbladet examined the results of their 581 test , it became clear that in 243 cases , the person had stated directly that it would be 18 this year .
the method of assessing the age of medical age , which is carried out by r√∂ntgeniters and types of MRT , and then they are allowed to be analysed by toothic doctors and radiologists , has been criticised in some circles .
one of the sceptics is the endokrinologist of the Karolinska Institute , Mr Claude Marcus , whose work includes the assessment of people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through the normal audience sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measuring method currently used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say firmly , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he said to the newspaper , &apos; he said forestry .
but Johan G√∂ransson , the Institute of medicine , defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that the risk of a child &apos;s inaccurate release is low .
most of all , perhaps around 10 % , there is a risk if the person is a little under 18 . &quot;

the 20 @-@ year @-@ old newer , Anna Maria Orel , made the London Mil beautiful debate , with 67.377 a good 18 seats .
after that , MM noorim was a woman &apos;s newer , and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for medals in the future .
the contest went well and received good experience .
with the first test ( 64.80 ) , I immediately took advantage of my average result , the second ( 62.80 ) risk too much , and the third ( 67.37 ) I was able to keep it very clear , &quot; said Orel after the contest .
I had my own emissions and I am very pleased that I found it .
Anna Maria Oreli MM &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 seats .
the Vihmasadu Orelit did not mix , because he is training him through the TEC stage .
&apos;I am afraid &apos; , he said a little bit .
the London Olympic state had almost a full house of the people , did the Orel reclaim people or was able to turn off ?
I have come to Tajani , but in a positive sense .
everyone says that it will add - that is the case !
if it is to compete , it can be experienced .
he then confirmed that he will be satisfied with the MM &apos;s debate and he is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 32nd outcome of the current season , the last one , I finished 18 .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and Mil - that is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of the medals .
Western Virgina kuberner announced party exchanges
the Western Virginia Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President Trumpa , that he would change the parties .
&apos;Mpresue it or not , but the democrats walked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I say to you , having thanked you hard and thought ... today , I say to you , the West , that I can no longer help you as a democratic Governor . &quot;
explanations of joy were glued at the mixing .
&quot; so I will be a Republican tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a engineer , I would say to you that it is time to play a second game . &quot;
the Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Virginia .
Trump won 42 points in Western Virginia and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats , Hillary Clinton .
Justice , which is the only billion star in the state , according to the Ford , proved to be elected in 2016 .
in the wilderness , it notes that it is owned by coal mines in five states and that it is quite self @-@ sufficient for coal business .
his value is approximately USD 1.59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday evening , the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) published a statement that &apos; Governor Justice &apos;s party exchange is yet another blow to a democratic parade that would prevent the country from improving again rather than working towards it &apos; .
&quot; just 15 months and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent wake @-@ up to you , which is the way to the end of the day and cannot find a positive and united message , &quot; said RNC representation , Ronna McDaniel CBS Newsi .
it is not surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
the Weekise medical practitioner , Urmet , said yesterday evening that they have had to share a lot of posters .
Vills and marches are fundamental , excuses and easy failures .
of course , it is also the main , absentia and footwear .
according to Urmeti , visitors will come to the festival with false footwear and so the problems will come .
the media have also had to help a couple of visitors with more injuries - there have been some scaremongering and also one foot .
we have also made a blessing when a person has pulled the hand or the finger .
we are doing less here , we are going to send a hospital .
see the video as to whether the brakes on the media for the treatment of potablet are also asking for a painkiller .
Coe praised the honest apologies of the Russians for the anti @-@ doping scandal .
the international rally of the Kergean Sebastian Coe , according to his words , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apology &apos; on Thursday , but reiterated that this is not the time to allow sport to be returned to the country .
on the eve of the World Cup on the eve of the last night of the International Cup , the Russian frivolrels Dmitry Shylithtin said that the ban on competition imposed on his country is right and has a firm aim to combat doping .
he has apologised &apos; from all the lighters of gold and silver medals &apos; .
despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on entry into force , which was introduced in November 2015 after the report by the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think it was a very honest answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IAAF President Coe to journalists .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were satisfied that the Russian Federation also recognised that they have had quite difficult times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Union . &quot;
according to Coe , he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own recovery .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the proposal for a working group that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; we must do everything possible in the next few months to normalise the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want clean athletes to be separated from the system , &quot; he added .
Eighteen Russian lighters , who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF , compete on Friday in London as neutral athletes in the World Cup .
the head of the IAAF Group , Rune Andersson , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of criteria for forecasting .
following a presentation by the IAAF to the Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that the trained engineers are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution makes a significant difference to the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
little because the revolution in electric cars makes a significant difference to the fuel market up to infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market .
although mining giants like Glencore can say that they will win from one place and lose another , smaller mining companies will not help .
Glencore coal and oil are currently serving , but in the era of electric cars , the demand for cobalt , lithium , copper , aluminium and nickel is growing .
this year , governments in the UK , France and Norway have contributed to the decisions of the UK , France and Norway to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades .
therefore , Volvo has already known that they are planning to abandon the combustion engine , and Tesla will bring a cheaper country 3 electric car to the market .
Banimal berg &apos;s New Energy Finance forecasts predict that electric cars will be sold over two decades more than cars using oil @-@ produced fuels .
&quot; with regard to some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Simona Gambranin Banimal berg , Capital of Economics .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium , which have increased demand for years .
in electric cars , there are approximately three times more copies than in the ordinary car , the Glencore .
even more answers are needed at charging stations , which is why the Exane BNP Paris estimates that it will increase the demand for copper by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional lithium , cobalt , graphite and manganese demand .
Glencore can generate a growing income from electric cars and the fact that there is the world &apos;s largest producer of cobalt , predicted by the Jeffitative Group .
according to this broker company , the winners of the second wave of electric cars are winners of Fbete @-@ McMoRan and First Quanmas Minerals .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of 70 % of the London metal stock .
the price of soil was 37 % .
the answer has also been 14 % this year , mainly due to economic growth .
the Glencore excise duty rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price rise to the rival Rio Tinto Group , BHP Billitoni and Anglo .
on the side of the losers , lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine , who have to adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ use of the Plii is the batteries of cars with petrol and diesel engines .
electric cars are used by glaciers .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael Widmer , the Governor of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch , who analysed the metallic market .
the impact of the Plii price movement is not yet seen in the form of a seamless trend .
it has been 17 % this year , while it is the best methane in London among the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems for metals in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure that it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition , &quot; said Herwig Schmidt , the head of the metal broker Triland Metalsi .
if lead demand falls , it will be slow .
this may be the case in about ten years &apos; time .
in the meantime , stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which is often dependent on advanced lead @-@ based batteries , will be assessed by international lead and by the organisation of inquiry .
Kergmetal , like aluminium , is replaced by steel , as a lighter car can go further with less electricity .
this explains the additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes for 2013 @-@ 2016 .
this represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s output of aluminium .
this trend is likely to grow , says Widmer .
Aluminium is responsible for 13 % this year , as the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
steel producers do not .
ak Shalding will work together with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful cars .
ArcelorMittal and ShalEurope are also trying to develop a lighter meltdown in order to withstand the minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris , Sylvain Brunet .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to a plate .
it took around half of this precious metal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , announced the metal refiner Johnson Matta .
&quot; many raw materials such as oil and plate may not have a great deal of demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard Dahdah , the Natixourselves raw material analysts .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
the Plaatinatmakers believe continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Mr Marc Grynberg , leader of the Uncore , said that in 2025 , more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from cars .
the great hope of the Plaatinatatmakers in the 10 @-@ year perspective is Toyota Motors and Hymuni Motosi , based on hydrogen @-@ based cars that depend on a plate to produce electricity from hydrogen .
so far , however , this technology has not yet been commercially justified .
&quot; it seems to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris from Brunet .
German car manufacturers received a major setback in July , as Stuttgart &apos;s court banned the use of diesel in the city of Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche .
how financial rules for football affect the transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the rampant spending of European football clubs do not prevent the world &apos;s record transition from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona club Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences for UEFA , the governing body , which dominates the European game and in its power to ban teams from the prestigious League of Meisters from participating in the market , are waiting for the Paris Saint @-@ GerMay .
the financial rules for fair play ( FFP ) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that the PSG has to prove at some point that the transition to Neyra was financed without a huge loss .
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona ( USD 262 million ) alone for buying the Brazilians out of his contract , and the salary of Neyra will reach tens of millions of dollars per year .
here are some of the financial aspects of moving to the French club .
the PSG will undoubtedly be able to go out of this kind of money for the recruitment of Neyra and the inclusion of its stars , given that the team is funded by the family governing the Katar &apos;s energy chain .
clubs have been allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players , but they have to balance this with legal sources of income that allow them to come out of a football business .
FFFP was set up by Michel Platini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that the clubs , which are falling into debt in search of success , are actually dealing with fraud and risk buying when banks or owners should give up support .
since 2011 , the FFP club will focus on monitoring their losses instead of their debts .
this change means that the business model , which Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 in Chelsea , to buy a club with potential , and then to spend a great deal in order to improve the team and create a global brand , is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of the FFP , which runs until 2018 , the clubs will be able to bear up to EUR 30 million in losses .
and , despite the fact that Platini was discredited by the presidential office in 2015 , his successor , Alexander Ceferin , is still committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; FFFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said the previous week , Mr Andrea Traverso , who is the guardian of the UEFA @-@ FP .
although the PSG for the purchase clause of Neymari as one of the full payments , they will be able to distribute this amount for the purposes of accounting for the whole period of validity of the agreement .
Mr Neymar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it is possible to demonstrate a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years .
for the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , the PSG , together with Abu Dhabi , received the most severe penalties on Manchester Cityga .
the PSG was fined EUR 60 million ( currently EUR 82 million ) , which was reduced later to EUR 20 million , and the club was required to limit the team of the League of Meisters for the period 2014 @-@ 2015 to 21 players instead of normal 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to overturn the financial institutions , blowing their income through companies connected with the owners of the club .
the Katar company may sponsor the PSG , but if the value of sponsorship is considered to be standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
this was the case in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Qatar Tourism Authority had the value of the PSG support .
it has been said that some of the PSG services of Neymari can come from Qatar through contributions from the World Cup Board of 2022 .
however , the PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neyra could become a world championship and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities are able to easily expose such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not been proactive in discussing the transition to the PSG .
they talked about The associated Ppress , provided that their anonymity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PSG .
the latest reports show that the PSG 2015 @-@ 2016 season will generate more than ‚Ç¨ 10 million in profits of around ‚Ç¨ 542.4 million in turnover .
the figures for the last financial year have not yet been published .
the PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions , trade and snus .
the club looks forward to an increase of at least 30 % of turnover in the agreement .
Spain too , having clearly irritated the departure of one of the largest football stars , tried to block the transition by saying that the PSG is in breach of FFP .
&quot; this is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with a club and a country , &quot; said La li President Javier Tebas AS , referring to the fact that the PSG belongs mainly to Qatar .
Arsenal m√§nejer Arn Wenger , whose club belongs to the American sports magnate , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights and it has changed completely the whole football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger on Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to the state , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a major player . &quot;

today , 50 years ago : an anomaly storm in Estonia , which was ripped off houses and windows .
the orchestra of the century , which , on 6 and 7 August , caused major damage in particular to the West , Harjuland and Raplaland .
in the course of these days , the wind was over 30 m / s in the north @-@ west Estonia .
in my old drink in Bavaria , a bottle of one card to another , and overlaps with them to support them .
everything was blind and ragne , like the world stage .
Taamal has already been flying into the houses , in 2002 , the old Mrs Linda Kurova Havava magazine was reminded of the Estonian nature in an interview with Estonia .
the Linda spouse saw how the planted axes collapsed .
but what are you going to support with your hands , where are you going against such a storm ?
the sea came under the window , from the windows in the water &apos; , Haapsalus Kalda , who has lived on the streets of Mrs Linda at the time .
the fact that the roads were full and the rock of the railway station had been flying to 20 @-@ 30 metres , the Linda majority of the Haitians , just like next morning .
according to the local authorities , the cages behind the Paralepa were lagging behind , some of them were completely lengthy , some of the shops .
everyone saw very depressing , the storm went through the beautiful old trees as a radar and pragmatism , like war .
Western Viruland was not particularly severely affected by August 1967 , compared with Western Estonia , but the losses were large there , the Virumaa Official Journal wrote in 2007 .
Haapsalu Lfossil Park and Padise Park were swept away from the ground , but also our own parks were severely affected .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured by up to 35 metres per second , or around 130 kilometres per hour .
in Tallinn Meriexpression , on the evening of 6.August , one of the few lead chambers had been shouting : &apos; mother , mother !
the channel is in the air and will no longer be signed , &quot; wrote Virumaa Official Journal .
at the time of the storm in Viljandiland , the Building of the generation was so that it was decided to be dismantled later .
the design of the T√ºri ski mountains , which was no longer restored later , was not opposed to August .
on 12 August 1957 , the newspaper Red Tblt wrote that the restoration of towns and settlements from landlocked trees and their vehicles is progressing slowly , and the population could be involved in corrogation work .
in Turin , fertility crops were also severely affected , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party organisations must be an incentive and a fertility corps &apos; .
in the event that the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s .
the wind order in Estonia remains on 2 November 1969 , when Ruhnul was measured at the speed of 48 m / s .
on the island of Vaindstory , a sword broke out , so it was not possible to register the speed of a strong wind .
secret of holiday beaches : night cleaning and poor coastal weather
cold summer weather also means less corrotation in the beaches of Tallinn .
&quot; if there is no , then people are in the rank , and if there are no people , then there are also no people , then the beer is truthful .
the city of Northern Tallinn Stroom in Stroom .
they are offered by a mechanical competition in the low @-@ turn tractor , which is a threshold for a placard to the trick .
in fact , the last seven @-@ cent goes through the depths of the sand , picking it out of the sea pounds and people left behind : bottles , cigarettes and so on .
people are still coming to rank , regardless of whether water is soya or not .
if there is a beauty , then people are in the rank , and if there are no people , then there are no people , &apos; the management of the private company hospital hospital &apos; will be said by Alexander Usov , Mr Usov .
at 6.30 p.m. and rank , there is a bitter hole , because at 8 o &apos;clock , the poster must be in order for the people .
the Usov is already at four o &apos;clock .
apart from Stroom , he is still keeping an eye on Pirita , Harku Lake , Kakum√§e and Palaraare Pikakari .
the amounts of Pr√ºm have fallen .
many years ago , it was much more .
people will now be able to assess what is being done for them , &quot; says Usov , who has harvested the migrants for 15 years .
before it was the case that , when something new was put up , it was already the next day .
now , what is on the coast is already being kept .
price of clean beach
one of the biggest jobs in the Estonian beaches is the breath of rubbish , or adru harvesting .
for example , in the Pirita rank , 400 000 tonnes of coastline have to be shipped .
&apos;This is an incredible amount &apos; , notes the Usov .
the second major category is municipal waste , all of which people leave behind .
there are eight major rubbish seiners in Stroom coast , which need to be watered down three times a week .
so much is the waste .
however , cold summer weather has meant that rubbish is a fifth less than otherwise .
the third species are abandoned .
in most cases , they are children &apos;s TV .
as a result , Usov has pulled out ten metres of sludge from the sand .
they will remain waiting for the owners of timber to be on the table .
&quot; they usually come out more , but it is a normal harvest , &quot; Usov knows that it will soon find them back in the sand .
children come to rank and take the toys in order to re @-@ install them .
landfill is broken down
Erika Scholler , a representative of administrative services , admitted that the work of the tractor is disrupting local communities .
noise , which lasts from hours to hours , is confusing the people living in the neighbourhood .
on the day , however , this work is impossible .
in one month , we have two times to go through the war .
&quot; if we do not do this , the city will be fined , &quot; notes Scholler .
however , the aim is , like Pirita , Pikakari and Persian , to get Stroom rand below the quality of the international flag .
&quot; compared with Europe , there is much more work in Estonia to care for beaches , &quot; says Scholler .
we have more adru and more stone , and it is more difficult to go to the sand .
however , our beaches have less rubbish than elsewhere in Europe .
when we hear that there is talk of rubbish in the rank , the conversations between Mr Martin , who is living near Stroom , and the interviews of the journalist and corrogation workers , highlight the current bottlenecks .
there is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is with birds and wood slaves , who have pulled the rubbish bags &apos; , Martin says .
although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the rubbish and , for example , put them on the roofs in order to prevent at least birds in the news there .
in general , however , Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroom .
it can be seen that the city is taking care of this .
it has become more pleasant with children &apos;s fields , enlightened and fresh asphalt .
it was once the case that only one way could travel on the ground , &quot; notes Martin .
findings of the village in Stroomis : coins , only coins
a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Dimitr , who , as a treasurer , is sailing the coastline with a metal metre , has had to be exploited .
he does not believe that , today , or in the future , he will find a price .
marine God is not generous enough to do so .
&quot; I have been working on this for a year and I have not found anything worthwhile so far , &quot; says Dmitry .
as a refrigeration , the Dmitry Islands have some euro coins , bottles and also dangerous pounds which later throw the rubbish .
normally there are still coins .
&quot; culture , fingers and other such practices are not usually the case , &quot; it is the island &apos;s village .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level as weak economic growth and inflation alleviation have cushioned speculation on the rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth remains a loophole , as household incomes have put interest rates on expectations .
policy makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MPC ) voted 6 : 2 in favour of 0.25 % , and fewer members require an increase this month , as slow economic growth has weakened support .
in its quarterly report on inflation , the Bank cut its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 and from 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households &apos; incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also signalled that the increase in rates for the next few years is necessary to curb inflation from Brexon and the financial markets may be necessary for the expected increase in the cost of borrowing .
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package , which was launched a year ago as a result of Brexti .
in February , the Bank will put an end to the fixed @-@ term finance scheme , which will provide banks with cheap funding , although it said that it is now GBP 15 billion more to be expected under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; GDP in the central forecast of the EPAs will remain powerless in the near future , as the difficult situation of real income for households will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
on the rates , it was repeated that there is a need for &apos; some effort to be made to alleviate inflation &apos; , and this &apos; somewhat higher &apos; than is expected in the markets .
Mr B√∂ge is now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any kind of anthem is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % for the next year .
the forecast for 1.8 % growth in 2018 was maintained .
after this news , the pound of the dollar and the euro fell .
women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.31 and 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to growing hopes of an increase in GDP in the second quarter , from 0.2 % last three months to 0.3 % .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will be able to collect a little momentum .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave little reason to the households suffering from rising inflation and abject wage increases , saying that the situation will go a little worse before an improvement is made .
it was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent a fall in income in the next few years , but the end of the three @-@ year forecast is expected to see a marked return to wages .
as a result , the economy is also being stimulated by increasing demand for British production , which is partly compensating for lower costs for consumers .
the decision comes one year after the rates were taken by 0.25 % last August after the shocking EU referendum , which caused a sudden weakening of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to completely breathe life into prices and the economy .
before the last decision of the Bank , there was a growing demand for raising the rate , as inflation had increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak pound .
Andrew Montlake , leader of Coreco mortgages , said : &apos; in view of the recent downturn in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market will again become more competitive , as creditors will be able to work and hope to end the year in a positive way .
Mr B√∂ge seems to be particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as refinancing , often without service and low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
NHS is writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV medication
patients have been able to access the &apos; transformative &apos; HIV @-@ preventive treatment since September , following the battle against whether the NHS should finance the medicine .
NHS England announced that public health is now making an estimated 10 000 people available for the initial three @-@ year clinical trial - pre @-@ pre @-@ school prophylactic ( PrEP ) - a tablet that is manned before the interim procedure and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people by around 86 % .
the NHS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported the ruling of the Supreme Court last year , according to which the NHS is able to pay for the PrEP , despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Stevens , the Executive Director of NHS England , welcomed this Thursday as a &apos; new large @-@ scale intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NAT ) described it as a &apos; pivotal moment &apos; .
sexual health clinics in London , Bright ton , Manchester , Liverpoolis and Sheffield are among the first to register people , and in October , there will be further clinics before the programme is introduced in England by April 2018 .
exposure to pre @-@ emptive prophylactic ( PrEP ) is the scene of HIV drugs , which will be taken before the incident in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that the PrEP will significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission among people .
the PrEP &apos;s adoption before the mid @-@ term review means that there is a sufficient number of medicinal products that prevent HIV infections .
such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure .
the appropriate candidates include LGBT men , transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment .
they identify suitable people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , transgender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their participation in the local sexual health clinics in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million , and NHS England signed an agreement to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the clinical test aims to assess the actual potential of the PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who is intended for treatment and how it is consumed and implemented .
Steven said : &apos; this new large @-@ scale intervention should complement and leverage a comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV proliferation .
this is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of the greatest health problems facing humanity . &quot;
Deborah gold , the Managing Director of NAT , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
the PrEP , if it is properly targeted at those who need it and belong to risk groups , offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England .
since September , people with a high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on the negotiations with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
the Executive Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation , ian Green , said : &apos; now it is a priority to ensure that a clinical trial is put in place quickly and that no member of the HIV risk group is excluded .
now that the PrEP clinical test has been obtained , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who risk being infected with HIV .
the Minister for Public Health , Sharon Hodgson , said : &apos; the beginning of the PrEP clinical test is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the census of the government &apos;s shoes .
evidence shows how much changes can be made to the prevention of HIV prevention and the spread of its life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will lead us a step closer to the full understanding of the advantages of the PrEP .
it is now important that a clinical trial is taken as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV and lead us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
in July , the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.94 , compared to EUR 7.71 in June this year , declared Elering .
the main cause of the price difference is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , the average electricity price for electricity was ‚Ç¨ 34.33 per megawatt hour last month , and the price increased by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt @-@ hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 34.17 , and the electricity exchanges in Nord half of the systemic price was EUR 26.37 per megawatt @-@ hour .
prices rose according to 12 and seven per cent .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity reached 75 % of last month &apos;s hours in Estonia and 16 % of the hours from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine % of the hours between the two countries did not take place next day .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity reached 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the hours were used by the entire transmission capacity .
according to the last trading day of July , Nasdaq OMX on the market , the price of electricity in August could be around 34 and ‚Ç¨ 37 per megawatt @-@ hour in September .
the price of carbon dioxide , which is affecting the price of electricity production last month , and transactions were at 5.04 @-@ 5.47 per tonne .
life expectancy - half @-@ time and smart designers have changed it to the small Earls of the Court of Justice
Joanne Leigh , a former banker who is a passionate property innovator , switched his home to the Grand Knightsbridge in 2014 against the Earls Court Corter .
it is in the first order of Queen Anne Ter≈£i , and the fact that Joanne has not packed his bags and sold the flats has been a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived together with a former fellow Member of life in Knightsbridge , &quot; said Joanne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tantamount to the price of my offer .
it was demonstrated to me by the Earls Court and had the same high waves .
I did in this and I made an offer on the same day .
since the first visit , this 93 @-@ square metre has gone through full innovation .
at the beginning , it was a sleeping and a complex star - a sleeping wall had to go through the kitchen , and Joanne wanted to add savings and quasi @-@ order to exploit high rates .
&quot; I wanted high , big windows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he is asking Erfan Azadi Notting Hillis for architecture and designer Duck &amp; D , to take advantage of 3.8 m ears and to create a home that is not just a development site but a place where Joanne could live .
it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a quasi @-@ order in which to stand up .
the Erfan was supposed to be a creative approach .
&quot; Metalldesign is quite complex , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to reorganise the premises so that they are located on each other , without having to be bogged down .
it was not just about building a platform , but we used steel design to be the right thing to do so , both in the upper and lower space . &quot;
this place allowed the Erfanil to create two full @-@ blown elements in the room , with a great deal of dramatic elements .
a half @-@ way street will be opened up from the old @-@ fashioned Retrouvius window to the glacier of Retrouvius .
the golden furniture , silver details and retrospective Serge Mouille &apos;s light highlight the style of space .
the use of mirrors plays a role in the inclusion of theatre , space and lighting .
in the short corridor , mirrors have been added to both sides , so that it would seem longer .
in the Knight , the mirror is giving the impression of a second @-@ tup window .
in the course of a return , the song will provide for all Joanne &apos;s eating riders and glass requirements .
housing is accompanied by a false opportunity to close the vegetables if it is not used , creating a more dense space .
the cumbersome kitchen is nothing new .
however , with this kitchen , it is a unique fact that this is a type of uprising in the garage .
&quot; it went a little bit of design , &quot; explains the presence of Erfan terasstrengthened MDF from the MDF .
&quot; this has a counterweight , which is why it is very simple to reject it . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage , Joanne now has 16 additional metres , an additional sleeping permit and a better corter plan .
&quot; after all , it is what you sell - or what gives property value , &apos; says Erfan .
&apos;Kinnisvary takes an outdated form and makes calculations on the basis of the surface area &apos; .
here , they have been able to increase the surfaces , using high quality materials that add a luxury to the space .
&quot; materials are what you are missing and thus help to create an emotional link with your home , &quot; says Erfan .
&quot; you do not love the electricity cables in my seine .
it is important , but it does not give heart to languages . &quot;
this shows that a good design and an increase in the area will help to make something astonishing from a rather normal coral .
in fact , they can even create a desire not to leave , as was the case with Joanne .
the main figure , Jensen , is Chicago &apos;s pictures of a washing village in Chicago , who is competing with a colleague for his professionalism .
no more than the amount of money that has been earned , apart from which any ethics is forgotten .
his wife and three children only see a man on the property and late night .
in the first half of the film , I find myself in the idea that it is a version of the business world of Kaardihouse - even in Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler &apos;s speech .
what the film goes on , however , is the less chaotic element , and the moralising intention of film @-@ makers is beginning to appear more and more .
life @-@ changing experience will be the main player in the cancer of cancer .
there is now a choice between working and family life .
the poet of the Architeiteation is making the father think of the great buildings of Chicago about matters of real importance , such as religion , welfare , love ... , without even the disaster of the twin towers .
after the third semester , where the son &apos;s father opens the eyes , there is a feeling that the film @-@ makers have certainly been able to meet the target audience , because even with the most basic heart , they cannot keep tears back in the face of the suffering of a doctor of cancer .
if the son falls into the House and his situation seems to be hopeless , the father will finally understand the morality of his work and make a good job for the old man who wants to work .
now , in a sense , I am lucky with myself - if the filter has been in possession of it , I will be rewarded with my own sense after the film coffee , if I am wrong , then at least one surprise could be applauded .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that ice will be lost - when a husband calls a hospital and a man drives in the middle of a corridor .
however , the Poeg has been amazing , and although his father has just lost his job , it will be positive because it is now time to deal with the family .
I can also feel well - I can already predict the end of the American drama quite well !
in fact , the film has been well constructed , all the elements that are needed for this are there .
it will be a joke , it will be a laughing actor , it is a good and moral beauty : money is not the most important thing in life .
this film is well introduced by surprise .
the new staff transfer is planned to limit the media consumption of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly will be able to do so .
then it would be the first .
Politico writes that the new staffing of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President Trumpin , including news , in the hope that it will keep the upper hand in a more balanced way .
here , the reporter Josh Dawseylt :
&quot; when the new staff of the White House , John F. Kelly , met with high officials on his first day of work , he highlighted the key problem of President Donald Trumpi Valges , which he intends to address in the hands of the President in the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly told officials that the information must go through him , either on paper or at meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems completely logical , but others have tried to do so and have failed to tame Trumpi by monitoring his media consumption .
President Trumpi &apos;s relationship with television goes for decades , and now that he is in the White House , his television observation habits have not gone away .
&quot; when the candidate Trump was dishonest about the dishonest media coverage , he had to show him that he was also fairly reflected in the publications affecting him , &quot; said Sam Nunberg Politicos in February .
Politico tara Palmer wrote at the time that &apos; according to the six former campaigners &apos; , Trumpi Twitter is the key to controlling the habits of the Trumpi Twitter , to ensure that his personal media consumption is also stable . &quot;
good .
however , the idea that the habits used by Trumpi Twitter have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know about the fact that the Trumpi bonuses would have been even more heartening without their intervention .
we will probably never be able to know about the shutdown that the Trump did not postal .
if he was able to save or save a few times , his efforts were worth doing so .
however , no one has been able to prevent Trumpi consistently from creating polemics .
part of the problem is that , in the White House , which consists of competing lines , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception , by transferring material to the TruOlympics , which supports their views on the world , but may not always be credible .
Politico , which reflects the whole story , wrote in May the advisers &apos; tendency to feed the President with information of strategic value .
one of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows :
&quot; the current and former Trumpi will say that Trump can react to a negative press , particularly with a damaging effect on infants , explosive , entrenching their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone gave a cheerful copy to the President of the Internet provocation Charles C. Johnson &apos;s website , GotNews.com , which accused the staff depump , Katie Walshi , that he was the white house of a series of leaflets . &quot;
it does not matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked by Twitter because of his modelling or that he did not provide any specific evidence or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
the Trump read the article and started to ask for Walshi . &quot;
the Goldmacher added that Rob Porter and the head of the White House , Rob Porter , have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting the documents reaching Trumpin . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but Trump is still an impulse and his helpless will continue to compete on the basis of influence .
these unchanging factors make the mission very difficult .
street musicians who have come from abroad to the capital of the capital will not be allowed to speak .
there is a lot of foreign affairs in the city of Tallinn .
those with whom the leaflet came out acknowledged that they were playing in the old town without the permission of the urban government .
the first was the three street musicians who have taken the same cocktail in the vicinity of Viru &apos;s gates .
it was clear to see that the musicians with cocktails and clandestine clothes were in absentia , to whom one duch would be a martyr .
despite the fact , the only woman in the company played a pariah story , while one man , alongside him , was calling for a gesture of three faces and furniture closer to him .
the third man was sitting in absentia alongside them and smoked a warmer self @-@ prepared farce .
their three chambers did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people of the past .
Mr Bob , who has played with the Acordion , has said that he said that he is behaving on the streets for both fun and money .
the aim of this panel was to collect ticket money on a ship travelling to Finland on the same day .
apart from the question of whether they asked for permission from the city in the old age , Noemi and Bob were shaking their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stay in one town more than a day or a few and , in most cases , allowed for a month or something like this .
there is no point in paying for this , &quot; explained by Bob .
when we returned to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in musicians and are going to go .
it is a challenge for the Viru Centre in absentia and cocktails to Viru .
three Polish young men , one of whom played a fifth , are also present on the streets of Viru Viru , and the third was even involved in electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people entertainment in order to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living , &quot; explained the trio pipe Mivosh .
according to Mivoshi , they are aware that there must be permission from the city government .
&quot; of course we do not have it , &quot; he said it joke .
but we hope that if people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
of course , if the police comes , we will go elsewhere , but it must be tried , he added .
in July , the Estonian bank purchased bonds worth ‚Ç¨ 149 million under the public property programme of central banks in the euro area , a bank bond portfolio increased to ‚Ç¨ 4.36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Hardo Hansson , has explained in the past that the assets of the central banks of the Eurosystem are covered by three different purchasing programmes : the bonds covered by the financial sector ( SIS ) , property guaranteed bonds ( ABS ) and public bonds ( PSPP ) .
the Central Bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases will fall in the production of lower @-@ risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks .
as a rule , in the framework of the public sector bond programme , each central bank buys its government bonds , and other countries &apos; bonds are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank will make so @-@ called &apos; replacement shopping &apos; within the limits of the amount allocated to them .
the central banks also shop in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian bank is generally buying the bonds of the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian bank is buying bonds under the asset programme from March 2015 .
in the meantime , Election bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian bank will no longer buy bonds from June 2016 .
in the name of the central banks of the euro area , from June onwards , both the Central Bank of Finland and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds are buying .
migrants are ignoring degrees and returning to &apos; millions of business &apos; .
some of the richest owners of the West Midlands have once again found themselves in a fierce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the unelected bureaucrats of the Council to win back their cotton .
migrants have parked their 20 trailers near the streets of Solihull , who are risked by a wealth of millions of business .
they have returned , together with the army of horses , children and lorries , after they were thrown out of it only in May , without allowing themselves to be confused with a degree of bureaucracy that was complaining to the Council to prevent their invasion .
an activist group found a weak place in defence limits , turning its vehicles through unblocked parts that were left to pocket .
the people of Maruangry have contacted the Solihulli Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless &apos; in dealing with the problem .
one anonymous resident said : &apos; they are sitting there on Monday evening after their exclusion from Bentley Heathon , where they were stoned by stoning .
the Council must be ashamed that they are going to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were going to go and now they are back again .
they came to the last night , probably more today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect their parks .
I live on the road to strike , and I am not happy that I must continue to pay a full charge if the Council is not even able to prevent such a thing . &quot;
one local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said : &apos; it is ridiculous , and we have seen the last of these migratory movements , and there is already a new offensive .
this time , the number has increased and even the horse has been seen in the grassland . &quot;
the representative of the Solihulli Council said : &apos; we are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the land near the street pasbrook , and we are working with the Solihulli police , and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
the gathering of evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling the number 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the Weekna Festival will also visit the Minister for Culture , Indrek Saar , who is pleased that it has been possible to bring real world top names to Estonia .
the question of why the Weekise festival is so important for the Estonians , Saar , that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the Festival &apos;s three @-@ day story .
however , it recognises that the real players in the area have come to the fore .
&quot; looking at the level of artists , which has been able to be brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this musical gesture are being brought home - often not in our hands - the Minister for Culture is speaking .
however , what festivals are the artists who speak most about Saart himself ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person , and it is certainly one of the most experienced doctors , Armin van Bnewren , who stood up yesterday evening .
according to his poster , all of us have , at some point , complicated our own feet , &apos; he says .
however , he still highlights a number of names , such as Chainthia , Deadmau5 , Knifea .
of course , our own Estonian players : starting with NOx P and they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , this renowned concentration of names is very high , &quot; he says .

Audi upgrades up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of the criticism of car manufacturers
the day before the Audi announcement , BMW said that it provides a software app for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of BMW , the company believes that &apos; there are smarter options than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the BMW home city , Munich , which has considered a ban or restriction on diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be upgraded to reduce gas emissions from diesel engines in Europe .
no company has described these procedures as a re @-@ call .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and in the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma .
at the same time , the cost of equipment installed for neutralising diesel vehicles is increasing for car industry , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
at the same time as German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of ringing powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs referring to the problem .
companies are trying to prevent Volkswagen from repeating the mistakes of the Volkswagen , who was silent on the use of so @-@ called &apos; petrolery &apos; devices , which made it possible to adapt emissions to the regulations for the testing of a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former president of the Audi engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and can be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , the Audi German Volkswagen was drawn into criminal investigations when the authorities accused the installation of the audit system in order to circumvent the requirements for European gas emissions by extending an investigation which was previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Audi in the investigation may be a major blow to the Volkswagen , the manufacturer of luxury cars , a disproportionately large proportion of Volkswagen &apos;s profits .
the Estonian schools will have 20 000 euro flags of the European Union .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union to the Estonian schools by 1 September .
in total , 105x158 cent of the European Union flag will be awarded to 570 educational institutions .
flags are intended to be made available in indoor rooms , they must be carried out in high @-@ quality printed techniques with a view to a certificate of convenience , the ERR &apos;s news portal .
there is a text on the label : &apos; Kingitus Estonia &apos;s schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , or one flag costs EUR 35 .
murder of journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
the workers of the weekly newspaper , Riodoce , usually gather on Wednesday in order to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the State of Yaloa , which is sown by organised crime , corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars .
however , today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their routine .
two parents will be discussing which seems safer : either to bring children into office , which was the target of a grandioattack in 2009 , or to leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the leader of the room : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking reporters to provide the names of a veil in every water , do not need proof , and impressions and internal feelings are enough .
the presence of the government or cartels is suspected of drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists , a whole list of couples who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
there are no breath of violence , and the more the bodies of the country accumulate , the majority of these journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists , have been killed since the appointment of President Enrique Pena Montreto in December 2012 , at least 25 , 589 journalists , after attacks and threats under national protection , and this year at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states .
the latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration , Javier Valdez Cardenas , co @-@ founder of Riodoce .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote in Valdez one of his many books on drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though his presence can be felt everywhere in the Orthodox Riodoce Building , a big picture of the average of the Valdezist , together with the letter &apos; Justice &apos; , and two of the 30 reporters , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , carries T @-@ shirts , which have been portrayed by his sleep glasses or the face of the amateur village of his wife .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death , Reporters will discuss a common trauma , their nightmare , their hopelessness , their paranoia .
although in 2010 , a separate public prosecution service was set up to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee on the Protection of journalists .
as in the case of most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders , the number of which amounts to thousands , the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
Riodoce &apos;s editorial will continue to reflect the violence in Sinalas , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and justice of murderers , the meeting on security is not a great benefit , according to the Ibarra .
&quot; it is very nice to waste your time here at the meeting , &apos; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , there will be no mistrust of everyone . &quot;
Valdez left the capital of the State , Culiacan , from the Riodoce office on 15 May morning .
he managed to travel just a few quarters , before two men stopped the red Toyota Coroles , and he was forced to go out of the car and shot at 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which means &apos; the twelfth river &apos; .
the armed man travelled to Valdez &apos;s car and made an accident in the vicinity .
Valdez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adults .
the flooded spreads freely spread in Culiacan .
however , there is basically only silence on Valdez .
since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of the United States in January , one of the most bloody battlefields in the country has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country , because rivalries are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
there is no difference that a person or even a number of people are being shot on the streets of oa every day , or that the dead are stunned by the double @-@ fashioned sweets of drugs , which are greater than many homes .
let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one cartel is headed by the state of the sea with valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Riodoce co @-@ founder and the President , IsMay Bojorquez ( 60 ) , feels that he was unable to defend his friend .
he believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
the first of these was the publication of an interview with Guzman &apos;s pots in February , a cartel , a cartel of war , and the Samaso Lopezeach .
this piece of correspondence could have been alluded to by the suspect gangs who bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they were reached in the newspapers .
the second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security , after there was a ramp in one of the newspapers that have been reflected in the same story .
Valdez was legalised both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had remained alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he existed forever .
he worked in 2003 as a veteranreporter in Noroeste when he joined five colleagues in order to create Riodoce , selling 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bojorquez said that &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem &apos; .
the amount of time has been felt by its courageous and honest performances and sales and advertising increased .
Reporters were keen to express vigorous studies without fear of censorship and readers , which they were able to read stories that no one else dared to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Riodoce , the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for his Latin American reports .
in the same year , the Committee on the Protection of journalists in Valdez ( AKK ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said the AKK award .
last October , in an interview with Rompeviento TV , he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Blue .
&quot; your head is to embrace the task that the journalists &apos; office is accompanied by a second chance to play .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths , or why I did not say what is happening . &quot;
Riodoce collectives will miss Valdez , a joke who rops like low , a friend who divided embryos and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their support to his routine .
he always gave his village a barrel .
he went from the office to El Guatemyabo bar and was always sitting on the same desk .
now they are asking whether his routine love became fatal to him .
his death has also put them into question how best to do his job and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the rigidity of their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bojorquez .
the result is , even in the best times , strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination .
trust in your instincts .
if it is a matter of suspiciously , it is a matter of keeping away .
according to the editor of Riodoce , Andres Villarreali , the problem is that &apos; fragrance can be deceived ... and so it was the case with Jempera &apos; .
he and others say that you no longer have the old rules , just as they do not apply in Thailand , Veracruz , Guerreros or other states which are home to the toxic combination of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in a space where the Riodoce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only the numbering assets sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in front of the House , two police officers sought to alleviate the 40 @-@ degree heat of the pump .
the government appointed them to a more elected Riodoce office in the Culiacan central class in Culiacan .
some reporters wondered whether these police officers are among their 50 % of police officers , whose Governor himself has been unreliable .
several months have passed since the reporters have travelled to mountain areas where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gangs .
Riodoce &apos;s edition of this week addressed three main features .
one of them was the murder of the former poet Julio Cesar Chavez venna in Blue aloas .
in addition , they had a revealing story of the spending of government funds on the home town of the Governor .
a group of people was kidnapped from Culiacan , one of the most expensive restaurants , and the public Prosecutor &apos;s office from the quarter .
there was no formal announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened , so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of the restaurant , both the drug traffickers and the authorities of the authorities .
the Reporter became aware of the public documents that the restaurant is registered as a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( IRP ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
in recent times , several IRP Governor has been accused of corruption in the context of widespread cases .
in Villarline asked the reporter to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Guzman poet El Chapo has escaped a military visit .
just a few months earlier , readers would have been looking for a Valdez cocktail to obtain information on the kidnappings from the best sources .
&apos;In the past we would have known what happened , &apos; said 46 @-@ year @-@ old Villark , whose body construction has earned him a slogan El Flaco .
&quot; now all channels of communication have broken up with our sources . &quot;
the office of Valdez has become a reservoir to bridges and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists , and editorial workers have become something that they never expected to wait for activists on behalf of the press .
Reporter Miriam Ramirez seized a few eyes and direction next morning to the local Prosecutor &apos;s office for another journalist .
Mr Salvador , in the Western State of Michoacan , three days after the murder of Valdez .
it has been found to be a dead body and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists have become more vocal across the country , and are crippling the phrase &apos; SOS press &apos; as a organised protest against the roads and buildings .
on this day , President Bojorquez is in Washington , trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case .
the day after the death of Valdez , the Ramirez authorities accused the journalists of the bullying and killing of them because of the truth .
after that , he requested that he be diverted from the government &apos;s activities elsewhere , concerned that hatred has affected objectivity .
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ guilty state officials and indifferent society .
in his last book , the &apos; drug press &apos; , he wrote that the reporters are not only killing drug gangs , but also under the command of politicians and security forces , who are at the mercy of organised crime .
Articulo 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , appealed to more than half of the attacks on journalists on the police and civil servants last year .
&apos;In Mexico &apos; , because you want to be silent , &apos; said Ramirez .
there is obviously a verbal impact .
no one will forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipasis six years ago .
he was found to be a dead body with a letter , which was probably signed by a cartel in LOS Zetas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
in addition to his painted head , computer glass and ears were found .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state , Chihuahuahua , after the killing of their correspondent , Ai slava Botopoulos , in March .
others will pass on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the murder of their President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez has publicly spoken to the drug cartel with the slogan &apos; What do you want us ? &apos; .
some journalists have fled from national states or even from the country .
this is a nervous decision .
it is difficult to find work in this way , and they still have to look at the streets in order to prevent dangers .
and sometimes they are behind them , as was probably the case with the photograph Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered together with four women &apos;s people in 2015 , three months after the Veracruz break .
those who remain in place and continue to work will have to refute risky decisions every day .
Ibarra , who once wanted to become a poet , recognises that the reporting of drug trafficking is frightening him .
&quot; Mexico is on the road to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
one of the recent midnight of Friday , when the latest number had already been stunned , the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and plundering the beer when suddenly all the phones began to be calibrated .
there were 19 people who died in the fire @-@ fighting between rival gangs and security forces in Mazatlanis , a staggering 19 people .
the war continued to continue , as did several of the messages that have been found in the region .
according to the same pavements , reporters made news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone .
in the front of next day , we needed to change .
the Sireens were seized by another arms exchange in the region .
Bojorquez piilus towards police officers to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not at least show it .
the founder of the newspaper has fallen under a massive tree , with his average finger being seen as a whole for the Sinalodoce , in Riodoce workers in his footsteps .
&apos;How can you think about the closure , &apos; said Bojorquez , &apos; whereas on the same day , when Javier was killed , a traineeship asked me to make a report on the streets ? &apos;
Dinosaurus used the protection of enemies to avoid enemies
at first glance , it seems like a form , albeit rather frightening .
scientists have now unveiled the first findings of the unbelievable presence of Canadian miners , which are so well preserved that experts have described it as &apos; dinosaurs Mona Lisa &apos; .
it has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the leather covered by his soya was the colour of red lignite and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the report published in the newspaper Biology described the existence as &apos; the best preserved sodium &apos; , which has ever been found &apos; and &apos; one of the best parts of the world &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new type of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the age of 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
its unbelievably good retention in the raft of theatre who describe it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
according to the National GeoGuard , this type of phosphorus , which has ever been found , has been best preserved by this type of phosphorus covered by soya .
it was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn functional , when he extracted Suncor Millenium in the Fort McMurray near Northern Albertas in Canada .
he struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone , and decided to look into it .
the advertised phosphorus was sent to Royal Tyrrell Paleondust museum .
for the next six years , it was designed to refer the animal to the land of 2 500 pounds ( 1100 @-@ kilometres ) .
after all this hard work , the final result is now finally ready to bring the public ahead .
&quot; if a little bit of eyes are torn , you can almost believe that he sleep , &apos; said Caleb Brown , the leading author , Royal Tyrrell , in the museum of the Royal Tyrrell .
&quot; this will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaurs - Mona Lisana . &quot;
when he looked at his skin , he found that this vegetation , which is covered by soya and resembles a walking tank , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food dinosaurs .
this high @-@ level dinosaur used red and white defence colours to hide from predators , and applied shelters , which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
this enabled experts , according to the experts , to enter into the dinosaur better , and to avoid enemies , as the major dinosaurs were likely to be hunt .
this was the first time in May and is now visited by Royal Tyrrell in the paleontology museum of the Royal Tyrrell .
the researchers have now investigated and given it the name of the Borealopelta Marmitchelli museum laboratory mark Mitchell , who was a famous team that spent more than 7000 hours in order to reveal more than 7000 hours .
thanks to the amazing good preservation of the father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to record the shape and size of the soatings in the body .
they discovered a contradiction - a common method of protection in the country of animal origin , which means that the intrusion of the present half was a dam as a aluminium .
although there is a common sense of responsibility , the findings come as a surprise , as Boeing is much greater than those who live in the face of responsible animals today .
this suggests that the dinosaurs were sufficiently actively hunted by other musicians , so that the evolution preferred to be overshadowed instead of the confrontation of the survivors .
however , most of the animals used today , such as fear , bars or armadweather , are much smaller and more vulnerable , indicating that nodosaurus had to really work to survive .
&quot; the strong hunt of the dinosaur , which is covered by a huge and multitude of sows , shows how dangerous it could have been to be the animals who were kidnapped from the dinosaurs of the age of crippers , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds of organic compounds also revealed that the dinosaur &apos;s skin was red .
scientists will continue to set up an investigation in order to get angles about this life , including the retained content of this gender @-@ style style , in order to find out what the animal would have in its last place .
they believe that the dinosaur has fallen into the dead rivers , thereby entering into the sea , where it turned its back into the ocean .
at the time , Albertas was just as warm as it is today in South Florence , and rivers and oceans are likely to go far beyond the internal land .
&quot; this nodosaurus is truly remarkable , as it is fully covered by a sober leaf , but it has also remained three @-@ dimensional , while preserving the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal is almost the same nowadays as in the age of cricket .
in order to reconstruct it , there is not a great deal of imagination to use - it is enough simply to preach bridges and it seems to be a sleep . &quot;
the crisis era was the time when there were huge two legs in the countryside - heterogeneous .
although the Queen Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta , some of his horrendous predecessors could be hunted by some of his horrendous predecessors .
these include Acrocanthosaurus , 38 legs ( 11.5 metres ) , a long and six @-@ tonne monster .
scientists whose recent findings have been published in the magazine Biology , believe that Borealopelta was killed after death in the sea and this muzambique sludge .
on 21 March 2011 , Shawn functional was discovered when he extracted Fort McMurray from the Millenium mine in Northern Albertas in Canada .
according to the museum , it is best preserved in the world , including leather and soya , and it is an integrated concentration up to the pumps .
these assumptions were on average 18 legs ( five metres ) long and the shelves up to GBP 3 000 ( 1300 kg ) .
there were two 20 customs @-@ long ora on its shoulders .
scientists believe that it was through the current Western Canada , which is covered by the soya , until the river is flooded into the open sea .
however , the place of absorbing the dinosaur under the sea helped to maintain an excellent detail of its characteristics .
the ice caps of this particular father are so well preserved that the headlines of the mysterious soomers are still covered by the headlines of the dinosaur .
as Michael Greshko wrote in the magazine of National Geodic : &apos; such storage is as rare as a loophole .
the more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
Deleaded skin ice is still covered by the creation of mysterious soya cards on the ground .
a better front is lying alongside him , and five assets have been rushed upwards .
I will be able to count on the sows of his winter . &quot;
how did one activist find a response to the question of &apos; whose streets ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell received a full shock .
just a day after the trip to New York , that was the birthplace of St. Louise Airbnb on a leaked bed , on Facebook on the phone .
he came to the post of his former school compatriot .
there was a letter : &apos; the police killed just 18 @-@ year @-@ old adolescents and he is still on the streets &apos; .
he was confused why no one else had posted this information on his stream , which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
Pidega @ TheePsucah &apos;s user had repeatedly been divided on his line .
Mr St. , from the Louise region , Michael Browni , the death of an unarmed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man , who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson Missouris , was communicated in real time .
he gave a picture of the life of Browni living in the street , staying there for four hours .
&quot; it is crazy , &quot; said Ferreira .
however , death was nothing new for him or for the community .
he has put his phone off , but later this evening , he saw the spark of the people &apos;s assembly in Canfield Drive .
Jagat photographs of the police and the people of fear , and a man who claimed himself to be the father of Brown and kept the label &apos; Fergusoni police killed just my unarmed son &apos; .
he looked at a real @-@ time stream in which the police officer stood up to the group of protesters with the graves .
in the second video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Mr Ferrell is reminded of how he struck himself from thinking : &apos; it is unusual &apos; .
&quot; this is not a murder of this kind , which we are accustomed to and which we could describe as typical . &quot;
I felt frightened at this moment .
I was angry and I met . &quot;
he booked a return flight and travelled home on the next day .
having buried at 23 o &apos;clock , he went to his father for his six @-@ year daughter and decided that they would travel to Fergusoni next morning .
what the Ferrell and Fergusonga took place next three years is a central issue in the new documentary &apos; Whose street ? &apos; ( &apos; whose streets ? &apos; ) , which will be presented in cinemas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who have thanked the answers .
if Mrs Ferreira , together with her daughter - who had a lipsy sticker and a peculiar with it - the Ferguson , they spoke again on a subject that they had repeatedly spoken before this morning - about the experience and living conditions of the musicians .
&quot; remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; recalls itself in question .
&quot; we are now travelling to Fergusoni because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on board , &quot; said Ferreira later .
&quot; what is happening now is ... the culmination of what happened in the past .
it needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it .
he must learn about a activist and organisation and , at the same time , also know the different layers of experience and living conditions of the musicians , and what we need to do to be free and free .
even if I succeed in bringing him up in such a way that he does not personally copy brutal racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel that I would do him a disservice if I would defend him from this world . &quot;
the first stop that they did in the vicinity of Fergusoni was through South Florissanti - a police station in the middle of the road , which had become a kind of camp , where activists were waiting for news of the police officer Darren Wilson , who was not ultimately charged .
there , Mr Ferreira and his daughter joined forces with local business owners who prepared lunch .
they put together food homes and helped to distribute them to the protesters .
for the Ferrell , a new type of activist has slowly started to take shape .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at the Missouri @-@ St. Louise University , he was the President of the Union for Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organisation .
this is all simply a pipe . &quot;
weeks later , Ferreira met a film co @-@ director Sabaah Folayanh during the evening demonstration .
Folayan said that he and the film operator , Mr Alvarado @-@ Farrar , simply wanted to document what is happening .
the question of &apos; are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often painful - come to the community and try to profit from its legitimacy and resilience .
Folayan explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
the Folayan had already put his hands on the co @-@ director Damon Davati , the artificial father of the region , who was known as activists who have been sentenced to death .
his involvement made the project attractive for the Ferrell and the six other local ones who were watched by the film &apos; Whose street &apos; for years after the shooting of Browni .
&quot; in this documentary , nobody is talking about us or with us , but we are talking about ourselves , &apos; said Davis .
&quot; for me , it was important how these people are portrayed , because I am also portrayed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell - it was intended to show that the movement is not about &apos; donor leader &apos; , but about the community coming together &apos; , as the Folayan said - he was the most open party to the film .
as a result , &apos; Whose Streets ? &apos; , surprisingly personal aspects of the life of Ferrell , such as ruthless and married with their wife .
&quot; I felt , as I would be earlier , &apos; said Ferrell , laughing over the first time when he was prepared to see the city .
&quot; however , I realised that it must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability to make this work and to the humanity of the black people . &quot;
moreover , the story of Ferrell emphasises and replaces the role of the black LGBT woman in the wider Black Sea Lives Matter movement .
two of the three initiators of the movement who , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martini in the social media in 2012 , thought out the hashtag # BlackLivesMatter , is homosexual .
&quot; in a leading role , Muslim women have kept the movement in general , &quot; said Ferrell , &quot; and this is precisely because we have to fight continually on several fronts .
Roma women must bear all the burden . &quot;
the Folayan agreed , stating that &apos; movement is indeed alive by black women and many of them are black homosexuals &apos; .
he says , however , that &apos; this is not a case of creating a kind of equal opportunity &apos; - Ferrell was not chosen as a film centre for his identity .
&quot; he was a man , who was the right energy , &quot; he said .
&quot; however , it is not a coincidence that he was directly on the frontline , because the black LGBT woman is at stake when living in such hubs .
his energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news cameras Ferguson has long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the conditional sentences imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the road will continue to be 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region he calls homelessness , simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
nevertheless , it still attaches importance to the mantra which it has been eating since the time when it went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we do not have to lose anything other than our chains . &quot;
7 nips on how to overcome Weekise &apos;s potablet
some of the most stubborn meters will find , after a scarce pipe , that they are suffering from , hence help .
or in the light of the saying &apos; How a pot , a pyramid &apos; .
however , this is only an inevitable postponement and a good word for health .
what can you do to ensure that , after today and tomorrow , the Weekise trend - or other pipes - is better felt this morning and to overcome the poppy as painfully as possible ?
Joo water .
it is down to alcohol and , after a great deal this morning ... or , if possible , even rather than alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it must somehow be recovered .
together with water , minerals are also being thrown out of the body , and sestap is a good hair of mineral water .
as a result of the often irritation of the soil is often irritated , it is particularly good if it is a bubble @-@ free or easy gamble .
let us walk .
it would certainly not cost the grandmother to burn the trees - it may prove fatal to be a false decision .
however , it is easy to remember the body once again what the feeling is to be alive .
Telgis and sleeping boys are a more time @-@ consuming way of getting healthier .
give poor energy back gradually and cautiously .
if you are already in the middle of yesterday &apos;s overrun , it will certainly not be worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
for example , a fresh wave of fruit in which the lion &apos;s share is slowly placed on the market as a body .
if the health of the South is already suffering , it would be possible to try , for example , wedding .
and a little later on .
a coffee was avoided .
this softer will release your body from the last water .
as has already been said : water and volume are your friends .
it is making a contribution to painkillers .
if you take a painkiller in order to prevent a pot on the evening , you have to deal with paratsetamol or ibuprophet , not only with alcohol , but also with the ability to do so .
so the riches are even more expensive and , in the future , the poppy is worse .
in addition , there will not be a long @-@ term silence in the past .
if you take a painkiller this morning , you will do it with a blank cheque - it irritates the already dirty sweat .
or if you do not have a partner , you can do well with you .
it is about the same thing as walking , but it does not become a orgasm .
however , too active a pace and outrageous shops were avoided - the physical effort should be moderate .
a joke .
the words of the friends of the friends of the time , the road to simple topes and the naera amicably , both for themselves and for others ( suffering ) .
Nali and laugher may not be doing a pot , but it is certainly easier for them to follow up .
once again , the poet goes over anyway !
Professor of Northwestern and University of Oxford are being sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , professors of the University of Northwestern and the University of Oxford are being sought nationally , who have received suspects following the death of men with lethal bullets from one Chicago &apos;s luxury corps .
according to the judicial documents of the Cook County , on Monday , the arrest warrant was issued for 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni , accused of being murdered at first instance because of their alleged involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell @-@ Duranleu .
according to documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Duranleu died after repeated Nazis .
according to the warning that the Chicago police station issued to the community , the body was found on 27 July .
police officers received telephone calls and found the Grand Plaza Corterhouse for the victim , whose body had a number of torturers .
according to the officials , the Cornell @-@ Duranleu event was recognised as dead and investigators , while the police are actively looking for two suspects .
they have worked as co @-@ professors of micro @-@ biology and immunology at the University of Northwester since 2007 .
the Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations , Alan K. Cubbage , said in a statement sent as e @-@ publishing that Lake has now been temporarily removed from work and is forbidden to enter the cities of the University of Northwestern .
&quot; this is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of Northwester will work with researchers , &quot; said Cubbage .
Mr Warren is a senior assistant of the University of Oxford .
the representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e @-@ publishing statement : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to help US research authorities in every possible way &apos; .
in addition , the statement stated that the Warreni colleagues were shocked and willing to give themselves up .
Anthony Guglielm , President of the police department in Chicago , urges the authorities to give themselves to the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are , but we are dealing with an increasingly intensive definition of the exact location , &quot; said Guglielm .
according to Guglielm , local , regional and national authorities will help to search for suspects .
Guglielm said that the police received a telephone call from the Grand Plaza Corterhouse , who had just received a cryptic rain that there has been something happening at Corps No 1008 .
according to the police reports , this was a spectacle .
it is not clear , according to Guglielm , whether the event itself was also taking place on 27 July .
he said that the security cameras confirm the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
the Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police are currently working to identify the background of events and the background of the victim , and will examine the various motives , including the possibility of a family dispute . &apos;
companies that help your businesses to avoid the next Ubwould
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were lucrative .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anonymity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Errett , who is headed by Madison Reed , a company selling e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees in San Franciscos .
it therefore called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups with new types of human resources , which will help businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software that aims to measure the involvement of workers , they will allow companies to carry out a knife , to target firm teams and demographic groups , to provide the anonymity of workers and the hot line of complaints and , in some cases , to allow manufacturers to bypass the C @-@ level leaders and to turn directly to the Bureau .
&quot; now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbps , which are designed to monitor health , but where is Fitbi for your company ? &apos; asked Jim Barnett , co @-@ founder and CEO Reding wood City start @-@ ups Glint , whose software analysts are used by companies to measure the inclusion of workers .
according to Erretti , he has received three years in which he has used Glinti , a much better overview of what the workers think and feel .
in addition to surveys and specific teams , it offers a company &apos;s heat card , which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , enabling it to identify the causes .
companies have started to realise that they have to stay in touch with their culture of work , so as not to become the next Ub , which has been insurmounted in scandals since the former worker published a blog , which described the harassing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as Glint , the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business .
the global governance , regulation and conformity area can be worth more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020 , according to the website of financial ethics statistics .
Denveris Colorados , a start @-@ up company , which helps businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , noted in the light of the dubious reputation of Ubber this year an increase in interest and activity .
there are almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
the Uber has recently registered himself as a customer .
as in Glinter , the coalition companies will be able to send a tailor @-@ made impulse poll , collect real @-@ time confidential answers and look at the problematic areas of heat cards .
it also offers anonymous messages to enable workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has been anchored by regulators , &quot; said Patrick Quinlan and CEO Patrick Quinlan .
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act ethically , the company may face serious consequences , such as consumer boycotts , leaving workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ruby , the restaurant , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of operation , has been used more than a year to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and offer a simple way to interact with the headquarters of the corporation .
if a worker wanted to report the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address to the corporation headquarters , and I hope that it will be taken seriously .
this was often a discouraging and inconvenient process , said James Vitrano , General Adviser , who said that there was no good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , at a time when the company is using a coalition census , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices , which did not previously lead to more rapid identification and treatment of offices in other cities or states .
&quot; I will be able to get closer to the holy 360 @-@ degree experience of the workers , &quot; said Vitrano , who is headed by the Ruby @-@ by @-@ by @-@ line risk management group .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and the involvement of workers more seriously in 2002 , after the audit company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical irregularities in relation to the Enron scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; , the companies realised that they cannot prevent their black wash from publicly hiding online .
&quot; before using the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both Glint and Vienna offer their software as a service , taking advantage of companies &apos; periodic pay for the use of their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors who have been in favour of both start @-@ ups .
in February 10 million dollars were financed by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by USD 47 million .
the Glinti invested USD 10 million in November in Bessemer Venture partners , increasing the company &apos;s total funding to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise if we take into account the link between companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more research shows that today &apos;s workers are waiting for more than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high wages and interesting projects are just on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy in a company , they feel that they are heard and that the work they do is satisfying , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said Nina McQueen , Vice @-@ President LinkedInis , who has a general benefit and the experience of workers , who uses both the so @-@ called cencenti and Glinti .
investors earn revenue if companies belonging to their portfolio are doing well ; businesses are doing well when workers are committed and involved .
if the analytical tools of the third party allow us to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , we are not sure that they will be supported .
the possession of data on the involvement of workers is important , according to experts in the culture of work .
however , these data are useless if the company &apos;s follow @-@ ups do nothing to do with them .
in fact , if a company asks for feedback from its employees , it can create expectations that changes are ahead of us .
and if the changes do not take place quickly or not at all , it could cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask 4 000 proposals , you must be ready for 4 000 conversations , &quot; said Kotter International President Russell Raath , who has seen how companies are making a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&quot; because if things are not brought to the end , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Erretti , the Netherlands , which is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via Glinti .
and , after the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , it was possible to reorganise several teams in the company and to provide communication training to deal with the problems .
however , Mr Ruby Kyprianou is collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in the industry , known for its high turnover of labour .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vitrano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose your customers .
and if you lose your customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
the euro area remains a star in Bali : incomes are growing rapidly
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , BSE , referring to the report by the European Central Bank .
according to the ECB , since 1999 , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
there is a low debt burden , fast @-@ growing institutions and business @-@ friendly and free @-@ market @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where the EU average has been substantially closer to the purchasing power of the reactor per capita . &quot; announced the Central Bank .
while the aim is to ensure that the overall output of the economy per capita is equal to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2 / 3 of the average of 15 countries , which were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle .
low wages have led the balans to seek a better wage abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic in a positive light , and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are doing very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was slightly less than half of those questioned about their economies .
NCAA &apos;s decision to cancel the trends taking place twice a day makes Bruinsi a long day
at almost 23 o &apos;clock , it is almost 23 that the football club of UCLA stops talking at the edge of a new exercise in the city of a team .
some of them have been burdened by a banner , revealing the efforts of the first day of their training camp .
for a large part of the team , they provide a midday break .
the participants in the course of the cucumbers are going to learn from the trialogues after a three @-@ hour trend , before returning at 6.30 meetings next morning to the WWman football club .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Bruinsi treach , Jim Mora , shortly before the Monday became Tuesday .
NCAA &apos;s decision to cancel the burden of players on a two @-@ day basis has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end of the day - to one side of the bargain .
for this reason , the three first operations of the UCLA were prompted to start at 19.15 , in order to fit players into the already tight timeline .
the transition from two strikes a day to a day means more than one trend - the beginning of the Bruinsi camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season , and for the first time in Mora &apos;s six Westward season , there will be workshops during summer courses .
they have until 20 August an agenda of 18 trenings before the formal preparation of the opening game against Texas A &amp; M in September begins .
according to Mora , he is in favour of the change of the NCAA rules , although it adds another item to the close schedules of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; and they break themselves through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that if we arrive on Saturday and we have more time , it will be a truly good thing . &quot;
if the camp is closed , the UCLA workings will be closed down , which is not an easy task , given the clear view of the parking plate of their fields and by @-@ standby Luskini , a higher @-@ class hotel , which has already escaped from a net of protection from football around the gates .
since this weekend , hotels are occupied by the Bruinsi players , but Mora acknowledged that problems may arise during the season with free tobacco .
&quot; we are implementing security measures , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; this is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can filter a dozen and treasuries .
if the summer has a record of a train , it can do a good deal .
but we are using a security team there and 8 parking stations .
we will do our best to use it .
I will try not particularly to worry about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the cost of the election union of Saduare @-@ Ivanova , who was expelled from the Reform Party , Kristiina Ojuland and the ECB forced to leave the forces of Maria Kaljs in the hands of our Tallinn and the parties to show the entrepreneurial Association in Tallinn , seems to be at least as much as the political parties involved in the local elections this year .
however , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether they are all sufficiently disappointed by voters .
who will remain with the Sahel ?
if the support team of Edgar Saduare has been reduced , it can anticipate the events organised by his electoral union .
one of the members of the country , some former and current central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and is there any reason why , in Tallinn , some of the faithful faiths and sisters of Saduare evade the candidacy , to look at the fact that the list of &apos; Saduare &apos; , which is the subject of suspicion of corruption and corruption , is becoming a reality ?
on the Russian @-@ speaking poem of a film @-@ driven music caldeo , which takes part in the city of Lasnam√§e ; and in any sense the original computer game in which Prime Minister J√ºri Ratas must avoid lomnipe and orchests on the road to the polls for the first time , is the central party trying to avoid the votes of the 16th and 17th year @-@ old voters ?
we look forward to the perception of the other political parties of the youth campaign .
if the Kanal 2 or TV3 look at the black rally instead of the beginning of August , there will be two options : to accept that , in future , only ETV , ETV2 , ETV + , Tallinn TV and English @-@ language France24 channels or to surrender each month to 10 TV operators .
there are probably also those who openly rejoice at the beginning of advertising @-@ free television experience , but at the end of the day - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and advertisements .
the deafening music , the black people and the rubbish left on the streets are an unpleasant side of almost every major musical festival .
however , if you do not want to be part of the ocean , however , it is worth going to the home country , rather than being painted at home , to go - and leave a sleeping place for the lung sum for the festival .
Washington changes the rules of the Green Card
media publications are quoted by President Donald Trumpi , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned , which will change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Republican and supported by the President .
the bill goes to the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , as it will change the way in which green maps are issued to citizens of other countries in the US .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process provides an advantage for candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economies , &quot; said Trump American media publications .
Siberian seto young people are moving back to land , pensioners .
Jevseyev Anatololi continues the tradition of the famous seto gold miners of the River Maana .
he is working 140 kilometres away from home to Maana , as a driver of gold in Kuvai .
this is a tough job : two months of work without rest days , and then only 10 days at home and again .
during the three years of the Artel , Anatoll has seen only one time .
&apos;There is a lot of order : when you go into it , you will have to be thoroughly checked so that you do not lead to it , and if you do not take it &apos; , you will talk about Anatol .
Mare Piho &apos;s conversation in the village of Haida with the local seto Jaga , who has spoken a lot about the memory of his family in Siberia .
the archaic culture of Siberian setopes is also beginning to affect the homes , because it is simply so shocking , thinks the most far @-@ sighted mixtures of Piho Mare .
his first investigation trip to Siberia will be 30 years later this year .
during this period , he has been there 14 times and has lived there for one year .
how much was the case in Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took note of this in the words of Siberian seto men who have also thought about it .
it is difficult to say precisely because up to 30 people could come in one group at the time , but the passport was only given to a man .
the passport was given only one , but it was children , sisters and women .
look at how much this territory was here .
this was a number of times greater than the historic Setomaist .
after all , it was necessary to educate , to manage it in some way .
Setos came here as farmers , but their lives changed , because they came to areas that were not only in agriculture but also in the river ( palgiparation ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New Petsert , many pigs went to work later in Krasnojarsk @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P. ) when it was formed .
was it the majority of the population in the region at that time ?
yes , they lived in a Compact .
in addition , a long tradition of marriage is maintained , and a lot of children .
seven @-@ eight children in the family were common .
how much is the culture of Siberian setopes different and different from that of the mother tongue ?
they are different , although what was said here was never the same .
they gave rise to a great deal of money .
they did so , too , ( the shadow ideas ) , but they always made a distinction between what was included and what was done here .
climate change has been severely affected by the traditional rivalry , because there is , after all , a cold .
the changes have been proposed .
for example , Setomaal meat was salt , but it was simply frozen here .
where are the villages of Siberian and what life is living there ? / graphics : Alari Paluends
the link with the mother country was spiritually strong , it was considered very important .
it seems to me that it is now starting to give back to the Setuony , to influence them .
those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories .
Piho must bear in mind the people of the Estonian delegation who came at the beginning of July to the day of Haida village Seto Kingdom and lived four days in homes - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is very easy to come and also go , because the city has an excellent location : the railway link and the roads at the crossroads , says Reigo Tamm , who comes from Tapy .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a lot of hope , sports and cultural places , and the carrot will be in every corner .
Tapa is a tip @-@ up city !
there is a small island in the Linera through the current White river , where the Tamils tend to be hijacked .
&quot; this beautiful place of train does not appear to be &apos; , haggles Reigo .
those who are not afraid of cold water can flood in the river , because the river is full of resources .
I have been flooded there , you can do it !
the water of the river can be regarded as long as it is easy to do the romantics - it can look at the flow of the river and think about life and want .
I have also been there with my own names .
the Ooperisolist Tamm has , apart from anything else , been getting used to three bridges between the river basin : &apos; that this place is on the city &apos;s city , no one may come in any way if their stories are heard &apos; .
&quot; there is a wonderful view of the Tapy mountain , but there are also health professionals where you can drink , winter skies and now , for example , to play a golf course - golf courses have been made , chains can be borrowed from sports centres , &quot; Reigo .
the old processors are , of course , there with their own system , but I have not yet been able to play there .
obviously , my colleague , Mrs Rasmus , must be invited to the village of Tapale , because she has experienced cgolfans and she has a chain .
perhaps he will lend me !
Reigo and M√§nnikug were inseparable from the current period of childhood .
at least during hours .
there are many tears , disappointments and you can be found in my sporting life .
not to mention the collapse of bells and suicides .
&quot; the entire city is now full of construction works , all this will become unknown , &quot; praised by Reigo .
however , the old and tired building is a very attractive place where oral discoveries are being played .
I am pleased that in 2012 , the head of R.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.M , welcomed my idea and had to make a summer theatre with his theatre .
although this year &apos;s theatre season &apos; Aleksei Karenin &apos; has just been carried out , on 11 August , the railway station is &apos; Elluwake &apos; , when the old building is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; from 11 to 13 August , Tapa City Days have been launched , in addition to the Open house of the Pringe , and there will be a series of cultural events , including the Solidarity Fund , Reigo , who recommends a visit to the city of 9 days .
on 1 May , a museum has already been in 1994 on 1 May .
&quot; the house is small , but there is a great deal of misgivings and information enormously , &quot; welcomes Reigo , which is full of the history of the Tapa town , most of which focuses on the railways and sister .
Reigo muds that , if all the sites recommended by Tapal were to be carried out , it will be a long @-@ distance empty , but fortunately a small town is full of coffee .
&quot; we have such good eating places and when we sit in coffee , sometimes you have the feeling that you are abroad , he describes it .
educated and young Tapy soldiers spend a lot of time in pubs , sestap there is a mixed feeling that you are in Estonia and your home town , but there is such an international company together .
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to the stories of the French or the Americans .
the wars , yes , we are going to have a lot !
two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tendering in Greece
Telecanal bTV quoted a foreign Ministry who announced that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering .
in the morning of 1 August , the police arrested on the island of Sithonia a group of illegally ordered people , including two Bulgarians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulgarians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing heavy fines on all those who are caught in a place of cleansing , which is not intended to do so .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
the wolves that teach the junta are breaking the sheep .
farmers on the shelf have to give the wolves once again , after year , to give their carpet &apos; educational material &apos; - apparently the wolves that taught the junta have already broken a number of sheep .
this year , the wolves in the Hiiu County have broken the sheep three times , with 23 sheep and eight , writes the Hiiu page .
the soil was only three years before 124 .
there are also data from the Environment Agency in the syndrome of Murdines that the soil was not born in Hiiuland and the Hiiuland hunting Council &apos;s information that this year , two wolves have been fixed on the island .
on Monday night , the wolves were unleashed by 15 sheep in the village of Kabul and injured in 18 survivors .
in the morning of the morning , the wolves in the village of Rehebacks on the land of the village of Commons were broken down by one sheep and wounded hard by another , who had to be made an emergency killer .
rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and the draft law on the amendment of plant protection products .
the amendment to the law removes the creation of a separate collection of data for the locations of both genetically modified ( GM ) crops and operators , which will continue to be used for plant health records .
in addition , the obligation of GM crops to have prior agreement with the designated person dealing with beekeeping will be amended .
although there is currently no cultivation of GM crops in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as there is no decision to declare Estonia GMO @-@ free , &quot; said Sigmar Suu Kyi , the head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and the public sector , in the Annex .
the draft law repeals the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of data on GM crops and operators in the field of GM crops , lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and the requirements for starting economic activities .
specifically with regard to the beekeeping sector , the obligation to inform beekeepers of the cultivation of GM crops will be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeepers before bringing up cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to ministries for coordination .
all interested parties have the opportunity to access the draft information system and , if they so wish , to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , those operating in the area of plant farming , beekeepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 810 .
so far , however , no Estonian farmer has been interested in the cultivation of GM crops .
the reason for this is that there is no magic bullet in Estonia , a European shadow media , for which mon 810 is resistant .
it has also been extended to the southern regions , and it is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
in order to obtain certainty , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination of GM organisms in Estonia in seeds , maize and soya varieties .
the analysis of the samples carried out showed that seeds were not included and that the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soya varieties in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms .
in turn , it can be concluded that in Estonia , GM crops are not deliberately cultivated , and it was also confirmed that there has not been a random contamination .
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United colours in the form of Nemanja Maticu in the form of &apos; genius &apos;
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United States has recruited Nemanja Maticu in the form of &apos; genetic genius &apos; , after a central player against Samlov on Wednesday evening .
for GBP 40 million , a player bought from Chelsea , started in Dublin , in the last seasonal game of the Unitedi , before the UEFA Super Cupi line against Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 , impressed by the role of defence , while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on attacks .
however , having left aside from the Blueprint for seasonal Asia , Maticl was badly needed to bury and it was only 45 minutes , which , according to Mourinho , must be corrected before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genious thinking - he has a football mindset , &quot; said Mourinho .
&quot; we will help him to achieve a form as soon as possible . &quot;
as in the past , the Aviva stadium also started other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romlu Mubarak , and Mourinho began to put a man in place at the beginning of the season .
the Independent public this week revealed that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football clubs , but he confirmed that the club has already done a &apos; excellent job &apos; by concluding agreements with three of its four priority choices .
&quot; I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three out of four , &quot; he added .
&quot; I am even happier if they are able to make four four , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
another warm son received the GSM Embassy on 1 August and this time in Muhus .
according to Mati Martinson , an observer living in Sfragile Martinson , we received the first cumber to be equipped with the embassy in Sfragile , and this washing cell is already flying around , leaving the washing ground and joining a large @-@ scale garment of the Mullutu @-@ Great Gulf .
this is because , after all , there are no fertility fields , the voice of the islands is written .
this Tuesday , in a relatively late way , it has become yet another son and one on the island of Muhu .
according to Martinson , the installation of embassies is actually an international project that is being carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojka .
the soil was supplied by a son called Mati GSM , Sfragile ves Turkey .
&quot; his actions are all on the internet : how he went to Spain in winter , back a long time in the German and Polish border , and then Saareland came , Martinson spoke .
British inventors to install a microchip in their own body in order to get a handful of houses and cars
the British inventor became the first person in a country to have a microchip installed in order to be able to open up its own front , to get to office and even to launch a car .
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Steven Northam children to install a small chip between their fingers and their name , and will now provide this service to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier through their technology .
he has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson , a consultant @-@ anestesiologist of the Royal hospital in Winchester in Hants , to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards .
the technology is similar to the microchip installed on cats and bags , and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure .
the Northam company will also replace houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chip , asking for GBP 300 per cent .
this child &apos;s father has now installed the technology both at home and in his car , BMW Z4 , which will start when he has his hand in the wheel .
the White House has cost taxpayers thousands of
according to the military documents announced in the magazine , the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter last month for an event involving American production in the south of the horror to the taxpayer was even USD 24 000 .
the green and white colour Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , which is called Marine One during the presidential pardon , was a central feature of the event that took place on 17 July in Valges Main .
President Donald Trump , Vice @-@ President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House reported on industrial products from all 50 states in the world .
the helicopter built in Connecticutis was built together with a reputation @-@ based hunt , a fire @-@ fighting car from Wisconten and a Mississip @-@ made pallet .
according to the Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX @-@ 1 ) documents , the Helicopter Squadron , the Helicopter Squadron , called for the presence of a helicopter in a military cabinet , a little 36 hours before the helicopter for the &apos; unusual &apos; event in the southern horror .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an unusually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said HMX @-@ 1 komand√∂r a day before the event in an e @-@ mail , the Deputy officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
the message indicated that the helicopter arrives in the southern horror on 17 July morning at 7 : 15 : 00 , and remains there until the same evening between 18 and 21 .
it was added that if the departure of the White House were to be present , a second @-@ hearted flight is needed due to the restrictions on working time .
the original air crew was at the helicopter during the event , and the security team of the escillary was close to the aircraft near the ground throughout the time of its stay .
it was not possible to read out from the documents given to the letter of time whether or not the second ethos were eventually needed .
the Hatch law prohibits federal workers from using the government &apos;s assets for political purposes .
the documents show that HMX @-@ 1 examined whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked whether it is in breach of Hatch &apos;s law , and we were told that it was not , &apos; wrote a commander .
&apos;It seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to the Deputy Prime Minister .
the White House declared the &apos; made in America &apos; event , and the Hatch law would not have covered it .
however , even official events have political undertones .
the President supported the efforts of health reform in the Senate at the time in the Senate and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in danger .
the use of an aircraft known as &apos; Marine One or Air Force &apos; for political gain is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use these purely photographs is unusual .
in February , the Trump came to the attention of his first campaign event in Floridas Melbourne , the President &apos;s plane , and he is sliding from Twitter &apos;s account messages complaining about how his predecessor &apos;s President &apos;s flight was used .
&quot; the White House is very pleased with the &apos; made in America &apos; , where products were represented in all 50 states made by American workers , &quot; said Lindsay Walters , the spokesman of the White House .
HMX @-@ 1 teams often carry out tests around Washington and the southern horror in order to get down to the white house of the President of the United States with a centimetres .
when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , the HMX @-@ 1 White House held 58 samples .
according to the official , the flight was considered to be the norm for the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; flight crew at the time of a month .
the Eskaadr helicopter flying 11 hours for &apos; non @-@ subsidy missions &apos; , in addition to that day .
according to the White House , none of the other forms of this event were burdened by the taxpayers &apos; wallets .
according to the representative of Sikorsky , the company was not involved in carrying out a helicopter in the southern horror .
HMX @-@ 1 does not maintain the budgetary documents of the President &apos;s flights and it is difficult to clarify the precise costs of the event .
however , at the time of the defence Ministry for the financial year 2017 , the VH @-@ 3D compensation rate is set at USD 24 380 per hour .
the Eskaadr &apos;s documents indicated the length of the flight from Quantico airport to Virginia for 30 minutes .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using helicopter is well below the amount .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading , &quot; said Walters .
&quot; these estimated compensation rates include staff , care and many other irreversible costs , which will be taken into account in the annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 @-@ rand study , the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation rates for staff costs , but they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former press officer of the White House Sean Spicer defended the use of helicopter at the time .
&quot; the point is to show the things made in America this week , &quot; said Spicer .
&quot; and I know that the State of Sikorsky and Connecticuti is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds , if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the Trump was a helicopter in the south of the horror in the event , or not , but he was hiding behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
in the White House , Trump Sikorsky addressed representatives by representatives of the media outlets on the company &apos;s products in his personal aircraft fleet .
&quot; I know Sikorsk√° very well , &quot; said President , &quot; I have three products . &quot;
Gari ≈†adeiko - Tastears arrived in peace and joy
the 2011 MMil Daetis hit ≈†adeikot in the last area , 800 m beverages and was taken away from the stadium .
shortly before that , he had received a zero @-@ sum leap from the University of China .
the Helsinki Helsinki formula in 2012 was an asset for cheap injury , but in London , it received 60 13 points 23 .
however , I have continued to do so .
after 2013 , Moscow &apos;s MMil became a driving force in Estonia &apos;s timetable for a long @-@ term parental injury .
two years later , he became the 15th seat of Beijing and met the Olympic Games , but this was more than a disappointment to the athletes .
the Raskedalipu was only passed by the ≈†adeiko , when the outcome of the Amsterdam Embassy was not received a letter at the beginning .
I would just like to put together one proper multi @-@ contest once .
one time , sprayed ≈†adeiko .
worse still lies ahead : a month later , his Olympic contest in Rios reievigastery was already in the first hurdle .
the time had to be taken down - is there any continuation of the seven competition ?
is the two @-@ day effort still worth all of this ?
Neiu thought a long time , but found peace .
I had to think about it .
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time for us to treat ourselves all and think about it .
&quot; I knew that I am not going to put a cool on the picture , &quot; Sadeiko is talking about his self @-@ cleansing .
I was able to turn a clean page and go ahead with the new momentum .
Treener Anne hill said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of negligence , but he realised that , above all , the sportsman himself has to get to the bottom .
after all , he was so repressed by all .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; however , he said that he does not give up and he wants to prove what he is worth , says remember .
now there is some kind of peace .
he will do so to his joy .
the contest came back in May , when the ≈†adeiko set 6280 points for a new Estonian record in G√∂tzitself .
in a high @-@ level competition , he improved his personal excellence in the heat of nearly a metre ( 13.89 ) , and drink a record of a barrier .
then there was a feeling of multiple competition that it was not at all a ceiling , but it was only the first hunger to be defeated .
he has been instructed for years by a word that ≈†adeiko is a Muslim student .
he is ready to be sportsman , he is a good training .
if something is wrong or wrong , he says it immediately .
he feels his own body and trusts his sense .
that is what we need to do .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we follow it .
the new approach has also been found in ≈†adeiko .
&quot; I am not the one who makes the most of the trend , he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right sense , because it also guarantees a good result .
baby walks will be happy to do so .
the good emotion has also been offered to the Sadeikou .
both his former friend , Maris hill and Grete , recently became grandparents and has received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;It has been quite interesting &apos; , says ≈†adeiko .
one alcohol whose drinking is tantamount to &apos; training &apos; .
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is a father of such a great wine game that he believes - wine can be trained better than any other thing in the world .
Sheperd is a neuroscientist University of Yale .
his message is not about alcohol or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
when it comes to the Council , when it comes to wine , when it comes to the complexity of the wine , we are putting our brain into work in order to create a taste for wine .
according to the Sheperdi , there is no real taste in the error , but a taste in the way in which wine is stimulated .
he will bring about a comparison of how the brain &apos; sees &apos; colour &apos; .
&apos;The taste is not wine , the taste creates wine and &apos; says Sheperd .
things that are still affecting the taste of wine are , for example , our vanity , gender and even the amount of coal that man produces .
Sheperd , of course , is that wine is not full of Jews .
&quot; there must be more &apos; , he says .
if you are too big a longest , the system is overcrowded .
excessive wine drinking can harm the brain instead of profit - according to the 2004 survey , people who drink more than three glass wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity .
10 % of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay for colleagues
the figures reveal that 10 % of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia receive lower salaries from their colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , the portal Geenius writes .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay study .
a total of 8 577 posts were examined .
63 % of posts were employed by men .
&quot; although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies , the reality is that there is no pay gap , compared to the average salary of men per month is 10 % higher than that of women and men per year on average 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said Foncrates analysts Ilmar North .
the clip of the &quot; Narcocose &quot; 3 season : now that Pablo Escobar has gone , Netflix hittsark is at the centre of Cali cartel .
despite the fact that &apos; Narcose &apos; in the second season revealed the killer of Pablo Escobari , the Netflix sari is far from over .
the third and fourth season has been confirmed by the quota , and the first one has already been produced by the advertising clip , which hails the sardines with the new pathos .
in the third season , DEA will pay its attention to the richest drug business organisation in the world - Cali cartels .
they are acting under the leadership of four powerful crushes , such as Ford 500 companies , simply with more bribery to the government and more violent actions .
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) , is leading links with Mexico and Chepe Santates London ( Pepe Rapazote ) in New York .
the advertised advertising clip sees Pedro Pascali &apos;s return to Javier Penana as a person recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement assistance in the war against drugs .
other new players include Matias Varela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .
the third season of the &apos; Narcose &apos; will be open on 1 September .
according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
the head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
the leader of the United Nations Assistance Mission , Nicholas Haysom , said that hundreds of women are standing in local Soviet elections , three women are standing as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; by underlining the importance of women &apos;s role , it is not possible to exaggerated , &quot; he said in his statement on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coincides with the transitional period , when the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is given calmly to one democratically elected government over the next .
according to Mr Haysom , women &apos;s strong role in Afghanistan will increase the success of democracy .
according to the Afghan independent electoral Commission , 1.2 million women have registered 3.6 million registered voters .
the joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both in large and small .
there is always too little common time , but the trend is a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
and what a convenient solution - wherever you were in the summer , live animals are always accompanied by the summer , and you will be impatiently reminded of your fine voice : &apos; we are now going to be a treny ! &apos;
Arata insulation - It is a very good thing to have a normal game of gold or to bypass the flag of the coastline .
one is the foundation of permanent footwear and tuna - who would then like to take the form of sand sand sleeping over the summer ?
it is nice to use children instead of chicken .
firstly , it is secure and convenient , and the race is gradually growing at the same pace as the training and force .
it is also possible to do the villages with quite large children .
the child teaches a balance , counts the corps and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
bigger children can do their own villages at the same time .
the scale of the movement is determined by the land shortage and you are pulling up .
keeping the fingers straight , the ball minimised properly .
the child can read the flats and feel as a job .
the planet is a huge , but hopeless exercise for the child .
however , it is easy to make things easier .
in the game @-@ plank : take a long plank to the colonies of which to get through .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much easier to do if , in the meantime , a friend can be given a hand .
to add the burden , we can keep the plants , the small market , and we can also walk around it .
in addition , the pumps of a child can be planted , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
at the same time as the crabs are joining the sand , the triumph , ash and air meat burden , such as the infection .
a child walks on their feet so that his body is distributed equally in advance and behind .
security can be kept in the hands of the market .
all walking and walking up straight away .
I will be able to fly , to fly , to strike a balance and to be difficult .
the life of a small engineer is an exhortation if he gets a small number of things in every fire .
the extra burden will be put on the feet of shoes .
check that the label remains in a neutral position .
children themselves have a lot of fun to do a boat and a plate .
the work and the wedding fuel .
follow the child &apos;s safety , the name of the fields , and the hotel in a neutral position .
all children &apos;s favourite and big fun !
at the same time , the whole body trend is truly effective for the elderly .
the means of sport were Ott ( 10 ) , S√§de ( 8 ) , happiness ( 4 ) .
a journey from the Philippines to the heart of the mopeds of a wide range of worlds in the Philippines .
plastic bags are the summer class , which has become a product in itself in recent years , which , in one of the right summer , has to hang the hand , and which , despite its modest origin , traders have been able to extract a price label in the same way .
it is probably one of the things that has existed in the life of the law and which has not been aroused by any particular emotion .
it is simply there , and if there is no , there is no overlap .
however , there is now a real victory for beer bags , and moefers have switched their mushrooms against simple beer bags by summer months .
it is not only a coastline , but today it is just as popular as a street , and more courageous women even walk into office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear whether this summer &apos;s summer is still sitting or whether it is worth postponing the label and laptops a little more official .
however , the wealth of tolerance has made a real summer love for women .
for example , when we read foreign moeblogists , the first thing is that the moeyoghurts are the first thing to do with the local market and acquire some beer bags , which are then the truck of a whole holiday period , and which is accompanied by a beach , on the market and also as a friend in the city .
some bloggers are even so generous that they are buying from the market a bigger wolf and selling them or giving them to their loyal readers .
in doing so , it is worth noting that there is a demand among readers for women in the real world ( and men ! ) , apparently , to be involved in each other &apos;s fishing zone in order to become a happy owner of some homes .
in some ways , this madness is also understandable , because it is rare for them to be able to buy some of the things that have gone into the mouths of yesterday , just for a few decades .
it is true that white merchants have also discovered a simple way of earning money here , and so more luxury brands are sold for a few hundred and a thousand euros .
obviously , that the richer customers should not feel easy to die , who are proclaiming around with some cheap bags .
for example , it is possible to buy Dolce &amp; Gabbana over EUR 1 000 in hand .
however , for the interpretation of Chanel &apos;s interpretation , EUR 6 000 can be found in the circulation .
in contrast to most of the motives , however , the brewers do not come from some of the big mosques , but their story began in a more distant way .
Admittedly , the beer bags come from far from the Philippines , where they have been subjected to a wide range .
it is very often the case that there is a lot of red tape , in particular , for export companies , and there is very often no way in which they are going around .
it is claimed that the 14 centuries of oil technique originated and is quite a series of normal corps .
however , as the beer does not need to be as much red as corps , they will be accompanied by musicians and other materials that are more personalised and , by extension , more active .
in recent times , for example , there are particularly trendy bags where the colour of red colours or skimmed boxes .
however , in particular , beer bags can be sent to the actress Jane Birkini , the largest bundled beer of whom was not seen before .
it was precisely that it sued shoulder to all sorts of clothing complex and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival .
however , the popularity of the Copts today does not play a smaller role , but also that caring for them is a hot head and , unlike any other summer , they do not have to care for them with special means , but also the water and the wet .
as in the case of the trend robbery , the brands have come out of all sorts of interpretations , apart from the classical appearance .
for example , if you want to have a red rice , you can buy a red @-@ shirt or a little bit of a boom .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classical beer is never going to be a mob , but a beer .
but what is the classical beer ?
for centuries , there has been a classic copy of the beer , which resembles a repetition of its style , is open , and it is short , as well as beer , crippers .

GMB concerns about investment in McVitie &apos;s Glasgow plant
the trade union expects the leaders of the mature producer and McVitie to confirm the long @-@ term production plans in the Glasgow plant .
according to GMB Scotland , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment .
more than 500 people are employed in Hobnobsi and rich know @-@ how and other products .
McVitie &apos;s owner Pladis said that they have invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years .
the workers and the trade union chairs are the first to hear &apos; when something changes in the operation of the plant .
in a letter sent to the head of the company , GMB Scotland asked McVitie to &apos; allay concerns about the lack of funding to modernise production lines &apos; .
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the site on the business needs and the future investment plan for the future , makes our members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and the people around Glasgow , as an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region where there is high unemployment and social housing .
therefore , in terms of jobs , wages and welfare in the east of Glasgow , and in the context of Brexti , the rise in living costs and the chronic damage to production , the McVitie company , which is growing in a very strong way , is badly needed . &quot;
the Pladise representative said : &apos; the head of the Customs Council received a letter from GMB Scotch only yesterday and the company responds directly to him because we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers and the representatives of the GMB , which discussed a number of issues openly .
we then discussed with workers that , like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are looking at our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million in customs equipment , most of it has gone into production routes and improvements .
we fully understand the heritage of customs as a source of production , and if there should be any changes in the activities of the object , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach to Neyra ?
a la may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .
the Paris Saint @-@ Germain does not give up in the attempt to attract Mr Neymar to his ranks by making an offer of GBP 189 million , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquest ?
this bold approach has opened the summer as a transitional window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world record of buying , which was set at the last season by Paul Pogba &apos;s return to Manchester Uniteba for GBP 89 million .
if the transition is completed , Neyra will become the most expensive player in the world and , at the same time , the highest paid professional athletes in the world , who will be able to pay over GBP 500 000 a week after the payment from the PSG .
Barcelona is also an indication of the way in which there is a rapprochement , as well as of the liberation of Neyra , although the source close to the Bureau of Catalansi confirms that the club has always taken the best care for football since its arrival in Santoise in 2013 .
but did the PSG President warn the football world for such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manchester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blaise Matuga Agreement in 2014 , the Nasser Al @-@ Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who think about recruiting some of the PSG &apos;s best players .
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that if they concern some of our players , we will be against them and we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ Khelaif .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have taken over this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the PSG central player , Marco Verratti .
the PSG made it clear that they would not be allowed to leave and that Barcelona could be a setback as a result of this interest , removing one of its expensive assets in the form of Neyra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Brexitit .
&quot; Brexit is seriously threatened by the wool between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Varadkar during his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the free movement of people and goods , said Varadkar .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , he stressed .
he said that he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union , and because it fails to do so , he will remain part of the European single market .
this would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
the second option to make Britain &apos;s departure smoother would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , said Varadkar : &apos; surely we could have such a British &apos; .
the alternative to this would be to return to customs points , which would be a historic division and a political failure .
&quot; bring about trade , prosperity and peace , &quot; said the Irish Prime Minister .
he called Brexitit &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that the result could affect every aspect of the daily lives of Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast .
