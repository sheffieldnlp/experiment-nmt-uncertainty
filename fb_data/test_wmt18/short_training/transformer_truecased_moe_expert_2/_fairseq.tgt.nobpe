four members of the Cape Verde Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to Mr Posselt , in Spain , the so @-@ called Chairman of the group of Cape Verde , Slava Gulevitch , who is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski , was detained by the police .
Gulevitvich , held in Spain , was arrested by a court .
yesterday , the Court also held three arrest warrants in Estonia .
it is suspected that these are members of the so @-@ called Communist Association aged between 27 and 57 , who commit mainly drug @-@ related crimes .
the alleged head of the criminal organisation of the Mala province of Spain , Mijav , was detained .
three men were arrested as a suspect in Estonia , one of which is collected according to criminal organisation and two are members of the criminal organisation .
the data collected indicates a clear division of roles and roles in the criminal community .
the criminal community was committed to tackling drug crime and thereby generating criminal proceeds , &quot; commented DG IOM , Prefector Vahur Verte .
&quot; we will not rule out an increase in the circle of suspects in this criminal case , &quot; added the Public Prosecutor .
these are people who have been interested in law enforcement in the past , and some have been punished for drug crime .
she stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high on the agenda throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of the cooperation , &quot;
the head of the inter @-@ criminal police service , ago Leis , said that nearly one and a half years of preliminary investigation had preceded the detentions .
&quot; in the first half of the week , we had a long time in life and we had the same conviction for crimes in Estonia and Spain . &quot;
in the Leis , central criminal police officers were helped in detention in Spain .
we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civil guard force for years .
these detentions are yet another message to the perpetrators that we can get them from the other side of Europe . &quot;
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that those suspected of being present can continue to commit new crimes , and the prosecution office requested their arrest and approved by the court .
a man arrested in Spain is waiting for his transfer to Estonia .
in this case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation .
the preliminary proceedings of the Criminal Court are conducted by organised crime officers of central criminal justice authorities and are led by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
in 2005 Slava Gulevitch was charged with blackmail and sentenced to 5 years in imprisonment by the City Court of Tallinn .
in the midst of the previous decade , the Allevitv was thought to be the second man in the world after the then Manerior Tarankov .
Gulevitch from Cape Verde has highlighted Estonian co @-@ stimuli in the early 1990s when he started to tackle blackmail in Tallinn .
he allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at different hotels and ordered monthly roofs on businessmen .
international joint operations , confiscation of proceeds of crime and the entry into force of court decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for instance , the latest court rulings , the eight indictees of the so @-@ called Dikactivist criminal association , who were confiscated on criminal proceeds , or the sentence against nine individuals in 2006 , were created by Igor Aleynikov , a criminal organisation aimed at illegal trade in counterfeit cigarettes and committing crimes against human trafficking in East Virumaa and southern Estonia .
it has a value of nearly € 71 500 in criminal income .
in these criminal cases , the evidence and evidence are being communicated daily by police officers with foreign colleagues and , if necessary , acts together in any European Union country .
civil Rights group warns against Missouristic travel
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) has warned the people of Missourisal air conditioning against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state .
the group statement states : &apos; an NAACP travel margin issued for the State of Missouri valid until 28 August 2017 calls on all aAmerican travellers , visitors and southeast to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the state , given the range of suspicious race @-@ related events which have been carried out in recent times and also made out by the State &apos; .
NAACP said that it was encouraged to issue a travel warning both the recent Missourn law , which makes it more difficult to obtain cases of discrimination , and the fact that minorities are disproportionately targeted by the state &apos;s law enforcement .
&quot; people &apos;s rights are violated .
they are hunted on the back of their skin colour , beaten or killed , &quot; said Rod Chapel , President of NAACP Missour , for The Kansas City Star .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints . &quot;
it is the first warning issued by an organisation of a US state .
the group referred to events such as racial insults against black students in Missouri University and the death of Sanders , the 28 @-@ year old black boy from Tennessee .
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances at the beginning of this year after having been locked up in lizing through the state and seized into custody by the Missour police without being charged with the crime .
in addition , a recent report drafted by the Chief Prosecutor of Missour indicates that the cars of black drivers are likely to be halted in the state by 75 % more likely than priests .
&quot; the comment is intended to make people aware and to warn their families , friends and collaborators about what could happen in Missour , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it means taking money away from the top of the day or informing their relatives about the state . &quot;
according to the latest information from the programme for information on hate crime in FBI , 100 hate crime cases were recorded in Missoura in 2015 , placing the state in a cross @-@ section 16th place in the state in terms of similar offences .
travel warning is also a response to the new Missour law , making it difficult to refer the company to court for reasons of discrimination in the search for housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( LAEC ) , which had previously issued travel concerns for Texas and Arizona following the adoption by these states of immigration laws obliging local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences , as ACLU says it will increase racial profiling .
the external Ministry usually issues out against other countries , but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain US @-@ related laws and trends .
Hepatitis : what about the different forms of this difficult disease could anyone know ?
Hepatitis , or liver , may be caused by a combination of five different diseases : A , B , C , D and E hepatitis .
all these viruses are a sharp burner of liver .
however , the cost of bad is chronic hepatitis B and C , which can develop into a cirrhop , the quacrimonium and the cost of the liver .
the heinous hepatitis disease phenomenon is the same for all types of liver - pound , tidal , timorous , oilseed , soul , soul , rally , sands , horse , grey emissions , dark horse mackerel , meat and limousness , and meat and mass mass strawoods .
the last disease is also the folk name of yellow disease .
they can undergo hepatitis without any disease .
different species of the mainary can only be identified on the basis of laboratory study data .
Besiver hepatitis can pass on to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without disease , meaning that people may not know about their harmful liver disease .
the audio Kutsar highlights different forms of hepatitis and details their conduct .
one hepatitis viruses spread from a sick to a human being and infections us in the feeding of contaminated food or drinking water , sex , beach and beacon to humans , food , soil , objects , sugar , and drug consumption .
a hepatitis was the family and carers of the disease , people suffering from chronic liver diseases , sex offenders with infected people , sex men with men , drug addicts , hepatitis high , travellers visiting countries .
vaccination can be prevented , in particular , by recommending vaccination for people travelling to a large number of people at risk of hepatitis A .
in addition , it is important to meet the hygiene requirements on a daily basis : to wash or disinfect hands before using food to wash all fruit and vegetables .
the hepatitis virus is spreading to patients when they are exposed to the blood , when they are exposed to drugs , in pregnancy , in pregnancy , in pregnancy , in pregnancy , in pregnancy , in pregnancy , in adulterated pregnancy , in adulterated conditions , in adulteration with hepatitis and in chpatitis sufferer foerer / dishes .
the hepatitis disease risk @-@ prone drug addicts , sex partners of infected people , sex men with men sex sex sex with honey , new born babies of infected mother , hospital family members and carers , health care , personnel and police officers , and travellers visiting high @-@ mortem @-@ mortem countries with a blood and other body fluids .
in addition to the chronic disease , HIV infections , sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes are recommended , it is particularly recommended to vaccinate people at risk and to vaccinate persons with a high level .
other preventive measures include avoiding the use of alien and manyplyte tools , other sharp tools and systalgic @-@ chrosis , abytation and honour donation , and use of condom in dangerous mixtures or the prevention of sexual risk @-@ taking .
vaccination against patitis b is part of the National immunisation Scheme and free of charge for children in Estonia .
Hepatitis C mixtures are spreading to patients when they face the blood of their illness , to inject drugs , to fine harvesting , to hire hourly dishes , to use blood @-@ contaminated dirings , to sex with hepatitis , and to breadter foetal foetal / infantiquity .
the hepatitis heinage group includes instinstone drug addicts , sex partners of infected people , sex men with men sex sex sex with honey , new HIV syndicates , sick family members and carers , health care , workers and rescuers , HIV infections and high @-@ health health @-@ borne travellers and travellers visiting countries with hepatitis C high diseases .
hepatitis C preventive measure is : refrain from using non @-@ exotic hygiene and manicyl tools , other sharp tools and systalgic @-@ chrosis , abyard care and honour donation , and use of condom in dangerous mixtures of infection .
there is no vaccine against hepatitis C .
Hepatitis D is causing hepatitis , which is acutely contained in the presence of hepatitis B .
as a result , there are hepatitis D , with hepatitis B or hepatitis B as superinflated .
hepatitis viruses are spreading in exposure to blood and other body fluids , contaminated with systalgic ventures , sexually and rarely infected animals .
Hepatitis at risk is chronic hepatitis B and non @-@ immune from hepatitis B .
vaccination with hepatitis B is an effective preventive action which also protects humans from hepatitis D virus infection .
the e @-@ patitis virus is spreading feeds on drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , donation with collective heart and infected animals .
travellers can be infected with hepatitis E in high health @-@ condition countries .
the measures to prevent hepatitis are hygiene requirements : washing or disinfecting hands after coping in a rod , before eating and cooking , after care for a patient .
Fruits and vegetables are laundered before consumption , not to eat little heat , fish or seafood , to keep safe drinking water and to avoid drug consumption .
although the last round was launched by competitors to throw out four Olympic winners , Farah , 34 years old , found power in the final row and won 26.49.51 .
the Farah did not think long , taking the lion to the lion &apos;s seat , Tania and children , after the finival .
it was a particular moment for me .
I am very much impressed by my family .
they were wonderful &quot; said to the press .
Farah is targeting the golden heading of the 5 000 @-@ 10 000 @-@ metre street in London .
everything is possible if it is believed .
despite the title , Mrs O &apos;Connori &apos;s &apos; Daam gold &apos; , the Gustav Klimt &apos;s masterpiece of the portal , the book of Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer , is triggering a splendid story of a work of art , far deeper from the birth of a Catholic works to the 20th century and the early 20th century in Vienna .
but in more depth , history .
a lethal information on the car would have the effect of cutting the clothes , and a more limited topic could be taken from the book book book allowed in the title to more influence the extraordinary story .
currently , two books , like the one in the boardroom : Gustav Klimt and his painting in Daam gold , are the case of Adele Bloch @-@ Baueri , and a much larger and more comprehensive newspaper accountant from the distinguished Jewish families and the German occupation with its follow @-@ up effects in Austria .
the first third of the book is in the middle of a wedding Vienna cultural life and who himself invaded the Austrian capital , can hardly imagine how , over a hundred years ago , he went around life around Russtrass or the Centrali cake , all the heads turned when he came into the customer .
the concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities of Europe and seemed to have seemed more culturally famous for the name that we know in the book .
yet , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where the pile of intreatment and the highest levels of suicides in Europe is as if nothing was done to develop .
or perhaps , each individual walking of a fair portfolio adds colour to the cultural life in Vienna at the start of the 20th century .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century Jews had exploded in Vienna , making themselves the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
almost one in ten was a Jewish .
visitors were also newcomers in Vienna , but by the time the helpless for Adele was twice as opening the door to the Czech sugar magnadi Ferdinand Bloh and Klimt for his famous painting , his bank had already become the seventh largest bank in Habsburg &apos;s Empire .
but the whole life of the gladier , where he was famous , was not taken in .
if you look at &apos; Daami gold &apos; , you cannot believe that it was the great Socialism that has been infected towards the end of life and dreamt of travelling to the Soviet Union .
in 1903 , when Ferdinja Bloch decided to order his wife &apos;s athlete from Klimtis , the last moment &apos;s commander in Vienna was a pageant driver .
the climt ordered a price of 4 000 kroons at the time , a quarter of the good location .
the fact that a few marbles were suspected of a moped by a master &apos;s mouse was not discouraged by sugar magnate .
as far as the brain is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship that has been established in the course of the work with the artist continued to life .
Anne @-@ Marie O Connor - Daam gold
Gemt Klimt , a special story for Adele Bloch @-@ Baueri , &quot; Varrak 2016 , Aldo Randmaa translated from English .
just before the start of the work with Adeleta , the Klimt had been in San Vitale , and the researchers believe that it was there that the artificial initiative of the emisblibant egna Theodora was to make a golden Port of Adelen as a mosaic .
the customer was presented in Dam gold in Vienna in 1908 and at around the same time ( 1907 @-@ 1908 ) was born in another golden land called &quot; Svellus . &quot;
the similarity of two women was not detected by artists .
what is Hitler &apos;s story ?
&quot; I think I owe him to make his hand to the public , to remember my friend Klimt , &quot; wrote to him Bloch @-@ Bauer a few years after she left the artist ( Klimt died in February 1918 ) to the Director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted to see their family Klimhus go to Museum .
six years before the death , a PhD was a peer @-@ to @-@ peer basis .
she also requested that her spouse retain two sports courses and four Gustav Klimtis to Austrian Galmen in February 1925 .
she wrote to Mariale and Luis .
one year after the customer had finished &quot; Austrian Mona lisa &quot; the attempt to access the 18ine arts in Akademine had been made by Adolf Hitler , 17 years old , but failed by the drawing period .
although Hitler &apos;s late anti @-@ Semitism is sometimes considered to be the result of not receiving her into the Academy by Jewish professors , not a single person really was a hair of his excuses .
in any case , the Austrian Galerier mission , referred to in Maria testament , had changed considerably in 1939 , had become a major factor in finding decent work from Vienna &apos;s rich Jewish arts .
some of the work of the Hitler &apos;s personal artistic wealth was also bred at home by some of the work of the people of the Klimt .
Sixty years after the murder of the Nazis , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old legal dispute between the Austrian Government and the heirs of Bloch @-@ Baudis began .
I should point out at this point that if the &apos; Snovelanism &apos; sees Belvedere in Vienna , the Daami gold , described by Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer , must be looked at New York &apos;s Neue Galerii .
and I will read the aforementioned book before Vienna .
even if you do not plan to look at the Klimt &apos;s work , my emotion , at least , after the closure of the book , was more feminicides and hair than the bucket and modell of the town sold for USD 135 million , Bloch @-@ Bauer .
so not so much a portfolio , but a very moving story of a marriage - a tricky story .
the association of the former Bauators &apos; relatives was considerably facilitated by events .
17 @-@ year @-@ old swimmer in Canada very close to Estonia &apos;s record
in the settlements , gold was in the depths of 2.16.62 in the personal tree of 200 m pork .
the label comes from a 17 @-@ year @-@ old pipe celebration of the moment the Canadian Jutan Champions were awarded 16.58 , the Priit Aaviku Loguing block .
gold ended , the final of the decade A .
he went through a distance from 2.68 in the Fair and achieved a strong 7th prize with a new top @-@ level mark .
Alina Kendzioris ( 2.15.13 ) left Golden in a little more than half a second .
in Estonia &apos;s ranking of all history gold increased by 3 , with a fresh personal top mark accounting for all its achievements in Estonia .
the young hope for the future is to start a further 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in balling in Canada , and 200 mand 400 more covert chat .
last week in the Canadian Championship championships in Toronto , gold rolled out there too .
he won 200 m in pipe oil with a silver medal of 2.3.22 .
this was swamped as a venue by the last quarter of 2008 .
the Golden site has been graduated by the record Estonian Elina Parhalt in Estonia .
in Canada , a leader still won 100 m @-@ slum chunk chore with excellent personal records and 56.66 new Estonian season marches .
for example , Kertu ly Alnek , an elderly year , has distanced it only one century more quickly .
he reached the top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art clip in the opening of the theatre at the end of the barbarbarbarbarbarbargain at 100 metres .
he only gained a seat from the 7th distance when he stunned in the final score 2.17.31 .
the Estonian keynote ranking is currently running at four distinct distances .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics cheer
it is time for the holidays - it is also a slap in the way of the US President Donald Trumpin .
however , as the President has now removed one of the most holidays , the critics are already hammer the scales .
on the US benches and CNN notifications , the President &apos;s plan foresees 17 days &apos; leave in Bedminster , which is based in New Jersey .
although the President began yesterday , he has spoken for weeks on the Anti @-@ Trup issue .
they are throwing too much light on the Bush .
the President is right to spend his time in the Florida , Virginia and New Jersey cotton .
by the way , Mr Trump has not been the President who has pumped the most during his 196 term .
for example , on a holiday of that day , George W. Bush had already reached 67 days , Barack Obama half as much as Trump , but 21 days .
but the Tirk tends to be a quick @-@ to @-@ fail .
the days before becoming President , in Trump , he received a &apos; 60 minutes &apos; saying that he would not be in time for long @-@ term holidays because a great deal needs to be done .
he also outraged Barack Obama &apos;s leave three years ago .
the current President wrote on Twitter at the time : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , golf is playing , the brakes and Judaamic groups are running on journalists &apos; head .
a 17 @-@ day golf visit to polled is not a kind of abstrand on the basis of a white @-@ house official .
it is officially called working holidays , during which the Tirker has no time to read or any other adventure .
in addition , there had to be another reason for working holidays .
the Western housing balance system is being replaced by a special system for the White House , which required the whole staff to leave .
Ovaalkkakar and other President offices also appear in the West Bank .
&quot; I do not think anybody would like to be in the West in August if you have 38 degrees and no balance pensions , &quot; said Lindsay Walters , the speaker of the White House , who stressed that the President would continue to work during the holiday .
you will get a slot from the video in the follow @-@ up of President Trump for 17 days .
&apos;Yes &apos; to a Facebook wall of critics , don &apos;t stand for a post of state office unless you tolerate criticism from the voters
our father was so ignorant of negative media reports .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it took no time for the newspapers to start bullying him for everything from internal politics to his political principles .
the criticism has , of course , upset him .
but he did not hesitate to keep up his criticism .
because in 1783 Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression could be taken from us and that , in a more virulent and silent way , we could be led by sheep . &apos;
this brings me to Mrs Hogan , Governor of Maryland , who has to struggle to be more like Washington .
the deputies of at least 450 people who expressed their views on the official Facebook page have been blocked and erated by Hogan .
and the American Civil Liberties Union ( ECU ) therefore took legal action .
the Siberian officers were washing the action into an empty and web comments in the style of &apos; who cares ? &apos; .
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; many said .
it counts .
and it is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan .
it is an astonishing popular Governor of the democratic state .
his discharge rate is the second highest in the country &apos;s 50 Governor .
Hogan is not a reactive .
it has firmly drawn the state and strictly determined its principles .
she has also used Facebook quite wisely as the main instrument in her contacts with constituents , for example , by presenting her rock head after chemovers for the first time .
thus , the writer &apos;s board Mercedes is a public forum with a formal label , managed by a staff working from taxpayers &apos; dollars &apos; dollars , who are stranded and ultimately unsafe .
in an interview with Kadgan , the Turkgani press representative , Amelia Chasse , defended The Washington Posselt , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation .
but it is too easy to paint a picture of online screening , spammers or people with anger online .
the post was held by a number of people who were blocked by Hogan .
that is what they are , quite deliberately , people who communicate with their elected leaders , the executor , owner of the business and the pastor , not online controls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , well thought @-@ out and not rosy .
the Pastor quoted milk in his mail , oppressing the Catholic traffic of Hogan .
Lakshm Sarma Raman , a lawyer from Maryland in Bowie , not encouraged hatred but rather hate crime .
&quot; I have been politely advised not to respond to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; I am afraid I was disappointed that he wrote a comment in the heading of The mail news story .
I also dislike the idea that , if many people comment on the same topic , some will suddenly be indifferent to collective effort instead of acknowledging that it is a great deal of concern for citizens . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s officer called &apos; targeted junk fire attack &apos; would probably be &apos; open &apos; .
the Facebook era allows easy matching of messages by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments .
it is much cleaner than in the past , when it was necessary to send out staff to get the newspaper papers with critical editorial lists together , burning them or arresting protestors and silencing them .
but that is exactly what is happening , just digital .
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media a tooth .
President Trup has been sued by users of Twitter who are blocked from the stream of Twitter .
one of the first sentences of formal value on this was in Virginia last week .
in Alexandria , a US District Judge James C. Cacheris decided that the Board of supervisors of the Loudounn Region had the first amendment to the Constitution , when he blocked the constituent on Facebook page .
in Ktucky , the Governor Matt Bevint ( R ) also visited the Governor , following the use of the ACLU Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
in Washington , the cost of affordable postal services had a similar impact to the internet .
the number of newspapers and anonymous writers interviewed him in a driving manner between 1776 and 1800 multiplied the number of newspapers .
even then , Washington had to face anonymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers from pseudo @-@ Orricola , Valerius , Belisariu and Portius , taking Washington decisions on a land @-@ grabbing track .
he buried the office in the following historical documents in the framework of George Washington &apos;s project for collecting signatures , he used to degenerate his views on friendship , trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain .
but he did not keep them silent .
freedom of expression , dissent and debate are the foundation stones of our country .
and proper management means accepting it .
Ronan Rafferty hopes comfort of the home territory in Renaissance Cluba

the Northern Ireland , which was in the last round of Archerfield Linksi in the neighbourhood last year , before the dismissal of Paul Ealpit , has been absorbed into a new place of operation and has played a market Envoy role as the venue for hosting and managing officer of the club , Jerry Sarvadi , instead of the Sarvadi .
&quot; I saw Renaissance Clubi built , and now we can see the club shining in full smack with the event , &quot; Rafferty .

&quot; I could not defend the title of Extremadura Overs , because it was shot from my match in one year &apos;s time .
it is mathematical to come back to this .
it is a great place to play golf .

&quot; nobody will dare to go around at five o &apos;clock in a happy morning . &quot;
it is a former Dutch colony , which was added to Indonesia in 1969 , after a referendum that had put only 1026 elderly people into the book , bringing it to vote , under the very eyes of the forces .
the move from the Dutch suppressant power is encouraging its racing against the Jakarta government , which is still holding the region under strong control , away from foreign journalists and human rights monitors .
in 2003 , the province of Paapud and the Western Pope were officially distributed , so that the eastern island remained independent in Papua New Guinea .

&quot; before we had only a plant on a body . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province , with 28 % of people living below the poverty line and the infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are among the worst in Asia .
but it is also a gold land in Indonesia .
just 100 km from Paniato , a mountainous province with a population of New Jersey , a population of 153 000 , is the world &apos;s largest and most lucrative gold mine , Grasberg , a Freeport McMoran , in Phoenix .
Freeport in 2015 alone emitted about USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and coph from this place .
in addition , Papua can be smuggled with consumer timber stocks valued at USD 78 billion .
however , these riches are a source of suffering for paved trees , as they are a suffocating presence by the powerful army in Indonesia .
the 2005 study of the New York Times showed that Freeport paid around USD 20 million to local troops and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including around USD 150 000 per victim .
the Paaed attempts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden haste and disappears ruthlessly .
since 1969 , over 500 000 killers have been killed , and thousands more have been raped , tortured and imprisoned , according to human rights activists .
according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights , the massive crime of genocide in the 1970s was a meteoric crime in the hills of the hills of the hill , belonging to the sils .
over 3 900 peaceful protestors were arrested in the region of Indonesia last year alone .
the 2016 report on &apos; We are all &apos; of the Syrimonial science report on the Bahá &apos;i Archbishop of Burma contains testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year , such as extrajudicial executions , torture ( rape and electricity punishment is particularly common according to another report ) and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to read the figure because there are events of this kind every week , &quot; says Andreas Harsono , journalist , the journalist of Human Rights Watch .
the concessions are even more strongly shut down , as the natural assets of Papua Mountains have led to the influx of new settlements from Indonesia elsewhere .
Eighty @-@ five per cent of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demographics are changing because there are economic migrants coming from the Muslim Isles of Indonesia , Jaava , Kalimantan , Sumatra and Sulawes .

but little has changed in the Pope and local feel cheated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokow in the expectation that he would live up to our hopes of restoring justice , &quot; said You are wrong .
in fact , Paniai was barely able to take office in the lower phase after the arrival of Jokow in October only two months .
on 7 December 2014 11 children in the Morotali songs on Christmas Christmas , while two Indonesian soldiers elapsed from blind whim .
the children who met told them they should include the front lights .
after talking about the local pastor Yavedt Tebai , one of his soldiers was sentenced to their tone and subsequently returned to four troops .
in the face of the victims and faces , soldiers chook behind children and beat them with their own devices .
then one of the soldiers was shot among children .
one child , Yulianus Yeimo , aged 16 , was so cruelly beaten as to fall into the home .
a few hours later , a lovely electoral commission took the burner and things were even estuary the next day .
around 1000 young Pamen , women and children gathered to claim justice to a football pitch in front of the local police Department and military command centre .
they carried out horse riding buses and presented a pago pago in Papua mee &apos;s clothing without @-@ dance , with a drink running around and a bag of birds .
some of the protesters were shrapped by the police and by the military .
&apos;When public mass is more than three times resistance , let them down , according to a letter of formal notice &apos; , according to a letter of time , but not issued to local media exhibitors &apos; , a letter of formal notice was sent to the criminals .
Yeremias Kayame ( 56 ) , an oldest Mayor of Kego Koto , felt a threatening threat and called for the maintenance of peace by asking for the crowd to go home .
nobody wanted to hear .
&quot; I was shot at the extreme left , &apos; he said time in his private colour , on the vermin of the tree house .
Kayame still does not know who was shooting , but says soldiers came from the ranks of the month .
&quot; there was a lot of people , a lot of abject , in the dot . &quot;
Alfius Youw , a local man , was arrested three times for his shooting , says the kettle .
&quot; I would like to come back to him and inquire through her body to make sure he was with him , &apos; he said a mesh of the clock in Yohano who uses only one name , like many Portuguese .
&quot; I saw him dead ... I was novel . &quot;
the TFIR , Yotje Mende , told reporters that they only guaranteed security in their own Parish because it was attacked .
&quot; we need to protect ourselves if threats are to be sent , &quot; said Pudjo Sulistiyo , the journalist &apos;s representative of the Pakian police , in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protestors were killed and injured .
the news of the killings arrived in Jakara only the day after year .
three weeks later , Jokow Jayapura held a passionate speech , giving condolences to the victims &apos; families and allowing the Pope to deal with maltreatment .
&quot; I want to resolve this immediately so it will never happen again , &quot; he said .
in October 2016 , Wiranto , the security minister said that it would set up an extrajudicial mechanism to tackle human rights crime .
but the excuses were almost followed .
most criminal acts were carried out a long time ago .
some were in the 1990s and early in the 1980s .
it is about us being committed to tackling these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &quot; he said .
however , at the time of the conversation in Jakarta on 5 June , Wiranto took off his words saying that he had no intention of setting up a Pope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead he said &apos; everything would be settled by law &apos; .
Wiranto , who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in relation to the death of more than 1 000 people in East Timor in the bloody referendum in 1999 , said that 11 human rights crimes had already been solved in Paapua , including in Paniai .
the victims &apos; families of the Paniai received such claims with a gloomy belief .
&quot; I have been interrogated four times in the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Yohanes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still afraid years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I am afraid I am arrested by the army , I am afraid I am being shot . &quot;
he confirmed the view that the people of Panian are afraid to slander this incident .
he said he was beaten by the army after having helped to bury four victims .
&quot; after burying the bodies , I had to be looked at by the army , &quot; he says .
the celebrations have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Mayor of Paniai was shot in Deiyaca by the Indonesian police in neighbouring Concerning .
one person was killed and 17 wounded , including children , while leaving a friend between the manager of the village and construction company who refused to carry an unknown man to hospital .
this man , 224 @-@ year @-@ old Ravianus Douw , who sank into nearby rivers in the search for fish , died on the road to hospital .
the frequent village communities protested to the office of the site .
the army has read the police stoning of the village , after which the helicopters responded with the shot .
but local claims mobile British ( the Indonesian army police ) started shooting at the population , killing one person .
&quot; we were in a mood of panic , we are afraid of revenge , &quot; said the time @-@ frame of 29 Dominggu Badii , who lives close to hospital and saw the infuriating of the injured .
&quot; I have been beaten in my own house for two days . &quot;
the Deiyi Parliament has called for the responsibility of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile Brigade from the region .
the Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government .
the lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the honey , moni , dancing and daychier in Papua Bhalida .
many of them have joined the army of free Paapua ani rebels ( VPL ) , which , in its own words , protects the rights of boats by conducting atrocities and abductions amongst Indonesian soldiers .
some of the leaders of VPL come from Panii , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
in response , in recent years , under the pretext of defending the sovereignty of a state , the army has arbitrarily arrested and held thousands of people detained .
some will never emerge .
Panias is known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; among the people of Papua Islands .
poverty is a source of dissatisfaction .
the low @-@ cost rip the majority is too expensive to buy for local people .
the top is equally unachievable .
people are mainly basing themselves on food , adding some fruit and vegetables to their entire food .
farming is women &apos;s work , each managing to maintain four or five of the premises .
they usually keep most of their catches to their families , and sell the rest on the local market .
ten bars cost only 10,000 premises ( 75 cents ) .
economic inequality between incompetent pawns and new migrants , who have come across a great deal since the opening of new flight routes at Nabire airport , has deepened over time .
the few jobs that exist go to better trained and more prosperous migrants .
the Pope often lacks the capital or the skills needed to pursue a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the fridge because there is no jobs or money , &quot; John Gobai , Chairman of the Paniai tribal Council , says .
the exhibition keeps the eyes of the world away from the Pope .
in addition , tough restrictions on foreign media remain .
French journalists Franck Escudie and Basilth Longchamp were expelled from the Pope at the beginning of this year , because they were not following the relevant practices , even though they had been given a rare film authorisation .
according to Phelim Kine , Deputy head of the Asian department of Human Rights Watch , Jokow &apos;s electoral promises to remove the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development have not been implemented .
&quot; in Indonesia , journalists seeking to report on the Eastern calmer provinces and West Paputan are facing new threats to the rejection of the Sakharov visa and blacklist , &quot; said in a statement .
the lack of a glance in the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua neighbours .
in March six Pacific countries were encouraged by pirates , Nauru , Belau , Tuvalu , Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands to investigate &quot; various large @-@ scale crimes &quot; in the Paapua , including the shooting of Paniai .
the same countries have historically supported VPL .
Arrmanatha Nasir , the journalist in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed the corporation &apos;s accusations of a group , saying to the press : &apos; in Indonesia democratic regimes and freedom of the press , so that evidence of cases against human rights can be decried &apos; .
local people want more foreign governments to be taken into consideration .
when the delegation from the Netherlands , headed by its human rights Ambassador , Kees Van Baarr , visited Jayapurat on 4 May , the local people suspended the meeting , but anonymous with their silence , saying : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
new presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019 , but the paint does not believe they will vote for Jokow again .
&quot; Jokowi is a man with good intentions , but people around him who are involved in shooting Paniai say Hobai , President of the tribal Council .
he wants to make a clear signal to Jokow that , in addition to the constant threat to the predatory army , the people of Panii are suffering from misery because of poor education and health services .
according to Goita , people in Panian , like other boats , consider their vote to be the debt to Jokow , which he has to pay .
&apos;They need no money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite the threat and intimidation , the families of the Paniai fire were coping with the latest symbolic counter @-@ insurgency in pirates , in the face of the dead police stations and army bases .
knowing that justice may never be done , they will at least not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&apos;One of our family members was killed &apos; says the core of the Yacobus .
&quot; what can we do ? &quot;
Neil neills in the Katycle of Dubai Torch for the second time !
hundreds of inhabitants were fed through one of the largest residential blocks in the world in Dubai on Friday , forcing hundreds of them to escape from the 337 metres of desert and 79 morale building .
it is the second fire that has devastated the high ranking , which is , incidentally , called the Turin storm , or the Tõrvik .
no direct fire was reported and no direct fire was caused .
&quot; we sleeping and woe the fire camp and the crying people .
we were caught by school courses and we took about 10 minutes to get down to the bottom of the 50th , &quot; said one woman to Reuterna , calling himself George .
fire @-@ fighters , as the civil protection officers of Dubai said , even down at around 4 a.m. in the morning at local time ( 00.00 GMT ) and cooling the building .
the government said they were working to provide shelter to those affected .
this incident could once again raise concerns about the safety of materials used on the external surface worldwide .
a study conducted following the fires on the ground at the Torch Bureau in 2015 found that fastaics - the decoralist panels and isolation of external soil - suffered most damage .
the British police have said they believe that the isolation of Grenfell Tower in London and the fasteners could have contributed to the fire chaos there in June , killing almost 80 people .
see : sales buttons are likely to be available in the autumn
Key and autumn are a time @-@ spiralling for technical theatres , as telephone companies then unveil their new models of excellence .
the sales of Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia Premium in spring have been expected to be expected to be new hitt @-@ phones to boys in the autumn .
according to Sir Christian Seema , telecoms marketing and sales Director , street ships are characterised by innovative design design , eye display display , serse @-@ servani &apos;s 4K resolution screen and ultra @-@ fast delivery .
Samsung Galaxy S8 , a world of high @-@ profile technology , has also received the top @-@ end sales ranking from Estonia .
in autumn , more advanced radiation , more resilient batteries , better quality cameras and greater water and dust security will allow smart foetal .
he added that , as you have already heard , guests can already be predicted for the four top @-@ ups that are likely to conquer the venlies .
these four top @-@ level smart phones will reach a leg in the autumn of this year .
the long @-@ awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone Plus should reach the boys by mid @-@ September .
the images of what the new Apple model looks like and can do in this regard are much more widespread .
if the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences between iPhone and 6s , Apple is expected to be completely distinct from the previous model at the birthday .
four colours have been mentioned : black , white , white and cold .
one element of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the entire telephone panel , lost at home and is built on the screen .
JonyIve , the head of Apple design , demands that the new iPhone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk of a ceramic version of an iPhone .
in addition to the SG , wireless charging and a more advanced cameras , speeds for A11 Process members can be expected .
this is certainly one of the most expected smart phones for the year .
the Galaxy note 8 of the brand new model will begin on 23 August .
there are many rumours of a new Galaxy note 8 .
there is even more business @-@ owners , and the S pen will allow even more functionality .
the TV phone should have two cameras , one being sleeping pressure and one on TV , with a narrow view .
nobody knows at present what two slums are capable of , but in any case it is the first test of the same same , which is surely the same as iPhone 8 in terms of quality .
we are looking forward to 23 August .
while Nokia has brought three smart phones to sales this year with Nokia 6 , their flagship ship - Nokia 8 - is still missing , which is already to be presented on 16 August .
we are awaiting a screen stretching from 5.3 to the end of the day and an ultra fast Firem Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processes and a more robust ag .
Nokia also speaks of aluminium flax and of the significant level of water and dust resistance IP68 .
in the same vein as the code , the new model of Nokia has two amples of ambia , an optimist produced by the Zeiss .
once the Sony has been a solid flagship ship , XZ Premium , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will have even more innovative functions in the near future .
we are looking for a smart phone which is a little more modest than XZ Premium , but at least with the same good or better camera .
speculation has been carried out on the new model for Sony , which is at least hot @-@ and @-@ cold .
what is happening is that we can see the moment soon , as the international technology fair charging has traditionally been published at the Sony &apos;s autumn flagship International Technology Fair ( IFA ) this year , which is to be held from 1 to 6 September .
Trump , leased transcricket warnings , pressurised by Trump , for paying the border wall
the Washington post revealed transcriptions between US President Donald Trup and Mexican Heads of State .
on 27 January , Mr Nietta , the Mexican President , went to the former President of the United Kingdom to stop announcing that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President was in abhor for publicly condemning the Wall , saying &apos; You must not say this to the press &apos; .
the thirteen @-@ man campaign has pledged to build a path to the US &apos;s South border wall and vanity to make Mexico pay for this project .
Transcriptors from his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turnbull , have also been published , revealing intense debates .
Trump said to Mrs Turner that the agreement that the United States would take on a migration path to Australia would be &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; nervous &apos; and &apos; foolish &apos; , and that it would save him &apos; from the impression of having given him a &apos; ragbag &apos; under the Obama Government , because it has proposed a ban on refugees from the United States .
the Trump finished giving notice to tourists that it was the most unpleasant speech of the day .
the Supreme Court did not prosecute the Landinag City , where the Tartu city rejected their offer of bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 2029 .
it is a handbook rejecting the offer of the Tartu bus bus in the City of OÜ MRP because of a lack of compliance , Anneli Apuhtin , Director of the Tartu City Service .
it is a public bus and coach transport for the period from 1.1.07.2019 to 0.06.2029 for the period of delivery within the city of Tartu .
the Councils in MRP brought the judgment of the Tartu District Court to the Supreme Court .
it was not prosecuted by the Supreme Court .
although many in the social media complain that the costubborn breath from the Weekend festival is disrupting their night and that the entire town is full of breaders , there are many who do not have a single word to say a bad about the festival lasting in the island .
I am even positively surprised that visas were so solemn in the supermarket !
I saw no dissent or impolite .
even the flame has come , &apos; a wave is a nut .
&quot; it is good that you are coming , staying and proud of the legacy that has remained on the winter , &quot; will bring him happily .
the wave of red cows does not bother .
while living in a central town , he is still being played on the floor of music , now the music has not reached his home rate .
&quot; I hope I hear , &quot; he will be happy .
also , the Agnes report that the Gestival is good for the record - it is a major contribution to the turnover of local merchants .
she also welcomes the fact that so many outbreaks have been visited in the capital cities of summer .
no woman of family life .
although I will not be on the coast any more , I am happy that the rand has recovered .
it is good that the public is moving and it has been three times as bad , &quot; says a woman .
I think the first time was a little worse .
&apos;Perhaps there were complaints &apos; , he will reflect .
what he says is common practice for the summer capital .
&quot; this Weekend is a very good program for our small town , Harri is hiding in para .
neither his life and mouth bogged down in his life .
for what !
we should all stand together .
how it is better to communicate between nations .
after all , a black man is not sleep .
it will not be , although I live near there .
&quot; good people can make savings and no trouble , &quot; he says .
visitors coming to the seaside are visa @-@ free , he said .
&quot; with the Alliance they have , of course , joined a bit , but young people are young and issant God - give you , but be people and we can ! &apos;
people on the ground have travelled away from somewhere by then , either to their relatives or to acquaintances .
&quot; but in general , the festival has a positive impact on life - people like it &apos; , the Tiina , who have walked with children from Vienna .
his family is also not bothered by festivals , although it has been heard even further from this year .
the second was on the spot last summer , then we heard more .
we live outside the city that it actually gets quite well to go there from the Sea of Heritage . &quot;
Pearson cuts another 3000 jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
the British educational firm Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3 000 jobs and reduce its interim dividend by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with the mentoring burden of business .
the jobs that will be covered , which will most likely be concentrated in the following four posts , as the CEO , John Falloni , at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will be added to the 4 000 posts lost in the previous restructuring .
Beijing announced in May plans to cut the cost of a third cost cut of the programme &apos;s reduction of EUR 300 million ( USD 394 million ) to try to revive the business that has been hit by the move to fast digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell its participation in the company , Penguin Random House , to Bertelsmann , said that their expectation with regard to the year has not changed since the 1 % increase in sales was announced at 2.05 billion in the first half of the year .
summer of rain will continue to be sown on Sunday
in Estonia , a sunscreen sunscreen with rainy rooting will be sunch on Sunday , with the wind outbreaks sometimes very strong .

Kabul attack : NATO soldier lost suicide in suicide attack
a suicide bomber attacked army convoys in the Afghan capital , Kabul , to kill a NATO soldier and wound several others .
the NATO statement stated that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
three civilians also died in the county of Qarabaghi , unproven local reports .
this bombing is the last acts of violence to have hit Afghanistan this month , with more than 30 killed in the Herati mosto attack on Tuesday .
on Monday two people were killed by suicide bombing in Kabul near the Iraqi Embassy .
the NATO statement stated that an explosion on Thursday took place when the Afghan army was attacked by &apos; man @-@ made explosives &apos; , in a joint patrol .
the statement states that all are in a stable position and treated at Bagram &apos;s airport in the US military hospital .
according to reporters , the Taliban and group known as the &apos; Islamic &apos; ( TEEK ) are a serious source of concern for the forces in Baghdad , NATO , which is becoming ever more powerful forces .
according to the UN , at least 1,662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , some 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , the car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people in the line of Shi &apos;ite rays .
they were at the root of the attack , according to the Taliban .
a major bomb attack in the centre of the city on 31 May killed more than 150 people , which has led to the most deaths in a military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces failed the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops and police forces that help the country .
according to the correspondents , the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf Ghan .
following a decision to postpone the Regulation , the EPA annulled the decision
the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( UNStates Environmental Protection Agency EF ) repealed the decision to delay the establishment of a Obama @-@ time Regulation obliging states to limit emissions of emissions from the summer , one day after 15 states were sued by this move .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed with &quot; the decision to establish the BONUS status &quot; late on Wednesday , saying it demonstrates its commitment to cooperation with the states .
&quot; we believe we need to engage in dialogue and listening to our national partners , &quot; said Scott Pruitt , leader of the EPA .
the June EPA had announced its intention to put into practice descriptors of the ozone content declarations 1.4 in different parts of the country , in order to identify where it should be reduced by one year to 2018 &apos;s crossroads in order to meet the most stringent air quality standard .
in the 15 main democratic states , an action was filed with Columbia on Tuesday saying that this decision was unlawful .
President Donald Trumpi &apos;s government has tried to bring back a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama , and this is part of the broader plan for growth , as I have said , in Trup .
but these efforts have led to reactions among the groups of democrats and nature protection who are concerned about the effects of increased contaminants on human health .
the EPA website states that inhaling the ozone layer &quot; could reduce the ability of lung and increase the risk of respiratory illness , &quot; e.g. asthma .
there may be a pittance for German pigs .
Germany can have a ticket for the purpose of threatening the EU &apos;s second @-@ biggest wheat producer , Bloomberg , as a result of heavy rain .
this year , it may be the case that the weekend of precipitations before harvesting may mean that the production intended for the bread only serves animals .
&quot; the quality of content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said Bernhard Chilla , the analysis of Agravis Raiffeisen .
this year , up to 40 % of German wheat can be fed fed in Agravis , a forecast of double @-@ hatted diseases .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have come across any beauty this year .
first , the winter was too dry .
then there was cold spring replaced by heat waves in June .
in July , the German leadership was hit , which has continued in August .
many eyes are on northern Germany , where the rain is holding back harvesting .
only five per cent of wheat have been cleared up so far .
most of the harvest in the area has not even started , local buyers in Ceravis have declared .
&quot; this is a very challenging day , said from the Rear Trade Authority Frank Deckert Rendsburg .
Pharmagic roofs of intra @-@ Finns
nature is playing its part in the intermittances of ruins of ruins , as through large windows Saimaa fishermen &apos;s spirits end up in many ( life ) rooms .

Irhaste and observance are also worth enabling Finns to use wood as a construction and processing material , furniture and beauty .
Portable techniques and smart solutions are found in the design of the building and home ( home ) in the cabins .
it shows clearly that the black , white and grey factions , if they are supplemented by wood tones and toesta , can be very angry .
there is still a week to go for good ideas , as the tone will last until 13 August .

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontations
Mr Lomachenko and Ms Garcia , who should be at the collision course to face the most attractive poxing poxing of the near future in the order of 66.7 kg weight group , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in Lomachenkot in special rooms in LOS Angeles , until Garcia , the unwon World Boxing Councili lightweight champion , walked the other corridor to welcome Lomachenkot , the World Boxing Times tably consulting the sulgrasram .
following the unanimous decision by Garcia , the former four @-@ time world champion Adrien Broner was won on Saturday in Showtime by both combatants in the headwolleg .
the Garcia extended its better hand and said : &quot; how is your soul going , champion ?
I wish you luck . &quot;
Lomachenko is defending his belts Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening 19 in the ESPN .
when a few photo images were named , Mr Egis Klima , a mountain joule of Lomachenko said that a &quot; perfect moderation &quot; could be possible between opposing fighters .
&quot; I was a former sultative , &quot; reminiscent of Garcia .
&quot; I have switched to Broner &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 63.5 kg .
I want to go beyond the lighter .
and it must move up the trail &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the games have called for it .
let &apos;s put it to them . &quot;
Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
the question of whether this should be worthwhile is one of his strategies , which he wants to ask Lomachenko to book 61.2 kg of the class at the end of this year , to make a meeting with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 months ) , who also has an interest in combating Jorge Linda and Luke Campkkich , following the athlete &apos;s celebration on the occasion of the athletes &apos; ceremony of Forradar on 23 September , was raised in the clima .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as the fans have asked for it , &quot; said Garcia , later saying that it was open to any channel providing the best financial package .
&quot; we are the main actors .
no other name can deserve so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
she said she was a &apos; powerful fighter &apos; to Lomachenkot and could go on to his Saturday .
however , Lomachenko was modest in praising the Garcia , saying that he thought he saw the decoration of three divishons from Riverside - very slow ; I am sorry , Mikey ... you wanted it a nose .
the aim was to show strength and then to bow down , as the Garcia said .
they both affirmed that they felt that the tension would increase to the challenge between them .
&quot; this is a struggle for action .
no other confrontation is so much more of a focus and a little bit of attention .
I am more than willing to work on it , &quot; said Garcia .
Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been on the bench of the best fighters , and Mikey is just that .
it will be a good struggle . &quot;
what sort of world rays will be relocated to Estonia ?
the Police and Border and coast Guard ( PPA ) issued a record residence permit of over 13 000 third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to , study or family to Estonia .
for example , if it was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit to 6702 foreigners , it was 4928 .
the agencies cannot tell how many migrants will eventually stay in Estonia , but such an analysis will be carried out in the Ministry of the Interior .
if there were around 500 Ukrainians per year in Estonia ten years ago , this figure will reach 2 000 in recent years .
the number of applicants for the residence permit soared during the Ukrainian crisis , with 1087 people in 2014 , one year before 675 before the age @-@ of @-@ term residence permit .
the statistics from the office show that the Ukrainian citizens are growing the highest number in Estonia , with 850 Ukrainian citizens left in Estonia more than a fence .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been very high in Estonia all the time , and it is only natural because of the difficult circumstances in the country that the country is looking for work and learning opportunities in the country where the community and many families already had their own front in front of them , &quot; said Kristin Rammus , the spokesperson for the Home Department .
the number of Ukrainians granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian nationals , although in 10 years total the most fixed @-@ term residence permits have been granted to them .
if the Ukrainians get into work here , then Russian citizens will be forced to migrate .
&quot; given the historic Russian community here , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said Helina Meuse , the chief theatre of the Interior .
&apos;If you look at where the Russian citizens who have been granted a residence permit in Estonia have moved , there is an East Fesmaa immediately after Harjutherland &apos; , she added and pointed out that around 40 % of them are married to a European Union citizen .
it has been granted a term of residence of 1 696 Russian citizens , which is also record .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to renew their residence permits fell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of a permanent residence permit for Estonia &quot; are explained by the spokesperson Rammus , who says that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia has remained stable for many years rather than the renewal of their residence permit .
a new residence permit for a permanent stay in Estonia can be applied for foreigners who have lived here for at least three years from last year .
it aims to encourage the sincere savings of the people adapted .
however , a long @-@ term residence permit will require five years , for example .
the renewal of the old residence permit has apparently diminished because of the new residence permit .
soil , for example , was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
Ukrainians can now exchange their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer point the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit became popular in the courtyard , with the owners of another grey passports ( 1029 ) , Russians ( 487 ) , individuals ( 54 ) and Finns ( 36 ) requesting them .
a total of 1968 people were granted a residence permit to reside in Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 Georgians and equally many Chinese .
the total number of applicants has already reached 1269 in the first half of this year .
in 10 years , Nigeria has become a country with some of the most active candidates for Estonian residence permits .
three residence permits were issued for nicoters in 2007 , the soil was 200 .
lessons will be learned from Nigeria to universities .
in addition , universities in Estonia are popular with Georgians , Chinese and Turks , for example .
the number of citizens in India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to the study games .
for these too , the rule applies that there will be more easily more of others in which the community has been formed , &quot; Rammus added .
in 10 years , two people have moved to Estonia from North Korea , for example , just as much from Laos and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four from Uruguay .
if around 6,000 third country nationals receive a residence permit a year , it is 0.46 % of the total population .
even if you include EU citizens , you will stick to about one percent of the difference &apos; , you have said that the figures are small .
in total , 14 822 people were able to travel to Estonia , compared with 13 792 , according to the statistical office .
this means that for a second year migration exceeded emigration .
the majority of relocated people are Estonian citizens , but more are in the country .
the migration beta has therefore been in decline with the population of 2 000 .
children are particularly struck between Finland and Estonia .
Mammu Couture glue glue with sausage , weed and disgust
however , in the wake of the North , there is history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and defendants : &apos; I can dream somewhere for hours in museums and old thieves and admire .
if you look at and learn something every day about it .
it is a joy to find out !
the world of Mammu Couture glamorous may seem to be a life alien to some , but the designer does not think so .
you will decide how much you are in life !
I have a friend who has full gall the battery of couture of the sharks I have created .
because it is not his fault , nor is he living in Hollywood and not on red fat every day , he wants to carry those most beautiful brokers and suffer !
you can live in a special way !
the Moeartist does not recognise the divisions between brilliant events and the hall day .
it was this reasoning that led to the rolling @-@ out of higher grades in Estonia between land , forests and fields , to people who are often not reached by the mood .
Mammu collection was presented on the basis of a benchmark , Jõhvis and LT moealleel , where a Royal Defilee with 45 modelles carried the streets .
in Tallinn , the desert is often taken in the shop , a dignified nod , but there is more emotion elsewhere - the cry is bvo rising , you have to thank you .
a large number of the audience had to be downlisted , but are now the fans of Mammu Couture .
if you exceed the expectations of the people , they are admired !
and I like to feel that I am on the verge of being a fashionable piece of moisy like a summer .
we had a 50 @-@ metre red carpet , full of rubber @-@ stamp across the whole street , which seemed to be not the end !
Maria also recognises the motive that the creation must be presented by a supersupercautionary character , and it will bring women who are willing to sit on the brink .
I often invite my own customers - they have always been happy .
it is like experience , a fine wings on the verge of a wonderful hole !
I am so sorry that I have never seen what I have been watching , I am always behind the scenes to make the last piece of what is unhappy as a boiom .
my nervous would not allow a calm watch from the floor .
Maria is the moelocher of a kind who not only wants to play a representative role , but has to be involved in everything .
I have a smack of its own muscle , most of it myself .
I like you to find out about the whole process of playing with the details .
I am not far from my own creature and I am not afraid of work .
it is not a matter of stigma , nor is it a matter of engineering , logistics , organisation , organisation - everything has to reach one day of temperate woman .
those who are really working are still hugely attached to fanatics .
I cannot say when my day of work will end , for me it is just a day full of joy !
I have been very lucky - it is like an unceasing happy parade : I do something nice , man gets something beauty and , in turn , complicate .
it has been said many times that I have a coogy in my stickers - they make themselves feel printed .
the aberroneous spectators that Maria talent made to account overnight have remained the Mammu Couture signalling date .
Martin Myrrrrat U18 boys : Reagrurupour , an arms for the Estonians , has now turned against us
I am afraid , fairy tales ran out .
the first thing was that we could not get our desk .
and if such a difference is needed on the table , &quot; the Estonian Estonian Estonian prayer reacted to the tune of U18 corvball boxes 61 : 75 UK Respies , our sole corptor , Thai KalBC @-@ v / mo Craabitreener Martin Myrrspp , who played our only part in the NFAs .
opponents took 28 pounds from the offensive wave and suffered so many more attacks .
we were not prepared to protect them aggressively and not to attack them , it was created .
many of the attacks by English end in three to five seconds , we could not build protection .
in defence , however , they have kept their hands everywhere , we could not combine .
it has turned the team out .
the anti @-@ fire was better .
the two claimants estimate that Estonia should have made more tactical errors to remove the momentum of the opponent in the bud .
in the last quarter , we had zero error , but we had already had a quick response from opponents .
Instancefulness and intense insistence , which was our weapon in the albind , have now turned against us all .
today we had no force against their aggressiveness .
the ymouthest remained satisfied with Kalevi , Matthias Tass , with its cavalier disregard .
in general , good words can be said about the whole team , so far in a united hit .
it is a pity that this aggressive opponent had not been met before .
the ball has been confident all the time and has played out today , but it seemed to have been tired - it has carried a pretty great deal of burden .
but he made some rather nice gestures that I have seen in the past &apos; , accompanied by a mentor .
terrible numbers : less than 10 points were thrown by EM @-@ turnip in the coral concentration of nefresh corps with three quarters ...
in the U18 age class , only emi B @-@ divisjon corpound in Tallinn did not work in the same category as men , Women starting the day yesterday in Dublin .
and the Estonian game with Poland was , unfortunately , a jealousy .
Estonia lost 33 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , 9 : 49 , or only in the last 10 minutes , were taken by opponents from the gas family , leaving the period at the level of the figure 16 .
Estonia &apos;s 4 , point number 3 , was set to be deleted in both the first and second quarters ...
then they hit two bits of the first two minutes from the four , and then adds to the 25 @-@ mile game , then one of the three , and then 21 , to the downside ...
perhaps 47 creatures were caught in almost half an hour .
in addition , 2 paragraphs came from four free @-@ tones .
the number of losses in many cases was reasonable , 12 .
the pump was eventually reduced by 33 % in Poland and 13 % in Estonia ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , and on the inaugural day Portugal had to be recognised as 83 : 56 .
NATO vessels have been replenished into Tallinn
NATO today arrived for the weekend of an ad hoc port visit to Tallinn to supplement the stock of ships and prepare for the upcoming exercises .
during the visit ships are preparing for release into the sea , giving crews the possibility to take a couple of days .
after the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonia to carry out a series of exercises and prepare for future historic explosives @-@ searching operations .
&quot; the participation of the Estonians in the NATO contingent and co @-@ operation in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the Allied forces , &quot; said Captenore Arto Reinmaa , chief of the overseas military and planning station .
since 29 June , NATO is holding a permanent mine steering group of the Latvian Navy Captenleitant Gvileant Laudups , who took over from the Estonian navy officer Johan @-@ Elias Seljaas at a ceremony in Riga .
LVNS Virsaitis , a ship supported by the Latvian navy , is designated as a group flagship ship , including a group steering period .
the Estonian Navy mine hunt and Sakalas are also part of the international unit in this semester .
as one of the four groups of ships subject to NATO &apos;s Maritime command , NATO is the permanent anti @-@ missile group 1 of primary Rapid Response Forces , to be sent to different places in the world within five days .
the fatigue series of Pirita monastery will become once more a place in which Birgitta Festival , which was committed 13 years ago , was decepted by the Maestro Eri Klased .
the World AIDS leader of the Charlemagne , at the Festival of the Charleonia arts , will be marvellous , powerful and unprecedented .
at the Risto Joost , the Traviata and Tosca in the class in the World of affopaesta , Balletilalato , the Palace of the Bolerost &quot; Karlssonin &quot; and the program &apos;s own production , this time , Joseph Haydni &apos;s magic orum Contrifume , &quot; discovery by the same international team who brought to Piriyni hospital design in 2015 . &quot;
Burma has much more than simply concerts and theatre replies .
it is bigger than any music theatres in their normal form .
it is a festival whose snow is gaining ground and never quite disconnected .
because the experience gained by the audience in this unjust and mysterious environment is more vibrant and human beings are affected by human models in ways that cannot be described .
at the risk , you are the first architect of Festival to Burma .
did the shoes of the maestro Ek not feel a little big ?
of course , but because I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been a lot of help .
he went through a whole pupil career and supported my dirigisme at the beginning of the dirigisme career .
perhaps it is because of this that I will be easier to carry on with her work .
the team of Birgitta Festival has been abusing so much of the good , and of course it is all over me .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things go .
I also had the great heart of Eri Kese to thrive on Burma in the Tallitania Filtu Festivalry .
and here I am on my way !
what could be the audience for this year &apos;s festival , what are you offering ?
we have the first balleum to be presented to the demonstrations , including by the Festival , written by Astrid Lindgreni , in the form of a surprise , from England , Latvia , Lithuania and surprise .
it is &apos; Karlsson fly &apos; .
and one notorious nuance in that is that the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons , who himself expressed a desire to write this work , is the author of this Balourty .
apparently , he has already been a caritter of Karlsson somewhere in his mind .
at the risk , how are you all fat ?
my life @-@ support colleague will certainly be .
this is a job that needs a lot of love and support , and fortunately I have a lot of cousness .
and I have noticed that my personal emotion is not as dependent on people as I myself might be , as it were , how I will go against every new day .
and this is a conscious awareness of the tone , a positive statement and , in fact , a smile in the mirror of the morning , a significant increase in my happiness .
especially this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen to practise them and it works .
Fool self @-@ defeating is a brain and a multiplier .
it is not just a hollow word .
I think people do not yet know about the body that the universe offers to them , but they will find it in a little bit .
now we are at a crucial moment .
is there a ritual before the dirigendi pulse is taken ?
it is time to exchange clothes for more comfortable ones .
it is a small moment for itself .
but generally , I do not have the opportunity to cool or make a little skins before I get a lot of speaking .
I am actually even pleased to have active exchanges with people , even before the dirigendidrag is taken .
but come to Birgitta Festival , not a particularly big ous and a brother !
watch the scene for a glance at the dangers !
new results of tests on the age of Swedish asylene applicants published
in Sweden , a test of their age @-@ old novel approach was carried out in a medical test of asthma , showing that over 80 % of theistic transactions were older than 18 % , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for medicine ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) started the tests this year .
tests were created to better assess the age when the Swedish IOM ( Migrationsverket ) was requested for not having been properly identified as the age of several minors .
to date , the Irationsverket has already sent 68 cases to the test , and a total of 2481 test results have been released between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July 2013 by the Institute for Justice .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or over and another 25 cases were assessed by the Institute for Justice ( CEN ) as &apos; a possibility of 18 years or more &apos; testing .
in 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person was &quot; probably younger than 18 &quot; .
the tests will only be used if the age of the person is in question .
the results are consistent in relation to those in the past months , according to Johan Göransson , working in the Institute for Justice .
&quot; we do not see any major differences in statistics over the past months , quite consistent figures , &quot; he said The Local Journal .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were judged to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that applicants have been disenfranchised for their age .
the institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said in 442 cases &quot; there are indications that the person examined is 18 years old or older . &quot;
but when she studied the results of the 581 test , she said in 243 cases she had said directly that she would be 18 this year .
this medical age assessment method , which involves nexthyogeniviss and cork imaging , has been used in some quarters , and has been used to analyse hairddos and radiologists .
one of the sceptics is the endokrinoloog Claude Marcus , an endocrine disruptor whose tasks include assessment of human biological maturity to determine whether they went through the usual audience early or beyond .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and do not think that the method of measurements that we are using should be used .
the way the biological age is set is very uncertain .
if we cannot say so strongly , we should not pretend we can , &apos; he said &apos; to the Metro newspaper .
but , from the Institute for Justice , John Göransson , the accuracy of the tests was advocated : &apos; generally speaking , there is little risk of child leaving inaccurate adulterations .
perhaps the biggest risk at around 10 % is a little less than 18 . &quot;

Anna Maria Orel , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old vasser , has done a nice debate on the BBC with her 6.376.birthplace .
she was a female priest and a happy woman , and he said he hoped to fight for the medals in the future .
the contest has been successful and has had good experience .
I immediately did my first test , 64.80 , to my average performance , to the other ( 62.80 ) , too much risk , and , thirdly ( 67.37 ) , I could almost keep it clear , &quot; said Orel after the contest .
I was conscious of my emissions and I am very pleased to find it .
Anna Maria Oreli MM has ended with a good 18th anniversary .
Mr Orelio did not blend , because he is training in the winter bridge .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; said a little fairy .
at the London Olympic Assembly , an almost full family of people , did they carry people around or were able to get off ?
I have returned , but in positive terms .
everybody says it will - that is true !
if you compete , you will be able to know .
I have finished over the course of the debate and have many good competitions for him : &apos; I have come here with the 32nd , the last outcome , of this season , to finish in 18th place .
it is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and it is the only thing that counts .
I will take on a good deal of experience and , some days , I want to compete on behalf of the coin .
Western Virgina Governor announced party change
Jim Justice , the Western @-@ Virginia Democrat Governor , announced at the gathering of Thursday evening with President Trumpi that he would change political parties .
&apos;Why it or not , the democrats walked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; having been a great fan and admired ... today , I say to you , the Western Tyravians , that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor . &quot;
Silits to joy were suspended at the assembly .
&quot; so I will be Republican , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a coke , I would say it is time to play a different game . &quot;
the Trump had previously committed a major announcement at the gathering of West Virginia .
Trump won 42 points in Western Virginia and Justice did not support Hillary Clinton as a Democrat candidate .
Justice , the only billionaire in the State of Forbeshali , was elected in 2016 .
the Ford notes that it has coal mines in five states and coal trading in its own right .
it is worth around USD 1.59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday night , the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) published an announcement that &apos; the party change of the Governor , Justice , is yet another blow to the democratic family that would prevent it from getting better , rather than working for it &apos; .
&quot; just 15 stars and controls on the lowest number of states in history - the Governor , Justice , &apos;s announcement is just the most recent expression of a parade that is in a position to complete the pipeline and cannot find a positive and united message , &quot; said Daniel BS Newsi , RNC , Ronna Manik .
it is hardly surprising that there are many people , many injured , too .
Urmet , in a photovoltaic preschool , said yesterday to the jury that they had to share a lot of posters .
plants and marches are fundamental , delevertitious and slight .
of course , we must also have a statement in the past and in the past .
visitors will come out to the festival with false footwear , according to Urmet , and so the problems will come .
the media have also had to assist a few people who are more injured - there have been scaremongering and also one foot in the foot .
we have also made bogs when people have gone out or have broken the finger .
we are doing less in this place , sending more to hospital .
watch the video whether the solemn media will be painkiller for the treatment of pophile .
Demicycle of Russians for the Duscannagoate
Sebastian Coe , the international force in the Kergean , praised him as &apos; Russia &apos;s Fair excuse &apos; for the Doping scandal &apos; , but repeated that this is not the time to allow sport back .
in the wake of the IAAF Congress , held at the World Cup in the wake of the athletes &apos; World Cup , Dmitry Shylakhtin , the Russian athlete was saying that the ban on the contest is right and has a firm objective of combating doping .
he has apologised to &quot; All light men who are stranded at the gold and silver medals in competitions . &quot;
despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban on the contest introduced in November 2015 , following the adoption of the WADA report , which provided evidence of state @-@ sponsored doping in Russia .
&quot; I believe it was a very fair response , a very honest presentation , today , &quot; said Coe , President of the IAEA .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that Russia itself admitted that they had had had quite difficult times and do everything possible to reorganise the UU . &quot;
in addition , Coe was pleased that Russia accepted its own sustainability criteria .
&quot; I believe it was a very constructive day today and progress is being made , but the Congress supports the group &apos;s proposal that this is not the time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; we must do everything we can in the next few months to bring the situation back to normal .
we have always based on the principle of wanting to separate pure sportsmen from the system , &quot; he added .
Ninteen Russian athletes meeting the strict criteria of IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World Cup matches to be launched in London on Friday .
Rune Andersson , head of the IAAF Group , said on Monday that Russia is not yet meeting a number of criteria for reconstruction .
following a presentation by the IAAF Council , he told journalists in London that doping controls were still insufficient and that the training officers who had banned were still operating freely .
the electric car revolution is a significant shift in the demand for honey .
who are the winners and losers ?
not least that the electric car revolution will revolutionise everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure , it will also generate new winners and losers in the metal market .
although mining giants like Glencore can say that they will win from one place and lose the other , the smaller mining companies will not help .
today , Glencore is coal and oil , but cobalt , lithium , copper , aluminium and nicism will continue to increase in the era of electric cars .
this year contributions have been increased by the governments of the UK , France and Norway to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades .
so Volvo has already knew that it is designed to abandon the combustion engine and that Tesla will bring 3 electric cars to a cheaper market .
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that electricity cars are sold more than cars used for oil in a space of two decades .
&quot; on some metals it will change everything , says to Simona Gambranini Bloomberg , the raw materials analysis for venture economics .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as code and lithium , which have been growing in demand for years .
there are about three times more adverse reactions in the power sector than in the normal car , Glencore announced .
more is needed at charging stations , which is why Exane BNP Paris estimates that demand will increase by around 5 % by 2025 .
the growth in demand for batteries in electric cars will mean additional demand for lithium , cobalt , graphite and manganans .
Glencore will generate a growing revenue from the electric car trend and will be the world &apos;s largest cobalt producer , predicting Jefferies Group .
this broker is estimated to be winners of Freeport @-@ McMoRan and First @-@ Quantum Minerals .
the market is responding to a trend that is already changing .
this year 70 % of the surface of the London metal code has been caught .
the increase in the soil was 37 % .
14 % has also been poured up this year , mainly because of economic growth .
the Glencore excise duty in London rose by 20 % , above the price increases for the Rio Tto Group , BHP Billiton and Anglo Americas .
on the side of the boss , lead companies like Recyclex and Campine are the ones to adapt to the new era .
the main end @-@ of @-@ door use is the supply of flowers to petrol and diesel engines .
the power vehicles use lithium cells .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other uses to overcome the fall in demand &quot; the Bank of America Merrill Lynchi &apos;s MeMeteorological Market analytical leader Michael Widmer .
the impact of the drifting trend is not yet noticeable .
the figure has risen to 17 % this year , with prices for the main industrial metals in London being the best metre .
investors will see the problems for metal in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure it is so bad for lead because it is low @-@ cost oil is keeping the normal cars in competition &quot; said Herwig Schmidt , the vendor Triland Metals .
if there is a fall in demand , it is slow .
it could be in about ten years .
in the meantime , stricter emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars , which are more frequent to trigger engines from advanced lead @-@ based batteries , will be measured by the international lead and the Kuni research organisation .
Lighten metals like aluminium replace steel , as it is easier to drive a car further away from less electricity .
this is already explained by an additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes for 2013 @-@ 2016 .
it represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s production of aluminium .
this trend is likely to intensify , as Widmer said .
Aluminium has been falling by 13 % this year , as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
steel manufacturers won &apos;t .
the holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnologies to produce miracles .
also , ArcelorMittal and Europe are trying to develop a lighter meltdown to face the minimum .
&quot; a strong message should be an answer to this development , &quot; said Exane BNP Paribasi Mex Sylvain Brunet .
some progress is being made in Europe .
an end to the oil era could also bring plague to the plate .
around half of this precious diesel engine has been used as catalysts for cars , with the memosaicist Johnson Matit announced .
&quot; many of the raw materials with high demand , such as oil and platinum , may not face much demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard Dahdah , Natixise raw materials analysts .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important , but will change in importance over the course of 15 years .
Plainatinatfarmers believe that there is continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc Grynberg , leader of Uncore said that more hybrid cars would continue to be sold in 2025 .
the great hope of the Plainatinaton manufacturers in the 10 @-@ year perspective is for cars based on a hydrogen element developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos , which are dependent on posturing their own energy to generate a hydrogen @-@ based electricity .
however , until now , this technology has not proved commercial .
&quot; on the road to electric cars , a clear loophole seems to be in place for the latter , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris from Brbaset .
the German car manufacturers suffered a great setback in July , as the Stuttgart Court prohibited the use of diesel in the city of Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche .
how the Treasury rules affect the upcoming UK changeover
the rules to prevent the excesses of European football clubs do not prevent the record global transfer of the Neyge World football clubs from the Paris @-@ Saint Germain France .
any consequences from UEFA , the governing body that governs the European game and can prevent teams from taking part in the World Kings Group , the Paris Saint @-@ GerMay .
the Financial Regulation for FFFFFP , introduced by UEFA in 2011 , will mean that PSG will have to provide some evidence that the takeover was funded without massive losses .
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona ( USD 262 million ) alone for buying an Austrian out of his contract , and the wages of Neymark will reach tens of tens of millions of dollars per year .
there are some financial aspects of the integration of the Neymar into the French club .
PSG will undoubtedly be able to pay for the recruitment of Neyra and to put money into the pocket of its staple missile , given that the team is funded by the family in the Katar unit .
there is a lot of money available to clubs to take up players , but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that will enable them to get out of football business .
Michel Platini launched the foundation for FP after he was elected as President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs that would fail to invest in high debt were actually engaged in fraud and risk ruin if banks or owners had to give up support .
from 2011 , FP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of remaining in the position of the clubs .
this amendment means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich first in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then to spend a lot to make a better team and create a global brand - is harder to implement .
FFFP during the current three @-@ year evaluation period , which runs until 2018 , can cause up to € 30 million of losses to clubs .
and despite the disreputable presidential office of Platini in 2015 , his successor to UEFA , Alexander ander Ceferin , remains committed to obstructing excessive waste .
&quot; FFP is certainly not dead and we will continue to reinforce these rules , &quot; said Andrea Traverso , the UEFA @-@ FP Supervisor , to The associated WTO .
while at the same time they can allocate this amount to the full due diligence of the overpurchase clause of Neymark , they can allocate it to the full part of the contract for the purpose of accounting .
the 5 @-@ year agreement is the result of which it will be possible to translate the transitional levy into € 44.4 million per year over the next five years .
in 2014 , with the first wave of FFP sanctions , Manchester Cityga , a member of Abu Dhabi , received the worst penalties .
the € 60 million fine ( at this moment $ 82 million ) was imposed on the PSG , which was subsequently reduced to € 20 million , and was requested to limit the team of Meiciles to 21 players during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of business as usual 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs to try to penetrate the regulatory institutions by blowing up their revenues via business @-@ owners in @-@ club .
while a Qatar company may sponsor PSG , if the value of sponsorship is deemed to be above standard market rates , UEFA would not accept this as official income .
this was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the PS support was slashed .
it has been said that a certain part of the Neymark PSG services could be helped by the Kainfrastructure in the form of contributions from the World Cup Board of 20 years .
however , Reporters and Katar 2022 say that the Neyra could become a world championship and that UEFA &apos;s regulators could easily reveal such manoeuvres .
the earlier penalties for the PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not addressed the transition proactively with the PSG .
they have said with The &apos; The associated PC &apos; that their anonymity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation .
recent reports show that , during the 2015 @-@ 2016 period , more than € 10 million of profits for the PS will be generated at around € 542.4 million .
no data has yet been published for the last financial year .
DEPG hopes that the arrival of Neymark will have a positive impact on sponsorship , trade and sales marking .
the study is expected to increase by at least 30 % of the contract .
Spain , being clearly irritated by the departure of one of the largest football stars , sought to prevent the takeover , saying that the PSG is in breach of FP .
&quot; this is a clear case of &quot; financial doping &quot; with the club and country , &quot; said President Javier Tebas , Spanish newspaper , referring to the fact that the PSG is mainly in Katar .
Arsene Wenger , a reigner of Arsenal &apos;s club , shares the attitude of La with the latter to fund the club .
&quot; this is the result of ownership and has fully changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger on Thursday .
&quot; wherever a club belongs to the state , it is possible .
it is very difficult to respect financial rules for fair play , as the country can have other ways or interests to represent such a major player . &quot;

Fortieth anniversary today : the hurricane storm in Estonia , which was torn down by roofs and windows .
the hurricane , which was cited as stormy for the century and raging on 6 and 7 August , resulted in major damage , particularly to the West , the Cartheast and the Rapid countries .
in the North Estonia , over 30 m / s was at the wind during these days .
in my old medal , one of the ticked trees in the garden was coming to the other and being indulged in a handful of support .
it was all in a dark and charming way , as the world has done .
the former had already had their roofs off the houses , and in 2002 , Linda Kurova , an interview with the jury in an interview with the Estonian design .
the wife of Linda saw the property he was sitting on crash .
what sort of support do you have , though , with hands , where you are suffering such storms ?
the sea came under the window , from windows in the field &quot; Haapsalus Kalda spoke at the time .
the web runs full and the roof of at the stations had flown 20 @-@ 30 metres away , saw the majority of the shark kilos just next morning .
in local terms , there was a wood that was lagging behind , some shooting , some hanging .
everyone saw the very depressing storm , with grief and pragmatism like war from the beautiful old trees .
Western Virumaa was not particularly hard hit in August 1957 , but was also very severe in the Western Estonia , as Virumaa Official wrote in 2007 .
the Dephon Lossipark and the Padis park were swept from sweet , but our paratus parks were also severely damaged .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured at 35 metres per second , or some 130 km per hour .
on the evening of August , a small series of crings of lead had slogans sounding the slogans : &apos; mother , mother !
&apos;From in the air , the Virumaa Official Journal has signed up no longer ! &apos;
the concept of the Building in the Viljandiary was so decidedly destroyed during the storm that it was then then then then dismantled .
the design of the ski carrots , which was not subsequently restored , did not survive the Tyri ski premium .
on 12 August 1962 the Punane Tuna newspaper wrote that the removal of towns and settlements from depressed trees and their oxygen would slow , and that the residents would be free to wear cleaning works .
the crop fields were severely hit , and the newspaper announced that &apos; party @-@ root organisations must be an incentive for and a guideline for both maintenance and fertility . &apos;
the window can be reported if the average speed exceeds 32.7 m / s .
the dramatic record in Estonia remains unchanged from 2 November 1969 , when the Ruhnul measured for wind radiation at 48 m / s .
the only story in the island was broken by a measure , so the speed of the strong wind measured could not be recorded in detail .
secret of live bathing areas : night cleaning work and poor coastal face
Seglect summer dwellings also mean less duplication at the beaches of Tallinn .
&apos;If there are people on the coast , and if not , there are no people , &apos; , the beach is replied .
the crustarings in Stroom land in Northern Tallinn are being torn .
they are offered a seamless tractor to a fake plough at a subprime competitive whim .
in fact , the last one sands from a seven @-@ metre depth , pulling out of it a sea bag and leaving people in danger : bottomless sands , swine cons and others .
people are still on the coast , whether it is water or not .
if it is nice , people are on the coast , and if not , there are no people , &quot; Alexander Usov , the head of the Tower administration says .
there is a bitter duplication in the beach at 6.30 p.m. , because at 8 : 00 , the record must be in order for people .
the job is already at 4 pm .
besides Stroom , he is still keeping a check on the village of Pirita , Harku Lake , Kakumäe and Paljasais Pikakr .
the amounts have been reduced .
there were many more years ago .
people can now already assess what is being done for them , &quot; Usov , who has harvested a living for 15 years .
it was the case before that , when something new was standing , it was broken next day .
what is in the field is now being kept .
price of clean shore
one of the biggest work on the Estonian coast is the clean @-@ up of seafaring marine waste , or equipment .
for example , it has to be shipped 400 000 tonnes of coastline in the Pirita coast .
&quot; this is unbelievable , it is encouraging .
in the second big category , it is the municipal rubbish , all that people leave .
eight large waste breadcrumbs at the lower @-@ end zones of Stroom are needed for tripling three times a week .
there is so much waste .
however , the cold summer papers have meant that there is a fifth less rubbish than there was any other way .
the third is a desert .
these are mostly cargo .
as a result , dozens of South @-@ West cars have been driven out of the Usov sand .
they will wait for the owners to take the wood route .
&quot; normally , they will come out more , but it is normal , &quot; and they will be aware that they will soon be found in the sand .
children come on board and take toys to get them in the sand again .
landfill
Erika Scholler , representative of hospital administrative services , concedes that the riding of a tractor is disrupted by local activities .
noise , which runs from night to night , is disrupted by the breeding of people in the vicinity .
but this work is impossible on the day .
a month has to be spent two riches .
&apos;If we do not , we will be fined by the city &apos; , Mr Scholler will note .
but the aim is to get Stroomi rand below the international sinimong mark , along with Pirita , Pikr and Persia .
&quot; there is much more work in Estonia to keep the beaches &quot; says Scholler .
we have more jewellery and temples and more difficulty in talking .
there is less rubbish on our beaches than there is in Europe .
in the crown , in the field of Stroom , Martin is incoeritum induced to the circle of interviews between journalist and cork workers , highlighting the current bottlenecks .
Hommimint is a sight of the gallery everywhere .
the problem is with birds and pumps who have pulled rubbish bags , &quot; Martin reports .
although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the city council will take action with blending and , for example , impose a carve @-@ out to them to prevent the poultry from getting out there at least .
in general , however , Martin is happy with developments in Stroomi &apos;s field .
the city is looking after it .
it has become more pleasing with children &apos;s songs , enlightened and fresh roads .
it was the case that only one way was to go on on the tabling , &quot;
Aardemic findings in Stroomis : coins , only coins
a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Dimitr who , as a proxy , hampers a metal @-@ type reactor , has had to be exploited .
he does not believe he can find anything valuable today or in the future .
Seincims are not enough .
&quot; I have been working on this year and have found nothing of value so far , &quot; Dmitry is announcing .
as a campus , some euro coins , bottles and also hazardous pounds are thrown in the Dmitry Tower tree .
there are always coins .
&quot; there are no golden , finger @-@ pointing points and so on &quot;
Bank of England holds interest rates 0.25 %
Bank of England is expected to announce interest rates remain at the same level as weak growth and inflation mitigation have cushioned speculation on the rise .
Bank of England has warned that growth will remain sluggish as the tight incomes of households have set interest rates on demand .
the Bank &apos;s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) was voting in favour of keeping rates at 0.25 % below levels 6 : 2 ; less members are expected to increase this month , as slow growth has weakened support for growth .
in its quarterly report on inflation , the Bank has cut its growth forecast to 1.7 % in 2017 and at around 1.6 % in 2018 , and warned that the pressure on household incomes is tense as inflation is expected to continue to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the bank signalled that the increase in rates is necessary to contain inflation from Brex over the next few years and that the financial markets could have the necessary rise above the expected cost of borrowing .
Members also voted in favour of partial withdrawal of the Milk Package , triggered a year ago by Brext .
the Bank will close a fixed @-@ term financing scheme in February , which will provide cheap funding to banks , although it said it would now be expected to offer an increase of £ 15 billion , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; GDP in the MC averbaseline remains powerless in the near future , as the difficult income situation in households continues to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
on the inflation cap , it was repeated that &apos; some effort by fiscal policy &apos; is needed to alleviate inflation , and to some extent &apos; somewhat higher than expected on the markets .
the Böge Plan is currently forecast to rise in the first quarter of next year and in 2020 .
but the bank stressed that any hypertension was gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % in line with the estimates from May .
the 1.8 % growth forecast for 2018 remained .
after that news , the pound fell against the dollar and the euro .
a 0.5 % decrease to 1.31 dollars and 0.4 % to 1.11 euros .
the decision to reject change is due to recent disappointing growth figures , which have shrunk growing expectations of an increase in GDP growth of 0.3 % in the second quarter of last three months .
the bank is likely to say that there will be a 0.3 % increase in the third quarter , although a little momentum will be collected at the end of the year .
the latest inflation report by the Bank gave little reason to joke inflation and pitiful rises to households suffering from the increase , saying that improvements are going a little worse .
it was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income from hitting back in the next few years , but a noticeable recovery is expected for the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
the weak payout also encourages the economy to increase British production , which partly compensates for lower consumer costs .
the decision comes one year after the EU &apos;s shocking referendum was taken last August at 0.25 % , resulting in a sudden weakening of the pound .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years to breathe life into the prices and the economy .
before the bank &apos;s final decision , there was a growing demand for higher the rate as inflation had increased the pressure on households ; in July , three policy @-@ makers were demanding an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell from 2.6 % last month , to 2.9 % in June , although the bank said it was expected and a return to the upturn in the coming months .
the bank said that excessive growth in comparison to the 2 % target was due to the downside .
Andrew Montlake , the head of Coreco mortgage brokers said : &apos; in light of the recent decline in exchange rates , the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again , as lenders yearn and hope to complete the year &apos;s positive work .
the Böge dividend to those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as refinancing , often service @-@ absorbing and low @-@ rate , seems to be increasingly popular . &quot;
NHS is writing a HIV drug which has been controversial to 10 000 people
patients have since September access to a transformative HIV treatment following a battle in court on whether the NHS should finance a medicine .
NHS has announced that public health services are now making an initial 3 @-@ year clinical trial available to 10,000 people during an estimated 3 @-@ year clinical trial - a pre@-@ to @-@ peer alert tactic ( PrEP ) - a tablet that is pre @-@ applied before the interim arrangement and has shown a potential risk of a nearly 86 % reduction in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people .
the NHS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the Supreme Court supported last year &apos;s decision by the Supreme Court that the NHS is capable of paying for PrEP , despite the authority &apos;s own assertions that it should finance the medicine directly from local authorities .
Simon Stevens , Executive Director of NHS England , welcomed the release of this initiative on Thursday as &apos; major new meddling &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NAT ) described it as &apos; turning moments &apos; .
Irhowing clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpol and Sheffield are among the first to register , and further clinics will follow in October , before the programme is introduced throughout England by April 2018 .
the pre @-@ HIV infection ( PrEP ) is a hotline for HIV medication , which is preceded by an interim arrangement to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that the PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk .
PrEP &apos;s inclusion prior to the incident means that sufficient drugs are available in the body of the person that is preventing HIV infections .
these medicines can be taken daily or two hours before the recess .
LGBT selection includes men of homosexual or bisexual origin , transgender people and people with HIV and with no treatment .
the clinical persons identify suitable people willing to participate in a clinical trial , including men , women , transgender people and those with an antiretroviral benefit .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor can also register their interest in a local sexual health clinical into the scheme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed the Treaty to get medicines this week after the international procurement process .
the clinical trial aims to assess the real potential of the PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who is destined for the medicine and how it is consumed and implemented in a big picture .
Stevens said : &apos; this new massive intervention should complement and leverage a comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
it is a milestone in the fight against one of the greatest challenges to human health in more than three decades . &quot;
Deborah gold , Managing Director of NAT , said : &quot; this is a turning point in the fight against HIV .
PrEP , if targeted correctly at those in need and at risk @-@ class groups , offers the opportunity to transform Britain &apos;s HIV epidemic .
since September , through this clinical attempt funded by the NHS , people with high HIV risks in England have access to a powerful new tool which is individually managed and is not dependent on dialogue with the partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian Green , Executive Director of the Terrence Higgins Fund , said : &quot; now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is quickly pushed over the country and that no HIV @-@ risk group is excluded .
now that the PrEP clinical trial has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of HIV infection .
Sharon Hodgson , Minister of Public Health , said : &apos; the start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delay and lectures by the government &apos;s feet .
evidence shows how much this medicine can bring to the end of HIV prevention and the spreading of life @-@ changing infections .
this clinical attempt will bring us one step closer to fully understanding of the advantages of PrEP .
it is now important that a clinical attempt is implemented as soon as possible across the country to protect people with HIV exposure and move us one step closer to halting HIV transmission in society . &quot;
electricity prices went down by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the difference in the price differential between the next day &apos;s stock exchange rate between Latvia and Lithuania fell to 1.94 euro , up from € 7.71 in June this year .
the main reason for the difference is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia the average electricity exchange rate last month was € 34.33 per megawatt hour , and the price increased by 12 % from June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by 5 % to 36.27 per megatt hour .
in Finland the price was € 34.17 and the 3half of the electricity exchanges had a cost of € 26.37 per megawatt hour .
prices rose by 12 % and 7 % respectively .
an electricity from Estonia and Finland reached 75 % of the previous hours towards Estonia and 16 % from Estonia in Finland .
no deals took place between the other nine % of the hours two countries for the next day .
electricity from Estonia and Latvia reached 99 % of the time at Latvia and from Latvia to Latvia in the Czech and 73 % of the total capacity for transmission was available .
Nasdaq OMX , according to transactions on the last July trading day , could generate a market price for electricity in August at around 34 € and 37 € per megawatt .
the carbon price affected by electricity prices increased last month , and transactions were at a price of between 5.04 and 5.47 € per tonne .
living in higher education - half @-@ time design Poles have transformed it into home of the little Earls Court cork corps
Joanne Leigh , former banker with passion for a building innovator , exchanged his great Knightsbridge house in 2014 against the Earls Court corti in London .
it is in the first order of Queen Anne Terrace and that Joanne has not packed up his bags and passed on the flarer is an honour to a new design .
&quot; before that , I lived on much stronger ground with a former life @-@ co in Kightsbridge , &quot; said Joanne .
&quot; I was looking at something equivalent to the price I have offered .
I was given the Earls Court of charge and had the same high levels .
I was wearing a head on it and making a deal on the same day . &quot;
since its first visit , this 93 @-@ square metre corps has passed a full innovation plant .
it was a sleeping cork and a complicated flat : a kitchen had to be walked through to get a sleeping ball ; Joanne wanted to add housing and half @-@ order to exploit the high levels .
&quot; I wanted a lot of light , high @-@ quality windows .
they were my demands , &apos; he said .
she was nominated by the architectural and designer of Erfan Azadi , who works in the hill , Duck &amp; shed to exploit a figure of 3.8 m and create a home that is not just a development site but a place where Joanne can live .
the band was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so architecture was the quasi @-@ challenge to stand up .
there was a creative approach to the issue .
&quot; it is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to reorganise the facilities without having to sit on one another .
it was not just about building a platform , but about using steel structures to get beyond and bottom . &quot;
this emphasis enabled Erfanm to build two full @-@ time rooms in the room with a number of dramatic elements .
the old @-@ age light will be opened to a new glameric housing in line with the Retrouus window .
the golden furniture , silver details and retrobbornly Serge Serge Mouille highlights space .
the use of mirrors will play a role in the inclusion of theatre , space and lighting .
mirrors have been added to both ends of a short corridor to make it more ambitious .
in Köök , I will give the impression of a second tuna window .
the display provides a reflection on the site for all the Rendemic and glass claims of Joanne .
there is a possibility to close the kitchen if it is not used , creating a more fluid space for the image of housing .
the curioid kitchen is nothing new .
however , there is a unique fact in this kitchen that it is a visible display of the art of neoliberals .
&quot; it has gone a bit to design , &quot; explains the MDF spoiled in a stronger spouse of Erfan .
it has a counterweight , which makes it very simple to push for . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage , Joanne now has 16 additional metres , additional sleeping permission and a better flat plan .
&quot; after all , it is the sale of what you sell - or what gives value to property - &apos; that says Erfan &apos; .
&quot; the detention camp takes the form of an outmoded whim and makes calculations based on the surface area . &quot;
here they have been able to increase the navigability of the floor using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury status to the premises .
&apos;If materials are what you touched and thus help to build emotional links with your home , &apos; Erfan says .
&quot; you are not bent on electricity cables in pig .
it is important , but it is not a language @-@ friendly way of thinking . &quot;
it shows that good design and increased surface areas are helping to make something quite amazing from the normal corps .
in fact , they can do so entirely , as happened with Joanne .
Heromy , a key figure in Chicago &apos;s cloud heating , is a heacow competing with her fellow Member for a taste of service .
there is no question of the amount of money that is earned , without which ethics is forgotten .
she sees her wife and three children as a mere early @-@ day and late hour .
in the first part of the film , one feels like a speech from Mr Butler is the business world in the Kaardihouse - even in Spacey and Mr Butler &apos;s voice .
the further film , the less skilful element remains , and the moralising intention of film @-@ makers is becoming more and more apparent .
cancer is a key peasant disease experience .
a choice must now be made between professional and family life .
the poet who is singing from the profession makes fathers think in the major building power in Chicago about what is really important things , such as religion , charity , love ... , without even affecting the twin sectors .
after the third stole where a son opens a eye , it seems to feel that film @-@ makers have certainly been driven by the goal of getting a pump out of the pump , because even the most basic foolish viewer is unable to hold the tears back in the face of the suffering of a army @-@ sick boy .
if the son falls into the home and looks almost hopeless , the father will finally understand the moral morality of his work and work for a man who is seeking a charity .
now I am putting a strata on my own - if a film has a happy film , then I reward my discernment after the film coffee , if I am wrong , at least one surprise can be praised for at least one .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the icon will be removed from the place - when the spouse calls a sick person and the man will storm the corridor name in slow motion .
the baby has been breathed , however , and although his father has just lost his job , it is also proving to be positive , because there is now time to deal with the family .
I feel well , too - I can predict quite well the end of the American drama !
in truth , the film is well designed , all the elements are there .
you can , you can laugh , actors are good and there is a moral beauty : money is not the most important thing in life .
it is a very good film .
the new staff chief of Trup intends to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps Mr Kelly can do it .
he would then be the first .
Mr Politico writes that the new staff chief of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President Trumpin , including news , in the hope of redressing the overs .
a trial is available from Josh Dawseyi , a reporter ,
&quot; on his first day of office , he brought together senior staff members , John F. Kelly , the new chief of the White House , in the White House , to the White House , in the White House , which he intends to address the poor information of the Vatican into the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly said he needed to go through the information , either on paper or in meetings , because the President would do better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried and failed to track his media consumption .
President Trumpi &apos;s relationship with television dates decades behind and , even now that he is in the White House , his television viewing habits have not gone away .
&quot; if he was annoyed by the unfair media coverage , he was fairly excited in the prestigious exts he was engendered , &quot; said Sam Nunberg , the previous campaigner in February .
Politico tara Palmer wrote at the time that &quot; six former campaigners said that the key to driving behaviour on Trumpi Twitter is to ensure that his own media consumption also has a stable praise . &quot;
well .
the idea that the habits of using the Trumpi Twitter have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is a nonsense .
perhaps those campaigners will know something else that is not known by others of us as the promoters would have been even more acute without their interventions .
we probably never know about the remains that was not signed by Trump .
if he could rescue him a couple of times from the shakes , their efforts were worth doing that .
nobody has been able to prevent Trup from continually poleming .
part of the problem is that in the White House , which makes up competing clicks , people try to promote their own interests without exception by sending materials to the Truw , supporting their world view but always not trusting .
Politico , the whole story , wrote in May suspicious information to the President of the advisors about the propensity to feed .
one example of the report , quoted by reporter Shane Goldmacher , is :
&quot; today &apos;s and former Trup says that Trump can react to negative press , particularly infection with adverse effects , by exploding by taking root ideas on identifying the source .
this was the case at the end of February , when someone was lucky enough to give a copy of the webstream of information to the President , Charles C. The website to Johnson , Gots.Newcom , accusing the designer of staff officer , Katie Walshi , that he was the &apos; source of a series of information &apos; in a White House .
it is no difference that , because of slogans , Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter or offered no concrete evidence or has mischarges and withdrawn from Twitter in the past .
I read the article and asked the House about Walshi . &quot;
Goldmacher added that Reince Priebus , the top staff at that time , and Rob Porter , head of the White House , &quot; has tried to establish a system for managing and documentation documents that reaches Trumpin . &quot;
how was it ?
Mr Kelly will try to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than he was in the Priebt , but Trump will remain robust and will continue to compete for influence .
these immovable factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .
street musicians from abroad are not allowed to go on display .
there is a lot of expatriation in Tallinn City .
those with which the speaker spoke acknowledged that they would play in the old town without the permission of the government .
the first was found in the front line of Viru by three street musicians who had taken the same breadth .
it was clear that musicians with rubbish and smell @-@ waffers were in absentia , and that one duch would take the brunt .
despite being so , the only woman in the company played a fun story with a lame , while one man , alongside her , was in a conjuring with three faces in the Congress and brought the furthest winners closer .
the third man was sitting in his house alongside them and smoking the dirty @-@ prepared dig of dig himself .
their three chambers did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people that passed .
Bob , who had been comet with the flame and the ball , said he would be kissing in the streets for fun and money .
the explanation was designed to collect the ticket price at the same day in Finland on night .
whether they asked for permission for muscle in old areas was shaken by Noemi and Bob .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stay in one town for more than a day or a few days , and most of these will be granted permits for a month or such a month .
there is no point in paying , &quot; explained by Bob .
when we went back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later , we saw two women standing on the music side and walking them .
the team has copied luck at the crossroads of the Viru centre with copies and bags in absentia .
three Polish young men were also present on the Viru street , one playing the fence , another chat and the third had even passed the electronic glass curve .
&quot; we are here to entertain people to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living , &quot; explains the trio from the Mivosh .
in the words of Mivoshi , they are aware that there must be permission from the municipalities to speak .
&quot; we do not have it , of course , &quot; he said by joking .
but we hope that there will be no problem if people enjoy our music .
of course , if there is a police , we go elsewhere , but try it . &quot;
the Estonian bank purchased bonds worth € 4.36 billion in July under the Public Plan for Central Banks of the euro area ( BFA ) , the Central Bank &apos;s bonds portfolio .
the ECB will not publish detailed information on purchases .
Hardo Hansson , President of the Estonian Bank , has previously explained that the plan for the bank assets of the Eurosystem will include three separate purchasing programmes : covered bonds in the financial sector ( covered bonds ) , bonds backed by assets ( ABS ) and public debt bonds ( PSPP ) .
the Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage the reseller to invest elsewhere .
the impact of the purchase is driven by lower risk of asset generating and will act as a stimulus for investors to take on higher risks .
normally , in the framework of the public debt programme , each central bank buys its own government bonds , no buy bonds from other countries .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is making &quot; capitulation &quot; within the scope of the allocated capacity .
central banks also have to shop in those countries with limited debt to provide bonds to the purchasing scheme .
the Estonian Bank , while it confirms its determination , generally authorises the European institutions &apos; bonds , such as the European Financial Stability Facility and EIB bonds .
the Estonian bank will buy bonds under the early purchase programme from March 2015 .
in the meantime , bonds were also obtained in Elering , but bonds were no longer bought by the Estonian Central Bank from June 2016 .
both the Central Bank of Finland has been buying bonds from Estonia , for the sake of the central banks of the euro area since June .
Taskforce and month @-@ to @-@ year &quot; millions &quot;
some of the wealthiest owners of the West Midlands have returned to the rainy confrontation with the determined hard @-@ line tempers who have ignored the campus dirtired by the county to win back the bag from their cotton .
the migrants have booked 20 trailers on the path to a prosperous &quot; line &quot; along the streets of Solihulli .
they have returned to the army of horses , children and trucks after they were pulled out of the horse , children and trucks only in May , without being distracted by the degree dug to prevent their intervention by the Council .
the only group found weak levels of protection , by pulling its vehicles through the unblocked part of the poppy walker .
the people of furious hair have been contacted by Solihull councillor , saying that &apos; there is no use in addressing the problem &apos; .
a anonymous resident said : &apos; they moved to it on Monday evening after their withdrawal from Bentley Heath , where they were stoned by furnitors .
it is up to the Council to discredit them for taking action because they are useless in tackling the problem .
migrants were there in May , they were pushed to go and now they are back .
they came up with more , probably tonight . &quot;
she added : &apos; Birmingham councillors know how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect their parks .
I live on the strike and am not happy to continue to pay the full levy if the Council is not even able to prevent such a thing . &quot;
a local resident who also wished to stay anonymous said : &apos; it is ridiculous ; we saw the last of these travellers left , and a new offensive is already under way .
this time , the number has increased and even the horse has been shown in the ruins . &quot;
the Solihull Council said : &apos; we know that there is an unacceptable camp in the land close to the streetsbrook and we are working with the Police Service of Solihull ; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
it will be very helpful to gather evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling the figure 101 .
it will help to create a picture for the Court if we present the case . &quot;
the Weekend festival will be visited by Indrek Saar , among others , Minister for Culture , who is pleased that it has been possible to bring true world excellence to Estonia .
the question of why Weekend is so important to the protagonists at the Festival is answered by Saar that it should be asked from all those who are enjoying the full loudness of the three @-@ day festival .
he says , however , that real players in his area have arrived in the Gulf .
&quot; looking at the level of artists that has been able to be brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music jargon are brought home - often not in our body &apos; , the Minister of Culture speaks .
what are the artists attending the festival to speak most ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person and an old person of a faith is certainly one of the most experienced doctors , Armin van Buuren , who stood up last night .
his record has shown that all of us have been self @-@ driving at some point . &quot;
he will , however , mention a number of other names , such as Chainsmokers , Deadmau5 , Knifebi .
of course , our own Estonian players too : starting with NOJordanP and having a full range of them read .
in reality , it is very high in the concentration of names , &quot; says .

up to 850 000 diesel cars are among the critics of car manufacturers
the day before the Auti announcement , BMW said that it provides software applications for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of BMW , companies believe there is &quot; more intelligent alternatives than driving restrictions &quot; , referring to European cities , including the city of BMW , Munich , which has been considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce exhaust emissions from diesel engines .
no company described these as being re @-@ TIs .
European car manufacturers have been actively promoting diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
but nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is classified as carcinogenic and could cause asthma .
the cost of equipment to neutralise diesel emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing for car manufacturers , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German carmakers are under thorough investigation , the Federal Chancellor , Angela Merkel , is also accused of harshing out powerful automobile manufacturers and of ignoring signs pointing to a problem .
companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen , who quietly disquiced the use of so @-@ called hair devices , which made it possible to adapt emissions to the regulations when tests were carried out on the car , but were withdrawn under normal driving conditions .
several Heads of Volkswagen have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation from both sides of the Atlantic .
last month a former head of the Audi Thermonuclear unit , the Auvel Development Division , was arrested in Germany .
the former President , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and can be prosecuted in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was charged with a criminal investigation concerning Volkswagen in Germany , when the authorities accused the installation of an Audit System to circumvent European emissions performance requirements , thus extending the investigative effort , which had previously been concentrated in the United States .
the inclusion of the Auti in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen by a diesel manufacturer disproportionately generates a large proportion of the profits of Volkswagen .
the Estonian school will get EU flags for € 20 000 .
the Education Ministry intends to buy EU flags for the purpose of removing the Presidency by 1 September to the Estonian school .
overall , the EU &apos;s 570 educational institutions will receive a total of 105x158 sentimetres .
the flags are foreseen for exponder in indoor areas , which must be carried out in the home rooms of high quality printed techniques with an attestation , and the ERR news portal will be facilitated .
on a flag label , the text &apos; was arrested for mentioning the first presidency of the Estonian Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of the 570 pledges is € 20,000 in the Ministry of Education , with a single tie costing € 35 .
the journalist &apos;s murder highlights growing danger in Mexico
weekly newspaper Riodoce &apos;s staff are usually gathering on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the State of SSinaloa , sown crime , corrupt officials and incessant drug wars .
today , however , they have been gathering their own security under the guise of their personal tragedy .
they are told that it is important to change routine .
two old writers will discuss which seem safer : either to bring children to an office that was the target target for a personal attack in 2009 or to leave them home .
three words have been written by security experts to the top of the space : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask reporters to provide evidence of resistance to each piece of water , to give them impressions and insights .
the practice of being employed by the government or cartels is suspected of being a list of drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists who are hazardous to reporting the chaos in Mexico .
there are no spurms of violence , and the majority of these journalists are published in the country , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists , since the inauguration of President Enrique Pena 1980s in December 2012 , at least 25 089 journalists have been killed in a state of protection following attacks and threats , and seven have so far been killed in seven states .
the latest casualties include their performance and source of inspiration , Javier Valdez Cardenas co @-@ founder of Riodoce .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist , &quot; Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though his presence can be felt anywhere on the basis of the Salafranca prayer , a big average picture of the verge of the verge of the verse Wdezus , with a headline &apos; Justice &apos; and two 30ken reporter , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , bears T @-@ ärske , depicting his limire prizeal or a typical limorous pool .
Reporters will discuss a collective trauma , their nightmare , their dreams , their oblivion , their paranoia .
although a separate Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was created in 2010 to address the cases of journalists , only two cases have been brought to justice by the Committee on the Defence of FGM .
as with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders , which number thousands of murders , the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
the presence of Riodoce will continue to reflect the violence in Sinaloa , even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is more dangerous .
without data and justice on murderers , there is little benefit from the Ibarra meeting on security .
&quot; it &apos;s very good to waste our time in this meeting , &quot; says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , you will distrust everyone . &quot;
Valdez left in Culiacan , at the University of Riodoce , in Culiacan , on the morning of 15 May .
he managed to drive just a few quarters before two men suspended Mr Corolla , who was forced to leave the car and was shot 12 times , supposedly because of the name of the newspaper , which means , in translation , the &apos; twelve @-@ th river &apos; .
an armed man drove out in Valdez &apos;s car and made an accident near it .
Valdez was 50 years old .
she left her with her and two adults .
the images are circulating freely in Culiacan .
however , there is essentially a silence about Valdez .
since the last year of the Rzman arrest and the withdrawal of the United States in January , the Blue authorisation has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country , because the rivalries are fighting to fill a power vacuum .
it is no difference that in the streets of Sinaloa , a few people , or even several people , are suddenly shot up or the dead are grocked from the biquitous pathogen of drugs that is bigger than many homes .
let us not forget for a moment that the peace period indicates that only one cartel is in the hands of valuable ports and the maritime state with drug routes to the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the risks of his work , the co @-@ founder and chairman of Riodoce Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) feels terrified that he was unable to protect his friend &apos;s head .
he believes that two mistakes favoured slaughter .
the first was an interview with Damaso Lopeze , a cartel clique , competing with the Guzman poet , in February .
this piece of correspondence could also have been accompanied by suspected gang members buying all copies of the publication once they reached newspaper carcass .
the second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after a crackdown took place in another newspaper news , which reported the same story .
Valdez legalised itself in Mexico and abroad and is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had maintained for so long that his friends and colleagues had assumed he was in perpetual existence .
she worked as a veterreporter at the novels in 2003 , when she joined five colleagues to create Riodoce , selling 50 @-@ dollar departments .
Bojorquez said &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without touching on the drug problem &apos; .
the newspaper was up to date with its bolder and fair coverage , sales and advertising .
the cargoes were happy to issue rigorous studies without having to be censored and read by readers in print , which no one else could report .
eight years after the establishment of Riodoce , the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award won a newspaper for their Latin American reflections .
in the same year Valdez , the International Prize for Freedom of the Press ( AKK ) won the Valdez Prize for its courage to follow the Mexican drug addiction wherever it leads .
he openly admitted to be afraid .
&quot; I want to live , &quot; he said by hosting the AKP prize .
last October , in an interview with Rompeviento TV , he said in a speech that drug trafficking is a way of life in Shaspace .
&quot; our head is to take on the role of volunteering in a different role .
I do not want to ask what I did in the face of so many pressures , or why I did not talk about what is happening . &quot;
Riodoce collectives is a man of Valdez , a joyman who brains like madness , a friend who generously bred embatgence and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their routine .
he always weed his hat .
he went from the office to El Khadraoui &apos;s base and was always present on the same desk .
they are now asking whether he received a love of routine .
he has also asked them to question how best to do their job and stay in life .
&quot; they do not like the rigidity of their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing plates used to carry drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not be touched , &quot; said Bojorquez .
it results in strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ reliance even in the best time .
entrusting their instincts .
if it smell dubious , cold @-@ handed .
in the words of Andres Villarreal , the editor of Riodoce , the problem is that &apos; the odour can be cheated ... and so was that of Javier &apos; .
he and others are saying that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as they do not apply to the toxic combination of profit @-@ bearing smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials in Tamaulipad , Veracruz , Guerreiro or other states .
the landscape is changing all the time .
suddenly , in the space where Riodoce workers met for security training , mobile phones were not permitted ; a few days before , it was revealed that only a buttress sold to governments had been used to track journalists and activists in Mexico .
two police officers in front of the house sought relief from the 40 @-@ degree monthly pump , in the shadow of the pump .
the government has set up a special office for the holding of Riodoce in Culiacan &apos;s central neighbourhood , which is in the four regular buildings .
some reporters were quibbles about whether the 50 % of the police are in the pool of police officers whose governors themselves have been discredited as unreliable .
several months have passed since reporters have moved to mountain areas where controls are de facto drug gangs .
the Duodoce edition of this week addressed three key lectures .
one was the murder in Sinaloa of the former boxing @-@ legend Julio intolerance by Chavez venna .
in addition , they had an uncovered story of spending government money on the hometown of the governor .
and the chef group of people from Culiacan , which is located from the office of the Prosecutor &apos;s office , from one of the most expensive restaurants .
there was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened , so caution had to be exercised when it was time to write what everyone in the town knows , Mr Berlusconi is a habit of both drug traffickers and the authorities .
the film was reported in public documents as being registered with the names of a politician in power in the Revolutionary Party ( IRP ) , dominated by all policy levels almost throughout the previous century .
several IRP Governor have recently been accused of corruption with widespread coverage of cases .
the Villarline has asked the reporter to write previous incidents in the same place , including the way in which the son of Guzman , who wear the name El Chapman , escaped military broadcasts .
just a few months earlier , readers would have sought a copy of Valdez &apos;s body to get information on abductions from the best sources .
&quot; we would have known what happened previously , &quot; said a 46 @-@ year old village whose body @-@ building has served as a slogan for him , El Flaco .
&quot; all communication channels have now been cut off by our sources . &quot;
the Valdez office has become the space for bridges and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the editorial workers have become something they could never expect in the name of the activists of the press .
a few bridges were seized by Reporter Miriam Ramirez and next morning went to a local Public Prosecutor &apos;s office to protest for another journalist .
Mr Salvador was in the West of Michoacan State three days after Valdez was murdered .
the body has been burnt down and , according to the officials , it is in the DNA tests .
journalists across the country have become more audible and are crippling as organised protests to scorn and buildings the phrase &apos; SOS press &apos; .
on this day , President Bojorquez will be held in Washington in an attempt to gather international support for justice in Valdez .
the day after the death of Valdez in a meeting with the Sinaloa Governor accused the Ramirez authorities of revisiting and killing journalists for telling the truth .
he subsequently asked him to be diverted from government action , concerned that he had had had an impact on objectivity .
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were &apos; in step with &apos; beacon in the form of organised crime , complicity with national officials and a half @-@ hearted society &apos; .
in his latest book &apos; Drug press &apos; he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug trafficking but are also carried out at the behest of the political and security forces , who are in an organised crime treasure .
the media monitoring group Articulo 19 issued more than half of the attacks on the police and civil administrators last year .
&quot; in Mexico , because you want to be kept silent , &quot; Ramirez said .
the murder clearly has versatile effects .
nobody will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipasis six years ago .
she was found dead with a letter that had probably been signed by Carbo Bloom Zetas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
his funeral has been packed by computer glass and headphones .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as in the northern border state of El Norte , Chihuahuahuhuhua , following the murder of their correspondents Birslava B112h in March .
others will keep on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder in 2004 .
in 2010 , the headline &apos; What do you want of us &apos; was publicly presented by the Diario de Ciudad Juarez Penaesti on the editorial list .
some journalists have fled from their national states , or even from their country .
it is a nervous decision .
it is difficult to find work in the wrong direction and they still have to grab the streets to avoid risks .
and sometimes they are driven , as probably happened in the photograph Ruben Espinosa , murdered in one of the four women &apos;s places in Mexico in 2015 , three months after she was fleeing from Veracruz .
those who remain on the move have to refute risky decisions every day .
the Ibarra , who once wanted to become a poet , admits that he is terrified by reporting the narcotics trade .
Mexico is on the way to hell and so I will report , &quot; said .
at a midnight of a recent Friday , when the latest figure had already been sounded , Riodoce editors sat on the way to office and beer the batteries , suddenly starting to telephone on all phones .
19 people were reported to have died in fire @-@ fighting campaigns in Mazatlani , in the northern cantile town , which took place between rival gangs and security forces .
the war continued to equate , as were a number of messages from cartels found in the area .
in the same line , reporters uploaded the Riodoce site using a mobile phone .
a change was needed in the upcoming round .
another fire in the region was shipwrecked .
Bojorquez is on guard police officers to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not at least show it .
under a massive book book of the descendant , where the average finger of the holder is to be seen in the entirety of Sinaloia , the workers of Riodoce took on his trails .
&apos;Why can one think about closing &apos; , &apos; said Bojorquez , &apos; whereas on the same day Javier died , the trainee asked me to report to the streets ? &apos;
Dinosaur used a defence colour to avoid enemies
at first glance , it looks like a form , albeit rather scary .
scientists have now revealed the first findings of the unbelievable wave sizes discovered by Canadian minable cartoon numbers , which are so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; Lisa Mona added &apos; .
it has been so well preserved that it was even possible to recognise that the leather covered by his soomers was a red Brown hole and had a somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; past .
a reporter published in the Journal &quot; The best preserved soomy , &quot; once found &quot; and &quot; one of the best dinosaurf in the world &quot; described the term &quot; was the term &quot;
it is a new type of nodosaic living in the middle of a storm of 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
it was incredibly good to have it in rud for scientists who describe it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
this vegetarian , like soya , is the best preserved fossils ever discovered in the past , according to the National Geographic magazine .
on 21 March 2011 , Shawn Funk found it when he extracted Fort McMurray in the IND / NGL mine in Northern Albertas in Canada .
he has been struck by something that did not recall the surrounding stone and decided to look into it .
the Physium of Royal Tyrrell ulty was sent to the revealed .
the next six years were designed to expel the area of land from 2 500 ( 1 100 km ) .
after all this tremendous effort , the end result is now ready for the public to be brought to the end .
&quot; if you bent a little mind , you can almost believe she is sleeping , &quot; said Brown , the leader Royal Trell Musecide , where you bow to lies .
&quot; this will go down in science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurbias - Cork Mona Lisana . &quot;
he found in a skint that this vegetation worker covered by soybean and reminiscent of walking tank was likely to be significantly threatened by food dink .
this series of soya @-@ owned dinosaur used red and white forms of protection to be beaten by predators and applied a shadowing technique , which is described as a sham and is also used by many present @-@ day animals .
it allowed dinosaur to be absorbed better and the enemies to be prevented , as the major dinosaur probably found him to be hunt .
this presence of nodosaic , a population of 110 million years old , has come to the news for the first time and is now visited in the Royal Tyrrell Paleonchology Museum .
the reporters have now investigated and given the name to Borealopelta Marmitlor &apos;s museum , according to mark Mitchell , the famous team spent over 7 000 hours to uncover a demanding animal .
thanks to the astonishing good preservation of the father , Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the design .
they discovered a misfortune - a protective method in animal states - which means that the head of the mood was the dark than the lower .
although the buck is widespread , the findings come as a surprise , as Borealopeh is much greater than those that live today with unsacrosanct secrets .
it suggests that dinosaur hunting was sufficiently actively accompanied by other dindinosaurs of meat , that the evolution was preferred to overshadow the failure to oppose a failure to act as a means of survival .
however , most of the animals who use today &apos;s trauma - such as fears , skins or bars - are much smaller and more vulnerable to harvests , which suggest that nodosasaurus had to struggle to survive .
&quot; vigorous cooling of dinosaur pressure , covered by massive and high levels of soya , shows how dangerous the animals of dinosaur pressure could have been , &quot; Brown said .
chemical analysis of organic compounds of Soomseed also revealed that dinosaur was a red screen .
scientists will continue to explore to find indications of this life , including the content that remains in the warm form , in order to find out what the animal would be like for its last past .
they believe that dinosaur failed rivers , thus reaching the sea with a stream of wrestling over the ocean .
at that time , Albertas was the same soya as is the case now in the Eastern Floriquity , and rivers and oceans are likely to have been much further away to inland land than they are today .
&quot; this nodosainity is truly remarkable as it remains fully covered by soomy skin , while maintaining its original shape , &quot; Brown . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the animal today finds itself practically the same as the ages of krife .
there is not much imagination to be used to reconstruct it - simply to blend our eyes and it seems like a sleep . &quot;
the time for the crisis was when huge meat @-@ related dinosaurs - terogeneurs - who skate two feet .
although the Royal of Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta , it could be taken as a shot by some of his formidable predecessors .
these include the long and six tonnes of monster that is weighing , Acrocanthocontamination , 38 feet ( 11.5 metres ) .
scientists whose recent findings are published in the current Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta was drowned after death in the sea and this mutualist .
on 21 March 2011 , Shawn Funk discovered tenacity when he mined Fort McMurray in the Millenium mine in Northern Albertas in Canada .
it is the best preserved soomdindinosaur in the world , including skin and soomy , as the other way has said , and is complete in the form of a safety net .
these tentions were on average at 18 feet ( five metres ) and grew to GBP 3 000 ( 1300 kg ) .
two 20 customs layers emerged from this .
scientists believe that this vegetation fitted with soya will pass through the current Western Canada , while the river flooded into the open sea .
but the sequestration site at sea helped to preserve its finely detailed nature .
the coal residues of this particular father are so well preserved that the tidal boom of mythological someteries will continue to cover skin residues .
as Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic Journal : this is just as rare as a lotovictory .
the more I look at it , the more incredible it seems .
Stimulation remains a good @-@ house mythological button .
a better front line will be taken by him and five troops are picked up .
I can count the soya in his own backyard . &quot;
how did one activist answer the question &apos; whose streets ? &apos;
Brittany Ferrell was completely shocked on 9 August 2014 .
just days after travelling to New York , Louisi was on a dose rented via Airbus , on a Facebook line in Srings .
he got on to the post of his former school fellow Member .
it wrote : &apos; 18 year @-@ old juveniles have just been killed by the police and are still on the streets &apos; .
he was confused as to why nobody else had posted this information on his bed , leaving him on Facebook and opening Twitter .
the deloads of the user of TheePharoah were repeatedly transmitted in line with his own timetable .
the Stern from the Louam region was passed on in real time to the säda Michael Brown , the death of an unarmed , 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by a white officer in Fergusonis Missouris .
he has depicted the live body of Brown in the corner , leaving four hours .
&quot; it is crazy , &quot; thinking about the quotations by Mrs Ferreira .
but he and his community were not new .
he has taken off his phone , but later this evening saw the spark of the seizure of the people in Canfield in Drive .
Pictures of the police and shouting people and a man who claims to be in the hands of Brown and kept a label &apos; The Ferguson police killed just my unarmed boy ! &apos;
he looked on in real time a bed in which the police officer stood in front of the protest group with a grab .
in a second video , another police officer , he said he was guns and shellfish : &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
it is a reminder of how it was looking at the idea &apos; unusual . &apos;
&quot; this is not the murder of the kind with which we are accustomed and we could call a typical . &quot;
I felt atrocities at that time .
I was angry and huffed . &quot;
he booked a flight and went home the next day .
having buried at 23 o &apos;clock , he left her father with his six @-@ year @-@ old daughter and decided to travel to Ferguson next morning .
what happened to Ferrelli and Fergusonel over the next three years is a key issue in the new Whose street Information portal &apos; , &apos; whose streets are appearing in cinemas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and of love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who have responded by demanding .
if the ball , with a bull - who had a flower tag and a beat the beat with it - walked in the Ferguson , they again spoke about a subject that they had repeatedly talked about before this morning - the experience and living conditions of black people .
&apos;Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; he is reminding him of the question ?
&quot; we are now travelling to Fergusoni because an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy was killed by the police and it is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on , &quot; said Ms Ferrell later .
&quot; what is happening now is the culmination of past events .
it needs to know and see this and grow in the middle .
she must learn about the organisation and organisation of a body of different layers of musical experiences and living conditions , and what we need to do is to free ourselves and free ourselves .
even if I can bring him up without having to copy atrocious racism in person , some other black girls do not differ .
I feel sorry to do him if I were to defend him from the world . &quot;
the first suspension they made in the Ferguson was on the South Florissant - from a police station to a place of crossing the way , which had become a sort of camp plague where the activists were awaiting news from the police officer Darren Wilson , who was not ultimately charged .
the Copde and her daughter joined forces there with a local business owner who prepared the lunch .
they put together the food bags and helped to apportion them to protesters .
a new type of activist slowly took shape for the Ferrelli .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; said he , when he was a Missouri @-@ St. Louisi , was a student at the University of a student Association of Small educational pupils and focused on food fairness and health inequalities in the non @-@ performing communities .
&quot; I had no organisational experience .
it is all a flat . &quot;
after weeks , during a demonstrations , Mrs Ferrell met a co @-@ director of a film Sabaah Folayani at the time of an evening demonstration .
the prize was said by him and the film operator , Lucas Alvarado @-@ Farrar , just wanted to document what is going on .
the question that arose from the Ferrelli was : &apos; are you trying to document what is going on or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
this scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to profit from its efficacy and resilience .
the prize was explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voices of people born and born in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do so in a different way &apos; .
the prize had already been beaten by Damon Davin , a man in the region who was well @-@ known for a activist due to the sentence of death sentence .
his involvement made the project heated by Ferrelli and another six for the local communities that followed years after the shooting of Brown .
&quot; nobody is talking to us or speaking to us in this documentary film , &apos; said Davis .
&quot; it was important to me how these people are portrayed , because I am portrayed as being . &quot;
although not to focus on the experience of Ferrelli , it was intended to show that the movement was not about &apos; head of salvation but community unity &apos; , as the Folayman said , made it the most open film .
as a result , &apos; Whose street &apos; is a surprisingly personal aspect of the lives of Ferrelli , such as pardon and marriage with her wife .
&quot; I felt I was wrong , &quot; said Ms Ferrell , pouring over the first time he was ready to work on a town .
&quot; I have realised that there is a certain vulnerability to doing this and to humanising the black people . &quot;
moreover , the Ferrelli story highlights and puts the role of the black homosexual woman in the wider Black Alliance in Matter movement once more at the centre .
two of the three initiators of the movement who thought in the social media in 2012 of the hashtags # BlackLivesMatter , following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin , are gay .
&quot; women of black age in leading roles have kept movement across the board , &quot; said Ferrell , &quot; and this is because we have to fight on many fronts all the time .
women in Mustanac homosexuality must bear this burden . &quot;
the photo was agreed , noting that &quot; women really do live in black life and many of them are black homosexuals . &quot;
he says , however , &apos; This is not a kind of &apos; one @-@ way @-@ to @-@ go solution &apos; - that the film was not chosen as the focus of the film because of his identity .
&quot; he was the man who used to be right in the right energy , &quot; said .
&quot; however , it is no coincidence that he is on the frontline , because there is a lot at stake as a homosexual woman living in such novels .
he can be seen through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news camera from Fergusonel has disappeared a long time ago , but the relationship between the community and the police is still fragile .
the suspended suspended sentence for road blocking during the demonstration against Mr. Ferrell will last for another 2.5 years .
he describes the social policy climate in the area he calls home as a &apos; a huge threat to freedom &apos; .
it still considers the mantra that it has been eating since the time it took to the streets of Ferguson for a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our own freedom .
it is our responsibility to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing but our chains to lose . &quot;
7 factsheet to overcome pomelty after Weekt
some of the most stupid young people will find a cure after the metal wave , which is scarce , and help .
or the words &apos; avoid pomelhmell , stop broke &apos; .
but this is just the inevitable postponement and good health humour .
what can you do to better identify and overcome the poppil cycle after today and tomorrow - or any other day - in the morning ?
Joo Water
alcohol was under and after a great deal of pain in the morning ... or , if possible , in the form of alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it uses alcohol , it must somehow be recovered .
along with water , minerals are being dispersed from the body and the seine is good hair &apos;s mineral water .
it is particularly good , since the buck is often irritated after the metal has been burned , if it is not bubble or only easily billed .
let &apos;s walk .
it would certainly not cost the grandmother to go on to the bath - it could be fatal to mislead .
but a slight walking helps the body to recall what it is like to be alive .
Tsy smapping and potasy are a more time @-@ consuming way to get out .
slowly and cautiously put back the ruins of the body .
if you are already starting the test of overshooting yesterday , it is certainly not worth trying to charge a fat boat .
take the example of a new volume containing trawls to keep silent feet of the cage .
if health already suffers around the South , pulls , for example , could be tested .
a little later , there is a bit of commotion .
Extect
this diuphoria will relieve your body of the last water .
as has already been said , your friends have the water and the scale .
contribute to pain @-@ pituturon individuals .
if you can be painkiller on the evening to prevent pofmell , you must tackle not only alcohol but also alcohol but also the persephet or ibuprofus and lose the capacity .
this will lead to even more clothes of their pay and worse ones in the future .
moreover , there will be little time remaining painkiller in the body .
if you are painkiller this morning , you will do it with a blank fence - it will irritate your already dirtimed maze .
or if you are not a partner , you can do well .
it is about walking , but you cannot get your feet .
however , too much speed and extermination of the shop - a physical effort should be moderate during the pocket .
well done .
Sool with friends of the time , easy feeding and laughing amicably , both for himself and for others ( suffering ) .
the butcher and wife may not be allowed to dial , but they can certainly be more lax in their follow @-@ up .
it will once pass over the poker anyway !

a professor of the University of Northwestern and a university in Oxford are sought nationalized by the police , and have become suspects of a single Palestinian body with deadly paint wns of worship , from the Chicago luxury basket .
according to the Cook judicial documents , an arrest warrant of 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi and 56 years of Andrew Warlen was issued on Monday for arrest of the accused of first @-@ instance murder because of their alleged involvement in Trenton H. Cornell @-@ Durleu .
according to documents , the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Duranu died after repeated havow .
the body was found dead on 27 July , following a warning by the Chicago police station .
police officers received telephone calls and found a victim on arrival of the Grand Plaza Korterrand , whose body had several pipes .
according to officials , Cornell @-@ Duranu was recognised dead and researchers treat seating as murderer while the police actively search for two suspects .
since 2007 , the University of Northwester has been a co @-@ professor of microbiology and immunology .
in a statement sent as e @-@ publishing , Alan K. Cubbage , Vice @-@ President for Public Relations from the University of universities , said that the Laware has now been temporarily removed from employment and is prohibited from entering the town of Northwestern University .
&quot; this is now a criminal act being investigated by the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern will work with the investigators , &quot; said Cubbage .
Warren is senior assistant in the financial institution of Oxford .
a representative from the University and Somerville College said in a statement that e @-@ mail : &apos; we have been in touch with the British Police and ready to assist the US investigation authorities in any way possible &apos; .
moreover , the statement stated that the Warreni colleagues are appalled and wish to extradite themselves .
Anthony Guglielm , Head of the Police Department of Chicago , urges the authorities to give in to the authorities on suspicion .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are present , but we are more and more intensively defining their exact position , &quot; said Guglielm .
the fact is that the local , regional and national authorities are helping to seek suspects .
Guglielm said that the police received a telephone call from administrator of the Grand Plaza Korterrand , who had just received cryptic indications that something has happened in the chryptic apartment .
the police described a magic view .
it was stated by Guglielm that it was not clear whether the event was also on 27 July .
he said that the cameras would confirm the stay in the University of Lathemi and Warreni .
&quot; we believe that Professor Lathamil and victim had a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
the management of the Grand Plaza wrote to the inhabitants : &apos; the police are currently working to identify the clironology of events and the victim &apos;s background and are examining different motives , including the possibility of a family dispute &apos; .
companies to help your company avoid getting the next fairer
Mr Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ up company , but the poll was unhelpful .
the replies were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anonymity , some workers distrusted this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Errett , who is running an e @-@ commerce company called Madison Reed , which is selling hair products with 75 employees in San Francisco .
it therefore called non @-@ actors to the aid .
start @-@ ups on new types of human resources are starting to help businesses find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software with a clear purpose to measure employee involvement , they will enable companies to commit cells , target specific teams and demographic groups , offer anonymity to workers and a bull for complaints and , in some cases , allow empeers to bypass the level C managers and go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health but with Fitres for your company , &quot; asked Jim Barnet , co @-@ founder and CEO Birwood City at the start of the City of Glint , which software analytical tools use to measure employee participation .
in the three years he has used Glinti , a much better overview of what his workers think and feel .
in addition to app studies and dedicated consultations for certain teams , it provides a corporate soojusotalogue which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support , allowing them to identify the reasons .
companies have begun to realise that they need to stay informed about their working culture so as not to become the next Ublishman , which has been riots since the former employee published a blog describing a harassing environment in which those who dared to speak were penalised .
for start @-@ ups like Glint , there is a lucrative business perspective to have an overview .
global governance , regulation and conformity can be worth more than $ 118.7 billion according to the Let &apos;s speak of financial transaction statistics by 2020 , according to data on the Let &apos;s speak SANT .
the company in Colorado , which is based in Denveris Colorado , is responding to a clear and unsuitable conduct , and this year saw an interest and an increase in activity against the background of Uber &apos;s dubious reputation .
the Convercentil has almost 600 customers including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
Uber recently registered himself as a client .
like Glintki , targeted companies will be able to send customised incentives to sober , collect confidential answers in real time and look at problem areas in the heat maps .
it also provides anonymous nomatics enabling employees to report uncomfortable behaviour .
and where the executive leader is concerned , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion is entrusted to regulators , &quot; said Patrick Quinlan , founder and CEO of Convercenti .
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees ill or act unethically , it could face serious consequences , such as consumer boycotts , departures and court cases , even if regulators do not intervene .
Ruby Tuesday , restaurant , which has more than 25,000 employees in 500 sites , has used the Convergence Policy for over a year to ensure that employees know the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way to interact with the Corporate headquarters .
if an employee had to report a problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number for the corporation &apos;s headquarters or an email address , make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously .
this was often a daunting and uncomfortable process , said Mr Vitrano , General Adviser of Ruby Tuesday , who said he was not well advised to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , since the company uses the Convercenti , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices , which were not previously used by managers who operated in offices in other cities or states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I can get closer to a holistic 360 degree experience of workers , &quot; said Vitrano , who will head the Risk Management Group in Ruby @-@ Tuesday .
&quot; and we will defend our shareholders against legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Quinlan said that companies were much more serious in terms of ethical conduct , values and worker involvement in 2002 , in other words , after the audit company Arthur Andersen failed due to ethical infringement in the Enron scandal .
only when &apos; social media became coon @-@ garden &apos; did companies realise they cannot prevent their dirty bashers from being online openly .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service , taking charge of periodic remuneration by companies for the use of their products .
it is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been able to rely on both start @-@ ups .
in February , companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Capital financed USD 10 million , thereby raising the value of the capital collected at USD 47 million .
USD 10 million was invested in November by Bessemer Venture partners , increasing total company funding to USD 60 million .
such investments will come as no surprise if we consider the interconnectedness between businesses , cultures and venture capital .
more and more studies show that today &apos;s workers are waiting harder than before .
high salaries and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are merely stakes on the table .
workers want to feel accepted and valued and to devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy , feel they are heard and the work they do is reassuring , they are more committed to ensuring the success of their business , &quot; said Nina McQueen , Vice @-@ President LinkedInis , of the Labour Government , which uses both convergence and Glinti .
investors will earn their income if companies in their portfolio do well ; businesses will do well to have dedicated and involved staff .
if analytical tools from the third party allow a strengthening of the commitment and involvement of workers , it is no wonder that they will find support .
data on employee participation is important , as experts have said .
but this data is useless if there is nothing to follow @-@ up by the company .
in fact , if a company asks feedback from its employees , expectations of a change may arise .
and if changes do not happen quickly or at all , they may cause dissatisfaction and disorientate the involvement of workers .
&quot; when you ask about 4 000 proposals , you need to be ready for 4 000 conversations , &quot; said Mr Russell Raath , the President of the Consultative and Business Administration , who has seen companies fail to rely too much on data collection .
&apos;because , if things are not done , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
will you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
in the words of Erretti , a Dutch Regel , who is now carrying out six studies among the workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the Glinti case has been reported .
and after receiving feedback from workers frustrated by the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , it was able to reorganise several company crews and provide communication training to address the problems .
Ruby ures are collected for staff , however , and it is hoped that in the long term , this will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment from the industry known for the high turnover of its workforce .
&apos;If you are not committed to transparency , you lose people , &apos; said Vitrano .
&quot; if you lose people , you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you lose businesses . &quot;
the euro area celebrates a Baltic : income growth rate
while the 2008 crisis and trade concerns with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe , Bloomberg is writing a report from the European Central Bank , with reference to the report .
according to the Central Bank , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations since 1999 .
low debt , fast @-@ improving institutions and business and free market @-@ friendly policies are the main drivers of this success .
&quot; the Baltic States are among the few euro area countries with a significant convergence of EU average in terms of their GDP per capita , &quot;
although the objective is for the total economic output per capita to be more affluent to Western Europe , in 2015 the total output per capita of the Baltic economies was just 2 / 3 of the 15 national average , which was part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led the Baloyans to seek a better pay abroad .
while the European Central Bank sees Bali as a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic at all .
according to a recent Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies are doing well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , less than half of those surveyed thought this was about their economies .
NCAA Decision to cancel trends twice a day changes Brumes
it is almost 23 : 30 , if the football sworship stops at the very end of a new school snaping at the University of a team .
some of them have tightened their sleeves by revealing their lip @-@ up of the efforts of the first day of the September Camp .
for a large proportion of the team , these paint a paint from midday .
the participants in the courses will go back to study after a three @-@ hour trend to later on the collective family before returning to Wevman football at the next morning .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mora , Bruinsi treer , a little before he became Tuesday on Monday .
the NCAA decision to cancel trends twice a day to reduce the burden of players has actually led to longer days , at least until the end of the day , on Friday .
for this reason , the three first training sessions of UCLA were prompted at 7.15 : 00 to fit players into the already intensive timeline .
the move from two to two days a day means more of a trend : the start of the Bruinsi training camp was increased almost a week , compared to the previous season , and for the first time during the Mora six @-@ Westwoodi season , training sessions took place at the summer courses .
they will have an 18 trenches agenda until 20 August , before formal preparations begin for the opening game in Texas A against &amp; M in September .
Mr Mora says she is in favour of amending the USSR , although it adds another item to the tight schedule of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and it is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; and they will break themselves through this challenge ; they will work , they are wonderful young people .
I believe it is a real pleasure when we come on the table and have more time . &quot;
once the camp has been lifted , UCLA training will be closed , which is no easy task given a clear view of the proximity of the search and remotely located Centre for Luskin , a higher class hotel which has already been dispatched from the portal around the gates with football .
since this weekend , the functionaries of the hotel are occupied by the Bruys , but Mora admitted that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&apos;We are putting in place security measures &apos; said Mora .
&quot; this is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can dig and filter .
if you have a record on a training , you could do a good deal .
but we will use a security team there and at a seat of 8 .
we will do our best by using it .
I will not be very concerned about that .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the Association of Trade Forces , born in the centre , Savisaare @-@ Ivanova , the AKP @-@ trained Kristiina Ojuland and forced to withdraw from the ECB , seems to be at least the same as the local elections as the local elections , which have been created by the founding Trade Authority Election Union in Tallinn , which is to show the local elections , which is the same as the majority of the signatories who have been created by a party initiative .
however , the buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether enough frustrated voters will hold them all .
who will stay with Sadulia ?
if the support team of Edgar Savisaare reduced , it can anticipate events organised to honour the electoral union .
one member of the Council , some of the former and now the central party and many unknown faces - can this be the composition of the electoral federation ?
and can some of the Savisaare honest protagonists and sisters stand by for a nomination in Tallinn be looked at as the &apos; list of talent &apos; , led by corruption and corruption suspects , is becoming a reality ?
on the night of the mayors &apos; roofs of the municipality , a music fé in Russian plague involving the parent of the town of childrene ; and in every sense the primitive computer game in which the Prime Minister , Jüri Rata , must avoid the lomy and oraceur in the course of a trip - is the EPP seeking , for the first time , the votes of the 14th and 17th year @-@ old voters to be allowed by ballot boxes ?
we look forward to seeing other political parties thinking of a youth campaign .
if a viewer from Canal 2 or TV3 looks against a black rman instead of August &apos;s entertainment , two options will remain : to accept that in future only ETV , ETV2 , ETV + , Tallinn TV and Francece22 channels will be available for a TV operator for a period of 10 months , or to give up a TV operator in English .
there will probably also be those who will initially be happy to rejoice with free TV experience , but , at the end of the day , albeit reluctant , TV and advertisements .
Allearly music , a disgusting people and rubbish on the streets are the downside of almost every major musical plot .
if you do not want to play part in the charity , you do not want to find your homeland at home rather than just getting sick - and you can leave the place of sleeping to the polls for the amount they have paid .
Washington changes the Green Card rules
the media are cited by President Donald Trup , who said that a new US immigration plan , which changes the rules on the Green Card , is planned .
the plan foresees a reduction of the number of legal immigrants per year for 50 000 people , stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by Republics and supported by the President .
the draft law will be discussed in two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise salaries and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , because it will change the way that green cards are issued to citizens from other US countries .
the law will reduce red migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process will give the advantage to applicants who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills to benefit our economy , &quot; said Trump the US media outlets .
the young people of Siberia move to the country , pensioners back to the country .
Yevseyev Anat. continues to have a tradition of gold miners , famous guest along the former Maana River .
she works 140 km from home as an additional prisoner of the Maana , Kuvai , the driver of the underground plant .
it is tough work : 12 hours of work without rest periods two months and then only ten days at home and again .
Anatoli has seen gold only once in the three years worked .
&quot; there is a hard quit : when you go in , you will be checking hard to take no action and , going out , you will talk about Anatoli .
in the village of Haida , Mare Piho will speak local seto Jaani , who has spoken a great deal to him about the memory of his family in Siberia .
the archaic culture that has been preserved in the pig feed will also affect home @-@ pigs , as it is simply so shocking , is the most important sight of Piho Mare , who has studied the seals .
this year , his first trip to Siberia will be 30 years later .
he has been there 14 times in that time and has lived for one year .
how many people still came out to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th century to get land here ?
it is an unresolved issue .
I would suggest 8 000 .
I have taken this into consideration by the men who have myself thought of it .
it is difficult to say exactly that , because up to 30 people could have come in one group at the time , but the passport was given only to the man .
the passport was given to only one , but was children , nurses and female .
look at the extent of this territory here !
it was several times larger than historical Setomaa .
it was really needed to educate , manage in some way .
Greetings came here as peasants , but they got life because they got into areas not only farming but also the river ( palm parking ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New @-@ Petserb , many pigs went into operation at a later stage of the Krasnojarsk @-@ 45 city ( If it was set up by the Soviet authorities , Mr J. P. ) .
did the wall represent a majority of the population in the region at the time ?
yes , they were living in a bag .
in addition , the tradition of marriage and multi @-@ child marriage has been maintained for a long time .
seven to eight children in the family were normal .
how much is the Siberian Setode culture different and different from that of mother &apos;s setox ?
they are different , although it was brought here at the same time .
they brought a lot of popular ideas .
they did so themselves ( ideas of a nation ) , but always made a distinction , which was brought in and had been made here .
the traditional rigidity of seals was strongly affected by climate change , because the cold is here .
the modifications were made .
for example , meat in Setomaal was soled , but frozen here .
where are the villages of Siberian setods and what life life life lives there ? / graphics : Alari Paluots
the link with the mother country was strong in spirit , very important .
I feel that it will now return to Setumaa , will affect them .
the amazing stories have been heard by girls who have lived in families .
Piho is thinking of the people of the Estonian setode delegation who came to the Royal day at the beginning of July to the Royal Kingdom of Haida and lived in homes for four days - J. P .
it is a shock to what is here .
&quot; it is extremely easy to come and go away , because the city has a wonderful place : in the breadth and at the crossing points of the roads , &quot; says Reigo Tamm from Tapalt .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a lot of nature , sports and culture , and a pizza is available in every corner .
Tapa is a top @-@ throp town !
there is a small island along the River Two through the coast of the city , where the beach is used to walk the strings .
&quot; no rail window seems to be there , &quot; says Reigo .
those who are not afraid of the cold can swallow the river because the river is full of sources .
I have been there , you can !
a long @-@ distance , simple romantics can be considered and done - the flow of the river can be looked at and looked at in advance .
I , too , have been walking with my breeders there .
in addition to anything else , an abductor has been active in getting her batteries running through her three eyes : &apos; that place is in the town , nobody can come in any way if their stories are completed &apos; .
&quot; the carrowmasses will also provide a wonderful insight into Tapa , but there will also be health professionals who can run , heat and rob and now , for example , discgolf courses - golf courses have been made , can lend to sports , &quot; the Reigo is is head .
the old practitioners are , of course , in line with their own supermarket , but I have not yet got there .
obviously , Mr Grale Palace must be invited , because she has experienced a displaying game and has a chain .
I am sure he will lend me .
the current opernicism and Männić were indivisible during their childhood .
at least for hours .
there are many tears , disappointments and victories in my sporting life .
let alone broken rocks and skins .
&quot; the city as a whole is currently full of construction , all of it becomes unknown , &quot; Reigo Rejoins .
however , the old and tired building of Tapa is a very attractive place for oral discoveries .
I am pleased that my idea was adopted in 2012 by the head of R.A.M , in Meos , and that he had to make a book for the summer .
although the &apos; Aleksei Karenin &apos; theatre &apos;s time @-@ old theatre has just passed , on 11 August , the railway station is undergoing a &apos; Ellucinisation &apos; , while in an old old building , moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; 11 @-@ 13 August is the day in which the town of Tapa has not only encouraged open house cafes but also cultured cultural events , including in the form of a monastery , &quot; Reigo , who recommends a visit to a city from 9 to 9 in the space .
in the small yellow on 1 May pump , the museum is already 1994 .
&apos;The house is small , but there are a lot of misstatements and huge information &apos; , Reigo is praised in the place full of the history of the town of Tapa , most of which focuses on the railway and military .
Reigo mubale is that if you go through all recommended sites , you will have to go a long way , but fortunately the small town is full of coffee .
&quot; we have such good food places and sometimes the feeling that you are abroad when you sit on the breaders . &quot;
well trained and young soldiers from Tapale spend a lot of time in pubs , and the slot is a pitiful feeling of being in Estonia and in your home town , but there is a multinational body around .
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans .
we are going a lot , yes , there are soldiers !
two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering
television quoted from the Foreign Ministry , which reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tending .
on the morning of 1 August , the police arrested an illegal axis of the group in the Iberian Peninsula , including two Bulgarians .
they were released on the same day , but an investigation is taking place .
the Foreign Ministry told the television channel that the Bulgarian were later released .
the Greek authorities have stepped up the restrictions on free @-@ phone tending and are already imposing tough fines on anyone who is caught in a circumvented place that is not foreseen for doing so .
the sweep will continue throughout the season .
the court may impose fines , as the Ministry has said .
the wolf trees are breaking the wolf .
farmers in the soil need to give their herd &apos; teaching material &apos; to the junta again after the year &apos;s break - apparently the wolf @-@ grappers have already broken a lot of sheep .
this year , lamb in the idiot region has been burnt down three times , 23 sheep and eight pages have been wounded . Hiiu writes .
the figure was only three years earlier .
in the colony of Murdurs , the Environmental Agency also has reported that the wolf benches were not born in the soil in the Hik Country and that the button Board of Hips had the information that two wolf detergents had been fixed this year on the island .
on Monday night , the junta broke the twentieth anniversary of the 15 sheep in the village of Emvest Kabuna and injured 18 of the survivors .
in the morning of the morning of Wednesday , the wolf broke a sheep in the province of Reheselja and badly injured you who had to be the scene of an emergency killing .
clear rules on GMO treatment
the ground Department of the EU has sent a draft law on the release of GMOs into the EU &apos;s sphere of transport and plant protection product legislation .
the amendment to the law will eliminate the creation of a separate collection of data for both GM and operators , using a plant health register in the future .
in addition , GM crops operators will be changed from being obliged to have a prior arrangement with beekeeping agent in the requested radius .
although there are no GM crops at present in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence between GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this would be at least as long as the decision is not to declare Estonian GMO @-@ free , &quot; said Sigmar Suu Kyi , Head of the plant Health Department at the department of the Maaelutic Ministry .
&quot; however , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burdens of both the private and public sectors , &quot;
the draft law repeals provisions on the collection and treatment of GM crops in the form of a table of data and handling activities for GM crops in the GMO , lays down requirements for handling GM crops and for starting an economic activity .
specifically for beekeeping , GM crops are replaced by a mandatory obligation to inform beekeepers of the obligation to start growing GM crops by a commitment to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeepers before cultivation begins .
the draft law has been sent to Ministry of State Affairs for coordination .
all interested parties will have the opportunity to explore the draft information system and to submit their views to the world Department if they wish .
the proposed modifications will affect in particular those active in the plant farming sector , beekeepers and the farming profession .
only one GM crop - maize mon 810 - is allowed to be grown in the European Union , including in Estonia .
so far , no Estonian farmer has been interested in cultivating GM crops .
the reason is that there is no magic bullloton in Estonia , the European corn Media , which is resistant to mon 810 .
it has also been breeding its maize leaf for the southern regions , and it is not appropriate for our climate conditions in May .
in order to provide this certainty , the Beijing has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect pollution from potentially GM bodies in the seeds of various summer rape , maize and soya cultivated in Estonia .
the analysis of samples carried out showed that seeds were not included in a foreign wave and that the inquiry concluded that the seeds for seeds for rape , maize and soya varieties in Estonia were not accompanied by GMOs .
this is the case with the deliberate cultivation of GM crops in Estonia and with assurances that there was no accident contamination .
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United colbas Nemanja and Maticu , in the shape of &quot; genetic &quot;
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited in the form of Nemanja Maticu &quot; genetic &quot; after the chief player , Sampdoria , on Wednesday evening , was dissent .
in Dublin , in the last pre @-@ enrolment game of Unitedi in the previous authoritarian match of the Unitedi , the GBP 40 million from Chelsea , before the UEFA Super Cup on Tuesday in the rum in the exogeny , giving the impression of defence , while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to attack the carpet .
but , aside from the noble Asian site , Maticon was left with a badly needed match @-@ fixing and only had 45 minutes against , as Mrs Premier &apos;s father said , to improve the start of the baby &apos;s season .
&quot; he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genius thinking - he has football slogans , &quot; said Mourinho .
&quot; we will help it to achieve its normal form as soon as possible . &quot;
like the inexcuses at the Aviva stage , other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romeba and Mourinho began to put in place a man starting from their own ranks at the beginning of their season .
the Independent report this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football clubs , but he confirmed that the club had already done a &apos; excellent job &apos; by concluding contracts with three of four of its four priority options .
&quot; I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four &quot; he added .
&quot; I am even happier if they can deliver four things , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
another salt poet was beaten by a GSM accompanying on 1 August and this time in Muhus .
Mati Martinson , a poultry observer who lives in the breach , received the first baby @-@ patient in Shove , and the washing basin walks , has left the nest and joined the Grand Job Concert in the Bay of Mullutu .
this is because the voice of the islands is not productive .
on this Tuesday , rather late to snowy the sail , another pump was received by the accompanying person , on the island of Boy .
in fact , according to Martinson , the installation of accompanying workers is an international project headed by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojare .
one of the gold @-@ pog , Mati &apos;s character Sõrves , was stolen .
&quot; his activities are all online : he was in the wings of the winter in Spain , coming back for a long time at the German @-@ Polish border and then on the Saaremaa , &quot; said Martinson .
British inventor to install microchips in her body to get your house and car in hand
the first person in the country to be added a microchip to be able to open a line with a mere handful of people became an office and even start a car .
Steven Northam , aged 33 , has the pleasure of installing a small chips between his pöla and the captain , and is now providing this service to companies and individuals who want to make life easier through Bioq .
she has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards by a Royal hospital in Winchester , in Hanting Region , in Handes , in the Royal hospital in the county of Hampshire .
the technology is similar to that of the microchip fitted on cars and cogs , and only 30 seconds will be used for the procedure .
the Northam company also has a replacement of houses and cars to be compatible with ambaste , asking for a lump sum of GBP 300 .
this child &apos;s father in marriage has now installed technology at home and in BMW Z4 , which will be operational once she has a hand in the rostrum .
misleading house money to taxpayers
according to military documents published for the magazine , the decision to aeroplane a naval helicopter last month went to the southern horror taxpayer to cost USD 24 000 .
the Green and white colour Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , called the Marine One under the President &apos;s parity , was the centrepiece of the play of the US construction programme in White on 17 July .
senior officials from Mike Pence and the White House , President Donald Trump , reported on industrial products from all 50 states on their circulation .
a helicopter built at the Connecticut was rolled together with a champion of the Wisconham fire @-@ fighting car and Mississius .
according to the documents of the Escakar Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX @-@ 1 ) , who is responsible for the deployment of Helikopter , the Helicopter Concert , the Helicopter &apos;s office called the Prefrill of the Helicopter , requested a military office office for a cell cell cell cell cell office of the Helicopter , or FARGO , just 36 hours before the helicopter &apos;s &apos; extraordinary &apos; gold @-@ hub for the event was fun .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually highly @-@ focused event , &quot; said HMX @-@ 1 comandör a day before the event in an email to his chief , the leading officer of the naval base for the deputies in the aviation sector .
the message stated in the message that the helicopter will arrive on the southern horror at around 7 : 00 in a kick @-@ start event on 17 July morning and stay there until 18 and 21 o clock are cleared .
the added fact was that , should leaving the White House , you need a second ethos because of the limits of working time .
the initial flight crew were at helicopter during the event and the security team of the first camera remained near the aircraft throughout its entire terrain .
it was not possible to read out from documents given to the magazine whether a second epill was needed or not by the end of the hurricane .
the Hatchi law prohibits the use of government assets by the federal authorities for political ends .
the documents show that the HMX @-@ 1 study examined whether this could be compromised by this event .
&quot; we asked whether it was a violation of Hatchi law and we were told not to be in breach , &quot; wrote a commander .
&quot; it seems you have no choice , &apos; responded to the Deputy leading victim .
the White House announced the &apos; American &apos; official event and the Hatchi law would not have covered it .
there are , however , political undertones even at formal events .
the President supported the health reform efforts at the time in the Senate and praised attempts to keep government regulations under threat .
the use of a fleet known under the name Marine One or Air Force for political gain is not a new phenomenon .
the Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the need to use them as a pure photocopy is unusual .
the first campaign campaign in Floridas Melbourne was followed by a President &apos;s plane in February by a clicking on Twitter &apos;s account , and she is sending messages about how his predecessor used the plane .
&apos;The White Matel is very pleased with the designation of America &apos; where products were represented from 50 states produced by American workers from American materials &apos; , &apos; said Lindsay Walters , the press officer of the White House .
HMX @-@ 1 teams often test samples around Washington and the southern hemicycle to get to grips with the white house of the US President with a metre @-@ metre citing .
when the G20 was in place in Trump at the beginning of July in Germany , 58 tests were carried out at HMX @-@ 1 &apos;s White House levers .
the flight was included in the &quot; American &quot; flight manager &apos;s training standards for this year &apos;s study .
the helicopter of Eskar fly another 11 hours for &apos; presidential Support missions &apos; on that day .
no other disservice to this event , according to the White House , cried taxpayers &apos; purses .
according to Sikorsky &apos;s representative , the company was not involved in carrying out an expontor at the southern helicopter .
HMX @-@ 1 will not retain the budget documents of the President &apos;s flights and the precise costs of the event will be difficult to identify .
in contrast , the average price of the defence agency for the financial year 2017 is GBP 24 380 per flight hour .
the first office papers indicated a flight of 30 minutes from Virginio airport to both routes , from the main base of the flight .
the White House says that the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below the sum .
&quot; it is a misleading calculation of taxpayers &apos; costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates , &quot; said Wales .
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other irreversible costs which will be taken into account in the annual appropriations . &quot;
according to a study by the 2015 rostrum , staff costs are not covered by the Ministry of Defence , but they cover fuel , maintenance and contracts .
Sean Spicer , former spokesperson for the White House , defended the deployment of helicopter at that time .
&quot; this is about showing America &apos;s achievements this week , &quot; said Spicer .
&quot; I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security and that hundreds , if not thousands , of people whose work depends on it are expected to exist .
and I believe , just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked tirelessly on .
so it is right to highlight it , of course . &quot;
it is not clear whether Trump was exposed to helicopter in a southern factory , or not , but was sitting behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
in the White House , Trump Sikorsky addressed representatives , throwing out the media for jokes and company products in his own aircraft park .
&quot; I know Sikorski very well , &quot; the President said , &quot; I have three of their products . &quot;

one alcohol whose drinking is equivalent to &apos; training &apos; .
the Livestral movement writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is so big a wine fan that believes that wine can teach better than any other thing in the world .
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University .
it is not alcohol , it is not about how it affects our feelings and minds , but it is about the &apos; very active &apos; process of taste for wine .
by citing the glass , by beating the wine , enjoyment it and the ensuing perception , we are putting our brain on the job to create a taste for wine .
in the words of Sheperd , wine @-@ bearing bodies do not actually contain taste , but taste arises from the way the wine stimulates brain .
he sets a comparison between the way brain sees &apos; appetite &apos; .
&quot; taste is not wine , taste creates a taste for wine , &quot; Sheperd says .
things that still affect the appearance of a wine are , for example , the number of our age , our sex and even our heart that humans produce .
Sheper is of course in the impression that wine is not full of hair .
&quot; there must be more , says .
if you are too big a plague , the system has been overloaded .
excessive wine drinking can be damaged rather than the brain , with people running over three glass of wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity being exposed to a 2004 study .
10 % of ICT employees in Estonia get less salary than colleagues
data from the Perselection Company Fontes reveals that 10 % of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia are paid less than colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , and the portal Geenius writes .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in a teaching survey in the ICT sector .
8 577 posts were surveyed in total .
men have worked 63 % of posts .
&quot; although only 3 companies said that the pay gap is in favour of men and that there is no pay gap for the rest of companies , in reality , the average annual pay gap is 10 % higher than men &apos;s and the average annual salary for men is 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said Mrs Iljev Iljev Iljev .

the third and fourth levers have been confirmed by the stream and the first has already been produced by a clip , which spreads the chargeator with the new pawns .
in the third season , DEA will focus its attention on the most affluent organisation in the world , the Cal cartel .
they are running under the leadership of the four powerful Christian &apos; like Fortune 500 &apos; , simply with more bribery and violent actions on the part of the government .
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is Head of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) is leading the ties with Mexico and Chepe Sanpe Sansunlion London ( Pepe Rapazote ) in New York .

the role of women in democracy in Afghans political leadership says UN
on Wednesday , the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said that the elections can represent the people only if all members of society , including women , play a role .
the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , Nicholas Haysom , said that hundreds of women would stand for municipal councils , three women would stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; it is not possible to exaggerate the role of women by underlining the importance of women , &quot; said in a statement made on Wednesday .
the elections can represent a genuine people and can only be credible if women fully participate and participate in all phases of the electoral process .
the local council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have , for its part , threatened the electoral process , which coincides with a transitional period of advisory role for international military operations .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that the power is peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next .
women &apos;s strong role in Afghanistan is , as the genius has said , increasing the success of democracy .
according to the Independent Election Commission in Afghanistan , 1.2 million women are registered as the equivalent of 3.6 million registered voters .

a further aspect could be placed on a mother &apos;s seat , but the exercise offers fun to all children .

Silk wings to the heart of the world &apos;s mophile
Trapped copies are the summer class , which has in recent years become a piece of snuff in its own right , at the top of the hand , and which has been able to be accompanied by a flat @-@ rate label by traders , despite its modest origin .
a copy of thick bags is probably one of the things that has existed in life at the same time and which has not been aroused by much emotion .
it simply exists and , if it does not exist , there is no plague .
now the jump is taking a real kick @-@ start , and momophile bags have been replaced by their top @-@ top design bags for months , instead of simple beer @-@ red bags .
it is not just a coastal cluster , but it is also just as popular today as a street copy and even a bolder woman walks into office .
it is worth making it clear here whether the solemn speaking time is sitting in the Chamber or whether it is worth marking and pushing the laptop in a little more formal .
however , female love has been made by their discord .
for example , when reading foreign mopeds , the first thing is that mogurus people first claim to go on to the local market on holiday and acquire some beer bags , to which a full holiday is a priest and a single bearer , a market , and also a friend @-@ like career in the town .
some bloggers are so generous that buying houses from the market is selling larger limours or giving them to their loyal readers .
it is worth noting that there is so much demand for readers that women ( and men ) apparently go to each other in the world to become happy to take some of the bags .
in a sense , this madness is understandable , because it is these procedures that educate themselves when , in the mock of yesterday , it is possible to buy up a few tens of euros .
true , the rock traders have discovered a simple way of making money here , and so the boxes are selling off luxury tissues for a few hundred and -1000 euros .
perhaps it is not to be easy to feel as easy to get richer customers to get round some cheap bags .
for example , a dose of EUR 1 000 is to be bought by Dolce &amp; Gabbana .
however , 6 000 euro may be channelled out of a surgeon translation .
however , unlike most motor buildings , the outsourced feeds do not come out of a lot of great fun , but from a far more distant story .
indeed , the outsourced bags are said to be far from the Philippines , where they are wide @-@ ranging .
Trapping from a bunch of trains is particularly an export business and very often does not see them all round .
it is said that the 14th century is a flowing form of flowering technology and it is quite a series of flames .
however , because the beer does not have to be red as hard as the basket , they can be labelled and other materials that make the cocktail more attractive and , by extension , more acoustic .
for example , there are particularly trendy bags in recent times , with red papery or skins .
however , in particular , the devil can send a beer to Jane Birkini whose greatest red beer beer was not seen before .
she has adapted the beer to any possible set of clothing and even had to go to the Cannes Film Festival .
but , in the popularity of the willing , today , it is not a minor role that is the next word of care , and , unlike all the summer centres , they are not required to care with special funds , but to do the water and target .
as always with the trends , there are all sorts of interpretations , in addition to classical appearance , brands .
for example , red cheese or a tiny tiny swimp can be obtained if you wish .
it is worth remembering , however , that a classic beer will never be a mouse , while a brewery fuel does not .
but what is the classic beer &apos;s affair ?
for centuries , a bunch of beer red in a breath of rubber @-@ snatching has been classified as &quot; strained &quot; and is easily open and short , not without reproach , whistle .

GMB concerns investment at McVitie &apos;s Glasgow plant
the Trade Union is waiting for mature generation managers in McVitie to be reassured of long @-@ term production plans at the Glasgow plant .
in the words of GMB Scotland , the company has remained silent on the future of the NHS investment .
in a field where Hobnolid and rich know about cookies and other products , more than 500 people work .
McVitie &apos;s owner , Pladi , said they had invested over £ 5 million over the last few years .
it has employed staff and trade union chairs &apos; are the first ones to hear &apos; if something changes in the operation of a plant .
in a letter to the company &apos;s leader , GMB addressed the McVitie company &apos;s concerns with the lack of funding to upgrade production lines .
the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the site on the business needs of customs and the future investment plan is a cause for serious concern for our Members .
several generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely made up of people from the local community and the Glasgow community , a pillar indispensable for decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social housing .
so in the face of the dramatic growth in employment , salary and welfare in the eastern Glasgow , and the very high @-@ growth McVitie company in the face of the decline in living costs and production . &quot;
the design representative said : &apos; the Director of the customs crosses was received from GMB Scotton only yesterday and the company replies directly to him because we value active interaction with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , a regular meeting between the workers and representatives of GMB was held in customs and openly debated a number of issues .
we then discussed with the workers that , like all other companies that are extremely competitive and in a precarious economic climate , we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years we have invested over £ 5 million in the Customs crossing , most of which has gone into production lines and improvements of operations .
we fully understand the legacy of customs as a production site and , if there is any change in the site &apos;s activities , the first employee and trade union representatives will hear about it . &quot;
did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago of being sympathetic to the Neyeding State ?
la liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not give up in the attempt to attract Neyts to their ranks by making a USD 189 million offer to evade him , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record March ?
this hard @-@ headed approach has opened the summer to a transitional window , and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the current world record of double the purchase that was erected in the previous season by returning Paul Pogba to Manchester Uniteus GBP 89 million .
once the changeover is completed , the Neymark will thus become the most expensive player in the world and also the most highly remunerated professional global player , with over GBP 500 000 per week to pay after the contributions from the PSG .
Barcelona is also a hint , as a result of the approach and the breaking down of Neymar , but the source of the Catalansan Executive confirms that the club has always been best off for football since its arrival in Santotou in 2013 .
but did the President in the PSG warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manchester City grew out of an interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuka in 2014 , Mr Al @-@ Khelaif warned in a tough way against all clubs thinking about recruiting some of their best @-@ performing retailers in the PSG .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that if they are dealing with some of our players we will stand up to them and contact their players , &quot; al @-@ Khelaif said .
&quot; we honour all clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this border , as the Spanish club had previously shown interest in Marco Verratti , the central player of PSG this summer .
the PSG made it clear that it would not be allowed to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could be counterproductive in this interest by removing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymark .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Brex .
&quot; Brex faces a serious disturbance between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned early on a first visit to Northern Ireland since its entry into force in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it &quot; she added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible to move freely to the current people and goods , says Varadkar .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; she emphasised .
he would prefer Britain to stay part of the European Union , and as it is not , he would be part of the European common market .
it would preserve the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the UK .
another chance to make Britain &apos;s exit smoother would be the creation of a European Union @-@ United Kingdom Customs Union , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that there was such an agreement with Turkey , the Varadkar said : &apos; surely we could have that with Britain &apos; .
an alternative to this would be to return to customs points declaring historical separation and political failure .
&quot; bring trade , prosperity and peace , &quot; said the Irish Prime Minister .
she called Brexitit &apos; a challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that the outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland &apos;s everyday life .
the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the Northern Irish parties in Belfast .
Avand , through her first quasi @-@ long marathon March : Ironman can pass through everyone .
today , the capital city of Otepääl was the largest triathonic priest in the Baltic , while around a thousand triathles were in excess of thirty countries on a semi @-@ 8th contest .
70.3 miles of detillation consisted of 1.9 km of swimming , 90 km of cycling and 21,1 km of cycling .
the first trialogue also gave a successful outcome to the note Avand .
&quot; I thought it would be difficult and difficult at last , &quot; saying Avand Avunši .
despite the complexity , Avand said that almost everyone is in fact at the end of the triathon .
&apos;not disgusting , but kills &apos; , says , suggesting that at a feasible rate , one can almost every man gets to the finish .
except Ott Sepp , &apos; everything is fine but , unfortunately , he cannot swallow &apos; .
Avmud had already made a mockery in February .
initially 4 @-@ 5 hours a week , ten hours a week later .
time 05 : 34 : 12 , he got 27th in overall terms .
while Avand lost both to Raio Piiror ( time 04 : 59 : 53 ) and Jürgen Ligi ( time from 05 : 06 : 37 ) , she won other so @-@ called &apos; prominent class &apos; .
Tanel Padar , a good example of the past year , lost her life in seven minutes to Avanti ( time : 05 : 05 : 54 ) , journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes ( time 05 : 50 : 23 ) , Kalev Krrev and Raivo E. Tamm ( approximately one hour ( time : 31 : 53 ; 06 : 53 ; and 06 : 45 : 18 ) .
the total winner of the count for men in the Ironman basin , in Otepää , was Sir Johannes Moldan Rodan time 3 : 58 : 27 Estonians were the best Ivo Greasen 04 : 14 : 09 .
in women , the Danes Helle Frederiksen heralded 04 : 24 : 01 , while Maria Jänese , who lost Frederiksen almost half a hour and was then 04 : 58 : 58 .
Avand passed through a 42 @-@ minute flood concoction of 1.9 km and 14 seconds .
he stood out in 410th positions .
