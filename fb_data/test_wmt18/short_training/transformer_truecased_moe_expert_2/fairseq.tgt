four members of the Cape Verde Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to Mr Posselt , in Spain , the so @-@ called Chairman of the group of Cape Verde , S@@ lava Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch , who is known in the criminal world as S@@ lava K@@ eme@@ ro@@ v@@ ski , was detained by the police .
Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ vi@@ ch , held in Spain , was arrested by a court .
yesterday , the Court also held three arrest warrants in Estonia .
it is suspected that these are members of the so @-@ called Communist Association aged between 27 and 57 , who commit mainly drug @-@ related crimes .
the alleged head of the criminal organisation of the M@@ ala province of Spain , Mi@@ ja@@ v , was detained .
three men were arrested as a suspect in Estonia , one of which is collected according to criminal organisation and two are members of the criminal organisation .
the data collected indicates a clear division of roles and roles in the criminal community .
the criminal community was committed to tackling drug crime and thereby generating criminal proceeds , &quot; commented DG I@@ OM , P@@ ref@@ ec@@ tor Va@@ hur Ver@@ te .
&quot; we will not rule out an increase in the circle of suspects in this criminal case , &quot; added the Public Prosecutor .
these are people who have been interested in law enforcement in the past , and some have been punished for drug crime .
she stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high on the agenda throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of the cooperation , &quot;
the head of the inter @-@ criminal police service , ago Le@@ is , said that nearly one and a half years of preliminary investigation had preceded the de@@ ten@@ tions .
&quot; in the first half of the week , we had a long time in life and we had the same conviction for crimes in Estonia and Spain . &quot;
in the Le@@ is , central criminal police officers were helped in detention in Spain .
we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civil guard force for years .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are yet another message to the perpetrators that we can get them from the other side of Europe . &quot;
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that those suspected of being present can continue to commit new crimes , and the prosecution office requested their arrest and approved by the court .
a man arrested in Spain is waiting for his transfer to Estonia .
in this case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation .
the preliminary proceedings of the Criminal Court are conducted by organised crime officers of central criminal justice authorities and are led by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
in 2005 S@@ lava Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch was charged with blackmail and sentenced to 5 years in imprisonment by the City Court of Tallinn .
in the midst of the previous decade , the Al@@ le@@ vit@@ v was thought to be the second man in the world after the then Man@@ eri@@ or T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch from Cape Verde has highlighted Estonian co @-@ stimul@@ i in the early 1990s when he started to tackle blackmail in Tallinn .
he allegedly taxed tax@@ i drivers and prostitu@@ tes at different ho@@ tels and ordered monthly ro@@ of@@ s on business@@ men .
international joint operations , confiscation of proceeds of crime and the entry into force of court decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for instance , the latest court rulings , the eight indic@@ tees of the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ activist criminal association , who were confis@@ cated on criminal proceeds , or the sentence against nine individuals in 2006 , were created by Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v , a criminal organisation aimed at illegal trade in counterfeit cigarettes and committing crimes against human trafficking in East Vir@@ u@@ maa and southern Estonia .
it has a value of nearly â‚¬ 71 500 in criminal income .
in these criminal cases , the evidence and evidence are being communicated daily by police officers with foreign colleagues and , if necessary , acts together in any European Union country .
civil Rights group war@@ ns against Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ tic travel
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ cement of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ ACP ) has warned the people of Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ al air condi@@ tioning against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state .
the group statement states : &apos; an NA@@ ACP travel margin issued for the State of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i valid until 28 August 2017 calls on all a@@ American travellers , visitors and sou@@ the@@ ast to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the state , given the range of suspi@@ cious race @-@ related events which have been carried out in recent times and also made out by the State &apos; .
NA@@ ACP said that it was encouraged to issue a travel warning both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ n law , which makes it more difficult to obtain cases of discrimination , and the fact that minorities are disproportionately targeted by the state &apos;s law enforcement .
&quot; people &apos;s rights are violated .
they are hun@@ ted on the back of their sk@@ in colour , beaten or killed , &quot; said R@@ od Cha@@ pel , President of NA@@ ACP Mis@@ s@@ our , for The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints . &quot;
it is the first warning issued by an organisation of a US state .
the group referred to events such as racial insul@@ ts against black students in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of S@@ and@@ ers , the 28 @-@ year old black bo@@ y from T@@ en@@ nes@@ see .
S@@ and@@ ers died in suspi@@ cious circumstances at the beginning of this year after having been locked up in li@@ zing through the state and seized into custody by the Mis@@ s@@ our police without being charged with the crime .
in addition , a recent report drafted by the Chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our indicates that the cars of black drivers are likely to be hal@@ ted in the state by 75 % more likely than pri@@ es@@ ts .
&quot; the comment is intended to make people aware and to warn their families , friends and collabor@@ ators about what could happen in Mis@@ s@@ our , &quot; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it means taking money away from the top of the day or informing their relatives about the state . &quot;
according to the latest information from the programme for information on hate crime in F@@ B@@ I , 100 hate crime cases were recorded in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ a in 2015 , placing the state in a cross @-@ section 16@@ th place in the state in terms of similar offences .
travel warning is also a response to the new Mis@@ s@@ our law , making it difficult to refer the company to court for reasons of discrimination in the search for housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( LA@@ EC ) , which had previously issued travel concerns for T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona following the adoption by these states of immigration laws obli@@ ging local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences , as AC@@ L@@ U says it will increase racial profiling .
the external Ministry usually issues out against other countries , but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain US @-@ related laws and trends .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what about the different forms of this difficult disease could anyone know ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or li@@ ver , may be caused by a combination of five different diseases : A , B , C , D and E he@@ pati@@ tis .
all these vir@@ uses are a sharp bur@@ ner of li@@ ver .
however , the cost of bad is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B and C , which can develop into a cir@@ r@@ ho@@ p , the qu@@ ac@@ ri@@ mon@@ i@@ um and the cost of the li@@ ver .
the he@@ in@@ ous he@@ pati@@ tis disease phenomenon is the same for all types of li@@ ver - p@@ ound , ti@@ dal , ti@@ mo@@ rous , o@@ il@@ seed , s@@ oul , s@@ oul , r@@ ally , s@@ ands , horse , grey emissions , dark horse mackerel , meat and li@@ mo@@ us@@ ness , and meat and mass mass stra@@ w@@ oods .
the last disease is also the fol@@ k name of y@@ el@@ low disease .
they can undergo he@@ pati@@ tis without any disease .
different species of the ma@@ in@@ ary can only be identified on the basis of laboratory study data .
B@@ esi@@ ver he@@ pati@@ tis can pass on to chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and run for decades without disease , meaning that people may not know about their harmful li@@ ver disease .
the audi@@ o Ku@@ tsa@@ r highlights different forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and details their conduct .
one he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread from a sick to a human being and infections us in the feeding of contaminated food or drinking water , sex , be@@ ach and be@@ ac@@ on to humans , food , soil , objects , sugar , and drug consumption .
a he@@ pati@@ tis was the family and carers of the disease , people suffering from chronic li@@ ver diseases , sex offenders with infected people , sex men with men , drug addi@@ cts , he@@ pati@@ tis high , travellers visiting countries .
vaccination can be prevented , in particular , by recommending vaccination for people travelling to a large number of people at risk of he@@ pati@@ tis A .
in addition , it is important to meet the hygiene requirements on a daily basis : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands before using food to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading to patients when they are exposed to the blood , when they are exposed to drugs , in pregnancy , in pregnancy , in pregnancy , in pregnancy , in pregnancy , in pregnancy , in adul@@ tera@@ ted pregnancy , in adul@@ tera@@ ted conditions , in adul@@ tera@@ tion with he@@ pati@@ tis and in ch@@ pati@@ tis suff@@ e@@ rer fo@@ e@@ rer / dis@@ hes .
the he@@ pati@@ tis disease risk @-@ prone drug addi@@ cts , sex partners of infected people , sex men with men sex sex sex with honey , new born babies of infected mother , hospital family members and carers , health care , personnel and police officers , and travellers visiting high @-@ mor@@ te@@ m @-@ mor@@ te@@ m countries with a blood and other body flu@@ ids .
in addition to the chronic disease , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes are recommended , it is particularly recommended to vacc@@ in@@ ate people at risk and to vacc@@ in@@ ate persons with a high level .
other preventive measures include avoiding the use of alien and man@@ y@@ pl@@ y@@ te tools , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ gic @-@ ch@@ ro@@ sis , ab@@ y@@ tation and honour donation , and use of con@@ dom in dangerous mix@@ tures or the prevention of sexual risk @-@ taking .
vaccination against pati@@ tis b is part of the National immun@@ isation Scheme and free of charge for children in Estonia .
He@@ pati@@ tis C mix@@ tures are spreading to patients when they face the blood of their illness , to in@@ ject drugs , to fine harves@@ ting , to h@@ ire h@@ our@@ ly dis@@ hes , to use blood @-@ contaminated di@@ r@@ ings , to sex with he@@ pati@@ tis , and to b@@ read@@ ter fo@@ e@@ tal fo@@ e@@ tal / inf@@ anti@@ qu@@ ity .
the he@@ pati@@ tis he@@ in@@ age group includes in@@ st@@ in@@ stone drug addi@@ cts , sex partners of infected people , sex men with men sex sex sex with honey , new HIV syn@@ di@@ cates , sick family members and carers , health care , workers and rescu@@ ers , HIV infections and high @-@ health health @-@ borne travellers and travellers visiting countries with he@@ pati@@ tis C high diseases .
he@@ pati@@ tis C preventive measure is : refrain from using non @-@ ex@@ otic hygiene and man@@ ic@@ y@@ l tools , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ gic @-@ ch@@ ro@@ sis , ab@@ y@@ ard care and honour donation , and use of con@@ dom in dangerous mix@@ tures of infection .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
He@@ pati@@ tis D is causing he@@ pati@@ tis , which is ac@@ u@@ tely contained in the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
as a result , there are he@@ pati@@ tis D , with he@@ pati@@ tis B or he@@ pati@@ tis B as super@@ inf@@ lated .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses are spreading in exposure to blood and other body flu@@ ids , contaminated with sy@@ stal@@ gic ven@@ tures , sexu@@ ally and rarely infected animals .
He@@ pati@@ tis at risk is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B and non @-@ immun@@ e from he@@ pati@@ tis B .
vaccination with he@@ pati@@ tis B is an effective preventive action which also protects humans from he@@ pati@@ tis D virus infection .
the e @-@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading fe@@ eds on drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , donation with collective heart and infected animals .
travellers can be infected with he@@ pati@@ tis E in high health @-@ condition countries .
the measures to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis are hygiene requirements : was@@ hing or dis@@ infec@@ ting hands after coping in a ro@@ d , before eating and c@@ oo@@ king , after care for a patient .
F@@ ru@@ its and vegetables are laun@@ dered before consumption , not to eat little heat , fish or se@@ af@@ ood , to keep safe drinking water and to avoid drug consumption .
although the last round was launched by competitors to throw out four Olympic winners , F@@ ara@@ h , 34 years old , found power in the final row and won 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
the F@@ ara@@ h did not think long , taking the lion to the lion &apos;s seat , T@@ ania and children , after the fin@@ i@@ val .
it was a particular moment for me .
I am very much impressed by my family .
they were wonderful &quot; said to the press .
F@@ ara@@ h is targeting the gol@@ den heading of the 5 000 @-@ 10 000 @-@ me@@ tre street in London .
everything is possible if it is believed .
despite the title , Mrs O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor@@ i &apos;s &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , the G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t &apos;s mas@@ ter@@ piece of the portal , the book of A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer , is tri@@ ggering a splendid story of a work of art , far deeper from the birth of a Catholic works to the 20th century and the early 20th century in Vienna .
but in more depth , history .
a le@@ th@@ al information on the car would have the effect of cutting the clo@@ thes , and a more limited topic could be taken from the book book book allowed in the title to more influence the extraordinary story .
currently , two books , like the one in the bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ t and his pain@@ ting in Da@@ am gold , are the case of A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , and a much larger and more comprehensive newspaper accoun@@ tant from the distinguished Jewish families and the German occupation with its follow @-@ up effects in Austria .
the first third of the book is in the middle of a w@@ ed@@ ding Vienna cultural life and who himself inva@@ ded the Austrian capital , can hardly imagine how , over a hundred years ago , he went around life around R@@ us@@ st@@ ras@@ s or the Cen@@ tr@@ ali ca@@ ke , all the heads turned when he came into the customer .
the concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the rich@@ est cities of Europe and seemed to have seemed more cul@@ turally famous for the name that we know in the book .
yet , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a city where the pi@@ le of in@@ treatment and the highest levels of su@@ ici@@ des in Europe is as if nothing was done to develop .
or perhaps , each individual wal@@ king of a fair portfolio adds colour to the cultural life in Vienna at the start of the 20th century .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century Jews had explo@@ ded in Vienna , making themselves the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
almost one in ten was a Jewish .
visitors were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time the hel@@ ple@@ ss for A@@ dele was twice as opening the door to the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ di Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ h and Kli@@ m@@ t for his famous pain@@ ting , his bank had already become the seventh largest bank in H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg &apos;s E@@ mp@@ ire .
but the whole life of the gla@@ di@@ er , where he was famous , was not taken in .
if you look at &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; , you cannot believe that it was the great Soci@@ alism that has been infected towards the end of life and dre@@ am@@ t of travelling to the Soviet Union .
in 19@@ 0@@ 3 , when Fer@@ din@@ ja B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his wife &apos;s ath@@ le@@ te from Kli@@ m@@ tis , the last moment &apos;s com@@ man@@ der in Vienna was a pa@@ ge@@ ant driver .
the cli@@ m@@ t ordered a price of 4 000 kro@@ ons at the time , a quarter of the good location .
the fact that a few mar@@ bles were suspected of a mo@@ ped by a master &apos;s mo@@ use was not discoura@@ ged by sugar mag@@ na@@ te .
as far as the brain is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship that has been established in the course of the work with the ar@@ tist continued to life .
Anne @-@ Marie O Con@@ nor - Da@@ am gold
G@@ em@@ t Kli@@ m@@ t , a special story for A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , &quot; Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , Al@@ do R@@ and@@ maa translated from English .
just before the start of the work with A@@ dele@@ ta , the Kli@@ m@@ t had been in San V@@ ita@@ le , and the researchers believe that it was there that the artificial initiative of the em@@ is@@ b@@ li@@ b@@ ant eg@@ na The@@ o@@ dor@@ a was to make a gol@@ den Por@@ t of A@@ dele@@ n as a mo@@ sa@@ ic .
the customer was presented in D@@ am gold in Vienna in 19@@ 08 and at around the same time ( 19@@ 07 @-@ 19@@ 08 ) was born in another gol@@ den land called &quot; S@@ vel@@ lus . &quot;
the simil@@ arity of two women was not detected by artists .
what is Hitler &apos;s story ?
&quot; I think I owe him to make his hand to the public , to remember my friend Kli@@ m@@ t , &quot; wrote to him B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer a few years after she left the ar@@ tist ( Kli@@ m@@ t died in February 19@@ 18 ) to the Director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere M@@ use@@ um and wanted to see their family Kli@@ m@@ h@@ us go to M@@ use@@ um .
six years before the death , a Ph@@ D was a peer @-@ to @-@ peer basis .
she also requested that her spo@@ use retain two sports courses and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ tis to Austrian Gal@@ men in February 19@@ 25 .
she wrote to Mari@@ ale and Lu@@ is .
one year after the customer had finished &quot; Austrian Mon@@ a lisa &quot; the attempt to access the 18@@ ine arts in A@@ ka@@ de@@ mine had been made by Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , 17 years old , but failed by the drawing period .
although Hitler &apos;s late anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is sometimes considered to be the result of not receiving her into the A@@ ca@@ de@@ my by Jewish profes@@ sors , not a single person really was a ha@@ ir of his ex@@ cus@@ es .
in any case , the Austrian Gal@@ eri@@ er mission , referred to in Maria testa@@ ment , had changed considerably in 19@@ 39 , had become a major factor in finding decent work from Vienna &apos;s rich Jewish arts .
some of the work of the Hitler &apos;s personal artistic wealth was also b@@ red at home by some of the work of the people of the Kli@@ m@@ t .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the murder of the Naz@@ is , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old legal dispute between the Austrian Government and the he@@ irs of B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ dis began .
I should point out at this point that if the &apos; S@@ no@@ vel@@ anism &apos; sees Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere in Vienna , the Da@@ ami gold , described by A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer , must be looked at New York &apos;s Ne@@ ue Gal@@ eri@@ i .
and I will read the aforementioned book before Vienna .
even if you do not plan to look at the Kli@@ m@@ t &apos;s work , my emo@@ tion , at least , after the closure of the book , was more femin@@ ici@@ des and ha@@ ir than the bu@@ cket and mode@@ ll of the town sold for USD 135 million , B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer .
so not so much a portfolio , but a very moving story of a marriage - a tri@@ cky story .
the association of the former Bau@@ ators &apos; relatives was considerably facilitated by events .
17 @-@ year @-@ old sw@@ im@@ mer in Canada very close to Estonia &apos;s record
in the settlements , gold was in the dep@@ ths of 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 in the personal t@@ ree of 200 m por@@ k .
the label comes from a 17 @-@ year @-@ old pi@@ pe celebration of the moment the Canadian Ju@@ tan Cha@@ mpi@@ ons were awarded 16.@@ 58 , the Pri@@ it A@@ av@@ iku Lo@@ gu@@ ing block .
gold ended , the final of the decade A .
he went through a distance from 2.@@ 68 in the F@@ air and achieved a strong 7th prize with a new top @-@ level mark .
A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or@@ is ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) left Gol@@ den in a little more than half a second .
in Estonia &apos;s ranking of all history gold increased by 3 , with a fresh personal top mark accounting for all its achievements in Estonia .
the young hope for the future is to start a further 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in bal@@ ling in Canada , and 200 m@@ and 400 more co@@ ver@@ t ch@@ at .
last week in the Canadian Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship champi@@ on@@ ships in Tor@@ onto , gold rol@@ led out there too .
he won 200 m in pi@@ pe oil with a sil@@ ver me@@ dal of 2.@@ 3.@@ 22 .
this was sw@@ am@@ ped as a ven@@ ue by the last quarter of 2008 .
the Gol@@ den site has been gradu@@ ated by the record Estonian E@@ lina Par@@ halt in Estonia .
in Canada , a leader still won 100 m @-@ s@@ lum ch@@ un@@ k ch@@ ore with excellent personal records and 5@@ 6.@@ 66 new Estonian season mar@@ ches .
for example , Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k , an elderly year , has distan@@ ced it only one century more quickly .
he reached the top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art cli@@ p in the opening of the theat@@ re at the end of the bar@@ bar@@ bar@@ bar@@ bar@@ bar@@ bar@@ gain at 100 metres .
he only gained a seat from the 7th distance when he s@@ tun@@ ned in the final score 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
the Estonian ke@@ y@@ note ranking is currently running at four distinct distan@@ ces .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics che@@ er
it is time for the holidays - it is also a sla@@ p in the way of the US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mpi@@ n .
however , as the President has now removed one of the most holidays , the critics are already ham@@ mer the sc@@ ales .
on the US ben@@ ches and CN@@ N notifications , the President &apos;s plan foresees 17 days &apos; leave in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , which is based in New Jer@@ sey .
although the President began yesterday , he has spoken for weeks on the Anti @-@ T@@ ru@@ p issue .
they are throwing too much light on the Bush .
the President is right to spend his time in the F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey cotton .
by the way , Mr T@@ ru@@ mp has not been the President who has pu@@ mped the most during his 19@@ 6 term .
for example , on a holiday of that day , George W@@ . Bush had already reached 67 days , Barack Obama half as much as T@@ ru@@ mp , but 21 days .
but the T@@ ir@@ k tends to be a quick @-@ to @-@ fail .
the days before becoming President , in T@@ ru@@ mp , he received a &apos; 60 minutes &apos; saying that he would not be in time for long @-@ term holidays because a great deal needs to be done .
he also outra@@ ged Barack Obama &apos;s leave three years ago .
the current President wrote on Twitter at the time : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , gol@@ f is playing , the brak@@ es and Ju@@ da@@ a@@ mic groups are running on journalists &apos; head .
a 17 @-@ day gol@@ f visit to pol@@ led is not a kind of ab@@ str@@ and on the basis of a white @-@ house official .
it is officially called working holidays , during which the T@@ ir@@ ker has no time to read or any other ad@@ venture .
in addition , there had to be another reason for working holidays .
the Western housing balance system is being replaced by a special system for the White House , which required the whole staff to leave .
O@@ vaal@@ k@@ ka@@ ka@@ r and other President offices also appear in the West Bank .
&quot; I do not think anybody would like to be in the West in August if you have 38 degrees and no balance pensions , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the speaker of the White House , who stressed that the President would continue to work during the holiday .
you will get a s@@ lot from the video in the follow @-@ up of President T@@ ru@@ mp for 17 days .
&apos;@@ Yes &apos; to a Facebook wall of critics , don &apos;t stand for a post of state office unless you tolerate criticism from the voters
our father was so ignor@@ ant of negative media reports .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but it took no time for the newspapers to start bul@@ lying him for everything from internal politics to his political principles .
the criticism has , of course , upset him .
but he did not hesitate to keep up his criticism .
because in 17@@ 83 Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression could be taken from us and that , in a more vir@@ ul@@ ent and silent way , we could be led by sheep . &apos;
this brings me to Mrs Ho@@ gan , Governor of Mar@@ y@@ land , who has to struggle to be more like Washington .
the de@@ pu@@ ties of at least 450 people who expressed their views on the official Facebook page have been blocked and era@@ ted by Ho@@ gan .
and the American Civil Liberties Union ( EC@@ U ) therefore took legal action .
the Si@@ b@@ erian officers were was@@ hing the action into an empty and web comments in the style of &apos; who ca@@ res ? &apos; .
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; many said .
it counts .
and it is particularly important when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
it is an aston@@ ishing popular Governor of the democratic state .
his discharge rate is the second highest in the country &apos;s 50 Governor .
Ho@@ gan is not a reac@@ tive .
it has firmly drawn the state and strictly determined its principles .
she has also used Facebook quite wisely as the main instrument in her contacts with constituents , for example , by presenting her ro@@ ck head after che@@ mo@@ vers for the first time .
thus , the writer &apos;s board Mercedes is a public forum with a formal label , managed by a staff working from taxpayers &apos; dollars &apos; dollars , who are stranded and ultimately unsafe .
in an interview with K@@ ad@@ gan , the Turk@@ gani press representative , Ame@@ lia Ch@@ asse , defended The Washington Posselt , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to pa@@ int a picture of online screening , spa@@ m@@ mers or people with anger online .
the post was held by a number of people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
that is what they are , quite deliberately , people who communicate with their elected leaders , the execu@@ tor , owner of the business and the pas@@ tor , not online controls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , well thought @-@ out and not ro@@ sy .
the Pas@@ tor quoted milk in his mail , op@@ pressing the Catholic traffic of Ho@@ gan .
L@@ ak@@ sh@@ m Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , a lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan@@ d in Bo@@ wi@@ e , not encouraged hatred but rather hate crime .
&quot; I have been poli@@ tely advised not to respond to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; I am afraid I was disappointed that he wrote a comment in the heading of The mail news story .
I also dis@@ like the idea that , if many people comment on the same topic , some will suddenly be indifferent to collective effort instead of acknowledging that it is a great deal of concern for citizens . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s officer called &apos; targeted jun@@ k fire attack &apos; would probably be &apos; open &apos; .
the Facebook era allows easy mat@@ ching of messages by simply blocking criticism or dele@@ ting negative comments .
it is much cleaner than in the past , when it was necessary to send out staff to get the newspaper papers with critical edit@@ orial lists together , burning them or ar@@ resting protest@@ ors and si@@ len@@ cing them .
but that is exactly what is happening , just digital .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media a too@@ th .
President T@@ ru@@ p has been su@@ ed by users of Twitter who are blocked from the stream of Twitter .
one of the first sentences of formal value on this was in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a last week .
in Alexand@@ ria , a US Dis@@ tri@@ ct Judge James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is decided that the Board of supervisors of the Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ n Region had the first amendment to the Constitution , when he blocked the constitu@@ ent on Facebook page .
in K@@ tu@@ ck@@ y , the Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ int ( R ) also visited the Governor , following the use of the AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
in Washington , the cost of affordable postal services had a similar impact to the internet .
the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters inter@@ viewed him in a driving manner between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 multipli@@ ed the number of newspapers .
even then , Washington had to face anon@@ ymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers from pseu@@ do @-@ Or@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ u and Por@@ ti@@ us , taking Washington decisions on a land @-@ gra@@ b@@ bing track .
he bu@@ ried the office in the following historical documents in the framework of George Washington &apos;s project for collecting signatures , he used to de@@ generate his views on friendship , trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain .
but he did not keep them silent .
freedom of expression , dis@@ sent and debate are the foundation stones of our country .
and proper management means accepting it .

it is a former Dutch col@@ ony , which was added to Indonesia in 19@@ 69 , after a referendum that had put only 10@@ 26 elderly people into the book , bringing it to vote , under the very eyes of the forces .
the move from the Dutch sup@@ pres@@ s@@ ant power is encouraging its ra@@ cing against the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta government , which is still holding the region under strong control , away from foreign journalists and human rights monitors .
in 2003 , the province of Paa@@ pu@@ d and the Western P@@ ope were officially distributed , so that the eastern island remained independent in Papua New Guinea .
the majority is a distance and a brow@@ n@@ field in the same way , and a five @-@ hour journey of the city &apos;s capital , Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ b , must be flying from the city &apos;s capital , the N@@ abi@@ p@@ se , and then the run@@ way by a le@@ ase .

Papua Indonesia is the poorest province , with 28 % of people living below the poverty line and the inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are among the worst in Asia .
but it is also a gold land in Indonesia .
just 100 km from P@@ ani@@ a@@ to , a mountainous province with a population of New Jer@@ sey , a population of 153 000 , is the world &apos;s largest and most lu@@ cra@@ tive gold mine , G@@ ras@@ berg , a F@@ ree@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an , in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x .
F@@ ree@@ port in 2015 alone em@@ itted about USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ h from this place .
in addition , Papua can be smugg@@ led with consumer timber stocks valued at USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are a source of suffering for pa@@ ved trees , as they are a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence by the powerful army in Indonesia .
the 2005 study of the New York Times showed that F@@ ree@@ port paid around USD 20 million to local troops and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including around USD 150 000 per victim .
the Paa@@ ed attempts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den h@@ aste and dis@@ appears ru@@ th@@ lessly .
since 19@@ 69 , over 500 000 kil@@ lers have been killed , and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned , according to human rights activists .
according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights , the massive crime of genocide in the 1970s was a me@@ te@@ or@@ ic crime in the hil@@ ls of the hil@@ ls of the hill , belonging to the sil@@ s .
over 3 900 peaceful protest@@ ors were arrested in the region of Indonesia last year alone .
the 2016 report on &apos; We are all &apos; of the Sy@@ ri@@ mon@@ ial science report on the Bah@@ Ã¡ &apos;@@ i Ar@@ ch@@ bis@@ ho@@ p of Burma contains testi@@ monies of atrocities committed in the previous year , such as extra@@ judicial executions , torture ( rape and electricity punishment is particularly common according to another report ) and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to read the figure because there are events of this kind every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , journalist , the journalist of Human Rights Watch .
the concessions are even more strongly shut down , as the natural assets of Papua M@@ oun@@ tains have led to the influx of new settlements from Indonesia elsewhere .
Eigh@@ ty @-@ five per cent of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing because there are economic migrants coming from the Muslim Is@@ les of Indonesia , Jaa@@ va , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ es .

the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , known to the population as Jo@@ ko@@ wi , promised to tackle their inequalities and human rights abuses in P@@ ope in the election campaign in 2014 .
the former fare vic@@ torious on its way to the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta presidential Pal@@ ace in Papua 29 constitu@@ encies , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
but little has changed in the P@@ ope and local feel chea@@ ted .
&quot; our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he would live up to our hopes of restoring justice , &quot; said You are wrong .
in fact , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i was barely able to take office in the lower phase after the arrival of Jo@@ ko@@ w in October only two months .
on 7 December 2014 11 children in the Mo@@ ro@@ ta@@ li s@@ ongs on Christmas Christmas , while two Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers el@@ ap@@ sed from blind wh@@ im .
the children who met told them they should include the front lights .
after talking about the local pas@@ tor Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ eba@@ i , one of his soldiers was sentenced to their tone and subsequently returned to four troops .
in the face of the victims and faces , soldiers ch@@ oo@@ k behind children and be@@ at them with their own devices .
then one of the soldiers was shot among children .
one child , Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ o , aged 16 , was so cru@@ el@@ ly beaten as to fall into the home .
a few hours later , a lo@@ vely electoral commission took the bur@@ ner and things were even es@@ tu@@ ary the next day .
around 1000 young Pa@@ men , women and children gathered to claim justice to a football pit@@ ch in front of the local police Department and military command centre .
they carried out horse riding buses and presented a pa@@ go pa@@ go in Papua me@@ e &apos;s clothing without @-@ dance , with a drink running around and a ba@@ g of birds .
some of the prote@@ sters were sh@@ rap@@ ped by the police and by the military .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen public mass is more than three times resistance , let them down , according to a letter of formal notice &apos; , according to a letter of time , but not issued to local media ex@@ hi@@ b@@ itors &apos; , a letter of formal notice was sent to the criminals .
Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ ame ( 56 ) , an oldest Mayor of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , felt a threatening threat and called for the maintenance of peace by asking for the crow@@ d to go home .
nobody wanted to hear .
&quot; I was shot at the extreme left , &apos; he said time in his private colour , on the ver@@ min of the t@@ ree house .
Ka@@ y@@ ame still does not know who was shooting , but says soldiers came from the ranks of the month .
&quot; there was a lot of people , a lot of ab@@ ject , in the do@@ t . &quot;
Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , a local man , was arrested three times for his shooting , says the ket@@ tle .
&quot; I would like to come back to him and inqu@@ ire through her body to make sure he was with him , &apos; he said a mes@@ h of the clock in Y@@ oh@@ ano who uses only one name , like many Portuguese .
&quot; I saw him dead ... I was novel . &quot;
the T@@ FI@@ R , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that they only guaranteed security in their own Parish because it was attacked .
&quot; we need to protect ourselves if threats are to be sent , &quot; said P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , the journalist &apos;s representative of the Pa@@ ki@@ an police , in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ors were killed and injured .
the news of the killings arrived in J@@ ak@@ ara only the day after year .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra held a passion@@ ate speech , giving condolences to the victims &apos; families and allowing the P@@ ope to deal with mal@@ treatment .
&quot; I want to resolve this immediately so it will never happen again , &quot; he said .
in October 2016 , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , the security minister said that it would set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism to tackle human rights crime .
but the ex@@ cus@@ es were almost followed .
most criminal acts were carried out a long time ago .
some were in the 1990s and early in the 1980s .
it is about us being committed to tackling these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &quot; he said .
however , at the time of the conver@@ sation in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta on 5 June , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to took off his words saying that he had no intention of setting up a P@@ ope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead he said &apos; everything would be settled by law &apos; .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in relation to the death of more than 1 000 people in East Timor in the bloody referendum in 1999 , said that 11 human rights crimes had already been solved in Paa@@ pu@@ a , including in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the victims &apos; families of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i received such claims with a g@@ loom@@ y belief .
&quot; I have been inter@@ ro@@ gated four times in the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &quot;
he says he is still afraid years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I am afraid I am arrested by the army , I am afraid I am being shot . &quot;
he confirmed the view that the people of P@@ ani@@ an are afraid to s@@ lan@@ der this incident .
he said he was beaten by the army after having helped to bur@@ y four victims .
&quot; after bur@@ ying the bodies , I had to be looked at by the army , &quot; he says .
the celeb@@ rations have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Mayor of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i was shot in D@@ ei@@ y@@ aca by the Indon@@ esi@@ an police in neighbouring Con@@ cer@@ ning .
one person was killed and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , while leaving a friend between the manager of the village and construction company who refused to carry an unknown man to hospital .
this man , 2@@ 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who san@@ k into ne@@ ar@@ by rivers in the search for fish , died on the road to hospital .
the frequent village communities prote@@ sted to the office of the site .
the army has read the police stoning of the village , after which the helicop@@ ters responded with the shot .
but local claims mobile British ( the Indon@@ esi@@ an army police ) started shooting at the population , killing one person .
&quot; we were in a m@@ ood of panic , we are afraid of reven@@ ge , &quot; said the time @-@ frame of 29 Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives close to hospital and saw the in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating of the injured .
&quot; I have been beaten in my own house for two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ i Parliament has called for the responsibility of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile Bri@@ gade from the region .
the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i has always been a problem for the Indon@@ esi@@ an Government .
the lack of meaningful development fe@@ eds the dis@@ satisfaction of the honey , m@@ oni , dan@@ cing and da@@ y@@ chi@@ er in Papua B@@ hal@@ i@@ da .
many of them have joined the army of free Paapua ani re@@ bels ( V@@ PL ) , which , in its own words , protects the rights of boats by conducting atrocities and abduc@@ tions amongst Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers .
some of the leaders of V@@ PL come from P@@ ani@@ i , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , in recent years , under the pretext of defending the sovereignty of a state , the army has arbitrarily arrested and held thousands of people detained .
some will never emerge .
P@@ ani@@ as is known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; among the people of Papua Islands .
poverty is a source of dis@@ satisfaction .
the low @-@ cost ri@@ p the majority is too expensive to buy for local people .
the top is equally un@@ achievable .
people are mainly b@@ asing themselves on food , adding some fruit and vegetables to their entire food .
farming is women &apos;s work , each managing to maintain four or five of the premises .
they usually keep most of their catches to their families , and sell the rest on the local market .
ten b@@ ars cost only 10@@ ,000 premises ( 75 cents ) .
economic inequality between in@@ competent pa@@ w@@ ns and new migrants , who have come across a great deal since the opening of new flight routes at N@@ ab@@ ire airport , has deepen@@ ed over time .
the few jobs that exist go to better trained and more prosperous migrants .
the P@@ ope often lacks the capital or the skills needed to pursue a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the fri@@ dge because there is no jobs or money , &quot; John Go@@ ba@@ i , Chairman of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ bal Council , says .
the exhibition keeps the eyes of the world away from the P@@ ope .
in addition , tough restrictions on foreign media remain .
French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ th L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were expelled from the P@@ ope at the beginning of this year , because they were not following the relevant practices , even though they had been given a rare film authorisation .
according to P@@ heli@@ m K@@ ine , Deputy head of the Asian department of Human Rights Watch , Jo@@ ko@@ w &apos;s electoral promises to remove the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development have not been implemented .
&quot; in Indonesia , journalists seeking to report on the Eastern cal@@ mer provinces and West Pa@@ pu@@ tan are facing new threats to the rejection of the Sakharov visa and black@@ list , &quot; said in a statement .
the lack of a g@@ lance in the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua neighbours .
in March six Pacific countries were encouraged by pirates , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ valu , Mar@@ shall Islands and the Sol@@ om@@ on Islands to investigate &quot; various large @-@ scale crimes &quot; in the Paa@@ pu@@ a , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the same countries have historically supported V@@ PL .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , the journalist in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed the corpor@@ ation &apos;s accusations of a group , saying to the press : &apos; in Indonesia democratic regimes and freedom of the press , so that evidence of cases against human rights can be dec@@ ried &apos; .
local people want more foreign governments to be taken into consideration .
when the delegation from the Netherlands , headed by its human rights Ambassador , K@@ ees Van B@@ aar@@ r , visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ rat on 4 May , the local people suspended the meeting , but anon@@ ymous with their silence , saying : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
new presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019 , but the pa@@ int does not believe they will vote for Jo@@ ko@@ w again .
&quot; Jo@@ ko@@ wi is a man with good intentions , but people around him who are involved in shooting P@@ ani@@ a@@ i say Ho@@ ba@@ i , President of the tri@@ bal Council .
he wants to make a clear signal to Jo@@ ko@@ w that , in addition to the constant threat to the pre@@ da@@ tory army , the people of P@@ ani@@ i are suffering from misery because of poor education and health services .
according to Go@@ ita , people in P@@ ani@@ an , like other boats , consider their vote to be the debt to Jo@@ ko@@ w , which he has to pay .
&apos;@@ The@@ y need no money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite the threat and intimidation , the families of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i fire were coping with the latest symbolic counter @-@ insur@@ gency in pirates , in the face of the dead police stations and army bases .
knowing that justice may never be done , they will at least not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&apos;@@ One of our family members was killed &apos; says the core of the Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us .
&quot; what can we do ? &quot;
Ne@@ il ne@@ il@@ ls in the Kat@@ y@@ cle of Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch for the second time !
hundreds of inhabitants were fed through one of the largest residential blocks in the world in Du@@ ba@@ i on Friday , forcing hundreds of them to escape from the 3@@ 37 metres of de@@ ser@@ t and 79 mor@@ ale building .
it is the second fire that has devastated the high ranking , which is , incidentally , called the Tu@@ rin storm , or the T@@ Ãµr@@ vi@@ k .
no direct fire was reported and no direct fire was caused .
&quot; we s@@ lee@@ ping and wo@@ e the fire camp and the c@@ rying people .
we were caught by school courses and we took about 10 minutes to get down to the bottom of the 50@@ th , &quot; said one woman to Re@@ u@@ ter@@ na , calling himself George .
fire @-@ fighters , as the civil protection officers of Du@@ ba@@ i said , even down at around 4 a.m. in the morning at local time ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and cooling the building .
the government said they were working to provide shelter to those affected .
this incident could once again raise concerns about the safety of materials used on the external surface worldwide .
a study conducted following the fires on the ground at the Tor@@ ch Bureau in 2015 found that fas@@ ta@@ ics - the de@@ cor@@ alist panels and isolation of external soil - suffered most damage .
the British police have said they believe that the isolation of G@@ ren@@ fell T@@ ow@@ er in London and the fas@@ ten@@ ers could have contributed to the fire chaos there in June , killing almost 80 people .
see : sales but@@ tons are likely to be available in the autumn
Ke@@ y and autumn are a time @-@ sp@@ ir@@ alling for technical theat@@ res , as telephone companies then unve@@ il their new models of excellence .
the sales of Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peri@@ a Pre@@ mi@@ um in spring have been expected to be expected to be new h@@ it@@ t @-@ phones to boys in the autumn .
according to Sir Christian Se@@ ema , telecoms marketing and sales Director , street ships are characterised by innovative design design , eye display display , ser@@ se @-@ servan@@ i &apos;s 4@@ K resolution screen and ultra @-@ fast delivery .
Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , a world of high @-@ profile technology , has also received the top @-@ end sales ranking from Estonia .
in autumn , more advanced radiation , more resilient bat@@ teries , better quality camer@@ as and greater water and dust security will allow smart fo@@ e@@ tal .
he added that , as you have already heard , gu@@ es@@ ts can already be predicted for the four top @-@ ups that are likely to con@@ qu@@ er the ven@@ lies .
these four top @-@ level smart phones will reach a le@@ g in the autumn of this year .
the long @-@ awaited i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone Plus should reach the boys by mid @-@ September .
the images of what the new Apple model looks like and can do in this regard are much more widespread .
if the i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not bring significant differences between i@@ P@@ hone and 6@@ s , Apple is expected to be completely distinct from the previous model at the birth@@ day .
four col@@ ours have been mentioned : black , white , white and cold .
one element of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the entire telephone panel , lost at home and is built on the screen .
J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve , the head of Apple design , demands that the new i@@ P@@ hone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk of a cer@@ a@@ mic version of an i@@ P@@ hone .
in addition to the S@@ G , wireless charging and a more advanced camer@@ as , speeds for A@@ 11 Process members can be expected .
this is certainly one of the most expected smart phones for the year .
the G@@ ala@@ x@@ y note 8 of the brand new model will begin on 23 August .
there are many rum@@ ours of a new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y note 8 .
there is even more business @-@ owners , and the S pen will allow even more fun@@ ction@@ ality .
the TV phone should have two camer@@ as , one being s@@ lee@@ ping pressure and one on TV , with a narrow view .
nobody knows at present what two slu@@ ms are capable of , but in any case it is the first test of the same same , which is surely the same as i@@ P@@ hone 8 in terms of quality .
we are looking forward to 23 August .
while Nokia has brought three smart phones to sales this year with Nokia 6 , their flagship ship - Nokia 8 - is still missing , which is already to be presented on 16 August .
we are awaiting a screen stret@@ ching from 5.@@ 3 to the end of the day and an ultra fast F@@ ire@@ m Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ nap@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and a more robust a@@ g .
Nokia also speaks of alu@@ mini@@ um fla@@ x and of the significant level of water and dust resistance IP@@ 68 .
in the same vein as the code , the new model of Nokia has two am@@ ples of am@@ bia , an opti@@ mist produced by the Z@@ e@@ iss .
once the S@@ ony has been a solid flagship ship , X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smar@@ t@@ phones will have even more innovative functions in the near future .
we are looking for a smart phone which is a little more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least with the same good or better camer@@ a .
speculation has been carried out on the new model for S@@ ony , which is at least hot @-@ and @-@ cold .
what is happening is that we can see the moment soon , as the international technology fair charging has traditionally been published at the S@@ ony &apos;s autumn flagship International Technology F@@ air ( IF@@ A ) this year , which is to be held from 1 to 6 September .
T@@ ru@@ mp , lea@@ sed trans@@ cri@@ cket warnings , pres@@ su@@ ris@@ ed by T@@ ru@@ mp , for paying the border wall
the Washington post revealed trans@@ cri@@ ptions between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ p and Mexic@@ an Heads of State .
on 27 January , Mr Ni@@ etta , the Mexic@@ an President , went to the former President of the United Kingdom to stop announcing that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President was in ab@@ h@@ or for publicly condemning the Wall , saying &apos; You must not say this to the press &apos; .
the thir@@ teen @-@ man campaign has pledged to build a path to the US &apos;s South border wall and van@@ ity to make Mexico pay for this project .
Trans@@ cri@@ p@@ tors from his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l , have also been published , reve@@ aling intense debates .
T@@ ru@@ mp said to Mrs Tur@@ ner that the agreement that the United States would take on a migration path to Australia would be &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; fo@@ ol@@ ish &apos; , and that it would save him &apos; from the impression of having given him a &apos; ra@@ g@@ ba@@ g &apos; under the Obama Government , because it has proposed a ban on refugees from the United States .
the T@@ ru@@ mp finished giving notice to tourists that it was the most un@@ pleasant speech of the day .
the Supreme Court did not prosecute the L@@ and@@ ina@@ g City , where the Tar@@ tu city rejected their offer of bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 20@@ 29 .
it is a hand@@ book rejecting the offer of the Tar@@ tu bus bus in the City of O@@ Ãœ MR@@ P because of a lack of compliance , An@@ neli A@@ puh@@ tin , Director of the Tar@@ tu City Service .
it is a public bus and coach transport for the period from 1.@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 to 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 for the period of delivery within the city of Tar@@ tu .
the Councils in MR@@ P brought the judgment of the Tar@@ tu Dis@@ tri@@ ct Court to the Supreme Court .
it was not prosecuted by the Supreme Court .
although many in the social media complain that the co@@ stu@@ b@@ born b@@ reat@@ h from the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val is disrup@@ ting their night and that the entire town is full of b@@ read@@ ers , there are many who do not have a single word to say a bad about the festi@@ val lasting in the island .
I am even positively surprised that visas were so sole@@ mn in the super@@ market !

even the fla@@ me has come , &apos; a wave is a nu@@ t .
&quot; it is good that you are coming , staying and proud of the legacy that has remained on the winter , &quot; will bring him happily .
the wave of red co@@ ws does not b@@ other .
while living in a central town , he is still being played on the floor of music , now the music has not reached his home rate .
&quot; I hope I hear , &quot; he will be happy .
also , the Ag@@ nes report that the G@@ esti@@ val is good for the record - it is a major contribution to the turnover of local merchan@@ ts .
she also welcomes the fact that so many out@@ breaks have been visited in the capital cities of summer .
no woman of family life .
although I will not be on the coast any more , I am happy that the rand has recovered .
it is good that the public is moving and it has been three times as bad , &quot; says a woman .
I think the first time was a little worse .
&apos;@@ Per@@ haps there were complaints &apos; , he will reflect .
what he says is common practice for the summer capital .
&quot; this We@@ ek@@ end is a very good pro@@ gram for our small town , Har@@ ri is hiding in par@@ a .

we should all stand together .

after all , a black man is not s@@ le@@ ep .

&quot; but in general , the festi@@ val has a positive impact on life - people like it &apos; , the Ti@@ ina , who have wal@@ ked with children from Vienna .
his family is also not bo@@ thered by festi@@ vals , although it has been heard even further from this year .

Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts another 3000 jobs and cuts dividen@@ ds to revive business
the British educational firm Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that it would cut another 3 000 jobs and reduce its interim dividend by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with the men@@ tor@@ ing burden of business .
the jobs that will be covered , which will most likely be concentrated in the following four posts , as the CE@@ O , John F@@ all@@ oni , at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will be added to the 4 000 posts lost in the previous restructuring .
Beijing announced in May plans to cut the cost of a third cost cut of the programme &apos;s reduction of EUR 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) to try to revive the business that has been hit by the move to fast digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell its participation in the company , Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House , to Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , said that their expectation with regard to the year has not changed since the 1 % increase in sales was announced at 2.@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year .

K@@ abu@@ l attack : NATO soldi@@ er lost suicide in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked army con@@ vo@@ ys in the Afghan capital , K@@ abu@@ l , to kill a NATO soldi@@ er and w@@ ound several others .
the NATO statement stated that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
three civilians also died in the coun@@ ty of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi , un@@ proven local reports .
this bom@@ bing is the last acts of violence to have hit Afghanistan this month , with more than 30 killed in the Her@@ ati mos@@ to attack on Tuesday .
on Monday two people were killed by suicide bom@@ bing in K@@ abu@@ l near the Iraqi E@@ mb@@ assy .
the NATO statement stated that an explosion on Thursday took place when the Afghan army was attacked by &apos; man @-@ made explosives &apos; , in a joint pat@@ ro@@ l .
the statement states that all are in a stable position and treated at Bag@@ ra@@ m &apos;s airport in the US military hospital .
according to repor@@ ters , the Taliban and group known as the &apos; Islamic &apos; ( T@@ EE@@ K ) are a serious source of concern for the forces in Bag@@ h@@ dad , NATO , which is becoming ever more powerful forces .
according to the UN , at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , some 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l killed at least 30 people in the line of S@@ hi &apos;@@ ite ra@@ ys .
they were at the root of the attack , according to the Taliban .
a major bomb attack in the centre of the city on 31 May killed more than 150 people , which has led to the most deaths in a military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces failed the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp is considering whether to increase the number of US troops and police forces that help the country .
according to the cor@@ respondents , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
following a decision to postpone the Regulation , the EPA annul@@ led the decision
the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( UN@@ States Environmental Protection Agency EF ) repealed the decision to delay the establishment of a Obama @-@ time Regulation obli@@ ging states to limit emissions of emissions from the summer , one day after 15 states were su@@ ed by this move .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed with &quot; the decision to establish the BONUS status &quot; late on Wednesday , saying it demonstrates its commitment to cooperation with the states .
&quot; we believe we need to engage in dialogue and listening to our national partners , &quot; said Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t , leader of the EPA .
the June EPA had announced its intention to put into practice descri@@ p@@ tors of the ozone content declarations 1.4 in different parts of the country , in order to identify where it should be reduced by one year to 2018 &apos;s crossroads in order to meet the most stringent air quality standard .
in the 15 main democratic states , an action was fi@@ led with C@@ olum@@ bia on Tuesday saying that this decision was unlawful .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has tried to bring back a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama , and this is part of the broader plan for growth , as I have said , in T@@ ru@@ p .
but these efforts have led to reactions among the groups of democrats and nature protection who are concerned about the effects of increased contamin@@ ants on human health .
the EPA website states that in@@ hal@@ ing the ozone layer &quot; could reduce the ability of lun@@ g and increase the risk of res@@ pira@@ tory illness , &quot; e.g. as@@ th@@ ma .
there may be a pit@@ tance for German pigs .
Germany can have a ticket for the purpose of threatening the EU &apos;s second @-@ biggest wheat producer , B@@ loom@@ berg , as a result of heavy rain .
this year , it may be the case that the weekend of preci@@ pita@@ tions before harves@@ ting may mean that the production intended for the bread only serves animals .
&quot; the quality of content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said Bern@@ hard Chil@@ la , the analysis of A@@ gra@@ vis R@@ ai@@ ff@@ e@@ is@@ en .
this year , up to 40 % of German wheat can be fed fed in A@@ gra@@ vis , a forecast of double @-@ hat@@ ted diseases .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have come across any beau@@ ty this year .
first , the winter was too dry .
then there was cold spring replaced by heat waves in June .
in July , the German leadership was hit , which has continued in August .
many eyes are on northern Germany , where the rain is holding back harves@@ ting .
only five per cent of wheat have been cleared up so far .
most of the harvest in the area has not even started , local bu@@ yers in C@@ era@@ vis have declared .
&quot; this is a very challenging day , said from the Re@@ ar Trade Authority Frank Dec@@ ker@@ t R@@ end@@ s@@ burg .

at every turn , our North neighbours are struggling to create both harsh and perfect ( energy @-@ saving ) homes .
I@@ r@@ h@@ aste and observance are also worth enabling Fin@@ ns to use wood as a construction and processing material , fur@@ ni@@ ture and beau@@ ty .
Por@@ table techniques and smart solutions are found in the design of the building and home ( home ) in the cab@@ ins .
it shows clearly that the black , white and grey fac@@ tions , if they are supplemented by wood ton@@ es and to@@ es@@ ta , can be very ang@@ ry .
there is still a week to go for good ideas , as the tone will last until 13 August .

M@@ ike@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss possible confron@@ tations
Mr L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and Ms Gar@@ cia , who should be at the col@@ lisi@@ on course to face the most attractive po@@ xing po@@ xing of the near future in the order of 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg weight group , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t in special rooms in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ les , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ won World Bo@@ xing Coun@@ c@@ ili ligh@@ t@@ weight champion , wal@@ ked the other corridor to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , the World Bo@@ xing Times tably consulting the sul@@ g@@ ras@@ ra@@ m .
following the unanimous decision by Gar@@ cia , the former four @-@ time world champion Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er was won on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ time by both comb@@ at@@ ants in the head@@ w@@ ol@@ le@@ g .
the Gar@@ cia extended its better hand and said : &quot; how is your s@@ oul going , champion ?
I wish you luck . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko is defending his bel@@ ts Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening 19 in the ES@@ P@@ N .
when a few pho@@ to images were named , Mr E@@ gis Kli@@ ma , a mountain j@@ ou@@ le of L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said that a &quot; perfect moder@@ ation &quot; could be possible between opposing fighters .
&quot; I was a former sul@@ tative , &quot; re@@ minis@@ cent of Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I have swit@@ ched to B@@ ron@@ er &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to go beyond the ligh@@ ter .
and it must move up the tra@@ il &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the games have called for it .
let &apos;s put it to them . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
the question of whether this should be worthwhile is one of his strategies , which he wants to ask L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko to book 6@@ 1.2 kg of the class at the end of this year , to make a meeting with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 months ) , who also has an interest in combating Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ da and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ k@@ k@@ ich , following the ath@@ le@@ te &apos;s celebration on the occasion of the ath@@ le@@ tes &apos; ceremony of For@@ ra@@ da@@ r on 23 September , was raised in the cli@@ ma .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as the f@@ ans have asked for it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , later saying that it was open to any channel providing the best financial package .
&quot; we are the main actors .
no other name can deserve so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
she said she was a &apos; powerful figh@@ ter &apos; to L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t and could go on to his Saturday .
however , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was modest in pra@@ ising the Gar@@ cia , saying that he thought he saw the dec@@ oration of three di@@ vis@@ h@@ ons from Ri@@ ver@@ side - very slow ; I am sorry , M@@ ike@@ y ... you wanted it a no@@ se .
the aim was to show strength and then to bo@@ w down , as the Gar@@ cia said .
they both affir@@ med that they felt that the tension would increase to the challenge between them .
&quot; this is a struggle for action .
no other confrontation is so much more of a focus and a little bit of attention .
I am more than willing to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been on the ben@@ ch of the best fighters , and M@@ ike@@ y is just that .
it will be a good struggle . &quot;
what sort of world ra@@ ys will be relocated to Estonia ?
the Police and Border and coast Guard ( PP@@ A ) issued a record residence permit of over 13 000 third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to , study or family to Estonia .
for example , if it was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit to 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , it was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the agencies cannot tell how many migrants will eventually stay in Estonia , but such an analysis will be carried out in the Ministry of the Interior .
if there were around 500 Ukrainians per year in Estonia ten years ago , this figure will reach 2 000 in recent years .
the number of applicants for the residence permit so@@ ared during the Ukrainian crisis , with 10@@ 87 people in 2014 , one year before 6@@ 75 before the age @-@ of @-@ term residence permit .
the statistics from the office show that the Ukrainian citizens are growing the highest number in Estonia , with 850 Ukrainian citizens left in Estonia more than a f@@ ence .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been very high in Estonia all the time , and it is only natural because of the difficult circumstances in the country that the country is looking for work and learning opportunities in the country where the community and many families already had their own front in front of them , &quot; said Kris@@ tin Ram@@ mus , the spokes@@ person for the Home Department .
the number of Ukrainians granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian nationals , although in 10 years total the most fixed @-@ term residence permits have been granted to them .
if the Ukrainians get into work here , then Russian citizens will be forced to mig@@ rate .
&quot; given the historic Russian community here , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said Hel@@ ina Me@@ use , the chief theat@@ re of the Interior .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you look at where the Russian citizens who have been granted a residence permit in Estonia have moved , there is an East F@@ es@@ maa immediately after Har@@ ju@@ ther@@ land &apos; , she added and pointed out that around 40 % of them are mar@@ ried to a European Union citizen .
it has been granted a term of residence of 1 6@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also record .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to renew their residence permits fell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of a permanent residence permit for Estonia &quot; are explained by the spokes@@ person Ram@@ mus , who says that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia has remained stable for many years rather than the renewal of their residence permit .
a new residence permit for a permanent stay in Estonia can be applied for foreigners who have lived here for at least three years from last year .
it aims to encourage the sincere savings of the people adapted .
however , a long @-@ term residence permit will require five years , for example .
the renewal of the old residence permit has apparently dimin@@ ished because of the new residence permit .
soil , for example , was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
Ukrainians can now exchange their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer point the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit became popular in the cour@@ ty@@ ard , with the owners of another grey passports ( 10@@ 29 ) , Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , individuals ( 54 ) and Fin@@ ns ( 36 ) requesting them .
a total of 19@@ 68 people were granted a residence permit to reside in Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and equally many Chinese .
the total number of applicants has already reached 12@@ 69 in the first half of this year .
in 10 years , Nigeria has become a country with some of the most active candidates for Estonian residence permits .
three residence permits were issued for nic@@ ot@@ ers in 2007 , the soil was 200 .
lessons will be learned from Nigeria to universities .
in addition , universities in Estonia are popular with Georgi@@ ans , Chinese and Tur@@ ks , for example .
the number of citizens in India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to the study games .
for these too , the rule applies that there will be more easily more of others in which the community has been formed , &quot; Ram@@ mus added .
in 10 years , two people have moved to Estonia from North Korea , for example , just as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four from U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6,@@ 000 third country nationals receive a residence permit a year , it is 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if you include EU citizens , you will stick to about one percent of the difference &apos; , you have said that the figures are small .
in total , 14 8@@ 22 people were able to travel to Estonia , compared with 13 7@@ 92 , according to the statistical office .
this means that for a second year migration exceeded emigration .
the majority of relocated people are Estonian citizens , but more are in the country .
the migration bet@@ a has therefore been in decline with the population of 2 000 .
children are particularly struck between Finland and Estonia .
M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture g@@ lu@@ e g@@ lu@@ e with sa@@ usage , we@@ ed and dis@@ gust
however , in the wake of the North , there is history for Maria Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u - old pa@@ int@@ ings and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream somewhere for hours in mus@@ eu@@ ms and old thi@@ ev@@ es and ad@@ m@@ ire .
if you look at and learn something every day about it .
it is a joy to find out !
the world of M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture gla@@ mo@@ rous may seem to be a life alien to some , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you will decide how much you are in life !
I have a friend who has full g@@ all the bat@@ tery of cou@@ ture of the shar@@ ks I have created .
because it is not his fault , nor is he living in Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ oo@@ d and not on red fat every day , he wants to carry those most beautiful bro@@ kers and suffer !
you can live in a special way !
the Mo@@ e@@ ar@@ tist does not recognise the divisions between bri@@ lli@@ ant events and the h@@ all day .
it was this reasoning that led to the rolling @-@ out of higher gra@@ des in Estonia between land , forests and fields , to people who are often not reached by the m@@ ood .
M@@ ammu collection was presented on the basis of a benchmark , J@@ Ãµh@@ vis and LT mo@@ e@@ alle@@ el , where a Ro@@ yal De@@ fi@@ le@@ e with 45 mo@@ del@@ les carried the streets .
in Tallinn , the de@@ ser@@ t is often taken in the shop , a dignified no@@ d , but there is more emo@@ tion elsewhere - the cry is b@@ vo rising , you have to thank you .
a large number of the audience had to be down@@ listed , but are now the f@@ ans of M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture .
if you exceed the expectations of the people , they are admi@@ red !
and I like to feel that I am on the ver@@ ge of being a fashi@@ on@@ able piece of mo@@ is@@ y like a summer .
we had a 50 @-@ me@@ tre red car@@ pet , full of rub@@ ber @-@ stamp across the whole street , which seemed to be not the end !
Maria also recognises the mo@@ tive that the creation must be presented by a super@@ super@@ cau@@ tionary character , and it will bring women who are willing to sit on the brink .
I often invite my own customers - they have always been happy .
it is like experience , a fine w@@ ings on the ver@@ ge of a wonderful ho@@ le !
I am so sorry that I have never seen what I have been watching , I am always behind the scen@@ es to make the last piece of what is un@@ happy as a bo@@ i@@ om .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow a calm watch from the floor .
Maria is the mo@@ el@@ o@@ cher of a kind who not only wants to play a representative role , but has to be involved in everything .
I have a s@@ ma@@ ck of its own mus@@ cle , most of it myself .
I like you to find out about the whole process of playing with the details .
I am not far from my own crea@@ ture and I am not afraid of work .
it is not a matter of stig@@ ma , nor is it a matter of engineering , logistics , organisation , organisation - everything has to reach one day of tem@@ per@@ ate woman .
those who are really working are still hugely attached to fana@@ tics .
I cannot say when my day of work will end , for me it is just a day full of joy !
I have been very lu@@ cky - it is like an un@@ ce@@ asing happy par@@ ade : I do something nice , man gets something beau@@ ty and , in turn , compli@@ cate .
it has been said many times that I have a c@@ oo@@ gy in my stic@@ kers - they make themselves feel printed .
the ab@@ er@@ rone@@ ous specta@@ tors that Maria talent made to account overnight have remained the M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture sign@@ alling date .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ at U@@ 18 boys : Re@@ ag@@ ru@@ ru@@ p@@ our , an arms for the Est@@ oni@@ ans , has now turned against us
I am afraid , fa@@ iry ta@@ les ran out .
the first thing was that we could not get our des@@ k .
and if such a difference is needed on the table , &quot; the Estonian Estonian Estonian pra@@ yer reacted to the tune of U@@ 18 cor@@ v@@ ball bo@@ xes 61 : 75 UK Re@@ spi@@ es , our sole cor@@ p@@ tor , Tha@@ i Kal@@ BC @-@ v / mo Cra@@ ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ r@@ s@@ pp , who played our only part in the N@@ F@@ As .
opponents took 28 p@@ ounds from the offensive wave and suffered so many more attacks .
we were not prepared to protect them agg@@ ressi@@ vely and not to attack them , it was created .
many of the attacks by English end in three to five seconds , we could not build protection .
in defence , however , they have kept their hands everywhere , we could not combine .
it has turned the team out .
the anti @-@ fire was better .
the two cla@@ im@@ ants estimate that Estonia should have made more tac@@ tical errors to remove the momentum of the oppon@@ ent in the b@@ ud .
in the last quarter , we had zero error , but we had already had a quick response from opponents .
In@@ stan@@ ce@@ fulness and intense insistence , which was our weapon in the al@@ bin@@ d , have now turned against us all .
today we had no force against their agg@@ ressi@@ veness .
the y@@ m@@ ou@@ th@@ est remained satisfied with Kal@@ ev@@ i , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s , with its ca@@ vali@@ er disregard .
in general , good words can be said about the whole team , so far in a united hit .
it is a pity that this aggressive oppon@@ ent had not been met before .
the ball has been confident all the time and has played out today , but it seemed to have been ti@@ red - it has carried a pretty great deal of burden .
but he made some rather nice ges@@ tures that I have seen in the past &apos; , accompanied by a men@@ tor .
terrible numbers : less than 10 points were thrown by E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ p in the cor@@ al concentration of ne@@ fresh cor@@ ps with three quarters ...
in the U@@ 18 age class , only emi B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on cor@@ p@@ ound in Tallinn did not work in the same category as men , Women starting the day yesterday in Dublin .
and the Estonian game with Poland was , unfortunately , a je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
Estonia lost 33 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , 9 : 49 , or only in the last 10 minutes , were taken by opponents from the gas family , leaving the period at the level of the figure 16 .
Estonia &apos;s 4 , point number 3 , was set to be deleted in both the first and second quarters ...
then they hit two bits of the first two minutes from the four , and then adds to the 25 @-@ mile game , then one of the three , and then 21 , to the down@@ side ...
perhaps 47 crea@@ tures were caught in almost half an hour .
in addition , 2 paragraphs came from four free @-@ ton@@ es .
the number of losses in many cases was reasonable , 12 .
the pu@@ mp was eventually reduced by 33 % in Poland and 13 % in Estonia ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , and on the inaugu@@ ral day Portugal had to be recognised as 83 : 56 .
NATO vessels have been re@@ plen@@ ished into Tallinn
NATO today arrived for the weekend of an ad hoc port visit to Tallinn to supplement the stock of ships and prepare for the upcoming exercises .
during the visit ships are preparing for release into the sea , giving cre@@ ws the possibility to take a couple of days .
after the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonia to carry out a series of exercises and prepare for future historic explosives @-@ searching operations .
&quot; the participation of the Est@@ oni@@ ans in the NATO conting@@ ent and co @-@ operation in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the Alli@@ ed forces , &quot; said Cap@@ ten@@ ore Ar@@ to Rein@@ maa , chief of the overseas military and planning station .
since 29 June , NATO is holding a permanent mine steering group of the Latvian Na@@ vy Cap@@ ten@@ le@@ it@@ ant G@@ vi@@ le@@ ant Lau@@ du@@ ps , who took over from the Estonian na@@ vy officer Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as Sel@@ ja@@ as at a ceremony in Riga .
L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , a ship supported by the Latvian na@@ vy , is designated as a group flagship ship , including a group steering period .
the Estonian Na@@ vy mine hun@@ t and Sak@@ alas are also part of the international unit in this semester .
as one of the four groups of ships subject to NATO &apos;s Maritime command , NATO is the permanent anti @-@ missile group 1 of primary Rap@@ id Response Forces , to be sent to different places in the world within five days .
the fa@@ ti@@ gue series of P@@ iri@@ ta mon@@ as@@ tery will become once more a place in which Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , which was committed 13 years ago , was de@@ cep@@ ted by the Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ lased .

Burma has much more than simply concer@@ ts and theat@@ re replies .
it is bigger than any music theat@@ res in their normal form .
it is a festi@@ val whose s@@ now is gaining ground and never quite dis@@ connected .
because the experience gained by the audience in this unjust and my@@ ste@@ rious environment is more vibran@@ t and human beings are affected by human models in ways that cannot be described .
at the risk , you are the first archite@@ ct of F@@ esti@@ val to Burma .
did the sho@@ es of the ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ k not feel a little big ?
of course , but because I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been a lot of help .
he went through a whole pu@@ pi@@ l career and supported my di@@ ri@@ gis@@ me at the beginning of the di@@ ri@@ gis@@ me career .
perhaps it is because of this that I will be easier to carry on with her work .
the team of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has been ab@@ using so much of the good , and of course it is all over me .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things go .
I also had the great heart of E@@ ri K@@ ese to thri@@ ve on Burma in the Tal@@ li@@ tan@@ ia Fil@@ tu F@@ esti@@ val@@ ry .
and here I am on my way !
what could be the audience for this year &apos;s festi@@ val , what are you offering ?
we have the first bal@@ le@@ um to be presented to the demonstrations , including by the F@@ esti@@ val , written by Astrid L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i , in the form of a surprise , from England , Latvia , Lithuania and surprise .
it is &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson fly &apos; .
and one no@@ torious nu@@ ance in that is that the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ sons , who himself expressed a desire to write this work , is the author of this Bal@@ our@@ ty .
apparently , he has already been a car@@ it@@ ter of Kar@@ l@@ sson somewhere in his mind .
at the risk , how are you all fat ?
my life @-@ support colleague will certainly be .
this is a job that needs a lot of love and support , and fortunately I have a lot of co@@ us@@ ness .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tion is not as dependent on people as I myself might be , as it were , how I will go against every new day .
and this is a conscious awareness of the tone , a positive statement and , in fact , a s@@ mile in the mir@@ ror of the morning , a significant increase in my happ@@ iness .
especially this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen to practise them and it works .
F@@ ool self @-@ defe@@ ating is a brain and a multipli@@ er .
it is not just a hol@@ low word .
I think people do not yet know about the body that the univer@@ se offers to them , but they will find it in a little bit .
now we are at a crucial moment .
is there a ri@@ tual before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di pul@@ se is taken ?
it is time to exchange clo@@ thes for more comfortable ones .
it is a small moment for itself .
but generally , I do not have the opportunity to c@@ ool or make a little s@@ kin@@ s before I get a lot of speaking .
I am actually even pleased to have active exchanges with people , even before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di@@ dra@@ g is taken .
but come to Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , not a particularly big o@@ us and a bro@@ ther !
watch the scene for a g@@ lance at the dangers !
new results of tests on the age of Swedish as@@ y@@ lene applicants published
in Sweden , a test of their age @-@ old novel approach was carried out in a medical test of as@@ th@@ ma , showing that over 80 % of the@@ istic transactions were older than 18 % , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for medicine ( R@@ Ã¤t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started the tests this year .
tests were created to better assess the age when the Swedish I@@ OM ( Mig@@ ration@@ s@@ ver@@ ket ) was requested for not having been properly identified as the age of several minors .
to date , the I@@ ration@@ s@@ ver@@ ket has already sent 68 cases to the test , and a total of 24@@ 81 test results have been released between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July 2013 by the Institute for Justice .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or over and another 25 cases were assessed by the Institute for Justice ( C@@ EN ) as &apos; a possibility of 18 years or more &apos; testing .
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person was &quot; probably younger than 18 &quot; .
the tests will only be used if the age of the person is in question .
the results are consistent in relation to those in the past months , according to Joh@@ an GÃ¶@@ rans@@ son , working in the Institute for Justice .
&quot; we do not see any major differences in statistics over the past months , quite consistent figures , &quot; he said The Local Journal .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were judged to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that applicants have been dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ ised for their age .
the institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said in 4@@ 42 cases &quot; there are indications that the person examined is 18 years old or older . &quot;
but when she studied the results of the 581 test , she said in 2@@ 43 cases she had said directly that she would be 18 this year .
this medical age assessment method , which involves ne@@ x@@ th@@ y@@ o@@ gen@@ i@@ vis@@ s and cor@@ k ima@@ ging , has been used in some quarters , and has been used to analyse ha@@ ir@@ d@@ do@@ s and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts .
one of the sceptics is the endo@@ k@@ rin@@ oloo@@ g Claude Mar@@ cus , an endocrine disrup@@ tor whose tasks include assessment of human biological maturity to determine whether they went through the usual audience early or beyond .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and do not think that the method of measu@@ re@@ ments that we are using should be used .
the way the biological age is set is very uncertain .
if we cannot say so strongly , we should not pretend we can , &apos; he said &apos; to the Met@@ ro newspaper .
but , from the Institute for Justice , John GÃ¶@@ rans@@ son , the accuracy of the tests was advocated : &apos; generally speaking , there is little risk of child leaving in@@ accurate adul@@ tera@@ tions .
perhaps the biggest risk at around 10 % is a little less than 18 . &quot;
9 indicators to have been more de@@ lu@@ ded by your de@@ ception .
you were more expensive on a Friday and spent a night with another .
you are hur@@ tful because you have so many nice times and memor@@ ies together .
I would like to for@@ give him , but is it time ?
Y@@ our Tan@@ g@@ go lists nine indicators showing that you are more expensive to act and could for@@ give her .
the seriousness of the situation seems to be more costly and is a great deal of work to resolve it .
it is more expensive to deal with a problem that has led him to bed with another .
no longer are there any more defen@@ sive .
it sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for what it does .
it is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
he agrees that he has made a serious mistake and is sincere in trying to improve .
he is attentive and pleasant to intera@@ ct with you .
but he is pressing for a hur@@ ry of your head .
they do not deny what has happened and try to make it un@@ noticed .
you have a more expensive idea , so why your default was raised .
you talk about this and about how we will prevent it in the future .
better communication and mutual assessment .
the more expensive attitude and actions have helped you to develop your own sympathy for his mis@@ fortune .
more expensive commitment and behaviour has created the basis for your proximity to recovery .
you have made progress as a couple to re @-@ believe in your unity and relationship .
Anna Maria O@@ rel , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old vas@@ s@@ er , has done a nice debate on the BBC with her 6.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 6.@@ birth@@ place .
she was a female pri@@ est and a happy woman , and he said he hoped to fight for the med@@ als in the future .
the contest has been successful and has had good experience .
I immediately did my first test , 6@@ 4.@@ 80 , to my average performance , to the other ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) , too much risk , and , thirdly ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) , I could almost keep it clear , &quot; said O@@ rel after the contest .
I was conscious of my emissions and I am very pleased to find it .
Anna Maria O@@ re@@ li M@@ M has ended with a good 18@@ th anniversary .
Mr O@@ reli@@ o did not b@@ lend , because he is training in the winter bridge .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; said a little fa@@ iry .
at the London Olympic Assembly , an almost full family of people , did they carry people around or were able to get off ?
I have returned , but in positive terms .
everybody says it will - that is true !
if you compete , you will be able to know .
I have finished over the course of the debate and have many good competitions for him : &apos; I have come here with the 3@@ 2nd , the last outcome , of this season , to finish in 18@@ th place .
it is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and it is the only thing that counts .
I will take on a good deal of experience and , some days , I want to compete on behalf of the coin .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina Governor announced party change
Jim Justice , the Western @-@ Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a Democrat Governor , announced at the gathering of Thursday evening with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i that he would change political parties .
&apos;@@ W@@ h@@ y it or not , the democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; having been a great fan and admi@@ red ... today , I say to you , the Western Ty@@ ra@@ vi@@ ans , that I can no longer help you as a democratic govern@@ or . &quot;
S@@ ili@@ ts to joy were suspended at the assembly .
&quot; so I will be Re@@ publi@@ can , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a co@@ ke , I would say it is time to play a different game . &quot;
the T@@ ru@@ mp had previously committed a major announcement at the gathering of West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
T@@ ru@@ mp won 42 points in Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and Justice did not support H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton as a Democrat candidate .
Justice , the only bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the State of For@@ bes@@ hal@@ i , was elected in 2016 .
the Ford notes that it has coal mines in five states and coal trading in its own right .
it is worth around USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday night , the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) published an announcement that &apos; the party change of the Governor , Justice , is yet another blow to the democratic family that would prevent it from getting better , rather than working for it &apos; .
&quot; just 15 sta@@ rs and controls on the lowest number of states in history - the Governor , Justice , &apos;s announcement is just the most recent expression of a par@@ ade that is in a position to complete the pipeline and cannot find a positive and united message , &quot; said Daniel B@@ S New@@ si , R@@ N@@ C , R@@ on@@ na Man@@ ik .
it is hardly surprising that there are many people , many injured , too .
Ur@@ met , in a photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic pres@@ ch@@ ool , said yesterday to the jury that they had to share a lot of pos@@ ters .
plants and mar@@ ches are fundamental , dele@@ ver@@ ti@@ tious and slight .
of course , we must also have a statement in the past and in the past .
visitors will come out to the festi@@ val with false foot@@ wear , according to Ur@@ me@@ t , and so the problems will come .
the media have also had to assist a few people who are more injured - there have been s@@ care@@ mon@@ gering and also one foot in the foot .
we have also made bo@@ gs when people have gone out or have broken the finger .
we are doing less in this place , sending more to hospital .
watch the video whether the sole@@ mn media will be pain@@ kil@@ ler for the treatment of po@@ p@@ hi@@ le .
D@@ em@@ ic@@ y@@ cle of Russians for the D@@ us@@ can@@ na@@ go@@ ate
S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , the international force in the Ker@@ ge@@ an , praised him as &apos; Russia &apos;s F@@ air excuse &apos; for the D@@ oping scandal &apos; , but repeated that this is not the time to allow sport back .
in the wake of the IA@@ AF Congress , held at the World C@@ up in the wake of the ath@@ le@@ tes &apos; World C@@ up , D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lak@@ h@@ tin , the Russian ath@@ le@@ te was saying that the ban on the contest is right and has a firm objective of combating doping .
he has apolog@@ ised to &quot; All light men who are stranded at the gold and sil@@ ver med@@ als in competitions . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the ban on the contest introduced in November 2015 , following the adoption of the W@@ AD@@ A report , which provided evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I believe it was a very fair response , a very honest presentation , today , &quot; said Co@@ e , President of the IAEA .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that Russia itself admitted that they had had had quite difficult times and do everything possible to re@@ organise the U@@ U . &quot;
in addition , Co@@ e was pleased that Russia accepted its own sustainability criteria .
&quot; I believe it was a very constructive day today and progress is being made , but the Congress supports the group &apos;s proposal that this is not the time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything we can in the next few months to bring the situation back to normal .
we have always based on the principle of wanting to separate pure spor@@ ts@@ men from the system , &quot; he added .
N@@ in@@ teen Russian ath@@ le@@ tes meeting the strict criteria of IA@@ AF will compete as neutral ath@@ le@@ tes at the World C@@ up matches to be launched in London on Friday .
R@@ une Andersson , head of the IA@@ AF Group , said on Monday that Russia is not yet meeting a number of criteria for reconstruction .
following a presentation by the IA@@ AF Council , he told journalists in London that doping controls were still insufficient and that the training officers who had banned were still operating freely .
the electric car revolution is a significant shift in the demand for honey .
who are the winners and losers ?
not least that the electric car revolution will revolu@@ tion@@ ise everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure , it will also generate new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although mining gi@@ ants like G@@ len@@ core can say that they will win from one place and lose the other , the smaller mining companies will not help .
today , G@@ len@@ core is coal and oil , but co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ ism will continue to increase in the era of electric cars .
this year contributions have been increased by the governments of the UK , France and Norway to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades .
so Vol@@ vo has already knew that it is designed to abandon the combustion engine and that T@@ es@@ la will bring 3 electric cars to a cheaper market .
B@@ loom@@ berg New Energy Finance estimates that electricity cars are sold more than cars used for oil in a space of two decades .
&quot; on some metals it will change everything , says to Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ ini B@@ loom@@ berg , the raw materials analysis for venture economics .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as code and li@@ thi@@ um , which have been growing in demand for years .
there are about three times more adverse reactions in the power sector than in the normal car , G@@ len@@ core announced .
more is needed at charging stations , which is why Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that demand will increase by around 5 % by 2025 .
the growth in demand for bat@@ teries in electric cars will mean additional demand for li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ gan@@ ans .
G@@ len@@ core will generate a growing revenue from the electric car trend and will be the world &apos;s largest co@@ balt producer , predi@@ cting J@@ eff@@ eries Group .
this bro@@ ker is estimated to be winners of F@@ ree@@ port @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First @-@ Qu@@ an@@ tum Min@@ er@@ als .
the market is responding to a trend that is already changing .
this year 70 % of the surface of the London me@@ tal code has been caught .
the increase in the soil was 37 % .
14 % has also been p@@ oured up this year , mainly because of economic growth .
the G@@ len@@ core excise duty in London rose by 20 % , above the price increases for the Rio T@@ to Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ on and Ang@@ lo Americ@@ as .
on the side of the b@@ os@@ s , lead companies like Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine are the ones to adapt to the new era .
the main end @-@ of @-@ door use is the supply of flow@@ ers to petrol and diesel engines .
the power vehicles use li@@ thi@@ um cells .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other uses to overcome the fall in demand &quot; the Bank of America Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ chi &apos;s Me@@ Me@@ teoro@@ logical Market analytical leader Michael W@@ id@@ mer .
the impact of the dri@@ f@@ ting trend is not yet notic@@ eable .
the figure has risen to 17 % this year , with prices for the main industrial metals in London being the best me@@ tre .
investors will see the problems for me@@ tal in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure it is so bad for lead because it is low @-@ cost oil is keeping the normal cars in competition &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the ven@@ dor Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ s .
if there is a fall in demand , it is slow .
it could be in about ten years .
in the meantime , stricter emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars , which are more frequent to trigger engines from advanced lead @-@ based bat@@ teries , will be measured by the international lead and the Ku@@ ni research organisation .
L@@ igh@@ ten metals like alu@@ mini@@ um replace steel , as it is easier to drive a car further away from less electricity .
this is already explained by an additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes for 2013 @-@ 2016 .
it represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s production of alu@@ mini@@ um .
this trend is likely to intensify , as W@@ id@@ mer said .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um has been falling by 13 % this year , as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
steel manufacturers won &apos;t .
the holding works with General Motors to use nano@@ technologies to produce mi@@ rac@@ les .
also , Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and Europe are trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down to face the minimum .
&quot; a strong message should be an answer to this development , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Pari@@ b@@ asi Me@@ x Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
some progress is being made in Europe .
an end to the oil era could also bring pla@@ gue to the pla@@ te .
around half of this precious diesel engine has been used as cataly@@ sts for cars , with the me@@ mo@@ sa@@ ic@@ ist Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ it announced .
&quot; many of the raw materials with high demand , such as oil and pla@@ tin@@ um , may not face much demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h , Na@@ ti@@ x@@ ise raw materials analy@@ sts .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important , but will change in importance over the course of 15 years .
Pla@@ in@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ farmers believe that there is continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , leader of Un@@ core said that more hybrid cars would continue to be sold in 2025 .
the great hope of the Pla@@ in@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ on manufacturers in the 10 @-@ year perspective is for cars based on a hydrogen element developed by To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Mot@@ or and Hy@@ unda@@ i Mo@@ to@@ s , which are dependent on pos@@ turing their own energy to generate a hydrogen @-@ based electricity .
however , until now , this technology has not proved commercial .
&quot; on the road to electric cars , a clear lo@@ opho@@ le seems to be in place for the latter , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris from Br@@ bas@@ et .
the German car manufacturers suffered a great set@@ back in July , as the S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art Court prohibited the use of diesel in the city of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how the T@@ reasury rules affect the upcoming UK changeover
the rules to prevent the exces@@ ses of European football clubs do not prevent the record global transfer of the Ney@@ ge World football clubs from the Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main France .
any consequences from UEFA , the governing body that govern@@ s the European game and can prevent teams from taking part in the World K@@ ings Group , the Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ May .
the Financial Regulation for F@@ F@@ F@@ F@@ F@@ P , introduced by UEFA in 2011 , will mean that PS@@ G will have to provide some evidence that the tak@@ e@@ over was funded without massive losses .
EUR 2@@ 22 million was paid to Barcelona ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) alone for buying an Austrian out of his contract , and the wages of Ney@@ mark will reach tens of tens of millions of dollars per year .
there are some financial aspects of the integration of the Ney@@ mar into the French club .
PS@@ G will undoubtedly be able to pay for the recruitment of Ney@@ ra and to put money into the po@@ cket of its sta@@ ple missile , given that the team is funded by the family in the Ka@@ tar unit .
there is a lot of money available to clubs to take up players , but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that will enable them to get out of football business .
Michel Pla@@ tini launched the foundation for F@@ P after he was elected as President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs that would fail to invest in high debt were actually engaged in fraud and risk ruin if banks or owners had to give up support .
from 2011 , F@@ P will focus on monitoring their losses instead of remaining in the position of the clubs .
this amendment means that the business model used by Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch first in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ sea - to buy a club with potential and then to spend a lot to make a better team and create a global brand - is harder to implement .
F@@ F@@ F@@ P during the current three @-@ year evaluation period , which runs until 2018 , can cause up to â‚¬ 30 million of losses to clubs .
and despite the dis@@ repu@@ table presidential office of Pla@@ tini in 2015 , his successor to UEFA , Alexander ander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , remains committed to ob@@ struc@@ ting excessive waste .
&quot; F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will continue to reinforce these rules , &quot; said Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , the UEFA @-@ F@@ P Supervisor , to The associated WTO .
while at the same time they can allocate this amount to the full due diligence of the over@@ purchase clause of Ney@@ mark , they can allocate it to the full part of the contract for the purpose of accounting .
the 5 @-@ year agreement is the result of which it will be possible to translate the transitional levy into â‚¬ 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million per year over the next five years .
in 2014 , with the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions , Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga , a member of Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , received the worst penalties .
the â‚¬ 60 million fine ( at this moment $ 82 million ) was imposed on the PS@@ G , which was subsequently reduced to â‚¬ 20 million , and was requested to limit the team of Me@@ ici@@ les to 21 players during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of business as usual 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs to try to penet@@ rate the regulatory institutions by blow@@ ing up their revenues via business @-@ owners in @-@ club .
while a Q@@ a@@ tar company may spon@@ sor PS@@ G , if the value of spon@@ sorship is deemed to be above standard market rates , UEFA would not accept this as official income .
this was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the PS support was s@@ las@@ hed .
it has been said that a certain part of the Ney@@ mark PS@@ G services could be helped by the Ka@@ infrastructure in the form of contributions from the World C@@ up Board of 20 years .
however , Re@@ por@@ ters and Ka@@ tar 20@@ 22 say that the Ney@@ ra could become a world champi@@ on@@ ship and that UEFA &apos;s regulators could easily reveal such manoeuv@@ res .
the earlier penalties for the PS@@ G mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not addressed the transition pro@@ actively with the PS@@ G .
they have said with The &apos; The associated P@@ C &apos; that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
recent reports show that , during the 2015 @-@ 2016 period , more than â‚¬ 10 million of profits for the PS will be generated at around â‚¬ 54@@ 2.4 million .
no data has yet been published for the last financial year .
D@@ EP@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ mark will have a positive impact on spon@@ sorship , trade and sales marking .
the study is expected to increase by at least 30 % of the contract .
Spain , being clearly irri@@ tated by the departure of one of the largest football sta@@ rs , sought to prevent the tak@@ e@@ over , saying that the PS@@ G is in breach of F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear case of &quot; financial doping &quot; with the club and country , &quot; said President Javier T@@ eb@@ as , Spanish newspaper , referring to the fact that the PS@@ G is mainly in Ka@@ tar .
Ar@@ sene W@@ en@@ ger , a re@@ ig@@ ner of Ar@@ sen@@ al &apos;s club , shares the attitude of La with the latter to fund the club .
&quot; this is the result of ownership and has fully changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; wherever a club belongs to the state , it is possible .
it is very difficult to respect financial rules for fair play , as the country can have other ways or interests to represent such a major player . &quot;

For@@ ti@@ eth anniversary today : the hur@@ ric@@ ane storm in Estonia , which was tor@@ n down by ro@@ of@@ s and win@@ dows .
the hur@@ ric@@ ane , which was cited as stor@@ my for the century and ra@@ ging on 6 and 7 August , resulted in major damage , particularly to the West , the Car@@ the@@ ast and the Rap@@ id countries .
in the North Estonia , over 30 m / s was at the wind during these days .
in my old me@@ dal , one of the tic@@ ked trees in the gar@@ den was coming to the other and being indul@@ ged in a hand@@ ful of support .
it was all in a dark and char@@ ming way , as the world has done .
the former had already had their ro@@ of@@ s off the houses , and in 2002 , L@@ inda K@@ uro@@ va , an interview with the jury in an interview with the Estonian design .
the wife of L@@ inda saw the property he was sitting on cras@@ h .
what sort of support do you have , though , with hands , where you are suffering such stor@@ ms ?
the sea came under the window , from win@@ dows in the field &quot; Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us Kal@@ da spoke at the time .
the web runs full and the ro@@ of of at the stations had flo@@ wn 20 @-@ 30 metres away , saw the majority of the shar@@ k kil@@ os just next morning .
in local terms , there was a wood that was lagging behind , some shooting , some han@@ ging .
everyone saw the very de@@ pressing storm , with gri@@ ef and pragmatism like war from the beautiful old trees .
Western Vir@@ u@@ maa was not particularly hard hit in August 19@@ 57 , but was also very severe in the Western Estonia , as Vir@@ u@@ maa Official wrote in 2007 .
the De@@ ph@@ on L@@ ossi@@ park and the P@@ ad@@ is park were swe@@ pt from swe@@ et , but our para@@ tus par@@ ks were also severely damaged .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured at 35 metres per second , or some 130 km per hour .
on the evening of August , a small series of c@@ r@@ ings of lead had s@@ log@@ ans s@@ ounding the s@@ log@@ ans : &apos; mother , mother !
&apos;@@ F@@ ro@@ m in the air , the Vir@@ u@@ maa Official Journal has signed up no longer ! &apos;
the concept of the Bu@@ il@@ ding in the Vil@@ j@@ an@@ di@@ ary was so deci@@ de@@ dly destroyed during the storm that it was then then then then disman@@ tled .
the design of the ski car@@ ro@@ ts , which was not subsequently restored , did not survive the T@@ y@@ ri ski premium .
on 12 August 19@@ 62 the Pun@@ ane T@@ una newspaper wrote that the removal of towns and settlements from de@@ pressed trees and their ox@@ y@@ gen would slow , and that the residents would be free to wear cleaning works .
the crop fields were severely hit , and the newspaper announced that &apos; party @-@ root organisations must be an incentive for and a gu@@ ide@@ line for both maintenance and fer@@ tility . &apos;
the window can be reported if the average speed exceeds 3@@ 2.7 m / s .
the dramatic record in Estonia remains unchanged from 2 November 19@@ 69 , when the Ru@@ h@@ nu@@ l measured for wind radiation at 48 m / s .
the only story in the island was broken by a measure , so the speed of the strong wind measured could not be recorded in detail .
secret of live bathing areas : night cleaning work and poor coastal face
Se@@ g@@ le@@ ct summer d@@ well@@ ings also mean less duplication at the be@@ aches of Tallinn .
&apos;@@ I@@ f there are people on the coast , and if not , there are no people , &apos; , the be@@ ach is repli@@ ed .
the c@@ r@@ usta@@ r@@ ings in S@@ tro@@ om land in Northern Tallinn are being tor@@ n .
they are offered a se@@ am@@ less tra@@ ctor to a fa@@ ke pl@@ ough at a sub@@ prime competitive wh@@ im .
in fact , the last one s@@ ands from a seven @-@ me@@ tre depth , pul@@ ling out of it a sea ba@@ g and leaving people in danger : bot@@ tom@@ less s@@ ands , s@@ wine con@@ s and others .
people are still on the coast , whether it is water or not .
if it is nice , people are on the coast , and if not , there are no people , &quot; Alexander U@@ so@@ v , the head of the T@@ ow@@ er administration says .
there is a bitter duplication in the be@@ ach at 6.@@ 30 p.m. , because at 8 : 00 , the record must be in order for people .
the job is already at 4 p@@ m .
besides S@@ tro@@ om , he is still keeping a check on the village of P@@ iri@@ ta , Har@@ ku La@@ ke , Ka@@ ku@@ mÃ¤@@ e and Pal@@ jas@@ a@@ is P@@ ik@@ ak@@ r .
the amounts have been reduced .
there were many more years ago .
people can now already assess what is being done for them , &quot; U@@ so@@ v , who has harves@@ ted a living for 15 years .
it was the case before that , when something new was standing , it was broken next day .
what is in the field is now being kept .
price of clean shore
one of the biggest work on the Estonian coast is the clean @-@ up of se@@ af@@ aring marine waste , or equipment .
for example , it has to be ship@@ ped 400 000 tonnes of coast@@ line in the P@@ iri@@ ta coast .
&quot; this is un@@ beli@@ evable , it is encouraging .
in the second big category , it is the municipal rub@@ b@@ ish , all that people leave .
eight large waste b@@ read@@ cru@@ mb@@ s at the lower @-@ end zones of S@@ tro@@ om are needed for tri@@ pling three times a week .
there is so much waste .
however , the cold summer papers have meant that there is a fifth less rub@@ b@@ ish than there was any other way .
the third is a de@@ ser@@ t .
these are mostly cargo .
as a result , dozens of South @-@ West cars have been driven out of the U@@ so@@ v sand .
they will wait for the owners to take the wood route .
&quot; normally , they will come out more , but it is normal , &quot; and they will be aware that they will soon be found in the sand .
children come on board and take toys to get them in the sand again .
landfill
Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler , representative of hospital administrative services , conce@@ des that the riding of a tra@@ ctor is disrup@@ ted by local activities .
noise , which runs from night to night , is disrup@@ ted by the breeding of people in the vic@@ inity .
but this work is impossible on the day .
a month has to be spent two ri@@ ches .
&apos;@@ I@@ f we do not , we will be fined by the city &apos; , Mr Sch@@ ol@@ ler will note .
but the aim is to get S@@ tro@@ omi rand below the international s@@ ini@@ mon@@ g mark , along with P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ r and Per@@ sia .
&quot; there is much more work in Estonia to keep the be@@ aches &quot; says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more je@@ wel@@ le@@ ry and temp@@ les and more difficulty in talking .
there is less rub@@ b@@ ish on our be@@ aches than there is in Europe .
in the cro@@ wn , in the field of S@@ tro@@ om , Martin is in@@ coer@@ i@@ tum in@@ duc@@ ed to the circle of inter@@ views between journalist and cor@@ k workers , highlighting the current bottlenecks .
Hom@@ mi@@ min@@ t is a sight of the gallery everywhere .
the problem is with birds and pu@@ mps who have pul@@ led rub@@ b@@ ish bags , &quot; Martin reports .
although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the city council will take action with b@@ lending and , for example , impose a car@@ ve @-@ out to them to prevent the poultry from getting out there at least .
in general , however , Martin is happy with developments in S@@ tro@@ omi &apos;s field .
the city is looking after it .
it has become more ple@@ asing with children &apos;s s@@ ongs , enligh@@ tened and fresh roads .

Bank of England holds interest rates 0.@@ 25 %
Bank of England is expected to announce interest rates remain at the same level as weak growth and inflation mitigation have cus@@ hi@@ oned speculation on the rise .
Bank of England has warned that growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish as the tight incomes of households have set interest rates on demand .
the Bank &apos;s monetary policy committee ( MP@@ C ) was voting in favour of keeping rates at 0.@@ 25 % below levels 6 : 2 ; less members are expected to increase this month , as slow growth has weakened support for growth .
in its quar@@ terly report on inflation , the Bank has cut its growth forecast to 1.7 % in 2017 and at around 1.6 % in 2018 , and warned that the pressure on household incomes is ten@@ se as inflation is expected to continue to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the bank sign@@ alled that the increase in rates is necessary to contain inflation from Bre@@ x over the next few years and that the financial markets could have the necessary rise above the expected cost of borrowing .
Members also voted in favour of partial withdrawal of the Mil@@ k Package , triggered a year ago by Bre@@ x@@ t .
the Bank will close a fixed @-@ term financing scheme in February , which will provide cheap funding to banks , although it said it would now be expected to offer an increase of Â£ 15 billion , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; GDP in the M@@ C aver@@ ba@@ seline remains power@@ less in the near future , as the difficult income situation in households continues to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
on the inflation cap , it was repeated that &apos; some effort by fiscal policy &apos; is needed to alleviate inflation , and to some extent &apos; somewhat higher than expected on the markets .
the BÃ¶ge Plan is currently forecast to rise in the first quarter of next year and in 2020 .
but the bank stressed that any hy@@ per@@ tension was gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % in line with the estimates from May .
the 1.8 % growth forecast for 2018 remained .
after that news , the p@@ ound fell against the dollar and the euro .
a 0.5 % decrease to 1.@@ 31 dollars and 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to reject change is due to recent disappointing growth figures , which have sh@@ run@@ k growing expectations of an increase in GDP growth of 0.@@ 3 % in the second quarter of last three months .
the bank is likely to say that there will be a 0.@@ 3 % increase in the third quarter , although a little momentum will be collected at the end of the year .
the latest inflation report by the Bank gave little reason to jo@@ ke inflation and pi@@ tiful rises to households suffering from the increase , saying that improvements are going a little worse .
it was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income from hitting back in the next few years , but a notic@@ eable recovery is expected for the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
the weak pay@@ out also encourages the economy to increase British production , which partly compensa@@ tes for lower consumer costs .
the decision comes one year after the EU &apos;s shocking referendum was taken last August at 0.@@ 25 % , resulting in a sudden weakening of the p@@ ound .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years to brea@@ the life into the prices and the economy .
before the bank &apos;s final decision , there was a growing demand for higher the rate as inflation had increased the pressure on households ; in July , three policy @-@ makers were demanding an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell from 2.6 % last month , to 2.9 % in June , although the bank said it was expected and a return to the up@@ turn in the coming months .
the bank said that excessive growth in comparison to the 2 % target was due to the down@@ side .
Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , the head of Co@@ rec@@ o mortgage bro@@ kers said : &apos; in light of the recent decline in exchange rates , the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again , as len@@ ders ye@@ ar@@ n and hope to complete the year &apos;s positive work .
the BÃ¶ge dividend to those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as re@@ financing , often service @-@ absor@@ bing and low @-@ rate , seems to be increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS is writing a HIV drug which has been controversial to 10 000 people
patients have since September access to a trans@@ forma@@ tive HIV treatment following a battle in court on whether the N@@ HS should finance a medicine .
N@@ HS has announced that public health services are now making an initial 3 @-@ year clinical trial available to 10@@ ,000 people during an estimated 3 @-@ year clinical trial - a pre@@ @-@ to @-@ peer alert ta@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t that is pre @-@ applied before the interim arrangement and has shown a potential risk of a nearly 86 % reduction in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people .
the N@@ HS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the Supreme Court supported last year &apos;s decision by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS is capable of paying for Pr@@ EP , despite the authority &apos;s own asser@@ tions that it should finance the medicine directly from local authorities .
Simon Ste@@ vens , Executive Director of N@@ HS Eng@@ land , welcomed the release of this initiative on Thursday as &apos; major new med@@ dling &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as &apos; turning moments &apos; .
I@@ r@@ ho@@ wing clin@@ ics in London , B@@ righ@@ ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ l and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to register , and further clin@@ ics will follow in October , before the programme is introduced throughout England by April 2018 .
the pre @-@ HIV infection ( Pr@@ EP ) is a hot@@ line for HIV medi@@ cation , which is preceded by an interim arrangement to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that the Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk .
Pr@@ EP &apos;s inclusion prior to the incident means that sufficient drugs are available in the body of the person that is preventing HIV infections .
these medicines can be taken daily or two hours before the rec@@ ess .
L@@ GB@@ T selection includes men of homo@@ sexual or bis@@ ex@@ ual origin , trans@@ gender people and people with HIV and with no treatment .
the clinical persons identify suitable people willing to participate in a clinical trial , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those with an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral benefit .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor can also register their interest in a local sexual health clinical into the scheme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and N@@ HS England signed the Treaty to get medicines this week after the international procurement process .
the clinical trial aims to assess the real potential of the Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who is destined for the medicine and how it is consumed and implemented in a big picture .
Ste@@ vens said : &apos; this new massive intervention should complement and leverage a comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
it is a milestone in the fight against one of the greatest challenges to human health in more than three decades . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , Man@@ aging Director of NA@@ T , said : &quot; this is a turning point in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if targeted correctly at those in need and at risk @-@ class groups , offers the opportunity to transform Britain &apos;s HIV epidemic .
since September , through this clinical attempt funded by the N@@ HS , people with high HIV risks in England have access to a powerful new tool which is individually managed and is not dependent on dialogue with the partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian Green , Executive Director of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Fund , said : &quot; now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is quickly pushed over the country and that no HIV @-@ risk group is excluded .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of HIV infection .
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Public Health , said : &apos; the start of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delay and le@@ ctures by the government &apos;s feet .
evidence shows how much this medicine can bring to the end of HIV prevention and the spreading of life @-@ changing infections .
this clinical attempt will bring us one step closer to fully understanding of the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
it is now important that a clinical attempt is implemented as soon as possible across the country to protect people with HIV exposure and move us one step closer to halting HIV transmission in society . &quot;
electricity prices went down by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the difference in the price differ@@ ential between the next day &apos;s stock exchange rate between Latvia and Lithuania fell to 1.@@ 94 euro , up from â‚¬ 7.@@ 71 in June this year .
the main reason for the difference is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia the average electricity exchange rate last month was â‚¬ 3@@ 4.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour , and the price increased by 12 % from June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by 5 % to 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ tt hour .
in Finland the price was â‚¬ 3@@ 4.@@ 17 and the 3@@ half of the electricity exchanges had a cost of â‚¬ 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour .
prices rose by 12 % and 7 % respectively .
an electricity from Estonia and Finland reached 75 % of the previous hours towards Estonia and 16 % from Estonia in Finland .
no deals took place between the other nine % of the hours two countries for the next day .
electricity from Estonia and Latvia reached 99 % of the time at Latvia and from Latvia to Latvia in the Czech and 73 % of the total capacity for transmission was available .
Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X , according to transactions on the last July trading day , could generate a market price for electricity in August at around 34 â‚¬ and 37 â‚¬ per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t .
the carbon price affected by electricity prices increased last month , and transactions were at a price of between 5.@@ 04 and 5.@@ 47 â‚¬ per tonne .
living in higher education - half @-@ time design Poles have transformed it into home of the little Ear@@ ls Court cor@@ k cor@@ ps
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , former ban@@ ker with passion for a building innova@@ tor , exchanged his great K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge house in 2014 against the Ear@@ ls Court cor@@ ti in London .
it is in the first order of Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ race and that Jo@@ anne has not pac@@ ked up his bags and passed on the fla@@ rer is an honour to a new design .
&quot; before that , I lived on much stronger ground with a former life @-@ co in K@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking at something equivalent to the price I have offered .
I was given the Ear@@ ls Court of charge and had the same high levels .
I was we@@ aring a head on it and making a deal on the same day . &quot;
since its first visit , this 93 @-@ square me@@ tre cor@@ ps has passed a full innovation plant .
it was a s@@ lee@@ ping cor@@ k and a complicated flat : a kit@@ chen had to be wal@@ ked through to get a s@@ lee@@ ping ball ; Jo@@ anne wanted to add housing and half @-@ order to exploit the high levels .
&quot; I wanted a lot of light , high @-@ quality win@@ dows .
they were my demands , &apos; he said .
she was nominated by the archite@@ ctural and de@@ sig@@ ner of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi , who works in the hill , Du@@ ck &amp; shed to exploit a figure of 3.@@ 8 m and create a home that is not just a development site but a place where Jo@@ anne can live .
the band was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so architecture was the qu@@ asi @-@ challenge to stand up .
there was a creative approach to the issue .
&quot; it is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise the facilities without having to sit on one another .
it was not just about building a platform , but about using steel structures to get beyond and bottom . &quot;
this emphasis enabled Er@@ fan@@ m to build two full @-@ time rooms in the room with a number of dramatic elements .
the old @-@ age light will be opened to a new gla@@ m@@ eric housing in line with the R@@ et@@ rou@@ us window .
the gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly Ser@@ ge Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille highlights space .
the use of mir@@ rors will play a role in the inclusion of theat@@ re , space and lighting .
mir@@ rors have been added to both ends of a short corridor to make it more ambitious .
in K@@ Ã¶Ã¶@@ k , I will give the impression of a second tuna window .
the display provides a reflection on the site for all the Ren@@ de@@ mic and glass claims of Jo@@ anne .
there is a possibility to close the kit@@ chen if it is not used , creating a more flu@@ id space for the image of housing .
the cu@@ ri@@ o@@ id kit@@ chen is nothing new .
however , there is a unique fact in this kit@@ chen that it is a visible display of the art of neoliber@@ als .
&quot; it has gone a bit to design , &quot; explains the M@@ D@@ F spo@@ iled in a stronger spo@@ use of Er@@ fan .
it has a counter@@ weight , which makes it very simple to push for . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne now has 16 additional metres , additional s@@ lee@@ ping permission and a better flat plan .
&quot; after all , it is the sale of what you sell - or what gives value to property - &apos; that says Er@@ fan &apos; .
&quot; the detention camp takes the form of an out@@ mo@@ ded wh@@ im and makes calculations based on the surface area . &quot;
here they have been able to increase the navig@@ ability of the floor using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury status to the premises .
&apos;@@ I@@ f materials are what you touched and thus help to build emotional links with your home , &apos; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; you are not b@@ ent on electricity c@@ ables in pig .
it is important , but it is not a language @-@ friendly way of thinking . &quot;
it shows that good design and increased surface areas are helping to make something quite ama@@ zing from the normal cor@@ ps .
in fact , they can do so entirely , as happened with Jo@@ anne .
He@@ ro@@ my , a key figure in Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s cloud heating , is a hea@@ cow competing with her fellow Member for a taste of service .
there is no question of the amount of money that is earned , without which ethics is forgotten .
she sees her wife and three children as a mere early @-@ day and late hour .
in the first part of the film , one feels like a speech from Mr Bu@@ tle@@ r is the business world in the Ka@@ ar@@ di@@ house - even in S@@ pac@@ ey and Mr Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s voice .
the further film , the less skil@@ ful element remains , and the mor@@ alising intention of film @-@ makers is becoming more and more apparent .
cancer is a key pe@@ as@@ ant disease experience .
a choice must now be made between professional and family life .
the po@@ et who is s@@ inging from the profession makes fathers think in the major building power in Ch@@ ic@@ ago about what is really important things , such as religion , ch@@ arity , love ... , without even affecting the twin sectors .
after the third st@@ ole where a son opens a eye , it seems to feel that film @-@ makers have certainly been driven by the goal of getting a pu@@ mp out of the pu@@ mp , because even the most basic fo@@ ol@@ ish vie@@ wer is unable to hold the te@@ ars back in the face of the suffering of a army @-@ sick bo@@ y .
if the son falls into the home and looks almost hope@@ less , the father will finally understand the moral mor@@ ality of his work and work for a man who is seeking a ch@@ arity .
now I am putting a stra@@ ta on my own - if a film has a happy film , then I reward my dis@@ cer@@ n@@ ment after the film coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , at least one surprise can be praised for at least one .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ic@@ on will be removed from the place - when the spo@@ use calls a sick person and the man will storm the corridor name in slow motion .
the baby has been brea@@ th@@ ed , however , and although his father has just lost his job , it is also proving to be positive , because there is now time to deal with the family .
I feel well , too - I can predict quite well the end of the American dra@@ ma !
in truth , the film is well designed , all the elements are there .
you can , you can lau@@ gh , actors are good and there is a moral beau@@ ty : money is not the most important thing in life .
it is a very good film .
the new staff chief of T@@ ru@@ p intends to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps Mr Kelly can do it .
he would then be the first .
Mr Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff chief of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope of red@@ ressing the over@@ s .
a trial is available from Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ i , a repor@@ ter ,
&quot; on his first day of office , he brought together senior staff members , John F@@ . Kelly , the new chief of the White House , in the White House , to the White House , in the White House , which he intends to address the poor information of the Va@@ tic@@ an into the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly said he needed to go through the information , either on paper or in meetings , because the President would do better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried and failed to track his media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television dates decades behind and , even now that he is in the White House , his television viewing habits have not gone away .
&quot; if he was anno@@ yed by the unfair media coverage , he was fairly ex@@ cited in the pres@@ ti@@ gious ex@@ ts he was en@@ gen@@ dered , &quot; said S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , the previous campaig@@ ner in February .
Poli@@ tic@@ o tara Pal@@ mer wrote at the time that &quot; six former campaig@@ ners said that the key to driving behaviour on T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter is to ensure that his own media consumption also has a stable praise . &quot;
well .
the idea that the habits of using the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is a nonsense .
perhaps those campaig@@ ners will know something else that is not known by others of us as the promoters would have been even more acute without their interventions .
we probably never know about the remains that was not signed by T@@ ru@@ mp .
if he could rescue him a couple of times from the sha@@ kes , their efforts were worth doing that .
nobody has been able to prevent T@@ ru@@ p from continually po@@ lem@@ ing .
part of the problem is that in the White House , which makes up competing cli@@ cks , people try to promote their own interests without exception by sending materials to the T@@ ru@@ w , supporting their world view but always not trus@@ ting .
Poli@@ tic@@ o , the whole story , wrote in May suspi@@ cious information to the President of the advis@@ ors about the pro@@ pen@@ sity to feed .
one example of the report , quoted by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher , is :
&quot; today &apos;s and former T@@ ru@@ p says that T@@ ru@@ mp can react to negative press , particularly infection with adverse effects , by explo@@ ding by taking root ideas on identifying the source .
this was the case at the end of February , when someone was lu@@ cky enough to give a copy of the web@@ stream of information to the President , Charles C. The website to Joh@@ n@@ son , G@@ ot@@ s.@@ New@@ com , accus@@ ing the de@@ sig@@ ner of staff officer , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , that he was the &apos; source of a series of information &apos; in a White House .
it is no difference that , because of s@@ log@@ ans , Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked from Twitter or offered no concrete evidence or has mis@@ charges and withdrawn from Twitter in the past .
I read the article and asked the House about Wal@@ sh@@ i . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us , the top staff at that time , and Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , head of the White House , &quot; has tried to establish a system for managing and documentation documents that reaches T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how was it ?
Mr Kelly will try to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than he was in the Pri@@ eb@@ t , but T@@ ru@@ mp will remain robust and will continue to compete for influence .
these im@@ mo@@ va@@ ble factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans from abroad are not allowed to go on display .
there is a lot of ex@@ patri@@ ation in Tallinn City .
those with which the speaker spoke acknowledged that they would play in the old town without the permission of the government .
the first was found in the front line of Vir@@ u by three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who had taken the same b@@ read@@ th .
it was clear that mus@@ ici@@ ans with rub@@ b@@ ish and sme@@ ll @-@ wa@@ ff@@ ers were in ab@@ sen@@ tia , and that one du@@ ch would take the br@@ un@@ t .
despite being so , the only woman in the company played a fu@@ n story with a la@@ me , while one man , alongside her , was in a con@@ ju@@ ring with three faces in the Congress and brought the fur@@ th@@ est winners closer .
the third man was sitting in his house alongside them and smoking the di@@ r@@ ty @-@ prepared di@@ g of di@@ g himself .
their three cha@@ mbers did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the people that passed .
Bo@@ b , who had been co@@ met with the fla@@ me and the ball , said he would be kis@@ sing in the streets for fu@@ n and money .
the explanation was designed to collect the ticket price at the same day in Finland on night .
whether they asked for permission for mus@@ cle in old areas was shak@@ en by No@@ emi and Bo@@ b .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stay in one town for more than a day or a few days , and most of these will be granted permits for a month or such a month .
there is no point in paying , &quot; explained by Bo@@ b .
when we went back to the Vir@@ u gates about 20 minutes later , we saw two women standing on the music side and wal@@ king them .
the team has cop@@ ied luck at the crossroads of the Vir@@ u centre with cop@@ ies and bags in ab@@ sen@@ tia .
three Polish young men were also present on the Vir@@ u street , one playing the f@@ ence , another ch@@ at and the third had even passed the electronic glass cur@@ ve .
&quot; we are here to enter@@ tain people to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living , &quot; explains the tri@@ o from the M@@ iv@@ os@@ h .
in the words of M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there must be permission from the municipalities to speak .
&quot; we do not have it , of course , &quot; he said by jo@@ king .
but we hope that there will be no problem if people enjoy our music .
of course , if there is a police , we go elsewhere , but try it . &quot;
the Estonian bank purchased bonds worth â‚¬ 4.@@ 36 billion in July under the Public Plan for Central Ban@@ ks of the euro area ( B@@ F@@ A ) , the Central Bank &apos;s bonds portfolio .
the ECB will not publish detailed information on purchases .
Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , President of the Estonian Bank , has previously explained that the plan for the bank assets of the Euro@@ system will include three separate purchasing programmes : covered bonds in the financial sector ( covered bonds ) , bonds backed by assets ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public debt bonds ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage the re@@ selle@@ r to invest elsewhere .
the impact of the purchase is driven by lower risk of asset generating and will act as a stimulus for investors to take on higher risks .
normally , in the framework of the public debt programme , each central bank bu@@ ys its own government bonds , no buy bonds from other countries .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is making &quot; ca@@ pi@@ tu@@ lation &quot; within the scope of the allocated capacity .
central banks also have to shop in those countries with limited debt to provide bonds to the purchasing scheme .
the Estonian Bank , while it confirms its determination , generally author@@ ises the European institutions &apos; bonds , such as the European Financial Stability Facility and EIB bonds .
the Estonian bank will buy bonds under the early purchase programme from March 2015 .
in the meantime , bonds were also obtained in Ele@@ ring , but bonds were no longer bought by the Estonian Central Bank from June 2016 .
both the Central Bank of Finland has been buying bonds from Estonia , for the sake of the central banks of the euro area since June .

some of the weal@@ thi@@ est owners of the West Mid@@ lands have returned to the ra@@ in@@ y confrontation with the determined hard @-@ line temp@@ ers who have ignored the ca@@ mp@@ us di@@ r@@ ti@@ red by the coun@@ ty to win back the ba@@ g from their cotton .
the migrants have boo@@ ked 20 tra@@ ilers on the path to a prosperous &quot; line &quot; along the streets of So@@ lih@@ ul@@ li .
they have returned to the army of hor@@ ses , children and trucks after they were pul@@ led out of the horse , children and trucks only in May , without being dis@@ tracted by the degree du@@ g to prevent their intervention by the Council .
the only group found weak levels of protection , by pul@@ ling its vehicles through the un@@ blocked part of the po@@ pp@@ y wal@@ ker .
the people of fu@@ rious ha@@ ir have been conta@@ cted by So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or , saying that &apos; there is no use in addressing the problem &apos; .
a anon@@ ymous resident said : &apos; they moved to it on Monday evening after their withdrawal from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath , where they were st@@ oned by fur@@ ni@@ tors .
it is up to the Council to dis@@ credit them for taking action because they are useless in tackling the problem .
migrants were there in May , they were pushed to go and now they are back .
they came up with more , probably tonight . &quot;
she added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors know how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect their par@@ ks .
I live on the strike and am not happy to continue to pay the full levy if the Council is not even able to prevent such a thing . &quot;
a local resident who also wished to stay anon@@ ymous said : &apos; it is ridiculous ; we saw the last of these travellers left , and a new offensive is already under way .
this time , the number has increased and even the horse has been shown in the ru@@ ins . &quot;
the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Council said : &apos; we know that there is an unacceptable camp in the land close to the stre@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k and we are working with the Police Service of So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l ; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
it will be very helpful to gather evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling the figure 101 .
it will help to create a picture for the Court if we present the case . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val will be visited by In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , among others , Minister for Culture , who is pleased that it has been possible to bring true world excellence to Estonia .
the question of why We@@ ek@@ end is so important to the pro@@ tag@@ onists at the F@@ esti@@ val is answered by Sa@@ ar that it should be asked from all those who are enjoying the full lou@@ dness of the three @-@ day festi@@ val .
he says , however , that real players in his area have arrived in the Gulf .
&quot; looking at the level of artists that has been able to be brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music j@@ arg@@ on are brought home - often not in our body &apos; , the Minister of Culture speaks .
what are the artists attending the festi@@ val to speak most ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person and an old person of a faith is certainly one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ uu@@ re@@ n , who stood up last night .
his record has shown that all of us have been self @-@ driving at some point . &quot;

up to 850 000 diesel cars are among the critics of car manufacturers
the day before the Au@@ ti announcement , B@@ M@@ W said that it provides software applications for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of B@@ M@@ W , companies believe there is &quot; more intelligent alternatives than driving restrictions &quot; , referring to European cities , including the city of B@@ M@@ W , Munich , which has been considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that it would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce exha@@ ust emissions from diesel engines .
no company described these as being re @-@ TI@@ s .
European car manufacturers have been actively promoting diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
but nitrogen ox@@ ide em@@ itted from diesel engines is classified as carcinogenic and could cause as@@ th@@ ma .
the cost of equipment to neutr@@ alise diesel emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing for car manufacturers , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car@@ makers are under thorough investigation , the Federal Chancellor , Angela Merkel , is also accused of har@@ sh@@ ing out powerful automobile manufacturers and of ignoring signs pointing to a problem .
companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , who qui@@ et@@ ly dis@@ qui@@ ced the use of so @-@ called ha@@ ir devices , which made it possible to adapt emissions to the regulations when tests were carried out on the car , but were withdrawn under normal driving conditions .
several Heads of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation from both sides of the Atlantic .
last month a former head of the Au@@ di Th@@ er@@ monu@@ clear unit , the Au@@ vel Development Division , was arrested in Germany .
the former President , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o , is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and can be prosecuted in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Au@@ di was charged with a criminal investigation concerning Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen in Germany , when the authorities accused the installation of an Audit System to circum@@ vent European emissions performance requirements , thus extending the investigative effort , which had previously been concentrated in the United States .
the inclusion of the Au@@ ti in the investigation may be a major blow to Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen by a diesel manufacturer disproportionately generates a large proportion of the profits of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen .
the Estonian school will get EU flags for â‚¬ 20 000 .
the Education Ministry intends to buy EU flags for the purpose of removing the Presidency by 1 September to the Estonian school .
overall , the EU &apos;s 5@@ 70 educational institutions will receive a total of 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 senti@@ metres .
the flags are foreseen for ex@@ pon@@ der in in@@ door areas , which must be carried out in the home rooms of high quality printed techniques with an at@@ testa@@ tion , and the ER@@ R news portal will be facilitated .
on a flag label , the text &apos; was arrested for mentioning the first presidency of the Estonian Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of the 5@@ 70 pledges is â‚¬ 20@@ ,000 in the Ministry of Education , with a single tie costing â‚¬ 35 .
the journalist &apos;s murder highlights growing danger in Mexico
weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s staff are usually gathering on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the State of S@@ Sin@@ al@@ oa , so@@ wn crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ es@@ s@@ ant drug wars .
today , however , they have been gathering their own security under the gu@@ ise of their personal tragedy .
they are told that it is important to change rou@@ tine .
two old wri@@ ters will discuss which seem safer : either to bring children to an office that was the target target for a personal attack in 2009 or to leave them home .
three words have been written by security experts to the top of the space : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask repor@@ ters to provide evidence of resistance to each piece of water , to give them impres@@ sions and insi@@ ghts .
the practice of being employed by the government or car@@ tels is suspected of being a list of drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists who are hazardous to reporting the chaos in Mexico .
there are no s@@ pur@@ ms of violence , and the majority of these journalists are published in the country , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists , since the inaugu@@ ration of President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena 1980s in December 2012 , at least 25 0@@ 89 journalists have been killed in a state of protection following attacks and threats , and seven have so far been killed in seven states .
the latest casu@@ alties include their performance and source of inspiration , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though his presence can be felt anywhere on the basis of the Salafranca pra@@ yer , a big average picture of the ver@@ ge of the ver@@ ge of the ver@@ se W@@ de@@ z@@ us , with a headline &apos; Justice &apos; and two 30@@ ken repor@@ ter , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , bears T @-@ Ã¤r@@ s@@ ke , de@@ pic@@ ting his li@@ m@@ ire pri@@ ze@@ al or a typical li@@ mo@@ rous pool .
Re@@ por@@ ters will discuss a collective trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , their dre@@ ams , their obli@@ vi@@ on , their paran@@ o@@ ia .
although a separate Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was created in 2010 to address the cases of journalists , only two cases have been brought to justice by the Committee on the Defence of F@@ GM .
as with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders , which number thousands of murders , the kil@@ lers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
the presence of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce will continue to reflect the violence in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ a , even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is more dangerous .
without data and justice on murde@@ rers , there is little benefit from the I@@ bar@@ ra meeting on security .
&quot; it &apos;s very good to waste our time in this meeting , &quot; says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , you will dis@@ trust everyone . &quot;
Val@@ dez left in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , at the University of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , on the morning of 15 May .
he managed to drive just a few quarters before two men suspended Mr Co@@ rol@@ la , who was forced to leave the car and was shot 12 times , supposedly because of the name of the newspaper , which means , in translation , the &apos; twelve @-@ th river &apos; .
an armed man dro@@ ve out in Val@@ dez &apos;s car and made an accident near it .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she left her with her and two adults .
the images are circu@@ lating freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
however , there is essentially a silence about Val@@ dez .
since the last year of the R@@ z@@ man arrest and the withdrawal of the United States in January , the Blue authorisation has been one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country , because the ri@@ val@@ ries are fighting to fill a power vacuum .
it is no difference that in the streets of Sin@@ al@@ oa , a few people , or even several people , are suddenly shot up or the dead are gro@@ cked from the bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous pa@@ tho@@ gen of drugs that is bigger than many homes .
let us not forget for a moment that the peace period indicates that only one car@@ tel is in the hands of valuable ports and the maritime state with drug routes to the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the risks of his work , the co @-@ foun@@ der and chairman of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) feels terri@@ fied that he was unable to protect his friend &apos;s head .
he believes that two mistakes favoured slaughter .
the first was an interview with D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ ze , a car@@ tel cli@@ que , competing with the Gu@@ z@@ man po@@ et , in February .
this piece of correspon@@ dence could also have been accompanied by suspected gang members buying all cop@@ ies of the publication once they reached newspaper car@@ cas@@ s .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after a crackdown took place in another newspaper news , which reported the same story .
Val@@ dez leg@@ alised itself in Mexico and abroad and is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had maintained for so long that his friends and colleagues had assumed he was in perpe@@ tual existence .
she worked as a ve@@ ter@@ repor@@ ter at the no@@ vel@@ s in 2003 , when she joined five colleagues to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling 50 @-@ dollar departments .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without tou@@ ching on the drug problem &apos; .
the newspaper was up to date with its b@@ older and fair coverage , sales and advertising .
the car@@ goes were happy to issue rigorous studies without having to be cen@@ sored and read by read@@ ers in print , which no one else could report .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot Award won a newspaper for their Latin American refle@@ ctions .
in the same year Val@@ dez , the International Prize for Freedom of the Press ( AK@@ K ) won the Val@@ dez Prize for its courage to follow the Mexic@@ an drug addiction wherever it leads .
he openly admitted to be afraid .
&quot; I want to live , &quot; he said by hosting the AK@@ P prize .
last October , in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV , he said in a speech that drug trafficking is a way of life in S@@ ha@@ space .
&quot; our head is to take on the role of volunteering in a different role .
I do not want to ask what I did in the face of so many pressures , or why I did not talk about what is happening . &quot;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ ctives is a man of Val@@ dez , a jo@@ y@@ man who bra@@ ins like mad@@ ness , a friend who gene@@ rously b@@ red emb@@ at@@ gence and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their rou@@ tine .
he always we@@ ed his hat .
he went from the office to El Khadraoui &apos;s base and was always present on the same des@@ k .
they are now asking whether he received a love of rou@@ tine .
he has also asked them to question how best to do their job and stay in life .
&quot; they do not like the ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity of their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing pla@@ tes used to carry drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not be touched , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
it results in strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ reliance even in the best time .
entr@@ us@@ ting their in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sme@@ ll dubious , cold @-@ handed .
in the words of And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ al , the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the problem is that &apos; the od@@ our can be chea@@ ted ... and so was that of J@@ avi@@ er &apos; .
he and others are saying that the old rules no longer apply in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ a , just as they do not apply to the toxic combination of profit @-@ bearing smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials in Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ d , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ iro or other states .
the landscape is changing all the time .
suddenly , in the space where Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers met for security training , mobile phones were not permitted ; a few days before , it was revealed that only a but@@ tress sold to governments had been used to track journalists and activists in Mexico .
two police officers in front of the house sought relief from the 40 @-@ degree monthly pu@@ mp , in the shadow of the pu@@ mp .
the government has set up a special office for the holding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s central neighbourhood , which is in the four regular buildings .
some repor@@ ters were qu@@ ib@@ bles about whether the 50 % of the police are in the pool of police officers whose govern@@ ors themselves have been dis@@ credi@@ ted as un@@ reliable .
several months have passed since repor@@ ters have moved to mountain areas where controls are de facto drug gan@@ gs .
the Du@@ o@@ do@@ ce edition of this week addressed three key le@@ ctures .
one was the murder in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ a of the former bo@@ xing @-@ leg@@ end Ju@@ li@@ o intolerance by Cha@@ vez ven@@ na .
in addition , they had an un@@ covered story of spending government money on the home@@ town of the govern@@ or .
and the che@@ f group of people from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , which is located from the office of the Prosecutor &apos;s office , from one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants .
there was no official announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how it happened , so caution had to be exercised when it was time to write what everyone in the town knows , Mr Berlusconi is a ha@@ bit of both drug traffickers and the authorities .
the film was reported in public documents as being registered with the names of a politician in power in the Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , dominated by all policy levels almost throughout the previous century .
several IR@@ P Governor have recently been accused of corruption with widespread coverage of cases .
the Vil@@ lar@@ line has asked the repor@@ ter to write previous incidents in the same place , including the way in which the son of Gu@@ z@@ man , who wear the name El Chap@@ man , esca@@ ped military broadcas@@ ts .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have sought a copy of Val@@ dez &apos;s body to get information on abduc@@ tions from the best sources .
&quot; we would have known what happened previously , &quot; said a 46 @-@ year old village whose body @-@ building has served as a slogan for him , El Fla@@ co .
&quot; all communication channels have now been cut off by our sources . &quot;
the Val@@ dez office has become the space for bridges and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the edit@@ orial workers have become something they could never expect in the name of the activists of the press .
a few bridges were seized by Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez and next morning went to a local Public Prosecutor &apos;s office to protest for another journalist .
Mr Salvador was in the West of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an State three days after Val@@ dez was murdered .
the body has been bur@@ nt down and , according to the officials , it is in the DNA tests .
journalists across the country have become more audi@@ ble and are cri@@ pp@@ ling as organised protests to s@@ cor@@ n and buildings the phrase &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; .
on this day , President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez will be held in Washington in an attempt to gather international support for justice in Val@@ dez .
the day after the death of Val@@ dez in a meeting with the Sin@@ al@@ oa Governor accused the Ra@@ mi@@ rez authorities of re@@ visiting and killing journalists for telling the truth .
he subsequently asked him to be diver@@ ted from government action , concerned that he had had had an impact on objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists were &apos; in step with &apos; be@@ ac@@ on in the form of organised crime , compli@@ city with national officials and a half @-@ hear@@ ted society &apos; .
in his latest book &apos; Drug press &apos; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug trafficking but are also carried out at the be@@ h@@ est of the political and security forces , who are in an organised crime t@@ reas@@ ure .
the media monitoring group Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 issued more than half of the attacks on the police and civil administra@@ tors last year .
&quot; in Mexico , because you want to be kept silent , &quot; Ra@@ mi@@ rez said .
the murder clearly has ver@@ sa@@ tile effects .
nobody will forget the death of blo@@ g@@ ger Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ sis six years ago .
she was found dead with a letter that had probably been signed by Car@@ bo Bloom Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
his fun@@ eral has been pac@@ ked by computer glass and head@@ phones .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as in the northern border state of El Nor@@ te , Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ hu@@ hu@@ a , following the murder of their cor@@ respondents Bir@@ sla@@ va B@@ 112@@ h in March .
others will keep on as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do did after the murder in 2004 .
in 2010 , the headline &apos; What do you want of us &apos; was publicly presented by the Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z Pen@@ a@@ es@@ ti on the edit@@ orial list .
some journalists have fled from their national states , or even from their country .
it is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
it is difficult to find work in the wrong direction and they still have to gra@@ b the streets to avoid risks .
and sometimes they are driven , as probably happened in the photo@@ graph Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , murdered in one of the four women &apos;s places in Mexico in 2015 , three months after she was fleeing from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
those who remain on the move have to refu@@ te risky decisions every day .
the I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to become a po@@ et , ad@@ mits that he is terri@@ fied by reporting the nar@@ co@@ tics trade .
Mexico is on the way to hell and so I will report , &quot; said .
at a mid@@ night of a recent Friday , when the latest figure had already been s@@ ounded , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce ed@@ itors sat on the way to office and be@@ er the bat@@ teries , suddenly starting to telephone on all phones .
19 people were reported to have died in fire @-@ fighting campaigns in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ i , in the northern can@@ tile town , which took place between ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces .
the war continued to equ@@ ate , as were a number of messages from car@@ tels found in the area .
in the same line , repor@@ ters u@@ plo@@ aded the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce site using a mobile phone .
a change was needed in the upcoming round .
another fire in the region was ship@@ wrec@@ ked .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is on guard police officers to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not at least show it .
under a massive book book of the de@@ scen@@ dant , where the average finger of the holder is to be seen in the entirety of Sin@@ al@@ o@@ ia , the workers of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce took on his tra@@ ils .
&apos;@@ W@@ h@@ y can one think about closing &apos; , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; whereas on the same day Javier died , the tra@@ ine@@ e asked me to report to the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur used a defence colour to avoid enemies
at first g@@ lance , it looks like a form , albeit rather sc@@ ary .
scientists have now revealed the first findings of the un@@ beli@@ evable wave sizes discovered by Canadian min@@ able car@@ toon numbers , which are so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; Lis@@ a Mon@@ a added &apos; .
it has been so well preserved that it was even possible to recognise that the lea@@ ther covered by his so@@ om@@ ers was a red Brown ho@@ le and had a somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; past .
a repor@@ ter published in the Journal &quot; The best preserved so@@ om@@ y , &quot; once found &quot; and &quot; one of the best din@@ osa@@ ur@@ f in the world &quot; described the term &quot; was the term &quot;
it is a new type of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ic living in the middle of a storm of 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
it was incredibly good to have it in ru@@ d for scientists who describe it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
this vege@@ tarian , like soya , is the best preserved fos@@ sil@@ s ever discovered in the past , according to the National Ge@@ o@@ graphic magaz@@ ine .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k found it when he extra@@ cted For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the IND / NGL mine in Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
he has been struck by something that did not recall the surrounding stone and decided to look into it .
the P@@ hy@@ si@@ um of Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell ul@@ ty was sent to the revealed .
the next six years were designed to expe@@ l the area of land from 2 500 ( 1 100 km ) .
after all this tremendous effort , the end result is now ready for the public to be brought to the end .
&quot; if you b@@ ent a little mind , you can almost believe she is s@@ lee@@ ping , &quot; said Brown , the leader Ro@@ yal T@@ rel@@ l M@@ use@@ ci@@ de , where you bo@@ w to lies .
&quot; this will go down in science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osa@@ ur@@ bias - Cor@@ k Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &quot;
he found in a s@@ kin@@ t that this vege@@ tation worker covered by so@@ y@@ bean and re@@ minis@@ cent of wal@@ king tan@@ k was likely to be significantly threatened by food din@@ k .
this series of soya @-@ owned din@@ osa@@ ur used red and white forms of protection to be beaten by pre@@ da@@ tors and applied a sha@@ do@@ wing technique , which is described as a sha@@ m and is also used by many present @-@ day animals .
it allowed din@@ osa@@ ur to be absor@@ bed better and the enemies to be prevented , as the major din@@ osa@@ ur probably found him to be hun@@ t .
this presence of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ic , a population of 110 million years old , has come to the news for the first time and is now visited in the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ ch@@ ology M@@ use@@ um .
the repor@@ ters have now investigated and given the name to Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta Mar@@ mit@@ l@@ or &apos;s muse@@ um , according to mark Mitchell , the famous team spent over 7 000 hours to un@@ cover a demanding animal .
thanks to the aston@@ ishing good preservation of the father , D@@ r@@ . Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the design .
they discovered a mis@@ fortune - a protective method in animal states - which means that the head of the m@@ ood was the dark than the lower .
although the bu@@ ck is widespread , the findings come as a surprise , as Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ h is much greater than those that live today with un@@ sa@@ cro@@ san@@ ct secre@@ ts .
it suggests that din@@ osa@@ ur hunting was sufficiently actively accompanied by other din@@ din@@ osa@@ urs of meat , that the evolution was preferred to over@@ shadow the failure to oppose a failure to act as a means of survival .
however , most of the animals who use today &apos;s trau@@ ma - such as fears , s@@ kin@@ s or b@@ ars - are much smaller and more vulnerable to harves@@ ts , which suggest that no@@ do@@ sa@@ sa@@ ur@@ us had to struggle to survive .
&quot; vigorous cooling of din@@ osa@@ ur pressure , covered by massive and high levels of soya , shows how dangerous the animals of din@@ osa@@ ur pressure could have been , &quot; Brown said .
chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds of So@@ om@@ seed also revealed that din@@ osa@@ ur was a red screen .
scientists will continue to explore to find indications of this life , including the content that remains in the warm form , in order to find out what the animal would be like for its last past .
they believe that din@@ osa@@ ur failed rivers , thus reaching the sea with a stream of w@@ rest@@ ling over the ocean .
at that time , Alber@@ tas was the same soya as is the case now in the Eastern F@@ l@@ ori@@ qu@@ ity , and rivers and oceans are likely to have been much further away to inland land than they are today .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ inity is truly remarkable as it remains fully covered by so@@ om@@ y sk@@ in , while maintaining its original shape , &quot; Brown . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the animal today finds itself practically the same as the ages of kri@@ fe .
there is not much imagination to be used to recon@@ stru@@ ct it - simply to b@@ lend our eyes and it seems like a s@@ le@@ ep . &quot;
the time for the crisis was when huge meat @-@ related din@@ osa@@ urs - tero@@ gene@@ urs - who s@@ kate two feet .
although the Ro@@ yal of Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x lived millions of years later than Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , it could be taken as a shot by some of his for@@ mi@@ dable predecess@@ ors .
these include the long and six tonnes of mon@@ ster that is weigh@@ ing , A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ contamination , 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) .
scientists whose recent findings are published in the current Bi@@ ology magaz@@ ine believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta was dro@@ w@@ ned after death in the sea and this mu@@ tu@@ alist .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k discovered ten@@ ac@@ ity when he mined For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine in Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
it is the best preserved so@@ om@@ din@@ din@@ osa@@ ur in the world , including sk@@ in and so@@ om@@ y , as the other way has said , and is complete in the form of a safety net .
these ten@@ tions were on average at 18 feet ( five metres ) and grew to GBP 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .
two 20 customs la@@ yers emerged from this .
scientists believe that this vege@@ tation f@@ itted with soya will pass through the current Western Canada , while the river floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the se@@ ques@@ tration site at sea helped to preserve its fin@@ ely detailed nature .
the coal residues of this particular father are so well preserved that the ti@@ dal boo@@ m of my@@ th@@ ological so@@ me@@ teries will continue to cover sk@@ in residues .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote in the National Ge@@ o@@ graphic Journal : this is just as rare as a lo@@ to@@ victory .
the more I look at it , the more incredible it seems .
S@@ ti@@ mu@@ lation remains a good @-@ house my@@ th@@ ological but@@ ton .
a better front line will be taken by him and five troops are pic@@ ked up .
I can count the soya in his own back@@ y@@ ard . &quot;
how did one activist answer the question &apos; whose streets ? &apos;
Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll was completely shocked on 9 August 2014 .
just days after travelling to New York , Lou@@ isi was on a do@@ se ren@@ ted via Airbus , on a Facebook line in S@@ r@@ ings .
he got on to the post of his former school fellow Member .
it wrote : &apos; 18 year @-@ old juven@@ i@@ les have just been killed by the police and are still on the streets &apos; .
he was confused as to why nobody else had posted this information on his bed , leaving him on Facebook and opening Twitter .
the de@@ lo@@ ads of the user of The@@ e@@ P@@ haro@@ ah were repeatedly transmitted in line with his own timetable .
the S@@ tern from the Lou@@ am region was passed on in real time to the sÃ¤@@ da Michael Brown , the death of an un@@ armed , 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by a white officer in Fer@@ gus@@ onis Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is .
he has de@@ pic@@ ted the live body of Brown in the corner , leaving four hours .
&quot; it is cra@@ zy , &quot; thinking about the quo@@ tations by Mrs Ferreira .
but he and his community were not new .
he has taken off his phone , but later this evening saw the spar@@ k of the seiz@@ ure of the people in Can@@ field in D@@ ri@@ ve .
P@@ ic@@ tures of the police and sh@@ ou@@ ting people and a man who claims to be in the hands of Bro@@ w@@ n and kept a label &apos; The Fer@@ gus@@ on police killed just my un@@ armed bo@@ y ! &apos;
he looked on in real time a bed in which the police officer stood in front of the protest group with a gra@@ b .
in a second video , another police officer , he said he was gun@@ s and sh@@ ell@@ fish : &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
it is a reminder of how it was looking at the idea &apos; unusual . &apos;
&quot; this is not the murder of the kind with which we are ac@@ custo@@ med and we could call a typical . &quot;
I felt atrocities at that time .
I was ang@@ ry and hu@@ ff@@ ed . &quot;
he boo@@ ked a flight and went home the next day .
having bu@@ ried at 23 o &apos;@@ clock , he left her father with his six @-@ year @-@ old da@@ u@@ ghter and decided to travel to Fer@@ gus@@ on next morning .
what happened to Fer@@ rel@@ li and Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ el over the next three years is a key issue in the new W@@ ho@@ se street Information portal &apos; , &apos; whose streets are appearing in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and of love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who have responded by demanding .
if the ball , with a bul@@ l - who had a flow@@ er ta@@ g and a be@@ at the be@@ at with it - wal@@ ked in the Fer@@ gus@@ on , they again spoke about a subject that they had repeatedly talked about before this morning - the experience and living conditions of black people .
&apos;@@ D@@ o you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; he is reminding him of the question ?
&quot; we are now travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ oni because an 18 @-@ year @-@ old bo@@ y was killed by the police and it is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on , &quot; said Ms Ferre@@ ll later .
&quot; what is happening now is the cul@@ mination of past events .
it needs to know and see this and grow in the middle .
she must learn about the organisation and organisation of a body of different la@@ yers of mus@@ ical experiences and living conditions , and what we need to do is to free ourselves and free ourselves .
even if I can bring him up without having to copy atro@@ cious racism in person , some other black girls do not differ .
I feel sorry to do him if I were to defend him from the world . &quot;
the first suspension they made in the Fer@@ gus@@ on was on the South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ t - from a police station to a place of crossing the way , which had become a sort of camp pla@@ gue where the activists were awaiting news from the police officer Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not ultimately charged .
the Cop@@ de and her da@@ u@@ ghter joined forces there with a local business owner who prepared the lunch .
they put together the food bags and helped to ap@@ portion them to prote@@ sters .
a new type of activist slowly took shape for the Fer@@ rel@@ li .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; said he , when he was a Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ isi , was a student at the University of a student Association of Small educational pupils and focused on food fairness and health inequalities in the non @-@ performing communities .
&quot; I had no organisational experience .
it is all a flat . &quot;
after weeks , during a demonstrations , Mrs Ferre@@ ll met a co @-@ director of a film Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ i at the time of an evening demonstration .
the prize was said by him and the film operator , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , just wanted to document what is going on .
the question that arose from the Fer@@ rel@@ li was : &apos; are you trying to document what is going on or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
this scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to profit from its efficacy and resilience .
the prize was explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voices of people born and born in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard and we wanted to do so in a different way &apos; .
the prize had already been beaten by D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ in , a man in the region who was well @-@ known for a activist due to the sentence of death sentence .
his involvement made the project heated by Fer@@ rel@@ li and another six for the local communities that followed years after the shooting of Brown .
&quot; nobody is talking to us or speaking to us in this docu@@ mentary film , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; it was important to me how these people are portra@@ yed , because I am portra@@ yed as being . &quot;
although not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rel@@ li , it was intended to show that the movement was not about &apos; head of sal@@ vation but community unity &apos; , as the Fo@@ lay@@ man said , made it the most open film .
as a result , &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; is a surpris@@ ingly personal aspect of the lives of Fer@@ rel@@ li , such as par@@ don and marriage with her wife .
&quot; I felt I was wrong , &quot; said Ms Ferre@@ ll , p@@ ouring over the first time he was ready to work on a town .
&quot; I have realised that there is a certain vulnerability to doing this and to human@@ ising the black people . &quot;
moreover , the Fer@@ rel@@ li story highlights and puts the role of the black homo@@ sexual woman in the wider Black Alliance in Mat@@ ter movement once more at the centre .
two of the three initi@@ ators of the movement who thought in the social media in 2012 of the h@@ ash@@ tag@@ s # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter , following the killing of the black teen@@ ag@@ er Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , are gay .
&quot; women of black age in leading roles have kept movement across the board , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll , &quot; and this is because we have to fight on many fronts all the time .
women in Mus@@ tan@@ a@@ c homosexuality must bear this burden . &quot;
the pho@@ to was agreed , noting that &quot; women really do live in black life and many of them are black homosexu@@ als . &quot;
he says , however , &apos; This is not a kind of &apos; one @-@ way @-@ to @-@ go solution &apos; - that the film was not chosen as the focus of the film because of his identity .
&quot; he was the man who used to be right in the right energy , &quot; said .
&quot; however , it is no coincidence that he is on the front@@ line , because there is a lot at stake as a homo@@ sexual woman living in such no@@ vel@@ s .
he can be seen through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news camer@@ a from Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ el has disappeared a long time ago , but the relationship between the community and the police is still fragile .
the suspended suspended sentence for road blocking during the demonstration against Mr. Fer@@ rell will last for another 2.5 years .
he describes the social policy climate in the area he calls home as a &apos; a huge threat to freedom &apos; .
it still considers the man@@ tra that it has been eating since the time it took to the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ on for a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our own freedom .
it is our responsibility to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing but our chains to lose . &quot;
7 fac@@ tshe@@ et to overcome po@@ mel@@ ty after We@@ ek@@ t
some of the most stu@@ pid young people will find a cure after the me@@ tal wave , which is scarce , and help .
or the words &apos; avoid po@@ mel@@ h@@ mel@@ l , stop broke &apos; .
but this is just the inevitable postponement and good health hu@@ m@@ our .
what can you do to better identify and overcome the po@@ p@@ pi@@ l cycle after today and tomorrow - or any other day - in the morning ?
Jo@@ o Water
alcohol was under and after a great deal of pain in the morning ... or , if possible , in the form of alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it uses alcohol , it must somehow be recovered .
along with water , miner@@ als are being dis@@ per@@ sed from the body and the se@@ ine is good ha@@ ir &apos;s mineral water .
it is particularly good , since the bu@@ ck is often irri@@ tated after the me@@ tal has been bur@@ ned , if it is not bub@@ ble or only easily bil@@ led .
let &apos;s walk .
it would certainly not cost the grand@@ mother to go on to the b@@ ath - it could be fatal to mis@@ lead .
but a slight wal@@ king helps the body to recall what it is like to be alive .
T@@ sy s@@ ma@@ pping and po@@ tas@@ y are a more time @-@ consuming way to get out .
slowly and cau@@ ti@@ ously put back the ru@@ ins of the body .
if you are already starting the test of over@@ shooting yesterday , it is certainly not worth trying to charge a fat boat .
take the example of a new volume containing tra@@ w@@ ls to keep silent feet of the ca@@ ge .
if health already suffers around the South , pul@@ ls , for example , could be tested .
a little later , there is a bit of com@@ motion .
Ex@@ te@@ ct
this di@@ u@@ ph@@ oria will relieve your body of the last water .
as has already been said , your friends have the water and the scale .
contribute to pain @-@ pi@@ tu@@ tu@@ r@@ on individuals .
if you can be pain@@ kil@@ ler on the evening to prevent po@@ f@@ mel@@ l , you must tackle not only alcohol but also alcohol but also the per@@ se@@ ph@@ et or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ f@@ us and lose the capacity .
this will lead to even more clo@@ thes of their pay and worse ones in the future .
moreover , there will be little time remaining pain@@ kil@@ ler in the body .
if you are pain@@ kil@@ ler this morning , you will do it with a blan@@ k f@@ ence - it will irri@@ tate your already di@@ r@@ ti@@ med ma@@ ze .
or if you are not a partner , you can do well .
it is about wal@@ king , but you cannot get your feet .
however , too much speed and ex@@ termination of the shop - a physical effort should be moderate during the po@@ cket .
well done .
S@@ ool with friends of the time , easy feeding and laugh@@ ing am@@ ic@@ ably , both for himself and for others ( suffering ) .
the but@@ cher and wife may not be allowed to di@@ al , but they can certainly be more la@@ x in their follow @-@ up .
it will once pass over the po@@ ker anyway !
Ca@@ ve@@ y@@ sk profes@@ sor and Ox@@ ford University of Technology will seek out a victim as suspects
a profes@@ sor of the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and a university in Ox@@ ford are sought nation@@ ali@@ zed by the police , and have become suspects of a single Palestinian body with deadly pa@@ int w@@ ns of wor@@ ship , from the Ch@@ ic@@ ago luxury bas@@ ket .
according to the C@@ oo@@ k judicial documents , an arrest warrant of 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 years of Andrew War@@ le@@ n was issued on Monday for arrest of the accused of first @-@ instance murder because of their alleged involvement in T@@ ren@@ ton H. Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ le@@ u .
according to documents , the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ u died after repeated ha@@ vo@@ w .
the body was found dead on 27 July , following a warning by the Ch@@ ic@@ ago police station .
police officers received telephone calls and found a victim on arrival of the Grand Pla@@ za Kor@@ ter@@ rand , whose body had several pi@@ pes .
according to officials , Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ u was recognised dead and researchers treat se@@ ating as murde@@ rer while the police actively search for two suspects .
since 2007 , the University of North@@ w@@ ester has been a co @-@ professor of micro@@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology .
in a statement sent as e @-@ publishing , Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , Vice @-@ President for Public Relations from the University of universities , said that the La@@ w@@ are has now been temporarily removed from employment and is prohibited from entering the town of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n University .
&quot; this is now a criminal act being investigated by the competent authorities and the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n will work with the investi@@ g@@ ators , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ arre@@ n is senior assis@@ tant in the financial institution of Ox@@ ford .
a representative from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in a statement that e @-@ mail : &apos; we have been in touch with the British Police and ready to assist the US investigation authorities in any way possible &apos; .
moreover , the statement stated that the War@@ ren@@ i colleagues are appal@@ led and wish to extra@@ dite themselves .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , Head of the Police Department of Ch@@ ic@@ ago , urges the authorities to give in to the authorities on suspicion .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are present , but we are more and more intensively defining their exact position , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the fact is that the local , regional and national authorities are helping to seek suspects .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police received a telephone call from administra@@ tor of the Grand Pla@@ za Kor@@ ter@@ rand , who had just received cry@@ p@@ tic indications that something has happened in the ch@@ ry@@ p@@ tic a@@ partment .
the police described a ma@@ gic view .
it was stated by G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m that it was not clear whether the event was also on 27 July .
he said that the camer@@ as would confirm the stay in the University of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ mil and victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the management of the Grand Pla@@ za wrote to the inhabitants : &apos; the police are currently working to identify the cli@@ ron@@ ology of events and the victim &apos;s background and are examining different mo@@ tives , including the possibility of a family dispute &apos; .
companies to help your company avoid getting the next fairer
Mr Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ up company , but the poll was un@@ helpful .
the replies were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers dis@@ tr@@ usted this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is running an e @-@ commerce company called Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , which is selling ha@@ ir products with 75 employees in San Franc@@ is@@ co .
it therefore called non @-@ actors to the aid .
start @-@ ups on new types of human resources are starting to help businesses find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licen@@ sing software with a clear purpose to measure employee involvement , they will enable companies to commit cells , target specific teams and demographic groups , offer anon@@ y@@ mity to workers and a bul@@ l for complaints and , in some cases , allow em@@ pe@@ ers to by@@ pass the level C managers and go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; now there are tools like Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ bit designed to monitor health but with F@@ it@@ res for your company , &quot; asked Jim Bar@@ net , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O Bir@@ wood City at the start of the City of G@@ lin@@ t , which software analytical tools use to measure employee participation .
in the three years he has used G@@ lin@@ ti , a much better overview of what his workers think and feel .
in addition to app studies and dedicated consultations for certain teams , it provides a corporate soojus@@ o@@ talo@@ gue which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support , allowing them to identify the reasons .
companies have begun to realise that they need to stay informed about their working culture so as not to become the next U@@ b@@ lis@@ h@@ man , which has been riots since the former employee published a blo@@ g describing a har@@ as@@ sing environment in which those who da@@ red to speak were penalised .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , there is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business perspective to have an overview .
global governance , regulation and conformity can be worth more than $ 118@@ .@@ 7 billion according to the L@@ et &apos;s speak of financial transaction statistics by 2020 , according to data on the L@@ et &apos;s speak S@@ AN@@ T .
the company in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , which is based in Den@@ ver@@ is Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , is responding to a clear and un@@ suitable conduct , and this year saw an interest and an increase in activity against the background of U@@ ber &apos;s dubious reputation .
the Conver@@ c@@ enti@@ l has almost 600 customers including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber recently registered himself as a cli@@ ent .
like G@@ lin@@ tki , targeted companies will be able to send custo@@ mised incentives to so@@ ber , collect confidential answers in real time and look at problem areas in the heat maps .
it also provides anon@@ ymous no@@ ma@@ tics enabling employees to report un@@ comfortable behaviour .
and where the executive leader is concerned , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion is entrusted to regulators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , foun@@ der and CE@@ O of Conver@@ cen@@ ti .
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that if a company is found to treat its employees ill or act une@@ th@@ ically , it could face serious consequences , such as consumer boycot@@ ts , depar@@ tures and court cases , even if regulators do not intervene .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , restaur@@ ant , which has more than 2@@ 5,000 employees in 500 sites , has used the Conver@@ gence Policy for over a year to ensure that employees know the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way to intera@@ ct with the Corpor@@ ate headquarters .
if an employee had to report a problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number for the corpor@@ ation &apos;s headquarters or an email address , make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously .
this was often a da@@ un@@ ting and un@@ comfortable process , said Mr Vit@@ ran@@ o , General Ad@@ vis@@ er of Ru@@ by Tuesday , who said he was not well advised to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , since the company uses the Conver@@ cen@@ ti , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices , which were not previously used by managers who operated in offices in other cities or states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I can get closer to a holistic 3@@ 60 degree experience of workers , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who will head the Risk Management Group in Ru@@ by @-@ Tuesday .
&quot; and we will defend our shareholders against legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies were much more serious in terms of ethical conduct , values and worker involvement in 2002 , in other words , after the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen failed due to ethical infringement in the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
only when &apos; social media became c@@ oo@@ n @-@ gar@@ den &apos; did companies realise they cannot prevent their di@@ r@@ ty b@@ ash@@ ers from being online openly .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent provide their software as a service , taking charge of perio@@ dic remuneration by companies for the use of their products .
it is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been able to rely on both start @-@ ups .
in February , companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and Capital financed USD 10 million , thereby raising the value of the capital collected at USD 47 million .
USD 10 million was invested in November by B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , increasing total company funding to USD 60 million .
such investments will come as no surprise if we consider the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ tedness between businesses , cultures and venture capital .
more and more studies show that today &apos;s workers are waiting harder than before .
high salaries and interesting projects in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley are merely s@@ takes on the table .
workers want to feel accepted and valued and to devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy , feel they are heard and the work they do is reas@@ suring , they are more committed to ensuring the success of their business , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , of the Labour Government , which uses both convergence and G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors will earn their income if companies in their portfolio do well ; businesses will do well to have dedicated and involved staff .
if analytical tools from the third party allow a strengthening of the commitment and involvement of workers , it is no wonder that they will find support .
data on employee participation is important , as experts have said .
but this data is useless if there is nothing to follow @-@ up by the company .
in fact , if a company asks feedback from its employees , expectations of a change may arise .
and if changes do not happen quickly or at all , they may cause dis@@ satisfaction and dis@@ orien@@ tate the involvement of workers .
&quot; when you ask about 4 000 proposals , you need to be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; said Mr R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , the President of the Con@@ sul@@ tative and Business Administration , who has seen companies fail to rely too much on data collection .
&apos;@@ because , if things are not done , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
will you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
in the words of Er@@ ret@@ ti , a Dutch Re@@ gel , who is now carrying out six studies among the workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the G@@ lin@@ ti case has been reported .
and after receiving feedback from workers frustra@@ ted by the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , it was able to re@@ organise several company cre@@ ws and provide communication training to address the problems .
Ru@@ by ures are collected for staff , however , and it is hoped that in the long term , this will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment from the industry known for the high turnover of its workforce .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you are not committed to transparency , you lose people , &apos; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&quot; if you lose people , you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you lose businesses . &quot;
the euro area celeb@@ rates a Baltic : income growth rate
while the 2008 crisis and trade concerns with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe , B@@ loom@@ berg is writing a report from the European Central Bank , with reference to the report .
according to the Central Bank , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations since 1999 .
low debt , fast @-@ improving institutions and business and free market @-@ friendly policies are the main drivers of this success .
&quot; the Baltic States are among the few euro area countries with a significant convergence of EU average in terms of their GDP per capita , &quot;
although the objective is for the total economic output per capita to be more aff@@ lu@@ ent to Western Europe , in 2015 the total output per capita of the Baltic economies was just 2 / 3 of the 15 national average , which was part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led the Bal@@ o@@ y@@ ans to seek a better pay abroad .
while the European Central Bank sees Bali as a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic at all .
according to a recent Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies are doing well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , less than half of those surve@@ yed thought this was about their economies .
N@@ CA@@ A Decision to cancel trends twice a day changes Bru@@ mes
it is almost 23 : 30 , if the football s@@ wor@@ ship stops at the very end of a new school s@@ na@@ ping at the University of a team .
some of them have tightened their s@@ leev@@ es by reve@@ aling their li@@ p @-@ up of the efforts of the first day of the September Camp .
for a large proportion of the team , these pa@@ int a pa@@ int from mid@@ day .
the participants in the courses will go back to study after a three @-@ hour trend to later on the collective family before returning to W@@ ev@@ man football at the next morning .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mor@@ a , Bru@@ in@@ si tre@@ er , a little before he became Tuesday on Monday .
the N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel trends twice a day to reduce the burden of players has actually led to longer days , at least until the end of the day , on Friday .
for this reason , the three first training sessions of U@@ C@@ L@@ A were prompted at 7.@@ 15 : 00 to fit players into the already intensive time@@ line .
the move from two to two days a day means more of a trend : the start of the Bru@@ in@@ si training camp was increased almost a week , compared to the previous season , and for the first time during the Mor@@ a six @-@ W@@ es@@ tw@@ oodi season , training sessions took place at the summer courses .
they will have an 18 tr@@ en@@ ches agenda until 20 August , before formal preparations begin for the opening game in T@@ ex@@ as A against &amp; M in September .
Mr Mor@@ a says she is in favour of amending the US@@ SR , although it adds another item to the tight schedule of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and it is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they will break themselves through this challenge ; they will work , they are wonderful young people .
I believe it is a real pleasure when we come on the table and have more time . &quot;
once the camp has been lifted , U@@ C@@ L@@ A training will be closed , which is no easy task given a clear view of the proximity of the search and remo@@ tely located Centre for L@@ us@@ kin , a higher class hotel which has already been dis@@ pat@@ ched from the portal around the gates with football .
since this weekend , the fun@@ ction@@ aries of the hotel are occupied by the Bru@@ ys , but Mor@@ a admitted that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&apos;@@ We are putting in place security measures &apos; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real concern and it is not exagg@@ erated to think that people can di@@ g and fil@@ ter .
if you have a record on a training , you could do a good deal .
but we will use a security team there and at a seat of 8 .
we will do our best by using it .
I will not be very concerned about that .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the Association of Trade Forces , born in the centre , Sa@@ visa@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , the AK@@ P @-@ trained Kris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ and and forced to withdraw from the ECB , seems to be at least the same as the local elections as the local elections , which have been created by the founding Trade Authority Ele@@ ction Union in Tallinn , which is to show the local elections , which is the same as the majority of the signatories who have been created by a party initiative .
however , the buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether enough frustra@@ ted voters will hold them all .
who will stay with Sa@@ du@@ lia ?
if the support team of Ed@@ gar Sa@@ visa@@ are reduced , it can anticipate events organised to honour the electoral union .
one member of the Council , some of the former and now the central party and many unknown faces - can this be the composition of the electoral federation ?
and can some of the Sa@@ visa@@ are honest pro@@ tag@@ onists and sis@@ ters stand by for a nomination in Tallinn be looked at as the &apos; list of talent &apos; , led by corruption and corruption suspects , is becoming a reality ?
on the night of the mayors &apos; ro@@ of@@ s of the municipal@@ ity , a music f@@ Ã© in Russian pla@@ gue involving the parent of the town of child@@ ren@@ e ; and in every sense the pri@@ mi@@ tive computer game in which the Prime Minister , J@@ Ã¼@@ ri Ra@@ ta , must avoid the l@@ om@@ y and or@@ ac@@ e@@ ur in the course of a trip - is the EPP seeking , for the first time , the votes of the 14@@ th and 17@@ th year @-@ old voters to be allowed by ballot bo@@ xes ?
we look forward to seeing other political parties thinking of a youth campaign .
if a vie@@ wer from Can@@ al 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 looks against a black r@@ man instead of August &apos;s enter@@ tainment , two options will remain : to accept that in future only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn TV and Fran@@ ce@@ ce@@ 22 channels will be available for a TV operator for a period of 10 months , or to give up a TV operator in English .
there will probably also be those who will initially be happy to re@@ jo@@ ice with free TV experience , but , at the end of the day , albeit reluctant , TV and advertise@@ ments .
Al@@ le@@ arly music , a dis@@ gus@@ ting people and rub@@ b@@ ish on the streets are the down@@ side of almost every major mus@@ ical plo@@ t .
if you do not want to play part in the ch@@ arity , you do not want to find your homeland at home rather than just getting sick - and you can leave the place of s@@ lee@@ ping to the polls for the amount they have paid .
Washington changes the Green Card rules
the media are cited by President Donald T@@ ru@@ p , who said that a new US immigration plan , which changes the rules on the Green Card , is planned .
the plan foresees a reduction of the number of legal immigrants per year for 50 000 people , stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by Re@@ public@@ s and supported by the President .
the draft law will be discussed in two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise salaries and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , because it will change the way that green cards are issued to citizens from other US countries .
the law will reduce red migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process will give the advantage to applicants who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills to benefit our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp the US media ou@@ tle@@ ts .
the young people of Si@@ beria move to the country , pensioners back to the country .
Y@@ ev@@ se@@ ye@@ v A@@ nat@@ . continues to have a tradition of gold min@@ ers , famous gu@@ est along the former Ma@@ ana River .
she works 140 km from home as an additional prisoner of the Ma@@ ana , Ku@@ vai , the driver of the underground plant .
it is tough work : 12 hours of work without rest periods two months and then only ten days at home and again .
A@@ nat@@ oli has seen gold only once in the three years worked .
&quot; there is a hard qu@@ it : when you go in , you will be checking hard to take no action and , going out , you will talk about A@@ nat@@ oli .
in the village of H@@ ai@@ da , M@@ are Pi@@ ho will speak local se@@ to Ja@@ ani , who has spoken a great deal to him about the memory of his family in Si@@ beria .
the archa@@ ic culture that has been preserved in the pig feed will also affect home @-@ pigs , as it is simply so shocking , is the most important sight of Pi@@ ho M@@ are , who has studied the se@@ als .
this year , his first trip to Si@@ beria will be 30 years later .
he has been there 14 times in that time and has lived for one year .
how many people still came out to Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th century to get land here ?
it is an unresolved issue .
I would suggest 8 000 .
I have taken this into consideration by the men who have myself thought of it .
it is difficult to say exactly that , because up to 30 people could have come in one group at the time , but the passport was given only to the man .
the passport was given to only one , but was children , nur@@ ses and female .
look at the extent of this territory here !
it was several times larger than historical S@@ et@@ oma@@ a .
it was really needed to educate , manage in some way .
Gre@@ et@@ ings came here as pe@@ as@@ ants , but they got life because they got into areas not only farming but also the river ( pal@@ m par@@ king ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New @-@ Pet@@ ser@@ b , many pigs went into operation at a later stage of the K@@ ras@@ no@@ jar@@ sk @-@ 45 city ( I@@ f it was set up by the Soviet authorities , Mr J. P@@ . ) .
did the wall represent a majority of the population in the region at the time ?
yes , they were living in a ba@@ g .
in addition , the tradition of marriage and multi @-@ child marriage has been maintained for a long time .
seven to eight children in the family were normal .
how much is the Si@@ b@@ erian Se@@ to@@ de culture different and different from that of mother &apos;s se@@ to@@ x ?
they are different , although it was brought here at the same time .
they brought a lot of popular ideas .
they did so themselves ( ideas of a nation ) , but always made a distinction , which was brought in and had been made here .
the traditional ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity of se@@ als was strongly affected by climate change , because the cold is here .
the modifications were made .
for example , meat in S@@ et@@ oma@@ al was so@@ led , but frozen here .
where are the villages of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ ds and what life life life lives there ? / graph@@ ics : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ots
the link with the mother country was strong in spirit , very important .
I feel that it will now return to Se@@ tu@@ maa , will affect them .
the ama@@ zing stories have been heard by girls who have lived in families .
Pi@@ ho is thinking of the people of the Estonian se@@ to@@ de delegation who came to the Ro@@ yal day at the beginning of July to the Ro@@ yal Kingdom of H@@ ai@@ da and lived in homes for four days - J. P .
it is a shock to what is here .
&quot; it is extremely easy to come and go away , because the city has a wonderful place : in the b@@ read@@ th and at the crossing points of the roads , &quot; says Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m from T@@ ap@@ alt .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a lot of nature , sports and culture , and a pi@@ z@@ za is available in every corner .
T@@ ap@@ a is a top @-@ thro@@ p town !
there is a small island along the River Tw@@ o through the coast of the city , where the be@@ ach is used to walk the str@@ ings .
&quot; no rail window seems to be there , &quot; says Re@@ ig@@ o .
those who are not afraid of the cold can sw@@ allow the river because the river is full of sources .
I have been there , you can !
a long @-@ distance , simple ro@@ man@@ tics can be considered and done - the flow of the river can be looked at and looked at in advance .
I , too , have been wal@@ king with my bre@@ ed@@ ers there .
in addition to anything else , an abduc@@ tor has been active in getting her bat@@ teries running through her three eyes : &apos; that place is in the town , nobody can come in any way if their stories are completed &apos; .
&quot; the car@@ ro@@ w@@ mas@@ ses will also provide a wonderful insight into T@@ ap@@ a , but there will also be health professionals who can run , heat and ro@@ b and now , for example , dis@@ c@@ gol@@ f courses - gol@@ f courses have been made , can lend to sports , &quot; the Re@@ ig@@ o is is head .
the old practitioners are , of course , in line with their own super@@ market , but I have not yet got there .
obviously , Mr Gra@@ le Pal@@ ace must be invited , because she has experienced a dis@@ playing game and has a chain .
I am sure he will lend me .
the current oper@@ nic@@ ism and M@@ Ã¤n@@ ni@@ Ä‡ were indi@@ visible during their childhood .

&quot; the city as a whole is currently full of construction , all of it becomes unknown , &quot; Re@@ ig@@ o Re@@ jo@@ ins .
however , the old and ti@@ red building of T@@ ap@@ a is a very attractive place for oral disco@@ veries .
I am pleased that my idea was adopted in 2012 by the head of R@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ M , in Me@@ os , and that he had to make a book for the summer .
although the &apos; Ale@@ kse@@ i K@@ aren@@ in &apos; theat@@ re &apos;s time @-@ old theat@@ re has just passed , on 11 August , the railway station is undergoing a &apos; El@@ luc@@ in@@ isation &apos; , while in an old old building , moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; 11 @-@ 13 August is the day in which the town of T@@ ap@@ a has not only encouraged open house ca@@ f@@ es but also cul@@ tured cultural events , including in the form of a mon@@ as@@ tery , &quot; Re@@ ig@@ o , who recommends a visit to a city from 9 to 9 in the space .
in the small y@@ el@@ low on 1 May pu@@ mp , the muse@@ um is already 1994 .
&apos;@@ The house is small , but there are a lot of mis@@ statements and huge information &apos; , Re@@ ig@@ o is praised in the place full of the history of the town of T@@ ap@@ a , most of which focuses on the railway and military .
Re@@ ig@@ o mu@@ b@@ ale is that if you go through all recommended sites , you will have to go a long way , but fortunately the small town is full of coff@@ ee .
&quot; we have such good food places and sometimes the feeling that you are abroad when you sit on the b@@ read@@ ers . &quot;
well trained and young soldiers from T@@ ap@@ ale spend a lot of time in pub@@ s , and the s@@ lot is a pi@@ tiful feeling of being in Estonia and in your home town , but there is a multinational body around .
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans .
we are going a lot , yes , there are soldiers !
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ dering
television quoted from the Foreign Ministry , which reported that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ ding .
on the morning of 1 August , the police arrested an illegal axis of the group in the Ib@@ erian Pen@@ insula , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but an investigation is taking place .
the Foreign Ministry told the television channel that the Bulgarian were later released .
the Greek authorities have stepped up the restrictions on free @-@ phone ten@@ ding and are already imposing tough fines on anyone who is caught in a circum@@ ven@@ ted place that is not foreseen for doing so .
the sweep will continue throughout the season .
the court may impose fines , as the Ministry has said .
the w@@ ol@@ f trees are breaking the w@@ ol@@ f .
farmers in the soil need to give their her@@ d &apos; teaching material &apos; to the junta again after the year &apos;s break - apparently the w@@ ol@@ f @-@ gra@@ pp@@ ers have already broken a lot of sheep .
this year , lam@@ b in the i@@ dio@@ t region has been bur@@ nt down three times , 23 sheep and eight pages have been w@@ ounded . Hi@@ i@@ u wri@@ tes .
the figure was only three years earlier .
in the col@@ ony of Mur@@ d@@ urs , the Environmental Agency also has reported that the w@@ ol@@ f ben@@ ches were not born in the soil in the Hi@@ k Country and that the but@@ ton Board of Hi@@ ps had the information that two w@@ ol@@ f deter@@ gen@@ ts had been fixed this year on the island .
on Monday night , the junta broke the tw@@ enti@@ eth anniversary of the 15 sheep in the village of Em@@ vest Kab@@ una and injured 18 of the survi@@ v@@ ors .
in the morning of the morning of Wednesday , the w@@ ol@@ f broke a sheep in the province of Re@@ he@@ selja and badly injured you who had to be the scene of an emergency killing .
clear rules on GMO treatment
the ground Department of the EU has sent a draft law on the release of GMOs into the EU &apos;s sphere of transport and plant protection product legislation .
the amendment to the law will eliminate the creation of a separate collection of data for both GM and operators , using a plant health register in the future .
in addition , GM crops operators will be changed from being obliged to have a prior arrangement with beekeeping agent in the requested radi@@ us .
although there are no GM crops at present in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence between GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this would be at least as long as the decision is not to declare Estonian GMO @-@ free , &quot; said S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , Head of the plant Health Department at the department of the Maa@@ elu@@ tic Ministry .
&quot; however , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burdens of both the private and public sectors , &quot;
the draft law repe@@ als provisions on the collection and treatment of GM crops in the form of a table of data and handling activities for GM crops in the GMO , lays down requirements for handling GM crops and for starting an economic activity .
specifically for beekeeping , GM crops are replaced by a mandatory obligation to inform bee@@ keepers of the obligation to start growing GM crops by a commitment to reach an appropriate agreement with the bee@@ keepers before cultivation begins .
the draft law has been sent to Ministry of State Affairs for coordination .
all interested parties will have the opportunity to explore the draft information system and to submit their views to the world Department if they wish .
the proposed modifications will affect in particular those active in the plant farming sector , bee@@ keepers and the farming profession .
only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10 - is allowed to be grown in the European Union , including in Estonia .
so far , no Estonian farmer has been interested in culti@@ vating GM crops .
the reason is that there is no ma@@ gic bul@@ l@@ l@@ ot@@ on in Estonia , the European cor@@ n Media , which is resistant to mon 8@@ 10 .
it has also been breeding its maize lea@@ f for the southern regions , and it is not appropriate for our climate conditions in May .
in order to provide this certainty , the Beijing has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect pollution from potentially GM bodies in the seeds of various summer rape , maize and soya culti@@ vated in Estonia .
the analysis of sam@@ ples carried out showed that seeds were not included in a foreign wave and that the inquiry concluded that the seeds for seeds for rape , maize and soya vari@@ eties in Estonia were not accompanied by GMOs .
this is the case with the deliberate cultivation of GM crops in Estonia and with assurances that there was no accident contamination .

misleading house money to taxpayers
according to military documents published for the magaz@@ ine , the decision to aero@@ plane a naval helicop@@ ter last month went to the southern hor@@ ror taxpayer to cost USD 24 000 .
the Green and white colour S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , called the Marine One under the President &apos;s par@@ ity , was the cen@@ tre@@ piece of the play of the US construction programme in White on 17 July .
senior officials from M@@ ike P@@ ence and the White House , President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , reported on industrial products from all 50 states on their circulation .
a helicop@@ ter built at the Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut was rol@@ led together with a champion of the W@@ is@@ con@@ ha@@ m fire @-@ fighting car and Mis@@ sis@@ si@@ us .
according to the documents of the Es@@ ca@@ ka@@ r Marine H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) , who is responsible for the deployment of H@@ eli@@ kop@@ ter , the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter Con@@ cer@@ t , the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter &apos;s office called the P@@ ref@@ ri@@ ll of the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter , requested a military office office for a cell cell cell cell cell office of the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter , or F@@ AR@@ G@@ O , just 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter &apos;s &apos; extraordinary &apos; gold @-@ hu@@ b for the event was fu@@ n .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an un@@ usually highly @-@ focused event , &quot; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 com@@ and@@ Ã¶@@ r a day before the event in an email to his chief , the leading officer of the naval base for the de@@ pu@@ ties in the aviation sector .
the message stated in the message that the helicop@@ ter will arrive on the southern hor@@ ror at around 7 : 00 in a kick @-@ start event on 17 July morning and stay there until 18 and 21 o clock are cleared .
the added fact was that , should leaving the White House , you need a second e@@ tho@@ s because of the limits of working time .
the initial flight crew were at helicop@@ ter during the event and the security team of the first camer@@ a remained near the aircraft throughout its entire ter@@ rain .
it was not possible to read out from documents given to the magaz@@ ine whether a second e@@ pil@@ l was needed or not by the end of the hur@@ ric@@ ane .
the H@@ at@@ chi law prohibits the use of government assets by the federal authorities for political ends .
the documents show that the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 study examined whether this could be compromised by this event .
&quot; we asked whether it was a violation of H@@ at@@ chi law and we were told not to be in breach , &quot; wrote a com@@ man@@ der .
&quot; it seems you have no choice , &apos; responded to the Deputy leading victim .
the White House announced the &apos; American &apos; official event and the H@@ at@@ chi law would not have covered it .
there are , however , political under@@ ton@@ es even at formal events .
the President supported the health reform efforts at the time in the Senate and praised attempts to keep government regulations under threat .
the use of a fleet known under the name Marine One or Air Force for political gain is not a new phenomenon .
the Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the need to use them as a pure photo@@ copy is unusual .
the first campaign campaign in Flor@@ idas Mel@@ bour@@ ne was followed by a President &apos;s plane in February by a cli@@ cking on Twitter &apos;s account , and she is sending messages about how his predecessor used the plane .
&apos;@@ The White Ma@@ tel is very pleased with the designation of America &apos; where products were represented from 50 states produced by American workers from American materials &apos; , &apos; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the press officer of the White House .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often test sam@@ ples around Washington and the southern he@@ mic@@ y@@ cle to get to gri@@ ps with the white house of the US President with a me@@ tre @-@ me@@ tre c@@ iting .
when the G20 was in place in T@@ ru@@ mp at the beginning of July in Germany , 58 tests were carried out at H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 &apos;s White House le@@ vers .
the flight was included in the &quot; American &quot; flight manager &apos;s training standards for this year &apos;s study .
the helicop@@ ter of Es@@ ka@@ r fly another 11 hours for &apos; presidential Support missions &apos; on that day .
no other dis@@ service to this event , according to the White House , cri@@ ed taxpayers &apos; pur@@ ses .
according to S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky &apos;s representative , the company was not involved in carrying out an expon@@ tor at the southern helicop@@ ter .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 will not retain the budget documents of the President &apos;s flights and the precise costs of the event will be difficult to identify .
in contrast , the average price of the defence agency for the financial year 2017 is GBP 24 380 per flight hour .
the first office papers indicated a flight of 30 minutes from Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ o airport to both routes , from the main base of the flight .
the White House says that the actual cost of using a helicop@@ ter is well below the sum .
&quot; it is a misleading calculation of taxpayers &apos; costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates , &quot; said Wales .
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other irreversible costs which will be taken into account in the annual appropriations . &quot;
according to a study by the 2015 ro@@ stru@@ m , staff costs are not covered by the Ministry of Defence , but they cover fuel , maintenance and contracts .
Se@@ an S@@ pic@@ er , former spokes@@ person for the White House , defended the deployment of helicop@@ ter at that time .
&quot; this is about showing America &apos;s achievements this week , &quot; said S@@ pic@@ er .
&quot; I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security and that hundreds , if not thousands , of people whose work depends on it are expected to exist .
and I believe , just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly on .
so it is right to highlight it , of course . &quot;
it is not clear whether T@@ ru@@ mp was exposed to helicop@@ ter in a southern factory , or not , but was sitting behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
in the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky addressed representatives , throwing out the media for jo@@ kes and company products in his own aircraft park .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ ski very well , &quot; the President said , &quot; I have three of their products . &quot;

one alcohol whose drinking is equivalent to &apos; training &apos; .
the Li@@ ves@@ tral movement wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is so big a wine fan that believes that wine can teach better than any other thing in the world .
She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist at Y@@ ale University .
it is not alcohol , it is not about how it affects our feelings and minds , but it is about the &apos; very active &apos; process of taste for wine .
by c@@ iting the glass , by be@@ ating the wine , enjo@@ y@@ ment it and the ensu@@ ing perception , we are putting our brain on the job to create a taste for wine .
in the words of She@@ per@@ d , wine @-@ bearing bodies do not actually contain taste , but taste arises from the way the wine stimu@@ lates brain .
he sets a comparison between the way brain sees &apos; appe@@ tite &apos; .
&quot; taste is not wine , taste creates a taste for wine , &quot; She@@ per@@ d says .
things that still affect the appearance of a wine are , for example , the number of our age , our sex and even our heart that humans produce .
She@@ per is of course in the impression that wine is not full of ha@@ ir .
&quot; there must be more , says .
if you are too big a pla@@ gue , the system has been over@@ loaded .
excessive wine drinking can be damaged rather than the brain , with people running over three glass of wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity being exposed to a 2004 study .
10 % of ICT employees in Estonia get less salary than colleagues

the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , and the portal Ge@@ eni@@ us wri@@ tes .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in a teaching survey in the ICT sector .
8 5@@ 77 posts were surve@@ yed in total .
men have worked 63 % of posts .
&quot; although only 3 companies said that the pay gap is in favour of men and that there is no pay gap for the rest of companies , in reality , the average annual pay gap is 10 % higher than men &apos;s and the average annual salary for men is 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said Mrs Il@@ je@@ v Il@@ je@@ v Il@@ je@@ v .

the role of women in democracy in Afgh@@ ans political leadership says UN
on Wednesday , the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said that the elections can represent the people only if all members of society , including women , play a role .
the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , said that hundreds of women would stand for municipal councils , three women would stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; it is not possible to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate the role of women by underlining the importance of women , &quot; said in a statement made on Wednesday .
the elections can represent a genuine people and can only be credible if women fully participate and participate in all phases of the electoral process .
the local council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have , for its part , threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with a transitional period of advisory role for international military operations .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that the power is peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next .
women &apos;s strong role in Afghanistan is , as the gen@@ i@@ us has said , increasing the success of democracy .
according to the In@@ dependent Ele@@ ction Commission in Afghanistan , 1.2 million women are registered as the equivalent of 3.@@ 6 million registered voters .

at the same time , larger children can fuel themselves .

O@@ tt ( 10 ) , S@@ Ã¤@@ de ( 8 ) , lu ( 4 ) , were the sports tools .
Sil@@ k w@@ ings to the heart of the world &apos;s mo@@ ph@@ ile
T@@ rap@@ ped cop@@ ies are the summer class , which has in recent years become a piece of s@@ nu@@ ff in its own right , at the top of the hand , and which has been able to be accompanied by a flat @-@ rate label by traders , despite its modest origin .
a copy of th@@ ick bags is probably one of the things that has existed in life at the same time and which has not been aro@@ used by much emo@@ tion .
it simply exists and , if it does not exist , there is no pla@@ gue .
now the ju@@ mp is taking a real kick @-@ start , and mo@@ mo@@ ph@@ ile bags have been replaced by their top @-@ top design bags for months , instead of simple be@@ er @-@ red bags .
it is not just a coastal cluster , but it is also just as popular today as a street copy and even a b@@ older woman wal@@ ks into office .
it is worth making it clear here whether the sole@@ mn speaking time is sitting in the Chamber or whether it is worth marking and pushing the lap@@ top in a little more formal .
however , female love has been made by their dis@@ cord .
for example , when reading foreign mo@@ pe@@ ds , the first thing is that mo@@ gur@@ us people first claim to go on to the local market on holiday and acquire some be@@ er bags , to which a full holiday is a pri@@ est and a single be@@ arer , a market , and also a friend @-@ like career in the town .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are so generous that buying houses from the market is selling larger li@@ m@@ ours or giving them to their loyal read@@ ers .
it is worth noting that there is so much demand for read@@ ers that women ( and men ) apparently go to each other in the world to become happy to take some of the bags .
in a sense , this mad@@ ness is understandable , because it is these procedures that educate themselves when , in the mo@@ ck of yesterday , it is possible to buy up a few tens of euros .
true , the ro@@ ck traders have discovered a simple way of making money here , and so the bo@@ xes are selling off luxury t@@ issues for a few hundred and -@@ 1000 euros .
perhaps it is not to be easy to feel as easy to get richer customers to get round some cheap bags .
for example , a do@@ se of EUR 1 000 is to be bought by D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a .
however , 6 000 euro may be channelled out of a sur@@ ge@@ on translation .
however , unlike most motor buildings , the outs@@ our@@ ced fe@@ eds do not come out of a lot of great fu@@ n , but from a far more distant story .

T@@ rap@@ ping from a bun@@ ch of trains is particularly an export business and very often does not see them all round .
it is said that the 14@@ th century is a flow@@ ing form of flow@@ ering technology and it is quite a series of fla@@ mes .
however , because the be@@ er does not have to be red as hard as the bas@@ ket , they can be labelled and other materials that make the co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il more attractive and , by extension , more ac@@ ous@@ tic .
for example , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y bags in recent times , with red pa@@ per@@ y or s@@ kin@@ s .
however , in particular , the de@@ vil can send a be@@ er to J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i whose greatest red be@@ er be@@ er was not seen before .
she has adapted the be@@ er to any possible set of clothing and even had to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
but , in the popul@@ arity of the willing , today , it is not a minor role that is the next word of care , and , unlike all the summer centres , they are not required to care with special funds , but to do the water and target .
as always with the trends , there are all sorts of interpretations , in addition to classi@@ cal appearance , br@@ ands .
for example , red cheese or a tiny tiny sw@@ im@@ p can be obtained if you wish .
it is worth remembering , however , that a classic be@@ er will never be a mo@@ use , while a bre@@ w@@ ery fuel does not .
but what is the classic be@@ er &apos;s affair ?
for centuries , a bun@@ ch of be@@ er red in a b@@ reat@@ h of rub@@ ber @-@ s@@ nat@@ ching has been classified as &quot; stra@@ ined &quot; and is easily open and short , not without re@@ proach , wh@@ ist@@ le .

G@@ M@@ B concerns investment at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant
the Trade Union is waiting for mature generation managers in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to be reas@@ sured of long @-@ term production plans at the G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
in the words of G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has remained silent on the future of the N@@ HS investment .
in a field where H@@ ob@@ no@@ lid and rich know about c@@ oo@@ kies and other products , more than 500 people work .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s owner , Pla@@ di , said they had invested over Â£ 5 million over the last few years .
it has employed staff and trade union chairs &apos; are the first ones to hear &apos; if something changes in the operation of a plant .
in a letter to the company &apos;s leader , G@@ M@@ B addressed the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e company &apos;s concerns with the lack of funding to upgrade production lines .
the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the site on the business needs of customs and the future investment plan is a cause for serious concern for our Members .
several generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely made up of people from the local community and the G@@ las@@ go@@ w community , a pillar indispensable for decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social housing .
so in the face of the dramatic growth in employment , salary and welfare in the eastern G@@ las@@ go@@ w , and the very high @-@ growth Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e company in the face of the decline in living costs and production . &quot;
the design representative said : &apos; the Director of the customs cros@@ ses was received from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ t@@ on only yesterday and the company replies directly to him because we value active interaction with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , a regular meeting between the workers and representatives of G@@ M@@ B was held in customs and openly debated a number of issues .
we then discussed with the workers that , like all other companies that are extremely competitive and in a precarious economic climate , we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years we have invested over Â£ 5 million in the Customs crossing , most of which has gone into production lines and improvements of operations .
we fully understand the legacy of customs as a production site and , if there is any change in the site &apos;s activities , the first employee and trade union representatives will hear about it . &quot;
did PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago of being sympa@@ thetic to the Ney@@ eding State ?
la liga may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not give up in the attempt to attract Ney@@ ts to their ranks by making a USD 18@@ 9 million offer to evade him , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record March ?
this hard @-@ headed approach has opened the summer to a transitional window , and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the current world record of double the purchase that was e@@ rec@@ ted in the previous season by returning Paul Po@@ g@@ ba to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ us GBP 89 million .
once the changeover is completed , the Ney@@ mark will thus become the most expensive player in the world and also the most highly remun@@ erated professional global player , with over GBP 500 000 per week to pay after the contributions from the PS@@ G .
Barcelona is also a hin@@ t , as a result of the approach and the breaking down of Ney@@ mar , but the source of the Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ an Executive confirms that the club has always been best off for football since its arrival in San@@ to@@ to@@ u in 2013 .
but did the President in the PS@@ G warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City grew out of an interest in signing a contract with Bla@@ ise Ma@@ tu@@ ka in 2014 , Mr Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f warned in a tough way against all clubs thinking about recru@@ iting some of their best @-@ performing retailers in the PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that if they are dealing with some of our players we will stand up to them and contact their players , &quot; al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f said .
&quot; we honour all clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have cros@@ sed this border , as the Spanish club had previously shown interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti , the central player of PS@@ G this summer .
the PS@@ G made it clear that it would not be allowed to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could be counterproductive in this interest by removing one of its precious assets in the form of Ney@@ mark .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Bre@@ x .
&quot; Bre@@ x faces a serious distur@@ b@@ ance between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned early on a first visit to Northern Ireland since its entry into force in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it &quot; she added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible to move freely to the current people and goods , says Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; she emphasised .
he would prefer Britain to stay part of the European Union , and as it is not , he would be part of the European common market .
it would preserve the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the UK .
another chance to make Britain &apos;s exit smoo@@ ther would be the creation of a European Union @-@ United Kingdom Customs Union , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that there was such an agreement with Turkey , the Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said : &apos; surely we could have that with Britain &apos; .
an alternative to this would be to return to customs points declaring historical separation and political failure .
&quot; bring trade , prosperity and peace , &quot; said the Irish Prime Minister .
she called Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t &apos; a challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that the outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland &apos;s everyday life .
the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the Northern Irish parties in Bel@@ fast .
