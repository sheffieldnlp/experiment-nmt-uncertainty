four members of Cape ro@@ vo groups were detained in Estonia and Spain .
according to Mr Posselt , the police held in Spain detained Estonia with the head of the so @-@ called K@@ Cape ro@@ vo Group , the leader of the so @-@ called K@@ Cape ro@@ vo Group , which is known as S@@ tu@@ ning K@@ o , the S@@ pr@@ ho@@ ski name .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch was arrested in the Court of Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch in Spain .
yesterday , the Court also adopted three suspected arrest in Estonia .
according to cases , the so @-@ called &apos; Cape ro@@ vo criminal members aged between 27 and 57 of 57 who commit themselves mainly to drug crimes .
in Spain , in the province of Mi@@ ja@@ m , the head of the criminal community was held in the M@@ alaga region .
in Estonia three men were detained , one has been collected according to the data collected according to the criminal community figures , and two of them are members of the criminal community .
the data that has been collected indicates that in the criminal community , there were clearly divided tasks and roles .
the purpose of the crime of the illegal Community was to set up drug crimes and , therefore , to serve the use of criminal benefits , the head of the court procedure , the Head of State Public Prosecutor , the Head of Ver@@ te .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected pirates will increase in the name , added to the Prosecutor .
this is the people who have been found in the law enforcement interest in the past , and some of them have suffered a penalty against drug crimes .
the Ver@@ te stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been crucial throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common@@ place for us , and the operation of this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; commented Ver@@ te &apos; .
ago , as a leader of the central criminal police service , Lithuania said that there were almost half years of prior examination of the detention period .
in the first half of the first half of the year , the privatisation of long @-@ term work and , at the same time , we have been suspected of crimes in Estonia and Spain . &quot;
it was added that officials of the central criminal police officers were helping in Spain .
for many years , we have a good contact and understanding of the Spanish police and civil card .
these arrests are another message to criminals that we will also be able to get them from another European search &apos; , &apos; said Le@@ i .
the information that has been collected so far indicates that there can be a suspicion of men in freedom in the presence of the new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office has requested the arrest and court of the prosecution .
the person arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
in the context of this criminal issue , the seiz@@ ure of property , vehicles and cash has been seized .
the Court &apos;s pre @-@ trial procedure leads to a centre of criminal police organised by organised crime and led the public Prosecutor &apos;s office .
the Latvian court in Tallinn , S@@ tu@@ dies , sentenced to blackmail in 2005 , and punished by a five @-@ year imprisonment .
in the middle of last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v , Mr Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v , was held in the light of the second most important thing in the European world .
Cape ro@@ vo@@ l , Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , rose by Estonia in the beginning of the 1990s when he started to address blackmail at the beginning of the winter .
Ad@@ mittedly , she has acted on the various ho@@ tels , and he called for a return to a monthly tax on the business men .
international joint operations , confiscation of criminal profits and the entry into force of the courts confirm that the fight for organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest Court rulings , for example , the eight accused of the criminal issue allocated by the criminal acquis of the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ ye@@ v Community of EUR 80 000 , or a judgment against nine individuals in that case , that Mr Ig@@ or Alex@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v set up a criminal Community in 2006 , aimed at Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v in the illegal trade and trafficking of crime in East Vir@@ u@@ land and South Estonia .
there is a total of EUR 71 500 in criminal revenue .
it has ensured progress in these criminal matters that police officers are changing the information every day with foreign counterparts and prosecutors , and if necessary , the operations carried out by any country in the European Union .
civil rights groups warn Mrs Paliadeli for travelling .
the Ad@@ van@@ er of C@@ olo@@ id of National Association for the People ( NA@@ ACP ) has warned the Mis@@ ris@@ ker travelling by the state of a Mis@@ ris@@ ker travelling by the state of a Mis@@ ris@@ ker travelling by the State of the state .
in the statement of the Rühle , the State of the State of the Ex@@ travel Act issued by the &apos; Mis@@ our@@ i State &apos; , which applies until 28 August 2017 , all the African passengers , visitors and sou@@ ri@@ ans , will have to be in the state of the entire state of affairs in the country , as well as the most careful and extremely cautious racial racial occurrence , which has been made over the last state and here . &quot;
according to NA@@ Ps , the group encouraged a passenger warning law to be issued by the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i Act , which will make discrimination against cases of cases that are more difficult than the fact that the state of state cor@@ ps is unequ@@ ally in the case .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are violated .
they are being drawn up because of their sk@@ in colour , they are being beaten or killed , &apos; said the &apos; NA@@ G@@ our@@ i branch of NA@@ Ps &apos; , Mr R@@ od Cha@@ pel , the newspaper of the K@@ ans@@ as of the Cha@@ dian , The K@@ ans@@ a City .
&quot; we have never been able to hear complaints in the past . &quot;
this is the first warning that the organisation has issued on the State state of the US .
Mrs Rühle referred to the events such as racist insul@@ ts for Mis@@ our@@ tic students in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i to Mis@@ sa@@ i University , and in T@@ en@@ nes@@ sing , the age of 28 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ and@@ er@@ si .
the winners died in the first half of this year , since it became the case by the State of the state of ben@@ ches and the Mis@@ our@@ i police carried out in custody , he took in custody , without having been accused of a crime .
in addition , note of a report by the Chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i refers to the recent report by the Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ n , which shows that the car drivers of the state will be suspended by 75 % in the state of car drivers more likely than to be wrong .
&quot; note is intended to be aware that people are aware and warned of their families , friends and working partners , which may happen in the A@@ pel . &quot; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people will have to be prepared , whether it will be remote from inclusion or informing themselves that they are going through the State . &quot;
on the basis of the latest data on the report by F@@ B@@ I hate crimes , an Mis@@ tane@@ ous crime in 2015 was documented by an Mis@@ tane@@ ous crime in 2015 .
your warning is also in response to a new law on the Mis@@ our@@ i , which makes it difficult for a company to prosecute housing or work in search of employment .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( AC@@ L@@ U ) was issued previously by the American Civil Liberties Association ( AC@@ L@@ U ) , in the case of T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona , after those states adopted immigration laws that oblige local authorities to be arrested for violations of the immigration law , because according to ACTA , it will increase racial profiling .
there is usually a foreign Ministry of Foreign warnings on foreign countries , but at the last time it has started to use this measure in response to the laws of certain US laws and trends .

that was a particular moment for me .
I am very much keen on your family .
it was a wonderful &apos; , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h journalists .

but even more in the history .
the inf@@ lam@@ matory le@@ af@@ let as a result of the inf@@ an@@ cy of gold , more than a narrow issue would have had been put in place in the title of a &apos; no &apos; to a greater effect on the basis of the pre@@ aching of the ath@@ le@@ tes .
at the moment , there are two books at the same time , between the two books : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti and his country &apos; Da@@ am gold @-@ in &quot; B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ des , and much more ambitious and more comprehensive and ambitious time @-@ wing families and the German occupation of the German occupation , with this follow @-@ up to Austria .
the first third of the book will lead in the middle of the w@@ ool Vi@@ ol@@ ence Vi@@ in Culture and who , in the Austrian capital , is expected to imagine how more than one hundred years ago , the R@@ ing@@ st@@ ale went to R@@ ing@@ sto@@ t , or how in the Cen@@ tr@@ ali , when the climate was introduced .
the concentration of cultural figures was in one of the rich@@ est cities of Europe and , when seeing the name of a high @-@ speed city , the call for a more more than a gram of culture .
at the same time , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in the city where the in@@ vio@@ ph@@ ine blame and was the highest in European self @-@ killing and was the highest suicide rate in Europe .
or perhaps , however - every couple of couples will add a colour of anti @-@ cultural life in Vienna in the 20th century .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna has been an explosion in Vienna , changing the biggest Jewish communities in Western Europe .
the exchange of the S@@ aj@@ di@@ c was almost one of the 10 people in Vienna .
the A@@ dele parents were also in Vienna , but by then , if the A@@ dele aid is to be opening up two times in the Czech sugar mag@@ ant , Mr Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch@@ every and Kli@@ m@@ m , he had already received a bank from H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg in the seventh largest bank in H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg &apos;s emp@@ ire .
but Mr A@@ de@@ let all all of this point of view , which he was famous , did not draw up .
if you look at the &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the age of life in the end of this kind is a very much socialist soci@@ alism and dre@@ aming up the Soviet Union .
by 2010 , when the Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided on a climate from his hus@@ band &apos;s visit to a customer , was the last moment of a six @-@ hour period in Vienna .
the climate was paid by 4 000 kro@@ on@@ ons at that time , a quarter of the cost of a good location to the land of the land .
in order for some of a few sports to a mo@@ del@@ l on a mo@@ del@@ l on the mo@@ del@@ l of a mo@@ del@@ l , the sugar mag@@ na@@ was did not discourage .
as far as it is concerned , the only firm fact is that in the course of work close to the mo@@ del@@ l and the ar@@ tist close the way to the end .
Mrs O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - &apos; Da@@ am gold .
Ms G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti , the extraordinary story of the P@@ len@@ se , A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri story &apos; , Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , English interpretation of the Al@@ do R@@ and@@ land .
in the wake of the start of the work immediately before the work of the A@@ dele@@ ga , the Kli@@ m@@ t went to San V@@ ita@@ s , and the investi@@ g@@ ators believe that it is where the b@@ read@@ th of the mo@@ sa@@ te of mos@@ sa@@ dor@@ est species is the slogan , The@@ o@@ dor@@ n , gave the idea to make a gol@@ den platform for the mo@@ sa@@ ble of the slogan .
the Kli@@ m@@ m presented its &quot; Vienna report 19@@ 0@@ 8 in 19@@ 08 and around the &quot; One of the gol@@ den &apos; in the region ( 19@@ 07 / 19@@ 08 ) .
the historical time of the arts did not have to be seen not by the simil@@ arity of a woman .
how is Hitler involved ?
&quot; I think that my friend Kli@@ m@@ m , I am indeb@@ ted to the memory of him , that he has made it available to the public in his work , &quot; wrote to A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer , a couple of years after the departure of artists ( in February 19@@ 18 ) , and wished to ask the M@@ use@@ um of the M@@ use@@ um from the Directorate @-@ General for the muse@@ um .
the six years before the climate was completed , the thir@@ st of the climate had been killed .
in its minds , too , in February 19@@ 25 , he asked for the hus@@ band to deprive her of its two Portuguese and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ m in Austria &apos;s Gal@@ m@@ m landscape .
in its authentic@@ ation , he has done a sis@@ ter of his sis@@ ters , Mari@@ ale and Lu@@ g .
the year after the Kli@@ m@@ t was an annex to the &quot; Austrian Mon@@ a &apos;s annex &apos; , it has tried to get the S@@ ag@@ ons of Vienna @-@ year @-@ old Ad@@ vis@@ de A@@ ka@@ de@@ f , Hitler , but failed by the German .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism because the anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is due to the fact that the professor of profes@@ sors did not have accepted him , none of his de@@ pic@@ tions was actually in July .
in any case , the role referred to in the Austrian Gal@@ Spe@@ ci@@ i task , which has changed considerably since 19@@ 3@@ 9 , has become a significant example of the wealth of artistic work to be found in Vienna .
some of Hitler &apos;s personal artistic assets have been working at home , but not about the climate .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the na@@ il of art , it started a 10 @-@ year @-@ old dispute between the Austrian Government and B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ kers .
at this point , however , it is only noted that , if &apos; S@@ lu@@ ke &apos; sees a Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere lo@@ opho@@ le in Vienna , the &apos; Da@@ am B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ er image &apos; , the &apos; Da@@ ami @-@ Bau@@ er &apos; is &apos; need to travel to New York in New York .
and before you read in Vienna , the book also has been mentioned .
even if you look at the climate to go to the plan , because at least my emo@@ tions were made following the closure of the book , and the issue of 135 million dollars , and the b@@ ll A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Mrs A@@ dele B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer .
so it is not so much a kind of refuge , rather than a fatal life , and a very much move .
in the event , it facilitated the presentation of the Bau@@ sons &apos; relatives in the beginning of the exhibition at the beginning of the paper .
17 @-@ year @-@ old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonia
there was gold in the past 200 more than 200 more than a personal re@@ cor@@ ning house in 2.@@ 16@@ 62 .

the Estonian re@@ cor@@ ps from the Estonian Le@@ end@@ zi@@ g ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) remained a little over half of the second .
Estonia all at all times rose by the end of gold , and its fresh personal mark is the fifth result of all the time in Estonia .
the hope of the future is Canada on the top 100 m , 200 m , 200 m and 400 , and 200 and 400 m , and 200 and 400 more complex .
last week , in Tor@@ onto , there took place in Tu@@ rin Cha@@ mpi@@ ons in Canada and the gold has done a successful start there .

half a longer @-@ term distance has only reached the seventh seat when the fin@@ est came in 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
the gold is currently leading to the age of Estonia in four different distance sessions .
President T@@ ru@@ g goes on holiday , critics of a too@@ th
the holiday time is in the hands - that means that the US President Donald T@@ ru@@ the .
however , since the T@@ ru@@ g has been one of the most most of the holiday days , the critics have already taken up a too@@ th .
in the US , the United States and CN@@ N have been scheduled for 17 @-@ day leave in the end of the President , in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster clubs , which is located in New Jer@@ se@@ ys .
although the President began yesterday , there has already been a few days in the case of T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i on holiday .
they will be too frequent in T@@ ru@@ g on the Olympic Games .
it is the case that the President is the right time for a week in his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey in New Jer@@ sey .
by the way , T@@ ru@@ g is not the most clean@@ ed by President , T@@ ru@@ g in his 19@@ 6 authorities .
for example , Mr W@@ . Bush arrived at the time of a holiday time , Mr Obama , as Mr Obama , is less than half of the T@@ ru@@ g , but 21 days .
however , the Olympic Games tend to be un@@ wise .
a few days after receiving the President , T@@ ru@@ g said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , so that the lon@@ gest holiday in his father will not survive , because there is a great deal of need to be done .
he also published three years ago on the leave of Barack Obama .
on Twitter at the time , the President signed on Twitter : &apos; at the time Obama is on holiday , gol@@ f , the brak@@ es and the j@@ ig@@ ns of gol@@ f , will go on the brak@@ es and the j@@ ig@@ ns of the j@@ ig@@ ns of the law . &quot;
the White House officials have not received 17 @-@ day gol@@ f visits to a study .
it is being formally called on a working holiday , during which there is no time for the Olympic Games to read or amend .
in addition , it had to be the second reason for holiday .
namely , the White House on the western stock of the western stock of the white house , and therefore , had to leave the staff where it has to leave .
the West is also located in the West and others are in the working space of the President .
&quot; I do not believe that one of you would like to be in August in the West , if there is 38 degrees , and there is no state of office , the White House said a person in L@@ ind@@ say , Mr Wal@@ ters , who stressed that the President will continue to work during the time .
where the President T@@ ru@@ g will follow 17 days , the use of vide@@ os .
blocking of the critics &apos; Facebook page , do not apply to public office when you are not going to vote on the voters &apos; criticism
the father of our country is in a great deal of media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved Mr George Washington , but the newspapers did not have had long enough to start up the ty@@ rann@@ y of the internal politics of the political principles .
of course , it was anno@@ yed to him .
but he did not forced its criticism .
because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression can be taken away from us , and in silence and silent on sheep , we may be in the wake of the massac@@ res . &quot;
this brings me to Mr Ho@@ ner Lar@@ ry , Mr Ho@@ gan , who worked hard to be able to be more in Washington .
it has been blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the week of the week of a complaint by the Union for freedom of freedom of American citizens ( AC@@ L@@ U ) is therefore a court .
S@@ ber@@ ner officials led to an act of empty and web comment fi@@ led by a counter @-@ style &apos; party &apos; interest ? &apos; .
&quot; this is just Facebook , &apos; many &apos; said .
but what counts .
and this is a great deal , in particular , if it is in the Ho@@ gan .
it is ama@@ zed by an overwhelming majority in the national re@@ public@@ o ner@@ b in a democratic state .
his approval of his waiver is a better position among the 50 countries in the country .
it is not an un@@ thin@@ kable response to the fore@@ sight .
he has led to a firm firm in the state of its own principles .
in addition , it has used the main tool to communicate with its voters on Facebook , for example , after the first time in the chemical system , for example , after the use of chemical uses for the first time .
there is therefore a b@@ ric@@ ner cow , which is a formal indication of a public forum managed by the staff of taxpayers &apos; dol@@ l@@ ari@@ s , which is being managed by the workers who have been able to visit the taxpayers &apos; dol@@ l@@ ari@@ s unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
the Minsk press representative in The Washington Prosecutor &apos;s interview in The Hague , claiming that the blocking of comments was not something else as mode@@ stly .
it is too simple , however , to get the picture online across the Internet border controls , spa@@ m or hatred full of the population .
the post has been blocked by several other people whose Ho@@ gan was blocked .
and that is what they are in the same way , who intera@@ ct with their elected leaders , with a teacher , the owner of the company and pas@@ tor , not on the internet .
they all have said that their comments were respectful , thought and not the Roma .
Mr S@@ versi@@ quoted from his postal services , by underlining the Catholic car of Ho@@ gan .
Mar@@ y@@ lan@@ t Bo@@ wi@@ e Bo@@ wi@@ e Bo@@ wi@@ e a lawyer , Sar@@ ma Ra@@ ma Ra@@ man Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not insti@@ l hatred , but on the quite ang@@ ry of crime .
&quot; I welcomed the cour@@ tes@@ y that I am disappointed , because it has not reacted to hate crimes or other recent news , &apos; he wrote the &apos; mail news &apos; with the comments of the report .
&quot; nor do I do not like the idea that , if there are many people who comment on the same subject , some of it will be an in@@ difference to collective efforts , rather than recognising that this is a great deal of concern with citizens . &quot;
what the Governor of the ja@@ ner officials called &apos; A &apos; spa@@ m attack &apos; , would probably call for other words &apos; public support &apos; .
the message of Facebook era allows the messages to be easily adapted , simply blocking the criticism or dele@@ tion of a negative comment .
it is a lot of cleaner than the old when it had to be sent out by workers , so that they collect the newspapers in the newspapers , and to bur@@ n them or arrest those protesting and forced them to remain silent .
but this is exactly what is happening now , simply digita@@ lly .
it is not the first official , who is criticised on Facebook and other social media with too@@ th .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has compla@@ ined to court Twitter by users who have been blocked by Twitter by users .
one of the first signs of court decisions on this subject was the previous week Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ as .
the US circular judge , James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ i decided , in Alexand@@ ria , decided that Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i was represented by the Committee on the Constitution for the first revision of the Constitution , if he blocked the election on Facebook page .
in K@@ oo@@ ck@@ y , ACTA visited Facebook and Twitter as well as by Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in@@ tis ( R ) .
this should not be so difficult .

the province of Indonesia is the poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and the inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one Asian worst .
however , there is also a number of gold w@@ ins in Indonesia .

in addition , Papua ha@@ ke , the value of the timber stocks is estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these mines are a source of pa@@ per@@ ate suffering , as they lead to the stran@@ g@@ ling presence of the presence of Indonesia by a powerful Indonesia .
the New York Times &apos;s study showed that the F@@ ree@@ b report in 2015 has shown that there is approximately USD 20 million from the F@@ DI Payments Force for local military and military units around USD 20 million , including up to USD 150 000 .

according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 69 and thousands of thousands of Indonesia have been beaten and imprisoned .
according to the Committee on Human Rights by the Committee on Human Rights , it was in the 1970s with the massive killing of the memory of the memory of the memory of genocide in the 1970s .

&quot; the number of victims is difficult to read , because this incident is taking place every week , &quot; says Human Rights Watch and Andreas Har@@ son .
absten@@ tions are still more strongly in order , because Papua natural resources have caused the influx of settlements from elsewhere in Indonesia .
the 83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but the demo@@ graphy is changing , because the population of Indonesia , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra , Su@@ ma@@ tra , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ es islands .

the former pu@@ mp capital won by J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta in Papua 29 constitu@@ encies 27 , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
but a very little has changed , but the local feeling has changed .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w , so that he fulfils our hopes on the restoration of justice , &apos; says you &apos; .
in fact , only two months after Mr Jo@@ ko@@ w took office after the only two months after Mr Jo@@ ko@@ w took office .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children were sing@@ led at the majority of the s@@ ong , when the dark motor@@ ists have two Indon@@ esi@@ a .

one soldi@@ er has been shot at the children of children .
one of the children , 16 @-@ year Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , beaten in the very cruel that he fell to the homes .
a few hours later , an early election committee was launched , and next day , things were even further .
around 1 000 young men , women and children gathered in the demand for justice in the local police authorities and the military management centre .
they were we@@ aring private buses and by Papua pa@@ go tri@@ cks in Papua pa@@ go , during which drinks and bur@@ y the poultry s@@ ongs .
a few protests began by the police and military bul@@ lets .
in addition , the soldiers were sent to the soldiers of the army , through the input of a soldi@@ er , &apos; if there are more than three times to resistance , let them go down , according to the official document , which has seen a letter of time , but what has not been issued for local media .
the majority of the city of Ke@@ y City Ko@@ to Ko@@ to , the city of the city of Ke@@ y City ( 56 ) , felt the threat and called for peace , asking for a population to go home .
no one was willing to listen .
&quot; I suddenly have been shot at the left of the left , in my part in the words of the German magaz@@ ine , who took place in the words of the German magaz@@ ine .
we are still not aware of the fact that we still know who was shot , but it says that the soldiers of the soldiers gathered in this month .
&quot; the people were a lot , a lot of children , the &apos; cas@@ ts &apos; is adding .
the local man Al@@ ph@@ us You@@ w became shot in his shoo@@ t , according to three times .
&quot; I would like to go to him and in his body , in order to make sure that this act has been with him , &apos; said the &apos; letter of time &apos; , who is using a lot of indicators in the name of Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who are simply using one name .
&quot; I saw that he has died ... S@@ novel I have been dead ...
Mr Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ides said , the chief Supervisor of Papua police , the chief inspe@@ ctor Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ile said that it was subject only to their own security , as it was attacked .
&quot; we need to protect ourselves if we are threatened by killing , &apos; said the High Commissioner for Papua police , the High Commissioner for Papua Police in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ors were killed in protest and had plenty of injured .
the news about the killings reached , J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta@@ tes , only next day .
the three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ras , held a passion@@ ate speech , where he has expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and promised to deal with the mis@@ treatment of the P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately , so that it will never happen again in the future . &quot;
the Security Minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 , in order to establish a ADR mechanism for tackling crimes against human rights .
but , almost immediately , the ex@@ cus@@ es .
&quot; the majority of crimes took a long time ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and the early 1990s .
it is a matter that we are committed to solving these crimes , but we need to comply with the processes , &apos; he said .
at the time of the list , on 5 June , the W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , on 5 June , has made his words back , saying that he has no intention of creating a mechanism to deal with the complaint by the P@@ ope .
instead , he said that &apos; everything will be resolved according to the law &apos; .
the W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , whose UN has been accused of crimes against human rights in other words over 1 000 people in East Timor in 1999 during the bloody independence referendum referendum , said 11 human rights crime , including what happened in P@@ ani@@ a@@ is .
the families of the victims of the camp were opposed to such allegations .
&quot; I have been listening to four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , &apos; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that there is still a fear for years later .
&quot; I am afraid he is saying .
&quot; I am afraid the army will arrest me , I am afraid that I am shot . &quot;
he bro@@ thers the opinion that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are afraid of the incident in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
he said that the army was beaten after it was helped by the four victims .
&quot; the army had to be tra@@ pped by the army in the army to find me . &quot;
it has not stopped .
in Tuesday , Indonesia fired the population of the villages of Indonesia in the village of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i in a neighbouring town of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
one person was killed and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , when it went between the President of the village and the President of the construction company , who refused to be informed by a man in hospital transport .
this team , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ E@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ w@@ ning fish to fish , died by a hospital .
the emergence of shar@@ k villages were protesting on the construction of a company in the construction site .
according to the police , the people of the village were sentenced by stoning , according to which they responded with warning orders .
but with local authorities , the mobile British people ( Indonesia ) have been shot at the people of the people of Indonesia , killing one person .
&quot; we were in a large majority , we fear the re@@ tali@@ ation , a &apos; letter to the &apos; letter to an 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ le in Ba@@ di@@ i , who live near the hospital in the hospital and saw injury .
&quot; I have sta@@ yed two days in my own house . &quot;
Parliament has insisted on the prosecution of police officers and the re @-@ release of the police of British people in the area .
there has always been a question for the government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development will feed into the me@@ al of Papua hal@@ a@@ c at the heart of the honey , m@@ one , dan@@ ning and da@@ al tri@@ bal dis@@ satisfaction .
many of them have joined in Papua mig@@ rate ( V@@ PL ) in Papua R@@ PL ( V@@ PL ) , which protects the rights of boats , organising the attacks among Indonesia soldiers and attacks on human beings .
some V@@ PL leaders come from P@@ ani@@ a@@ sia , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , the army has arrested the P@@ ani@@ a@@ is and has had to arrest thousands of people over the last few years in the pretext of protecting the sovereignty of the army .
some of them never come out of them .
among the people of Papua people are known as a &apos; tragic &apos; . &quot;
poverty is feeding out .
the lack of ri@@ val@@ ry is being sold at the majority of the majority is too expensive for the purchase of local communities .
labour is the same as un@@ available .
people are growing in their own food , mainly in a little bit , as well as a little fruit and kit@@ chen fru@@ its .
farming is the job of women , each of whom can care for the four or five fields .
they usually keep family from the majority of the recipient , the rest will sell the local market .
ten b@@ ars were paid only 10 000 Indon@@ esi@@ a space ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have deepen@@ ed between oil boats and new migrants , who have arrived at the opening of N@@ ab@@ ire airports with the opening of new airport routes .
these few jobs , which are , will be better educated and prosperous migrants .
the P@@ ope , itself , often lacks a competitive business , or the skills required for a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in the fall of the hos@@ tilities , because there is no job or money , &apos; says the President of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , John Go@@ ba@@ i .
isolation will keep the eyes of the world away from the P@@ ope .
in addition , strict restrictions on foreign media persist .
the first half of this year was sent out French journalists , Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ vari@@ a , since L@@ ong cha@@ mp in Ba@@ vari@@ a , because &apos; they were not following the relevant practices &apos; , although they were rare for this rare film authorisation .
the Vice @-@ P@@ po@@ m K@@ ine , President of the Asian department of Human Rights Watch , has not been implemented by Jo@@ ko@@ w electoral pledges to remove the restrictions on transparency and development to the promotion of reporting and development .
&quot; in Indonesia , Papua most of the provinces of the east of Papua The provinces and the West P@@ ope , journalists are threatening the new threats to the rejection of a visa and a black@@ listing , &quot; said in the statement .
the absence of the press means that the international pressure has been limited to the government of Indonesia with a large extent to Papua neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries encouraged T@@ on@@ ga , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ valu , Mar@@ shall Islands , Tu@@ valu , Mar@@ shall Islands and S@@ e@@ om@@ on Islands , the United Nations Human Rights Council to examine &apos; various widespread crimes &apos; , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the same countries have also supported the V@@ PL .
the press officer , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ner N@@ asi@@ r , Ministry of Foreign Affairs , thre@@ w a group to the accusations of a group , saying J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas journalists : &apos; , in Indonesia , there is still a democratic regime and freedom of the press , so that there is a difficult sign of cases of anti @-@ human rights . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to note .
if the official delegation of the Netherlands headed by K@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra , chaired by the state of the Netherlands , Mr Van B@@ us@@ pu@@ ra , visited by the local people at the meeting , the local people had been interrupted at the meeting , but , according to the source , I would have liked to have liked to have wished to remain silent . &apos; We want freedom . &quot;
in Indonesia , the presidential elections in 2019 will take place , but the boats do not believe that they will vote again in Jo@@ ko@@ w .
&quot; Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man with good intentions , but they are surrounded by people who are involved in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , the President of the Council , Ho@@ ba@@ i .
he wants to give the Jo@@ ko@@ w@@ l to make sure that , in addition to the threat posed by people in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , they are suffering from the poor in education and health due to the threat of the army .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i must , as others , have been given the voice of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , as well as the voice of Mr Jo@@ ko@@ w@@ i , which he has to pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &apos; says he .
despite fears and intimidation , families who have been shot in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , families of the last symbolic of the victims were made by a police force of one victim to the military and the military in the country .
knowing that justice may never be put in place , they will not allow them at least in charge of their crimes to forget .

the autumn will allow a more smart char@@ t of fast track charging , a more resistant to a high @-@ quality and greater water and customs level .
he added that , on the basis of the famous rum@@ ours , there can already be assumptions and forecast the four excellence model that probably will probably be in the wake of the sale tables .
these four smart phones will reach a half of the winners in the autumn of this year .
the long @-@ awaited i@@ P@@ hone 8 and an i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach a po@@ e@@ ts in the middle of September .

I am even surprised that the brak@@ es were in the shops in the form of visas .
I did not see any ambigu@@ ity and no cour@@ tes@@ y .

Mrs We@@ ek@@ y F@@ esti@@ val has been opposed today , the honey F@@ esti@@ val of the We@@ ek@@ y F@@ esti@@ val , and Martin Garri@@ x provided all of us in the last speaker .
the people were really turning the s@@ ong , s@@ inging , tanks , tanks , tanks .
if you have ended , a common mas@@ ses of the protein was lost in the middle of the city .
we are creating a Tro@@ y gallery where , together with all images , what our photo@@ graph@@ s have tried during the We@@ ek@@ o three days .
you certainly have some of them , you are looking for themselves !
for the first time , Mr Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet , the first time will be discussed .
V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ or@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should have a col@@ lisi@@ on track to face the most so@@ w@@ ning boys in the near future to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg of the lon@@ gest in the coming term , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ le@@ in the Office in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ le@@ c , until the Gar@@ cia , the winner of the World Bo@@ ac@@ on Coun@@ c@@ ili , has thrown out a corridor to the second running of a corridor , in order to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ k , the World Bo@@ ac@@ &apos;s , the World Bo@@ ac@@ on .
following the unanimous decision of the Gar@@ cia consensus , the victory of the former A@@ en B@@ ron@@ er Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ different , both mili@@ tants A@@ en B@@ ron@@ different , both mili@@ tants , and both mili@@ tants , are being considered to be considered .
Mr Gar@@ cia gave a better hand and said : &apos; how does it go , the champion ?
I would like to take progress . &quot;
Mr L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko is protected by Mr Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ v on Saturday evening of the ES@@ P@@ N @-@ EU .
if a couple of photo@@ graph@@ s were present , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko pointed out by Mrs E@@ g Kli@@ mas , that it would be possible for the opposition to the opposition to the opposition . &quot;
&quot; I have a former den@@ se , &apos; one of the Gar@@ cia .
&quot; for the Member States , I have received &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so large .
I am low for 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move below .
and he has to move towards a ligh@@ ter approach &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the games have wished it .
let us tell them that . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
what raised the question , whether looking at it should be paid . it is part of its strategy that he wants to allow the L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ l to be put to the end of this year &apos;s debate , to make a period of 6@@ 1.2 kg of this year , in order to make a meeting possible for the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ vans ) who are also interested in combating Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ l &apos; .
&quot; looking at this battle could be a return , because f@@ ans have wanted it , &apos; said Gar@@ cia , saying later that he is open to the fight against any channel that offers the best financial package .
&quot; we are key players .
none of the other name is unable to receive so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &apos;
Mr Gar@@ cia said that he has to call &apos; troops &apos; in L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t &apos; and may go to a look at his Saturday .
however , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was modest in approving Gar@@ cia , saying that he believes that three di@@ ets from the Ri@@ ver@@ ter have seen a very slow @-@ term initiative ; sorry , Mr M@@ me wanted it to &apos; .
according to Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show strength and then to go down .
both confirmed that they feel that they are growing to the strength of the tension .
&quot; this is the fight for the realisation of the realisation .
none of the other confrontation is not so much attention and the summer .
I am more than prepared to work on this , &apos; Mr Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters and the M@@ esi@@ y .
this is a good fight . &quot;
what world is moving on Estonia to move ?
the soil extended and issued a record of the police and border guards ( PP@@ A ) in a record of 13 000 third @-@ country nationals who , mostly in Estonia have travelled to work , learn to study or family .
for example , when the soil has been decided on fixed @-@ term residence permits to be issued 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , the figure was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the authorities do not know how much immigrants finally remain in Estonia , but this analysis will be drawn up by the Ministry of Internal Affairs .
the figure of nearly 500 Ukrainians per year ago in Estonia , when almost 500 Ukrainians per year ago , will start to reach a number of 2000 .
the number of authorisation for authorisation has increased expon@@ enti@@ ally in the wake of the Ukrainian crisis , in 2014 , in a period of 10 @-@ year @-@ term residence permits , a year ago .
in Estonia , we will increase the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia , the fact that the number of Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than 850 Ukraine &apos;s citizens arrived in Estonia .
the Ukrainian community has had a great deal of time in Estonia , and in the face of difficult circumstances , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are being sought in a country where the community and many of the family are already facing a country where the community and many of the families are already facing .
the large number of Ukrainians who have received fixed residence permits and the island was an open @-@ term residence permit even though , over 10 years , the most recent days of residence permits have been issued .
if the Ukrainians come here to work , Russia &apos;s citizens from family migration .
&quot; in view of this historic Russian community , they are more likely to have the most likely family ties with people living in Russia , &apos; said the Internal Protection of the Interior , Mrs Hel@@ ina in Hel@@ ina .
&quot; if you look at where the Russian citizens who have been able to live in the residence permit , then the East Vir@@ u@@ land is immediately , after all of the East Vir@@ s@@ land , is in the Annex he , and pointed out that around 40 % of them have been hel@@ ple@@ ss in the European Union .
the Mul@@ ti @-@ term residence permit received a fixed @-@ term residence permit , which is also a record of a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians did not want to extend the number of Russians .
&quot; Hy@@ pe is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , the new permit for residence permit permanent authorisation has been adopted , explained by the Ministry of the Interior Representative , Ram@@ on , which says , the Russian citizen &apos;s interest in Estonia has remained stable for many years .
in Estonia , at least three years , there will be at least three years of foreign access to a permanent permit for residence permit .
it is aimed at encouraging the emergence of people to adapt to it .
however , a long @-@ term resident permit requires five years .
the new residence permit has also been reduced by the old extension of the old residence permit .
for example , it was granted a residence permit for an 146 Ukrainians who have been working here at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to switch to the work and the Estonian state will no longer be the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit became popular - applicants for the soil in the event of a bad passport ( 10@@ 29 ) , the Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , individuals ( 54 ) and n@@ ig@@ es ( 36 ) .
in the end of Estonia living in Estonia to live on the basis of a residence permit for 19@@ 68 , there are still 23 mayors , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 g@@ Egypti@@ es and the same many Chinese people .
this year , the total number of applicants for such applicants will already be 12@@ 69 .
in the 10 years , there has been a surprise in Nigeria , which citizens are among the more active applicants for the Estonian residence permit .
if three residence permits were issued in 2007 , there are 200 200 .
in Nigeria , there is a lesson to be learned in the universities in the university .
Estonia is more popular , for example , for Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has largely increased thanks to the students .
for them , too , the rule applies to where there is a community that has arisen , more easily to other words , in the Annex .
in ten years , there are two people who have moved in Estonia , for example , for example from North Korea , as much as La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here in Cuba , 2@@ 31 South Korea , 40 in Indonesia and four U@@ ru@@ guay .
if a living permit can be around 6 000 citizens per year , it is about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if the citizens of the European Union , the citizens of the European Union , will remain about a percentage of the &apos; , &apos; , in fact , that the figures are , in fact , the figures .
according to the statistics agency , according to Estonia , there were 14 8@@ 22 people in Estonia , with 13 7@@ 92 .
this means that immigration has exceeded the second year for emigration .
most of the age and contributors are Estonian citizens , but more are those who are leaving them .
it was therefore a bub@@ ble for the citizens of Estonia &apos;s migration secrecy 2000 .
Ukrainians , particularly with the exception of Finland and Estonia .
C@@ ou@@ ture printing s@@ sim@@ ma@@ ge of C@@ ou@@ ture has been lu@@ mped in a few cases , ti@@ gers and t@@ top .
the North @-@ West Bank , however , is the history of Maria Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u , the old ones and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream of hours somewhere at the muse@@ um and the old theft of the past .
if there is nothing to go with you , you will study and learn about it every day .
this is a joy .
the world of C@@ ou@@ kon@@ s , the world of C@@ ou@@ ture , can appear to some of some lives , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think .
you yourself , if you have a great deal of your life .
I have a friend , who has been able to have a bot@@ tle of the ha@@ bit of those who have been created in my way , which has been created .
because , and this is not his fault , that he does not live in the Netherlands and does not go into red days every day , he wants them to carry out the most beautiful v@@ ars and who is suffering .
you themselves live in their own life .
the ar@@ tist does not recognise the gap between the events and hal@@ l of the events .
this is the reasoning that led to a plan to lead the plan in Estonia to land places in Estonia , forests and fields , the people , the people , the people who often do not get .
M@@ long colle@@ cts , for example , was presented for example by comparison , J@@ id@@ vis and Cas@@ tile , where 45 mo@@ del@@ l was held with the King of 45 mo@@ del@@ les .
in Tallinn , there is often a po@@ b in the face of a dignity , but elsewhere , emo@@ tions are more emo@@ tion , s@@ log@@ vo , rise , want to be than@@ ked .
a large part of the audience had to be just as news , but now they are M@@ ou@@ ture f@@ ans at C@@ ou@@ ture .
if you are over the expectations of people , they are spiri@@ ted !
and I like this feeling that I am in my motto as if the summer .
on the occasions , we had a red @-@ me@@ tre of 50 metres , a whole modern distance with you , seemed that they did not end .
Maria Maria does not recognise the mo@@ tive so that the creation of the creation must be presented by a super super super@@ mo@@ ll , he will have good ordinary women .
I often call on our own customers - they have always been happy .
this is , after all , the experience , the harvest in the Laval stage in a fine way .
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen its play , always behind it , and I am not always behind it in order to give things a final piece of things as a father .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow us to look at cal@@ mly .
Maria is this kind of mo@@ el@@ ty and who do not want only the role played by representative role , but in everything else it had to be involved .
I have had my admi@@ ration , for most of the colle@@ ctions , by the majority of colle@@ ctions .
I like the whole process where you play the details with the details .
I will never be able to do with our animal , and I am not afraid .
it is not limited to any matter , as well as intelligent , logistics , organisation , organisation - all of us need to be able to go away from one stamp in the same way .
they are still enormously in a way of working hours for fana@@ tics .
I will not be able to say when my working day ends , for me it is simply full of joy .
I have been very lu@@ cky - that is as an un@@ stop@@ p@@ less fortune : I am doing something fine , a man can be something fine and again , in turn .
several times have been said that my bro@@ ker is in the countryside - they make it felt .
the sensi@@ ti@@ matic je@@ wel@@ les , which Mrs Maria talent has done overnight to hear , is a signal of C@@ ou@@ ture to date .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p U@@ 18 po@@ s : s@@ lee@@ ping tur@@ n@@ out for children has now been turned away with us .
the damage , the mud , was running out .
it was the first thing that we did not get in the hands of my des@@ k .
and if there is a major difference in the table , there is nothing to do with &apos; , &apos; no comment , &apos; , with the exception of 61 from the UK to Britain : 75 be@@ arable Britain , the only N@@ B@@ SBA has played a repetition of the first N@@ B@@ SBA , BC Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo State Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ g .
opponents took an attack on 28 people , with a lot more attacks on this basis .
we were not prepared to protect them as aggressive , and it was created .
many of the children &apos;s attacks ended up by three to five seconds , we were not able to create protection .
however , they have been defended , however , every side between them , we could not combine .
it created a team from his feet .
the anti @-@ domestic work has been better done .
the M@@ y@@ r@@ ka@@ pa estimates that the Estonian levy is expected to do more tac@@ tical errors in order to make the battle against e@@ os .
the last quarter of the last quarter - we had a mistake , but there were already many quick cor@@ ners .
In@@ duc@@ ing and close our close silence , which was a weapon in our weap@@ on@@ ry , now , all of us , addressed all of us .
today we have no power against them .
M@@ y@@ r@@ la@@ p remained neg@@ ligible and Kal@@ ev@@ es , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s .
in general , the security transplant can be said to have good words to date , a single blow to this day .
it is a pity that , in the past , we have already met with an aggressive response .
the whole time has been in self @-@ confident and playing today , but it seemed that he had been ti@@ red - he has suffered a very large burden .
but he made a fine leap in some of you , which I have seen in the past half of what I have seen in the past .
the terrible number of the terrible figures : neo @-@ min@@ ated cor@@ s of E@@ M E@@ M to three waters less than 10 points ...
in the 18@@ 18 age class , only a pension scheme B is not just about B B @-@ di@@ vis@@ ir Tallinn , Mr Maystadt , started in Dublin in Dublin .
and Estonia play , unfortunately , in the area of anti @-@ missile cor@@ ners .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but after a third quarter , there was 9 : 49 of the last few minutes against gas pe@@ da@@ b , and it was a period left in a number of 16 : 16 .
for the first instance , both in the second quarter of Estonia , the third point ...
however , at the beginning of the Est@@ oni@@ ans hit at the beginning of two minutes , two pieces of first ten@@ se have been made , but there is a figure of 25 pieces , one of the tri@@ alogues , and then 21 .
perhaps , in an almost half hour , 47 celeb@@ rations were at a tab@@ oo .
in addition , 2 points had to be referred to in 4 .
the number of losses was a sensible number of this time , 12 .
Poland was in the end of the game of 33 and Estonia for 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , opening on day , to recognise Portugal &apos;s 83 : 56 better .
NATO vessels took up in Tallinn to supplement their stocks

after the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of habits and to be ready for operations for future historical rem@@ nan@@ ts .

B@@ oo@@ st J@@ oo@@ st : Cuba will end up with a &quot; Tra@@ vi@@ ata &quot; and &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; , &apos; Tra@@ vi@@ ata &apos; and &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; , &apos; bal@@ ls &apos; answers to the &apos; B@@ ole@@ ro@@ k &apos; , &apos; B@@ ole@@ ro@@ k &apos; , and also does not lack the scheme , which is , if Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ d@@ n is a wonderful or@@ a@@ iss@@ ance of Mr Ha@@ y@@ d@@ n , &apos; A@@ asta@@ ad &apos; , which has been the case with Mr Ha@@ y@@ d@@ n &apos;s m@@ our@@ ner , the &apos; E@@ asta@@ days &apos; , in 2015 , which led to P@@ iri@@ ta Ha@@ y@@ d@@ n &apos;s Ha@@ y@@ d@@ n &apos; Ha@@ y@@ d@@ n &apos; .
there is much more than the F@@ esti@@ val of Burma if the concerns and theat@@ re answers .
this is greater than any music in any form .
this is the festi@@ val , which will take power and never be completely dis@@ tracted .
because experience , which can be heard and in a cross @-@ border environment , makes human s@@ oul , and it concerns the human side in a way which is not possible to describe it .
for the first year , there are the art leader of the arts at Burma for the first year .
is it not a little bit of b@@ tro E@@ tre K@@ har@@ k , who has not seen a little bit .
of course , as I had a very personal relationship , however , as I had a very personal relationship , it has been helpful .
it has been carried out by my student career and also supported a career in the early career .
perhaps it is very much easier for me to continue his work .
in the various K@@ las , the F@@ esti@@ val team in Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has done so much and , of course , it is all about to me .
it was excellent to join teams who know exactly how things go .
it has also been a great coal by Mrs K@@ har@@ me , who also gave me the strength to go with the F@@ esti@@ val in Tallinn in a good way to Burma .
and here I am now and I can start .
what could be drawn up by the audience in the F@@ esti@@ val , which you have in particular to offer ?
what we have with artists from the country , Latvia , Lithuania , and surpris@@ ingly , as a muse@@ er , the first piece of bal@@ les , written by Mrs L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i .
it is &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson l@@ ent &apos; .
and one of the criminal s@@ ans@@ s of this House is that the bal@@ le@@ author has been held in Latvia &apos;s com@@ po@@ ser , J@@ ur@@ is , Kar@@ l@@ sons , who had its desire to sign it .
he has already lived in the Car@@ l@@ sson of the Car@@ l@@ nes pota@@ to .
how do you know what you know about everything ?
thanks to my support , I certainly will certainly be able to support .
this work needs a good idea and a lot of love , and I am thank@@ fully with the accumulation of it .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tions have not been dependent on the other people , as I am perhaps going to do with any new day , if I am not going to go against any new day .
and I am well aware of the tone of the tone , the preservation of the positive nature and , in fact , the self @-@ employed of ourselves in the morning , raised significantly my percentage of my happ@@ iness .
in particular , this week , when the most important tests are , I have been very keen to exercise this , and it works .
self @-@ priva@@ tis@@ ations of the activist , and it will increase the tone .
that is not just a word .
I think that people do not yet know the things that the univer@@ se offers to them , but everyone itself will slowly be able to do it .
as soon as it is concerned , it is a moment .
it is also a case of a ri@@ val@@ ry before a di@@ gen@@ y before the di@@ gen@@ y ?
there is still a ri@@ val@@ ry to switch to more comfort .
this is a small moment of sel@@ fish@@ ness .
however , in general , yes , I am not the opportunity to do so , before there is a great deal of inf@@ ony .
in fact , I even like to actively communicate with the people , even before the di@@ atri@@ c took place .
but get everything on the F@@ esti@@ val here , which has also been discovered , not particularly for the great o@@ e and bal@@ le@@ ep .
see a moderate video on the front @-@ to J@@ oo@@ va .
new results of the E@@ valuation tests published by Swedish applicants were published
among the applicants in Sweden , it was carried out among the applicants in which the latest results were assessed by the most innovative approach in medical . the latest results show that more than 80 % of the two @-@ ten per parent were assessed by parents than 18 , but not all do not believe any clarification .
the Swedish Institute of Justice ( R@@ CA@@ N ) , the Swedish Institute of Justice , started the test of the beginning of this year .
the tests were set up during the application of an age @-@ based application period after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Migration ) Agency ( Migration / ver@@ ging ) , which has not succeeded in criticising the age of many allegations of minors .
as far as the migration process has now been carried out by migration , 68@@ 80 cases , and the Institute of C@@ T , have issued a total of 24 81 cases from mid @-@ March to 31 July by the middle of March 2017 .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) , 18 @-@ year @-@ old or more than 25 cases were assessed in the case of the age of 18 and 25 cases , so that the test &quot; may be 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older . &quot;
in the 4@@ 32 case , the fact was that the person is &apos; probably more young &apos; .
the tests are used only if the person &apos;s age is a question mark .
at the same time , Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son &apos;s Institu@@ t , which worked in the case of medicine , is consistent with those of the previous months .
&quot; we do not see a major difference between the statistics in previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &apos; he said he said &apos; The Local .
the fact that the vast majority of cases were assessed by parents in the 18 , no necessarily mean that applicants have failed to choose their age .
the Institute was issued in May by the results of 581 tests and said that there are references to the fact that the person being investigated is 18 @-@ year @-@ old or age . &quot;
however , if the author of the Svensson Group examined the results of their 581 tests , the results of these 581 tests , the fact that there was a person in 2@@ 43 in the case of 18 .
the medical age assessment method , in which wisdom has been made , is carried out by MR@@ os and fields by MR@@ V by MR@@ L , and then they will be used to analyse the too@@ th doctors and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts , have been criticised in some circles .
one of the sceptics is the Institute of A@@ k@@ lin@@ ska Institute , Mr Mar@@ cus , whose tasks include the evaluation of human activities in order to identify whether they were able to negotiate with the audi@@ ences in the past or later on .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this , and I do not think that the method used now should be used .
the designation of biological age is very uncertain .
if we do not firmly have to say , we should not be able to do , &apos; he said that we can , &apos; he said &apos; the Met@@ ro .
however , in Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son &apos;s Institute of C@@ T , we defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; generally can say that the in@@ accura@@ cies of the child &apos;s in@@ accurate adult risk is a small risk .
the most perhaps about 10 % , if a person is a little less than 18 . &quot;
9 signs that you were dece@@ ived to a more for@@ gi@@ ant talent .
a more expensive return on the blue and water by someone else .
the Su@@ l is wrong , because you have a great deal of good times and recall .
they would for@@ give him , but will it be the time ...
Mr Y@@ our Tan@@ go lists of nine signs , which show that you have a little bit more than their own , and could give it to him .
a more expensive situation seems to understand the seriousness of the situation , and it has worked hard to resolve it .
a more expensive one is dealing with a problem which , in other words , a stream of flows .
you are no longer in a position of defence .
he regrets , sincerely and will take responsibility for their actions .
he is not trying to blame for your behaviour .
he agrees that it has made a serious mistake and , sincerely , trying to improve the situation .
he is attentive and trying to communicate with you .
at the same time , he was rus@@ hed to get on the matter .
they do not deny what has happened and will not be trying to make it un@@ noticed .
the fact that you have a more expensive understanding of the fact why you have been fai@@ th@@ ful to your question .
you are talking about this and how to avoid this in the future .
better communication and evaluation of each other needs .
in the cost of more expensive attitudes and actions , it has helped to develop its condolences against its mis@@ concep@@ tion .
our commitment and behaviour has created a basis for your proximity and the behaviour that you are going to have .
you have made progress in order to believe again in your unity and relations .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old response , Anna Maria O@@ rel , made the London M@@ M@@ il , the London M@@ M@@ il has made a good debate , with 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 3@@ 7@@ 7 .
Mr O@@ rel was the M@@ M no@@ m , and a pro @-@ woman was re@@ jo@@ ice in the future , that it hopes to fight for med@@ dling in the future .
the contest was well and I received a good experience .
with the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , I did not turn the average result immediately , in the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) , too much and the third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) I have been able to see clear &apos; , &apos; said O@@ rel , after the competition .
I had my own emissions and I am very pleased that I found it .
Mrs O@@ re@@ li M@@ M came to an end to a good 18 @-@ time debate .
Mr O@@ reli@@ t has not been confused , because he will carry out the TT@@ S@@ s in the winter .
&quot; I am afraid &apos; , he said , he said small mud .
in London &apos;s Olympic Games , there was almost a full house of the people , whether the O@@ rel of the people of O@@ rel , or who was able to switch itself off ?
I was in a positive sense , but in a positive sense .
everyone is saying that this will give it , so that it is .
if itself , then , it can be experienced .
Mr O@@ rel assured that the M@@ M dispute and it is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here 3@@ 2nd of the season , which was an end in 18 last year .
this is a very proper result .
I am 20 years and M@@ M@@ il - this is the only one that counts .
I take a good experience and , on some day , I want to compete with the med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina @-@ Governor announced by party exchanges
the Governor of the West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , the Governor of the West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , on a Thursday evening , together with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ er , that he will change the party .
&quot; this or not , but democrats wal@@ king away from my July , &apos; said the Governor of the Justice .
&quot; I say to you , having done a great deal of ball and thought ... today I say to you , in the West , that I cannot help you in a democratic fashion . &apos;
the plan@@ tations in the name of the joy of b@@ len@@ ds .
&quot; it will therefore be possible for me to be re@@ public@@ ised tomorrow .
&quot; I would like to say to you that it is time to play a second game . &quot;
in the past , it has pledged a great deal of announcement in the meeting of the West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
the T@@ ru@@ g won 42 points in the West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ as , and Justice did not support the appointment of the Alliance of Democrats for the Alliance of Democrats in the Alliance .
the right to justice , which is the For@@ der of the State state , proved to be elected in 2016 .
in the Ford , it notes that it belongs in five countries in the fifth of the coal @-@ mining , and it is pretty much on its own .
his value is around USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , the re@@ public@@ s of the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) , on a Thursday evening , that the party exchange of &apos; Governor of Justice Justice &apos; is another blow to the democratic improvement of the country , rather than would like to make it possible to make it easier for the country to work . &quot;
&quot; just 15 months , and control over the countries of the lowest number - Governor of the state of Justice in the history of the &apos; Justice &apos; statement is simply the most recent word of saying what is the case to you , which is the case to the end of the end , and that the message that combines the message &apos; said R@@ N@@ C Mc@@ Daniel Daniel Daniel Daniel Daniel B@@ S &apos; said , Mr Mc@@ Daniel Daniel Daniel Daniel K@@ B@@ S , &apos; Mc@@ Daniel Daniel Daniel K@@ B@@ S &apos; .
there is no surprise that where there is a lot of people , there are also many injured .
the We@@ ek@@ le of We@@ ek@@ y medical tel@@ ine has said yesterday , saying that there has been a record of the pos@@ ters in order to have a pos@@ ter to have the pos@@ ters .
az@@ ks and mar@@ ches are fundamental , sulphur and easy fall .
of course , too , it also - and foot - and foot .
according to Ur@@ me@@ was , the visitors will come to the festi@@ val with false foot@@ wear and the problems come from .
the media have also had to assist people in a couple of injuries - there have been some of the panic and also one of the feet .
we have also done a sis@@ ter if someone has done a hand or the finger at the hands of the person .
we are going to get smaller traffic here , greater we are sending a hospital .
see whether sole@@ mn media would be asking for irri@@ gation of pa@@ tho@@ gens in the media .
Mr Co@@ e has approved an honest apolo@@ gy for the Russians in doping .
international r@@ allies in the S@@ ebas@@ to@@ effect S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , with the S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e Co@@ e , has been accepted by the father of Russia &apos;s Thursday , but repeated that it is not time to allow the country to return sport .
Russia &apos;s ligh@@ t@@ lation of D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ ce@@ h@@ tin , S@@ hy@@ ce@@ h@@ tin S@@ hy@@ ce@@ h@@ tin , has said that it has taken place on the basis of the IA@@ C Congress , that the ban on the competition imposed by his country is the right and it is determined to fight doping .
he apolog@@ ised on all the ligh@@ ts of the &apos; every class &apos; , who has missed the gol@@ den and sil@@ ver med@@ als in competition . &apos;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of leaving the ban on the entry into force , which was introduced in November 2015 , following the report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) report by the state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I believe that this was a very fair response today , a very fair presentation , &apos; the President of the IA@@ AF &apos; , the President of the IAEA .
&quot; the whole Council and the Congress were satisfied that Russia was also recognised by Russia itself , so that they have had quite complicated times and they do all of the Union &apos;s restructuring . &quot;
it was also pleased that it was accepted by Russia to accept the criterion of anticip@@ ating the criterion .
&quot; I believe that today , a very constructive day and progress is taking place , but Congress supports the proposal for a working group that is not the right time to re @-@ withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we need to do everything possible in the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we have always met the principle that we want to be able to obtain a breach of the system , &apos; added it &apos; in Annex .
in the light of the small @-@ Russian population , who will meet the strict criteria of the IAEA , on Friday , in London , the global champi@@ on@@ ship of neutral ath@@ le@@ tes will compete with neutrality .
the Head of the R@@ une Ander@@ sen , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , on Monday , said that Russia does not comply with a number of predi@@ ctions .
following a presentation by the IAEA to the Council , in London , he said to journalists in London that doping is still insufficient and has still been operating freely .
the electric car Revolution makes a significant contribution to the demand .
who is the winners and losers ?
the fact that the electric car Revolution makes a significant difference to the fuel market up to infrastructure , it will also create a new winners and losers .
although the hor@@ rors like G@@ len@@ o can say that in one place they will win and lose , then the smaller ones will not help .
at the moment , G@@ len@@ core coal and oil , but in the era of electricity cars , there is growing co@@ balt , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and n@@ ik@@ is .
this year , the decisions of the electricity cars have increased the decisions of the UK , France and Norway , who allow for a ban on the sale of fossil fuels to new cars in the coming decades .
we have therefore already informed the Vol@@ vo aware that they intend to abandon the inland combustion engine and the T@@ es@@ la will bring the market on the market with a cheaper state of electricity .
B@@ animal berg , according to New Energy Finance forecasts , is already sold over two decades to electric cars , more than cars produced in electricity .
&quot; some of the parts of metals make it all &apos; , the Capital Policy , Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ ini B@@ animal @-@ ber@@ g B@@ fauna .
we have already seen a major impact on such metals , such as co@@ balt and li@@ li@@ um , which is a demand for years .
the electricity car is about three times more than more than usual cars , the G@@ len@@ core .
moreover , there is a need for re@@ charging stations , which is why the Ex@@ qu@@ er B@@ N@@ P Paris will increase demand for around five per cent by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional lit@@ res , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man @-@ in @-@ man .
the main profits of electric cars in the world can increase the price of electric cars , and that there is the world &apos;s largest co@@ balt , the forecast producer in J@@ eff@@ ently .
it concludes that it is estimated that there is a shift in the vic@@ torious car car race to the Mc@@ Mo@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First @-@ European Min@@ er@@ th Min@@ er@@ ms .
the market will respond to changing trends .
this year , there has been 70 per cent of 70 % in London .
the price increase was 37 per cent .
there has also been 14 % of this year &apos;s calendar , mainly because of economic growth .
G@@ len@@ core shares in London rose by 20 per cent , having exceeded the price rise by ri@@ val Rio T@@ into Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ on@@ on and Ang@@ lo , as well as .
on the part of the manufacturers , companies are engaged in lead , such as Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine , who must adapt to the new era .
the ultimate use of the P@@ li@@ ar @-@ end @-@ use of petrol and diesel engines is equipped with bat@@ teries .
electric cars will be used by li@@ li@@ ger@@ y .
&quot; this is a serious risk for lead to lead requirements when it finds itself intended to overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said the Bank of the Bank of America as well as by Michael W@@ id@@ mer Lyn@@ chi , the Bank of the Bank of America .
in the form of price migration , it is not yet a way of roll @-@ out on the impact of the f@@ all@@ out .
the P@@ li@@ i is 17 % this year , while this is the best meta@@ med by the main industrial metals in London .
investors see problems from me@@ tal only far from the future .
&quot; I am not sure that lead is a bad thing , because cheap oil will keep ordinary cars in competition &apos; , said Her@@ wi@@ g &apos;s company in Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ s , Mr Her@@ wi@@ g .
if demand falls , it will slowly take place .
it can be the case for around 10 years .
in the meantime , stricter emissions of exha@@ ust gases mean that the demand for hybrid and more frequent engines will be increased by the demand for advanced engines , the international lead and an organisation of research .
Ker@@ g@@ metal@@ graph@@ s like alu@@ mini@@ um substitu@@ tes , because let us get a car to go beyond the less electricity .
this has already been explained by 2013 @-@ 2016 , an additional 1.6 million tonnes of demand until 2013 .
this represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s product of alu@@ mini@@ um .
this trend is expected to deepen , W@@ id@@ mer said .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um is 13 per cent of this year , since the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to the market deficit .
the steel producers do not .
the failure to work together with General Motors in order to use nano@@ technologies for the production of nano@@ technologies .
Mr Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and the Europe are trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down from the bottom of the order to oppose the adoption of lower minimum .
&quot; a strong currency should be the answer to this development &apos; , &quot; said Ex@@ po B@@ N@@ P Paris , and Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ y .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also lead to the suffering .
it took around half of this precious me@@ tal @-@ diesel motor vehicle as a catalyst for cars , announced by the Ro@@ man Ex@@ po and Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ sooner .
&quot; in many times such as oil and pla@@ ins , such as oil and pla@@ ins , there may be no high demand for the future , by Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h , in the course of the number of women in the future .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will become the 15 years .
Sa@@ at@@ in@@ ators believe continued demand for a diesel hybrid good .
Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , head of prime head , said that the 20@@ 25 will continue to be sold in 20@@ 25 , more than more hybrid cars .
the great hope of the production manufacturers in 10 years is To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors , and Mr Mo@@ to@@ si have developed cars based on hydrogen @-@ based cars , which are dependent on pos@@ ses@@ sing in order to produce hydrogen .
however , this technology , however , has not yet been justified by the technology .
&quot; Di@@ A seems to have a clear chaos on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ po B@@ N@@ P Paris in Br@@ un@@ en .
German car manufacturers had a major set@@ back in July , because the S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art Court was banned in the printing city of diesel , Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how football will affect the transition from Ney@@ mar@@ i to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the in@@ vent of European football clubs are not stopping Som@@ o World record transition from Spain from the French football clubs in the Paris club in the French club of the Barcelona Paris @-@ Saint main .
any consequences as UEFA , the governing body , which is within the European game and in which teams are able to prohibit the participation of the Cha@@ pres@@ ti@@ er Me@@ is@@ ter Me@@ asures , the Paris K@@ Saint Ger@@ ma@@ tis will still be able to be banned .
the financial rules laid down by UEFA in 2011 ( F@@ F@@ P ) mean that the PS@@ G will have to demonstrate that the transition from Ney@@ mar@@ i was funded without a huge loss .
EUR 2@@ 22 million ( EUR 2@@ 62 million ) were paid for , so that the Brazili@@ ans were buying up , and Mr Ney@@ mar@@ i &apos;s pay is beginning to go to tens of millions of dollars per year .
there are some financial aspects of the presence of Ney@@ mar@@ i French clubs .
the PS@@ G is undoubtedly possible to take advantage of the money to go to Som@@ der , and to add such money to the top of their sta@@ rs , given that the team finances the family in Ka@@ tar .
in K@@ lu@@ bi@@ del , there are plenty of spent spending on players , but they need to balance the legal sources of income that allow them to come up with a football shir@@ t .
Mr Pla@@ tini , following the appointment of UEFA as President of the UEFA Presidency in 2007 .
this former French player , so that clubs who are going to take progress in large debts in the search for a major debt , in fact , when banks or owners should renoun@@ ce .
since 2011 , the F@@ F@@ P club club will focus on their losses to be monitored .
this amendment means that the business model that Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch used first in 2003 - to buy a club with the potential , and then to make huge costs to make the team better and to create a global brand - it is harder to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period , which runs until 2018 , the club will be able to transfer the club up to EUR 30 million .
and in spite of the fact that the Pla@@ tini was dis@@ credi@@ ted in 2015 , the presidential office is a disgrace , in his successor , UEFA &apos;s successor , UEFA will continue to commit itself to excessive costs .
&quot; F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will certainly continue to strengthen these rules , &apos; said the previous week on the coup Mr Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is UEFA &apos;s F@@ F@@ P with the specta@@ tor of F@@ F@@ P .
although the PS@@ G bu@@ p for the transfer clause of one of the full disbur@@ sement clause , they will be able to distribute the amount of the total contract for the purposes of the contract .
Mr Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it is possible to show the transition from the next five years of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million .
in the case of the first wave of sanctions for F@@ F@@ P , the PS@@ G , together with Abu D@@ ha@@ b , was the most severe sanctions in Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga .
the PS@@ G was appointed by EUR 60 million ( at the moment , at 82 million dollar ) , which were reduced later than 20 million to EUR 20 million , and a club of Me@@ asures in the League of Sport for the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of 25 players .
UEFA is looking at the club , who can try to regulate over @-@ regulatory financial institutions , blow@@ ing up their income through companies .
this company may have the PS@@ G spon@@ sor , but if spon@@ sorship value is considered to be standard market rates over@@ runs , UEFA would not allow UEFA &apos;s income to take into account .
this happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar tourism is the value of the value of the support of the G20 .
it has been said that some of Mrs Ney@@ mar@@ i &apos;s PS@@ G can come from the management committee of the A@@ C@@ T by 20@@ 22 for payments by the G@@ C@@ T .
however , the PS@@ G and the Ka@@ tar 20@@ 22 would deny that Som@@ der could become a world leader since the World C@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities can easily identify such manoeuv@@ res .
the penalties imposed before the PS@@ G mean that UEFA is even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
the people are familiar with the word on Thursday , that UEFA has not discussed the transition by UEFA to Som@@ el@@ i .
they spoke about the inclusion of the coup , provided that it is guaranteed by anon@@ y@@ mity , because they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PS@@ G .
the latest reports show that the PS@@ G will lead to more than EUR 10 million in 2015 @-@ 2016 as a profit of around € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the data for the last financial year has not yet been published .
the PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Som@@ zer arri@@ vals is well @-@ spon@@ sored transactions , freight transport and a label sale .
it looks forward to the conclusion of the agreement with a minimum increase in the amount of a percentage of 30 % .
it is too far too , with a clear irri@@ tated from the departure from one of the largest football marks , trying to prevent the transition from Mrs Ney@@ mar@@ i , claiming that the PS@@ G is in breach of the F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear case of the &apos; financial doping &apos; case with a club and a country , &quot; said the La List President Javier T@@ eb@@ as , said , by President of Spain , by referring to the fact that the PS@@ G is mainly of the Cata@@ tari@@ ats .
Ar@@ sen@@ t W@@ en@@ ger , whose club belongs to the American mag@@ na@@ a@@ di , with a club of American sport , shares the attitude that the country will fund a club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights , and it has completely changed the whole football landscape in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger Thursday .
&quot; if a club belongs to a country , all can be possible .
it is very difficult for the financial rules to be respected , since the country may be other ways or other interests to represent a large player . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep an interest rate of 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to see that interest rates remain in the former level , since economic growth and inflation are un@@ miti@@ gated speculation on the rise .
the Bank of England has warned that growth persists , since households have made interest interest rates .
policy @-@ makers of the Bank &apos;s financial policy committee ( MP@@ C ) , the policy @-@ makers of the Bank of 6 : 0.@@ 25 % in favour and less members require a rise in this month because the slow growth has weakened the rise in growth .
in its Quartet report , the Bank will cut the forecast of 1.7 % in 2017 and in 2018 , in addition , and warned that household incomes remain , since the autumn is still expected to rise to inflation in 3 % .
at the same time , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in inflation in the next few years is the necessary and necessary for the financial markets to curb inflation in the light of the Bre@@ x@@ it@@ from , which may be necessary in the next few years .
Members voted a year ago , as a result of the Bre@@ x@@ ti , the part of the partial readmission plan that has been launched as a result of the Bre@@ x Package .
the Bank will end up @-@ term finance in February , which provides for the banks cheap money , even though it has now said that GBP 15 billion under this scheme will be expected to be made by GBP 15 billion .
with regard to the decision on the record , the bank is saying : &quot; the main forecast forecast in EPAs remains to remain power@@ less in the near future , since the difficult situation of households will have a difficult situation in households . &quot;
rates were repeated that there is a need for some efforts to mitigate inflation in order to mitigate inflation &apos; and &apos; somewhat larger &apos; if the markets have been expected .
Mr Bö@@ rs will forecast the first quarter of the second quarter of the year 2020 and 2020 .
however , the bank stressed that any hy@@ th@@ ick and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for the next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % of the forecast in May .
the forecast of 1.8 % in 2018 has remained .
it fell by GBP 1 cu@@ cu@@ mbers to the dollar and the euro .
Na@@ el decreased by 0.5 % of USD 1.@@ 31 and 0.@@ 4 % of EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointment of the so@@ w@@ ers in the recent disappointment , which has raised the increase in the increase in GDP , in the second quarter of 0.2 % of the previous three months , from 0.2 % of the previous three months .
the bank is saying that growth remains at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of this year , it will be a slightly boost .
the latest inflation report by the Bank gave a little reason to re@@ jo@@ ice up inflation and w@@ ret@@ ched wage increases , saying that the situation goes slightly worse before a further improvement .
it was added that the monetary policy cannot be avoided in the coming few years , but the end of the three @-@ year forecast is expected to pay a significant return to wages .
as a result of the sin@@ es , the economy will also encourage a growing demand for British production , which will be reimbursed in part of the cost of consumers .
the decision must be taken since the rates were passed in August by 0.@@ 25 % after the shock of the EU @-@ i referendum , which caused GBP sudden weakened .
the Bank estimates that there will probably be four years in order to recover prices and to the economy fully .
before the latter last decision was felt by increasing demand for raising the rate , since inflation has increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers have made an increase in 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month compared to the June 2.9 % , although the Bank &apos;s message was expected to be a rise in the coming months .
the bank said that excessive growth compared to 2 % , with a view to the high level of p@@ ounds .
Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke leader , Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , has said in Co@@ rec@@ o : &apos; the recent fall in the terrible decline in the mort@@ ga@@ ges seems that the mortgage market will once again become more increasingly competitive , as credit len@@ ders and hoping to put an end to a positive year .

N@@ HS is in writing 10 000 people in the face of a contradiction of the HIV medicine
patients have access to the &apos; trans @-@ format &apos; , which has been left behind in September since September , to whether the N@@ HS should be funded .
it is estimated that public health is now estimated at 10 000 people in pre @-@ year @-@ year @-@ @-@ @-@ professional @-@ related professions ( Pr@@ EP ) , which has been proven before the exchange of risks , which has shown the risk of conta@@ gi@@ on , of approximately 86 % of the risk of conta@@ gi@@ on @-@ risk people in the case of 86 % of the risk of infection .
N@@ HS agreed to finance clinical tests after the Court of appeal was supported by the Court of Justice last year , according to which N@@ HS Pr@@ EP has to pay , regardless of its own statements that the pharmaceutical industry should fund the local authorities .
Mr Ste@@ vens welcomed , Mr Ste@@ vens welcomed this Thursday , the Executive Director of the Commission , on Thursday , as the National a@@ id@@ man Fund ( NA@@ T ) has described this &apos; turning moment &apos; , as a national a@@ id@@ er fund ( NA@@ T ) .
the basic health clinical London London , B@@ righ@@ ton , Manch@@ ester is , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ oli@@ s and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d , among those who are going to register , in October , only the clinical trials before the April programme will be introduced in England everywhere .
you pre @-@ emp@@ t@@ ency ( Pr@@ EP ) are a le@@ th@@ al of HIV medicines , which is taken before the interim order to reduce the risk of HIV @-@ related infections .
the results of clinical trials show that Pr@@ EP reduces the risk of HIV transmission rates among people who are affected by the threat of HIV .
the Pr@@ EP &apos;s adoption before the interim procedure means a sufficient number of medicinal products that hinder HIV @-@ related infections .
these medicines can be taken every day , or two hours at the latest .
it would include L@@ GB@@ T men , people of L@@ GB@@ ans , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are living with HIV to be treated with HIV .
the best @-@ suited people who agree in a clinical order to participate in a clinical order , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those who are not living with anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen their family doctor will also be able to participate in the local sex health clinical trials that participate in the programme .
the programme will pay 10 million GBP 10 million and N@@ HS is signed by the Treaty in order to get the medicines this week after international procurement procedures .
the pilot attempt is to assess the actual potential of the Pr@@ EP , by gathering clinical evidence to whom the medicine is used and how it will be used in a large scale .
Ste@@ vens said : &apos; this new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and boost the fight against the proliferation of HIV .
this is another milestone in the long @-@ term fight for mankind on one of the largest health issues in the world . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ d gold , NA@@ T Executive Board , said : &apos; this is a turning moment in the fight against HIV .
the Pr@@ EP , if this was correctly taken to those who need and are at risk of risk , offers an opportunity to make England HIV epi@@ demics .
since September , people in England have access to a powerful new tool , through a clinical attempt to have access to a powerful new tool which is individually managed and depends on the negotiations with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian CE@@ O of the Ter@@ rence I said : &apos; I am first of a priority to ensure that the clinical test is postponed and that no HIV group should be postponed and that no HIV group should be excluded .
now , when the Pr@@ EP Platform &apos;s clinical test is to be carried out , we are on the way we will be able to protect more than 10 000 people who are experiencing a risk to HIV .
the Minister for Public Health , Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , said : &apos; Pr@@ EP @-@ i clin@@ ic tests are very welcome and a great deal of late delays and in@@ vention of the government &apos;s sho@@ es .
evidence shows how big changes can be brought to an end to the spread of prevention of HIV prevention and the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will lead to a step closer to the Pr@@ EP advantages of the Pr@@ EP advantages .
it is important now that the clinical test should be introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV , and to bring us a step closer to the stopping of HIV spreading in society . &quot;
the price of electricity rose in Estonia by 12 % , Latvia and Lithuania fell .
in the next day , the gap in electricity was reduced in the price gap between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania , to EUR 1.@@ 94 , compared with the euro , the € 7.@@ 71 was in June .
the main cause of the difference is the European Union &apos;s rich in the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish .

it was not enough to include two space of space , so the challenge of architecture was to create a half @-@ right , which could stand up .
in Er@@ fan , we had to take the approach to the creative .
&quot; Me@@ tal@@ lation is quite complex , &apos; explains it .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise rooms , so that they are located on each other , without any other way .
it was not just a platform for building a platform , but we used the construction of a space for overcoming and lower space . &quot;
it has allowed the Er@@ fan@@ il in the room to create a b@@ read@@ th of each other in the room , with a great deal of dramatic elements .

in the short corridor , it has been added to the mir@@ rors that it seems to be longer .
it leaves it with a second p@@ a @-@ stop window to give the impression of a second p@@ a .
at the same time , it provides a reflection on the deposit of all Jo@@ anne ch@@ op@@ ts and glass requirements for all of us .
housing is adding to a false opportunity to shut down , if it is not being used , creating a wh@@ im of wor@@ dings .
the glass kit@@ chen is nothing new .

&quot; it went a bit in a way forward , &apos; explains the Er@@ fan ter@@ as@@ hing of the Er@@ fan M@@ D@@ F .
&quot; this is the responsibility of the responsibility , which is why it is very simply to reject it . &quot;

in the first half of the film , I think that it is &apos; the &apos; business world &apos;s version &apos; , even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r , is similar to .
however , what the film is going on , however , as an element of a little less fe@@ ar@@ ful houses , and the mor@@ alising intention of film @-@ makers remains and more than ever .
life @-@ changing experience can be seen at a po@@ cket @-@ ill @-@ disease phenomenon .
there is now a choice between working and family life .
the po@@ g of executive office puts a father from his feet in Ch@@ ic@@ ago on the big buildings to think of the very important buildings , as religion , love , love ... , non @-@ emp@@ t of the disaster even is not the case .
after the third , where the son &apos;s father is opening up , there is a feeling that the film @-@ makers have certainly been able to obtain the objective of the audience , because even the most of the heart of the view is unable to keep the suffering of a doctor in cancer , with a view to preventing the suffering of the baby cancer .
if the po@@ g is falling into and his situation , the father will be able to understand the father , and he will be able to understand his work , and it is doing a good thing to do so .
I now come in a sense of self @-@ bet@@ ting , if it is in the form of a fil@@ ter , then you will reward his cu@@ t@@ ency after the film , when I am wrong , then at least one sur@@ prises would be applau@@ ded .
there will be a suspicion for a moment that the residu@@ al coff@@ ee should be met without the use of the spo@@ use and a man in a le@@ th@@ ne corridor in a motor@@ way .
however , the Po@@ e@@ g is perfectly healthy , and although his father has lost its father , it will prove a positive thing because it is now time to deal with family .
I can also feel well - I can end up with the end of the American dra@@ ma .
in fact , the film is well designed , all the elements that are necessary for this .
there can be a baby , an actor is good and mor@@ ality : the money is not the most important in life .
this film is very well added .
the new &apos; new staff &apos; of staff will be able to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F@@ . Kelly can also start .
it would be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes , the policy of political tic@@ o , that the new staff of the White House will be able to limit President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope that it will keep the gap in the stock .
there are reports here from Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sel :
&quot; if the new staff of the White House in John Füle , Mr Kelly , on the first day , he received high @-@ level officials , he pointed out the key issue Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ ty Ma@@ needed , which he intends to resolve in the hands of the President , in the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly said that the information must move through , whether on paper or meetings , because the President would make better decisions if it is shared with good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly , it seems perfectly logical , but others have tried , and they have been trying to shoo@@ t the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i in his media control .
the ratio of the President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television amounts to decades and now , when he is in Val@@ o Ma@@ needed , his TV watch has not gone off .
&quot; if the applicant was in T@@ ru@@ g in the media following the unfair media record , it was shown to show him that he was involved in the declaration of the impact that he was concerned , &quot; the former campaign called N@@ un@@ berg S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg in February .
Poli@@ tic@@ o tara Pal@@ mas wrote at the time that &apos; six @-@ former campaigns &apos; , according to the &apos; six @-@ former campaign &apos; , is a key to the management of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter as a key to ensuring that he has a personal media consumption in a stable manner . &quot;
it is good .
however , the idea that T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s use habits have never been under &apos; control &apos; , is ridiculous .
perhaps they are aware of the campaigns that the rest of us are not aware of the fact that T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i would not be aware of the birth of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , without their intervention .
we will probably not have to be aware of the ut@@ ter charges that did not have issued a bun@@ dle .
if he was able to save whether or a couple of bankers who were able to save them , they were worth doing so .
however , no one has been able to obstru@@ ct T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i consistently from creating controversy .
part of the problem is that , in the Val@@ ty Ma@@ in Ma@@ in , who has been in competition , people are not only trying to promote their own interests , by sending out the walls of T@@ ru@@ the , which will support the Olympic interests of their world &apos;s views , but perhaps not always credible .
as a whole , policy @-@ tic@@ o wrote a advis@@ er to the President in May of the tendency to provide a strategic approach to the President in May .
one of the examples described by Mrs Sh@@ ane artificially is the next :
&quot; the current and former T@@ ru@@ g will say that T@@ ru@@ g can respond to the negative press , particularly with the adverse impact on information , explo@@ sive information , explo@@ sive , taking off the source of their source of origin .
this has also happened at the end of February , when someone gave a loss to a copy of the cop@@ ies of the Internet provocation by Charles C. Joh@@ n@@ son , a website belonging to the G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com article , which bla@@ med the staff of the staff of Mrs Wallis , that he was a White House for a series of information about the White House . &quot;
there is no distinction that in Joh@@ n@@ son , as a result , Twitter was blocked or that he did not provide any concrete evidence or that he has made a mistake in the past and withdrawn them .
in T@@ ru@@ g lu@@ ges , Article and took place in Wales . &quot;
Gold@@ mar@@ cher added that the latter will be the case for the Re@@ ports and the White House of the White House in Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , has tried to establish a system for managing and documentation of T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same .
perhaps it will be a privilege of more efficient leadership , but the T@@ ru@@ g is still an impul@@ se and that it continues to have an impact on his own competition .
these changing factors make it very difficult by Mr Kelly .
elderly mus@@ ici@@ ans have been able to obtain their mus@@ ici@@ ans from today &apos;s capital .
there is a lot of foreigners in the middle of Tallinn .
those with whom the fire will become , acknowledged that there is a presence in the elderly , without the permission of the city government .
the first we found in the middle of the Vir@@ u &apos;s ga@@ te@@ er , who were in the same way , who were the same as they have done with them .

it makes no sense to pay for it , Mr Bo@@ b .
if we were going to get around 20 minutes at the gates of Vir@@ u , we saw that two women are among mus@@ ici@@ ans and time@@ liness .
it will be a good omen for the cross @-@ accumulation of plastic carrier bags and bags in the middle of Vir@@ u .
Mr Vir@@ u was also represented by three people in Polish young men , one of which played a fifth , second k@@ lar@@ ing , and the third was , in the name of electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to provide people with enter@@ tainment to be able to spread music and joy and so that the money for fuel and residence for fuel and living is explained by M@@ iv@@ os@@ h from M@@ iv@@ os@@ h .
according to M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there must be the authorisation of the municipal authorities to take place .
&quot; of course , we do not have this &apos; , he has said it .

of course , if the police must be , we are going to go elsewhere , but we will have to try , in Annex he .
the Estonian Bank bought the euro area in the framework of the public sector of central banks in the euro area in July 149 million bonds , the flag bond bonds portfolio increased to EUR 4.@@ 36 billion .
more detailed information on purchases will not be in detail .
President Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , President Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , has made clear that the euro system will be made by the central banks of the euro system in order to cover three different purchasing plans : bonds from the financial sector ( in the form of a set of reference ) , assets guaranteed ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public bonds ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank purchase bonds from the market in order to encourage bonds by investors to invest in money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases will fall into a low @-@ risk asset , and it will motivate investors to take greater risks .
within the framework of the public bond programme , the central bank is buying its national government bonds , with other national bonds .
as Estonia has issued bonds issued by Estonia , the Bank of Estonia will make it available to them within the limits of the so @-@ called replacement .
the central banks will also make purchases in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian Bank buy H@@ ans@@ son &apos;s assurances , for example , European financial stability fund and European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian bank purchase bonds as part of the year in March 2015 .
in the meantime , Ele@@ ction bonds , and Estonia &apos;s June 2016 , have also purchased bonds , but a bank of Estonia in June 2016 .
on behalf of the euro area , the central banks of the euro will buy and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds since June , as well as Estonia .
migratory movements are ignoring degrees and return to millions of business . &quot;
some of the West Mid@@ lands , the most of the homes of the West , have been re @-@ owned by a dis@@ gus@@ ting confrontation , which has ignored the fo@@ ols of the Council , which has ignored their cotton .
the speculators have been hi@@ jac@@ ked by the tra@@ cks of their 20 tra@@ ilers , &quot; with a view to the &apos; ris@@ ked So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l &apos; in the street .
they have returned to the horse , along with the hor@@ ses , children and trucks , the army of the child and lorry , when they only come out of it in May , without being thrown out of a my@@ th , un@@ te@@ nable to prevent their invasion of Council .
the group considered a weak position by means of a defence limit , turning a blind eye to the vehicles that were left to do .
the people who are ang@@ ry are ang@@ ry from the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Council , saying that &apos; the problem is useless in dealing with the &apos; problem &apos; .
one anon@@ ymous person said : &apos; they are home there , on a Monday night after the Ben@@ ad@@ y He@@ ath@@ from , where they were elected by stoning .
it must be a disgrace that they should act , because they are in a way to deal with the problem .
speculators were there in May , they were time to go and now they are once again .
they had to be done yesterday evening , most probably today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Burma is aware of how to deal with such things , by obtaining a long barrier to protect their par@@ ks .
I live on the road to strike , and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay the payment of a total tax if the Council is not even able to prevent such things . &quot;
one local person , who also wanted to be anon@@ ymous , said : &apos; this is a lu@@ dic@@ rous one : the latter have been left up , and we have already seen a new offensive .
this time , the number has increased and the grass@@ land have even been a horse to remember . &quot;
the representative representative of the So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l Council said : &apos; we are aware that the route of the road to a war near the land is unacceptable , and we are working together in So@@ lih@@ ul@@ l police . we are implementing the necessary legal measures to move them as quickly as possible .
in the collection of evidence , it is very helpful when many local residents of any kind of antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour in the police , call the number of 101 or criminal behaviour are very helpful .
this will help to establish a picture of the situation for the Court if we are presenting the case . &quot;
the We@@ esti@@ val in the F@@ esti@@ val will also visit all of the other among others , Minister of Culture In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is pleased that Estonia has succeeded in bringing the top names of the world &apos;s top names .

it says , however , that the crisis has come to the real players in its area .
&quot; looking at the level of artists , which has been achieved in Estonia , then it will be to be placed on the top top names of its music , often in the light of the absolute names of us , who will speak , Minister for Culture .
however , what are the festi@@ vals in the festi@@ val of Sa@@ art themselves in the first place ?
I have to be a relatively old human and one of the old people , and for the old people , it is certainly one of the most experienced ar@@ tist , Ar@@ min van B@@ re@@ n , who took place yesterday evening .
after all of us , all of us have now made a grip on their own language . &quot; he has made a word &apos; .
however , it will also bring about a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ lis , De@@ ad@@ er@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ r .
of course , our Estonian players : starting from the F@@ o P and they can read a whole series of .
in reality , this well @-@ known concentration of names is very high . &quot; says he .

the awards will be renewed in the middle of the criticism by the car manufacturers in the middle of 850 000 diesel vehicles .
the day before the Au@@ d has said , B@@ M@@ W , in order to provide software modernisation more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chair of the B@@ M@@ W , the company believes that &apos; there is a more intelligent option as driving restrictions &apos; , referring to the European cities , including B@@ M@@ W homes , which have considered a ban or restriction of diesel vehicles .
the Da@@ im@@ ler announced the fact that , on Tuesday , to reduce gas emissions from diesel engines , the three million of Mercedes au@@ ctions in Europe .
no company did not describe these procedures as a re@@ call .
European car manufacturers have made an advertise@@ ment of the use of diesel in Europe and in the United States , in order to assist the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide of nitrogen ox@@ ide in diesel is considered to be carcinogenic , and that may cause as@@ th@@ ma .
the cost of waste emissions from diesel for car companies will also increase , by changing the cost of waste emissions from diesel , by making cars at competitive prices .
at the same time , while German car manufacturers are under @-@ thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused by Chancellor Merkel &apos;s government in the b@@ lending of powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the problem .
businesses are trying to prevent the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen to avoid the errors of the mistakes of the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen who made it to be able to be able to make the use of exha@@ ust emissions from the time of testing a car that allowed the car to be adapted to the test of the car .
a number of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen will be prosecuted in the United States and others are under the investigation of the Atlantic .
last month Germany was arrested as a former president of the engine development unit in Germany .
the former President Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o are Ita@@ lians and is therefore protected from extradition , and may go to the Court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , the Au@@ di prize was drawn up in Germany with Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen if the authorities bla@@ med the installation of the Audit system in order to evade the emissions from Europe &apos;s emissions requirements , by extending this investigation , which was focused on the United States in the past .
the inclusion of the awards can be the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen to be a great blow to the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen manufacturer , a disproportionately large proportion of the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen profit .

the murder of journalists stresses the growing situation in Mexico
the week &apos;s week , the workers of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , are usually gathering on Wednesday , to review plans for the most recent chaos in the state of origin , which so@@ w organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ un@@ ted drug wars .
but today they have gathered to discuss their own security in the shadow of the personal tragedy .
they are told that it is important to change its rou@@ tine .
two parents will be discussing , either safer : to bring children with office in 2009 , which was a target of grants in 2009 , or to leave them home .
the security experts have written room at the forefront of three words : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; the neutrality of the &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking reports for the names of all forms of error , it is enough to make the impres@@ sions and internal inter@@ faces .
the presence of the government or car@@ tels is suspected of drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists in the position of a whole list of evil who are doing in Mexico as dangerous .
the violence is not dis@@ per@@ sed , and more than more man@@ ners of the dead body are accumu@@ lating in the country , more than journalists are reported by journalists , according to the protection of journalists from the Committee on the Committee on the Protection of journalists , as they have been at least 25 years after the attacks and threats of national protection , and this year , at least seven journalists have been attacked and threatened by at least seven journalists in the state of national protection .
the latest deaths include their edit@@ or and inspiration for their edit@@ or and inspiration , Ri@@ o@@ ce co @-@ foun@@ der Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &apos; wrote in Val@@ dez @-@ in @-@ Val@@ dez one of its many drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though its presence may perce@@ ive the high picture of a fa@@ ç@@ ade on the head of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building building a fa@@ ç@@ ade on a fa@@ z@@ d building , with a letter to the &quot; Justice &apos; , and two 30 reports , A@@ ar@@ , I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , will bear in T @-@ shir@@ ts , which have seen his wife @-@ he@@ lli@@ ant face or their characteristic contribution .
the meeting will take place in less than two months after his death .
while in 2010 , it was set up in a separate state Prosecutor &apos;s Office to address cases of journalists , the protection of journalists , which is only two cases of the Court of Justice .
as in the case of the murder of most of every year , the number of drug trafficking and organised crime , which amounts to thousands , the killing of journalists is rarely brought to justice .
the edit@@ orial in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce is continuing to reflect violence on the beau@@ ty of the world , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without murder , there is no security for the meetings of the I@@ bar@@ ra , according to the data and justice .
&quot; it is very long to waste your time here at the meeting , &apos; he says .
&quot; until now , as long as it is not known , mistrust is known . &quot;
Mr Cu@@ li@@ ce in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s office in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state of Val@@ dez .
he has managed to travel only a couple of quarters before the two men made red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ roles , who were forced by cars and was shot at 12 times , which is expected to be the name of the newspaper , which means the twel@@ f@@ th river . &quot;
W@@ de@@ z thre@@ w the car of Val@@ de@@ z , who took the car to go and did in the vic@@ inity of an accident .
in Val@@ dez , 50 years old .
it remained behind the woman and two adults .
the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ us will freely spread in the Cu@@ li@@ er .
however , there is essentially only silence on the subject of the Val@@ de@@ z .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the United States in January , you have been one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields , because ri@@ val@@ ry by ri@@ val@@ ry in power in a vacuum of power has been one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ ts .
there is no distinction between you in the streets of a person in the streets of a person or even a number of them , or even a number of people who s@@ pan@@ s to death in the gu@@ ise of the tw@@ o@@ gy of drugs , which are more than a lot of the homes of many living with many living .
we forget , for a moment , that the peace time refers to the European State of drug routes when values of value @-@ friendly ports and the United States are leading only one of the car@@ tel .
in spite of everything that and the fact that the Val@@ dez @-@ dez @-@ of @-@ of @-@ his job , the dangers of their work , have been aware of the dangers of his work , feels the co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and the President , Mr President , in Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , that he was unable to defend its war .
he believes that there were two error in favour of slaughter .
the first was Gu@@ z@@ man son &apos;s po@@ ga@@ s of competing and war @-@ in @-@ war car@@ tel . D@@ amas@@ h inter@@ views on inter@@ views in February .
this piece of correspon@@ dence could perhaps be dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble members of the people who bought all the talent by the bu@@ ck , if they have reached the time of time @-@ injec@@ tions .
the second mistake was that the Val@@ de@@ z was not forced to leave a country on behalf of his own security following the fact that there was a ha@@ ir in one another of the same story .
Val@@ dez , in Mexico , as well as abroad , and his slaughter is seen as a turning point for violence in Mexico .
it was so long to be alive , so that his friends and colleagues were expected to have a permanent one .
he worked at the heart of the newspaper in 2003 , in the No@@ ro@@ vel@@ ler , when he joined the five Member States to create a Ri@@ o@@ ce , sale of 50 dollars .
Mr Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said that it was impossible to address the issue of the press without preventing the problem of the drug . &quot;
the total amount of time has been a time for his courageous and fair reflection and sale and advertising .
in writing . - ( DE ) I enjoyed strong research on Portuguese , without censorship and read@@ ers without censorship , and read@@ ers who were able to read the stories that anyone else did not dare to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ ce , the newspaper won the award of its Latin American reports for the prestige of Maria Mo@@ ors , Maria Mo@@ ors .
in the same year , the Val@@ dez journalists are won by the Committee on International Freedom of Freedom of the International Prize for the press for their courage to follow Mexico &apos;s drug creation .
he recognised the fact that it was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &apos; he said &apos; he &apos; had the winner of the Act .
last October , he said TV channel Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to the television channel , so that drug trafficking is a blue @-@ life way of life .
&quot; the head of the head of the task , which is accompanied by a journalist office , will be accompanied by another option .
I do not want me to ask me that what I did in the face of so many deaths , and why I did not say what is happening . &apos;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ ctives for the Val@@ de@@ z , a jo@@ ke man , who was a s@@ r@@ ty like , a jo@@ ke , a friend who divided embry@@ os and advice , teachers who know how to survive .
they are their stu@@ pid in the first place .
he always made his bar@@ rel@@ s .
she went on the basis of the El Dor@@ y@@ ab@@ r ba@@ r , and the father has always gone on the same table .
now they ask whether he had his stu@@ pid love to send him .
the death of him has also put themselves into doubt about how best to do its work and stay in life .
&quot; they do not like those women , their children , their children , their illegal land , their secret landing pos@@ ters , which are used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been treated , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result , even in the best times , is a strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ censorship .
confidence in its in@@ st@@ inc@@ s .
if it comes to suspi@@ cious , ho@@ ia .
Ms And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ rez said , according to Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce edit@@ or @-@ her , the problem is that &apos; fra@@ gran@@ ces can be dece@@ ived ... and this is the case in J@@ ternity .
his and other say that you do not apply any more old rules , just as they do not apply in Thailand , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z@@ is , Guer@@ re@@ ros or other states which have a cost @-@ profitable route to smugg@@ lers , weak institutions and corrupt public officials .
the environment is constantly changing .
in a room where workers in Ri@@ o@@ h@@ ce workers collapsed , suddenly they were not allowed to mobile phones ; some days before it was revealed that only at a crossroads of the governments of the governments had been used in Mexico for journalists and activists .
there are two police officers in front of the House two poli@@ ce@@ men to mitigate the heat of 40 ta@@ ils .
they set out a more painful government in Ri@@ o@@ ce &apos;s office , which is located in the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ ani building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ ani .
some repor@@ ters were wondering whether these police officers are among their 50 % of their police officers whose can@@ e has been un@@ reliable .
several months have passed since the repor@@ ter has travelled to the memory of the countryside where controls are de facto drug gan@@ gs .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in this week dealt with three main words .
one of them was the Ju@@ li@@ o@@ as of the K@@ al@@ o@@ as of the former son , the Y@@ al@@ o@@ a of the former son , Mr Cha@@ vez .
in addition , they were reve@@ aling the spending of the government of the government of the home to the poultry .
a quarter of the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ ani &apos;s c@@ abin@@ ets from the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ ani to the most expensive restaur@@ ant groups were kidna@@ pped by Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ ani .
there was no official announcement of those who were kidna@@ pped or how this happened , so it had to be a cautious time when it was the time to write what everyone knows in the city of the restaur@@ ant , both drug traffickers and the authorities of the authorities .
por@@ ter became public documents to know that the restaur@@ ant is registered as a politician who belongs in power to an institution of an Institu@@ tional Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Rev@@ olu@@ tionary League ( IR@@ P ) , which was dominated by all levels of politics in the whole of the last century .
at the last time , several IR@@ P has been accused of widespread reporting on corruption in the context of cases .
in Vil@@ lar@@ a , asked repor@@ ters have asked to write to previous incidents in place , including how the po@@ g of the Gu@@ z@@ man po@@ g of the Gu@@ z@@ man po@@ g , the Gu@@ z@@ man po@@ va , is rescu@@ ed from the military record .
in just a few months before the read@@ ers would be the reading of Val@@ de@@ z to obtain information on the best sources of human rob@@ s .
&apos;@@ earlier we would have known what happened , the 46 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old Vil@@ lar@@ k , who has made the construction of a body , he has earned him a slogan of the name of Mr El Fla@@ me .
&quot; it is now all the channels of communication that have occurred with our sources . &quot;
the Bureau has received savings on the bridges and stic@@ kers which protest against the killing of journalists , and there has become something they could never expect to wait for activists to press on behalf of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mit@@ rez , a couple of eyes and guidance next morning to the public Prosecutor &apos;s c@@ abinet to a demonstration of another journalist .
Mr President , we will be doing the two days after the C@@ abinet &apos;s State in the western half of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an .
it has been found in contempt for the death and officials of the DNA on the basis of the DNA tests .
journalists have become more than the voice of the country , as well as an organised protest in the roads and the phrase &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; .
on this day , Mr Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , in Washington , trying to collect an international support for justice in Val@@ de@@ z .
the day after the death of the White Court of Justice , Mr Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s death , was accused by a Ra@@ mi@@ rez authorities for journalists to speak out and killing the truth because of the truth .
after this , he asked that it should be channelled from the government of the government , with concern that it has affected hatred in the form of objec@@ tivity .
in Val@@ dez , there had been several times that the journalists in Mexico have been organised by organised crime , their de@@ cul@@ pri@@ ts and the in@@ difference of civil servants in the form of an organised crime . &quot;
in its last paper , the &apos; drug media &apos; wrote that re@@ repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gan@@ gs , but also by politicians and security forces , who have been organised crime in the case of organised crime .
the Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 attach more than half of the attacks on media surveillance by the media , Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 to the police and civil servants .
&quot; in Mexico , it is because you want to keep quiet , &apos; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
it is obvious that the ver@@ ges of a bloody impact is obvious .
nobody will forget the death of blo@@ gg@@ ers and Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as to the death of a blo@@ gg@@ ler in the country in Thailand , six years ago .
he was found to death with a letter , which was probably written to the car@@ tel in L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am in my repor@@ ter &apos; .
in addition , alongside him , the head of the computer s@@ log@@ ans have been le@@ ep by computer glass and de@@ va@@ ge .
some publications have decided to close their doors , for example in the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the country in the country of Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ v , after their correspon@@ dence in the case of Mon@@ sla@@ va B@@ as@@ h by Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ r in March .
other words , such as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de N@@ o@@ do , the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do after the murder of their President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad calls for a ban@@ ner in Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z to the car@@ tel . &quot; What you want to have ? &apos; .
some journalists have fled from the state of affairs or even the country .
it is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
it is difficult to find a job in exile , and they still need to be than@@ ked in order to avoid the dangers .
and sometimes it is behind them , as was probably the case with photo@@ graph@@ i Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered , together with the four people in 2015 , three months after the Ver@@ ac@@ h@@ z@@ ist pa@@ ge@@ g .
those who remain in place and will continue to work , every day in every day , to re@@ tri@@ tan@@ ate decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra who wanted a po@@ cket who wanted a po@@ cket , recognises that the issue of drug trafficking is intimi@@ dated .
&quot; Mexico is on the road to hell and because I am repor@@ ter , &apos; said he .
at one of the recent mid@@ night , when the latest figure has already been in front of the last number , the edit@@ or of the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the edit@@ or of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the edit@@ or to ju@@ mp when suddenly started to over@@ ride all the phone .
according to the re@@ exchange of ri@@ val@@ ry in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ is , there was 19 people who have died in the pipeline between ri@@ val@@ ry in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ is and the security forces of the security forces .
the war continues to continue , as has been promised by several of the messages left in the region .
in the same way , repor@@ t@@ ters in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s website in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s website was launched by the S@@ as@@ ter mobile phone .
in the next day , we needed changes to the next day .
the deployment of a hu@@ m@@ ga@@ tic in the region has been passed by another region .
the police officers in Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez stick to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not see it at least .
the collapse of the head of the bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ y , under the mass scale , with its average fin@@ gers , has been seen as a whole Y@@ al@@ o@@ h , edit@@ orial staff in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers in his foot@@ steps .
&quot; how can you look at the closure of the Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; whereas at the same day when Javier massac@@ red , it asked for the practice that I would report to this report ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur used anti @-@ defence col@@ ours to avoid enemies
at first sight , it seems like the form , although rather intimidation .
scientists have now unve@@ iled the first findings in relation to the un@@ beli@@ evable evi@@ ction of the Canadian mine , which is so well done so that experts have described this as the &apos; din@@ osa@@ y of the Mon@@ a &apos; .
it has been so well done so that it was even possible to identify that it was covered by a number of sk@@ y@@ gen and his past had been somewhat &apos; complex &apos; .
the report published in Bi@@ ology , published in Bi@@ ology , described as &quot; The best preserved Spanish tre@@ asures which have ever been found &apos; and if &apos; one best of the best at the world &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new type of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ble excess , which lived by the middle of 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
it is incredibly good for this un@@ beli@@ evable announcement of the &apos; truly significant &apos; . &quot;
it is covered by plant @-@ feeding crops , according to the National Ge@@ o@@ ise@@ lis National , the best preserved of this type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus which has ever been found .
on 21 March 2011 , the &quot; For@@ ty @-@ ray of &quot; For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray of the mining Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mines close to northern Alber@@ ta of Canada .
it has been hit by something that has not been remembered , and decided to examine more closely .
the ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus identified in Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ ar@@ l were sent to Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ ar@@ l .
the next six years were designed to be an animal @-@ friendly one of the 2 500 na@@ ges ( 11.@@ 100 kilometres ) .
after all this hard work , the final result is now to be prepared to bring about the public .
&quot; if there is a little bit to quote , almost believe that he s@@ le@@ ep , &apos; the author of Cal@@ e@@ b Brown has been saying &apos; a leading author &apos; said Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ ar@@ l , in the muse@@ um , where the demand is being made .
&quot; this will go down in the history of one of the most beautiful and most of the most beautiful , and most of the main ones , the Mon@@ a Mon@@ a , in addition to Mon@@ a , in addition . &quot;

this enabled the experts &apos; say to be better surroun@@ dings , and to avoid enemies of the enemy , as the major sur@@ ren@@ ders were likely to be hun@@ t .
this 110 million the family of the old no@@ do@@ sa@@ ture of the age of the age of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ils reached the first time for news in May and is now a visit to Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ er@@ li , which is now visiting Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ er .
the figures have now been investigated and awarded the name of Boeing in Bo@@ real@@ m , the mark of the Mar@@ mit@@ l@@ und laboratory , according to the Mitchell mark , which was spent by a team that spent up to create more than 7@@ 000 hours .
as Dr Mitchell and the team of scientists have been able to record the form and size of the team of Re@@ search@@ ers and the International Re@@ search@@ ers &apos; team .
they discovered the responsibility of the defen@@ dant - a standard defence method which means that the title of tolerance was a half @-@ lower one .
although there is widespread responsibility , there will be a surprise , because it is a surprise because Boeing is much greater than those who live in the face of their lives today .

however , the majority of animals who are in charge of modern responsibility - such as the fear , mix@@ ture or archa@@ es - is a lot smaller and more vulnerable , which refers to the fact that no@@ do@@ sa@@ ver pressure had to be seen to be really working hard to survive .

how does the Act found a response to the question of which today ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ i@@ ll became full shock .
just a day after the travel of New York in New York , this St@@ . one of the day @-@ by @-@ Lou@@ ven @-@ resident Airbus will be made through a return on Facebook .
he has entered its own language after school@@ ing .
there was a letter : &apos; the police killed just 18 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ents and who are now b@@ ars to date . &quot;
he was in the turmoil , why no one has been informed of this information , which is why he was closed on Facebook and opened Twitter .
in the meantime @ The@@ e@@ P@@ suc@@ ah user postal applications were repeatedly shared by his magaz@@ ine .
Mr Lou@@ kas &apos;s region transmitted in real time to the death of Michael Brown , a weapon of un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old young men , who killed the White police officer in the Fer@@ gus@@ on Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i .
he gave a picture of the life of the Bro@@ w@@ l , which was born in the age of four hours .
&quot; this is a cra@@ zy , &apos; won@@ dered by Mrs Ferreira .
the death of his or her community was not a new one .
he fi@@ led his phone , but it was subsequently re@@ fin@@ ite , which said this time , this time for people &apos;s assembly of the people of the Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve D@@ ri@@ ve .
there were photo@@ graph@@ s of the police in the police , and the fear of people , and a man who claimed himself to have the father of Bro@@ w@@ l , the &apos; Fer@@ gus@@ on &apos; police to kill the police of the Fer@@ gus@@ on . &quot;
it examined in real time a stream , where the police officer stood for the gra@@ ves of protests by the police officer .
the second video @-@ inspired by the other police officer , according to his statement , has said , and sh@@ ining : &apos; I will kill you all ... &apos; .
on the Fer@@ rel@@ le , how he has hit itself from thinking : &apos; it is unusual . &quot;
&quot; it is not a murder of this kind , which we are used to and what we could mention typical . &quot;
I felt that at this moment , I felt very sca@@ th@@ ed .
I was in the rain . &quot;
he boo@@ ked the flight and travelled at the next day .
at 23 o &apos;@@ clock , he went to the father of his six @-@ year da@@ u@@ ghter , and decided that they travel the next morning with Fer@@ gus@@ on Fer@@ gus@@ on .
what the Fer@@ rel@@ le and Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ iga will have done in the next three years , the central issue in the new docu@@ mentary &apos; W@@ ho@@ s street &apos; ? &apos; ( whose street is today ? &quot; ) , which will take place in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and prote@@ sters , a love and defeat , a love and defeat , strength and resilience , from the perspective of those who live in this community and who have met the answer by calling for the streets .
if , together with the ty@@ rann@@ y , who had a dis@@ til@@ ling stic@@ ker , and a s@@ po@@ t , the Fer@@ gus@@ on side , who has moved on the floor , who spoke again on the subject , which had been the case before this morning - from the m@@ ood of people who have repeatedly come from the past - and the living conditions .
&quot; can you remember how I taught me how the black community had to fight for their rights ? &apos; recalls itself to question &apos; .
&quot; we are talking about the Fer@@ gus@@ on , because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and it is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him , &apos; he said he said later .
&quot; what happens now is the cul@@ mination of what has happened in the past .
it must be aware and see it , and it will grow in the middle .
it must learn to learn about activists and organise and feel different from the different sections of the experience and living conditions , and what we need to do so that we have to be free and free .
even if I manage to increase him so that he does not have a cru@@ el@@ ty of racism , it does not differ from some of the other mus@@ ici@@ ans of the other .
I feel that I would like to make it a dis@@ service if I defend him for this world . &quot;
the first suspension of which they did , in the south of the Fer@@ gus@@ on , was on the path of South F@@ l@@ op@@ ia , in the place of the police community , which was in place in place , which was a certain kind of camp where activists waiting news for the police officer , Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who did not put an accus@@ ation at last .
Mrs Ferreira and his da@@ u@@ ghter joined the forces of local business owners who prepared the south .
they put together food bags and helped to share these protests .
for the Fer@@ rel@@ le , we slowly started to take shape of a new type of activist .
&quot; my activist change completely after 9 August , &apos; said it notes that , if he was an Mis@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . he was a student student , he was President of the Union of Vä@@ he@@ ans , the President of the Union , and focused on the security of food justice and health @-@ related communities .
&quot; I did not have any experience of organising .
that is all just a way . &quot;
the week later in the week , Ferreira is a co @-@ spon@@ tri@@ gue Sab@@ hail Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ every .
the Fo@@ lay@@ an , his and film operator , Mr Al@@ st@@ ad@@ o , wanted to be able to file a document .
the Fer@@ rel@@ li question arose : &apos; is you trying to document what is happening or to find a story that can be used ? &apos;
such scepticism was an un@@ accep@@ tably a number of cases where people - often dis@@ mis@@ sal - come to a community and try to benefit from the benefits and resilience of it .
the Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard the Fer@@ gus@@ on and the people of the Fer@@ gus@@ on who have not been heard and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an D@@ am@@ is has already been a blow to the D@@ am@@ at D@@ am@@ is , the region &apos;s artificial example , who was well known in terms of death row in activists .
his involvement made the project attractive in the Fer@@ rel@@ le and the two other local communities , who are the film &apos; W@@ ho@@ y street &apos; , a &apos; team &apos; following the shoo@@ t of Bro@@ w@@ ts for years .
&quot; this docu@@ mentary does not speak for us , and we ourselves , the &apos; Da@@ vis &apos; said we , but we are talking about us .
&quot; for me , it was important for us to represent these people , as it is also portra@@ yed by me . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the Fer@@ rel@@ le experience - the intention was to show that the movement is not about the &apos; point of departure , but in the coming out of the community &apos; , as said Fo@@ lay@@ an , it was the most open to a film .
as a result , the &apos; W@@ ho@@ t street &apos; is documented , &apos; W@@ ho@@ s street &apos; , as a result of the family of the Fer@@ rel@@ le , as the ch@@ arity and his wife .
&quot; I felt , as I would be myself , &apos; said , by Mrs Ferreira , Mr Ferreira , when he was prepared to see the city .
&quot; however , I realised that the work of this work and the human exploitation of human beings must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the Fer@@ rel@@ le story underlines and re@@ priorit@@ ises the role of L@@ GB@@ T women in the wider Black Li@@ mist Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three winners of the movement of the movement of the social media , who thought , following the murder of the social media in 2012 , was # Bla@@ ck@@ Liese Mat@@ ter Mat@@ ter , is homosexuality .
&quot; women in the vangu@@ ard &apos; role in the lead role are the movement of women in general over the overall area , &apos; said Ferreira , &apos; said , &apos; and it is precisely because we need to fight on several fronts .
the women of the Mus@@ tanks have to bear the burden on the whole of all . &quot;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed , noting that &apos; movement of movement is indeed women in life , and many of them are black homosexu@@ als . &quot;
he claims that &apos; this is not any kind of equal opportunity &apos; - Fer@@ rel@@ l was not elected to be the focus of his identity as a result of his identity .
&quot; he was a man , of whom the right energy , he said .
&quot; however , it is not a coincidence that he directly consis@@ ted in the foot@@ wear , because the mus@@ ici@@ ans of L@@ GB@@ T women in such an end , as a result of a lot at stake .
his energy is possible through the scre@@ ens . &quot;
at the same time , the news camer@@ as of the Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ ist , long ago , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
as a result of the demonstrations in the Fer@@ rel@@ le , a sentence for blocking the road to blocking the road is still a result of 2.5 years .
he describes the social policy in the region , which he calls on home , simply &apos; the vast threat &apos; .
nevertheless , it still needs to be an important man@@ tra that has destroyed the memory of the coal since the three years ago in the Fer@@ gus@@ on street .
&quot; our commitment is to fight for our freedom .
our duty is to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we do not have anything apart from our chain . &quot;
7 % , how &quot; We@@ ek@@ y We@@ ek@@ y du boys &quot;
some of the g@@ le@@ vers of me@@ po@@ sers will find that , after a scarce number , that the misery , this also of aid .
or on the basis of a phrase &apos; sa@@ y@@ y &apos; is &apos; mel@@ t@@ down &apos; .
however , it is only inevitable to postpone and to health to health .
what will you do to do so that after today and tomorrow &apos;s We@@ ek@@ own trend - or other parts - or other parts , this morning , it can be better felt and to overcome the pain of the boys ?
Jo@@ o water .
in addition , when there is a great deal in the morning ... or as soon as possible , or even alcohol .
since the use of alcohol consumption in a lot of liquids , it will have to be rejected in any way .
together with water , miner@@ als and miner@@ als are also a good thing , with miner@@ als and a se@@ as@@ p is a good mineral water .
since it is often irri@@ tated in the post @-@ fire , it is particularly good if it comes to soil free or just a ligh@@ ter .
the way to take place .
it would certainly not be paid to the age of boys , which would be a pu@@ zz@@ le - that may prove to be a fatal wrong decision .
however , it is easy to remember , however , that the feeling is alive once again .
it is a time @-@ consuming way of s@@ lee@@ ping and s@@ lee@@ ping to s@@ lee@@ ping to s@@ lee@@ ping .
giving poor energy slowly and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are already running from yesterday , we will certainly not be able to try to charge a lot of difficulty .
for example , it is fresh , with a fresh volume of nur@@ ser@@ y , which contains a lack of silence in the health of the markets .
when the world is already suffering around the South , it could be tried , for example , to the w@@ on@@ ess .
and a little later .
to avoid coff@@ ee .
it will release the inf@@ igh@@ ting of this de@@ priva@@ tion from the poor .
as has already been said : water and volume are friends .
contribute to pain @-@ si@@ si@@ ts .
if you were to prevent pain @-@ si@@ len@@ ced in this evening , you need to address , in addition to alcohol , in addition to alcohol par@@ at@@ ta@@ mos or i@@ f@@ pro@@ fe@@ at and will lose the way out .
both ri@@ vals , and will continue to be in a way , and will continue to have a bo@@ gus worse .
in addition , there is no room for silence anyway , even though there is a long time .
if you were pain@@ ting this morning , then the way to do so - this anno@@ ying our already di@@ r@@ ty ha@@ ven .
or if a partner is not to take , it can be done well .
around the same way , as evi@@ den@@ ced , but it cannot be followed by a foot@@ wear .
however , there should be a physical effort to prevent and paid out too active at the time , during a po@@ h@@ ler , during the po@@ h@@ ler .
jo@@ ke .
the people of the friends of the friends of the friends of the friends , the way for simple tons and a na@@ il @-@ class friendly way in both themselves and other ( suffering ) .
N@@ ali and laugh@@ er may not be done by a po@@ t , but it is certainly up to them to tolerate the same phenomenon .
once again , the shop will go on .
the staff of the professor of the profes@@ sors and Ox@@ ford University are looking for a murder of a suspect
according to the police , the authorities are looking at the same level of profes@@ sors in the University of North@@ wood and Ox@@ ford and Ox@@ ford , which have become a suspect of the people of the University of K@@ z@@ ic@@ ago , which have become a suspect for the death of a male people from a Ch@@ ic@@ ago luxury .
according to the C@@ oo@@ k Country documents , on Monday , on Monday , on Monday , there were 42 @-@ year @-@ old arrest warrants for arrest warrants for the arrest of 42 @-@ year W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i and 56 @-@ year @-@ olds Andrew War@@ ren@@ ton H.

according to documents , 26 @-@ year Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ tag@@ u died after repeated action .
the warning , according to which the Ch@@ ic@@ ago police commission issued the community , was discovered to death on 27 July .
the police in the police were telephone phones and found the Grand Pla@@ za kor@@ ter@@ house for the victims whose body was a number of stor@@ ms .
according to officials , Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ ta@@ u was admitted to death and investi@@ g@@ ators in Cor@@ nel@@ l , while the police are actively looking to two suspects .

Vice @-@ President of the University of K@@ .@@ T@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , the University of C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , said , in a statement sent by the University , that La@@ il has now been removed from the work temporarily and has been banned from the University of North@@ w@@ ester .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter in the investigation carried out by the competent authorities , and the University of North@@ w@@ ester will work with researchers , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
Mr W@@ arre@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant in the University of Ox@@ ford .
the representative of the university and Som@@ mer College said in the statement made by the University of e @-@ publishing : &apos; we have been in the Community with the British police and ready to help the US research authorities in any way possible . &quot;
in addition , in the statement , there was a statement that War@@ ren@@ i colleagues are shocked and willing to propose itself .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , President An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , the President of the S@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , urges themselves to give themselves to the authorities .
the police have an idea where they are staying , but we are working more intensively with the definition of a precise location , &apos; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to the G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , the suspects of the local , regional and national authorities will help to seek suspects .
the G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police had received a phone from the Grand Pla@@ za of the Grand Pla@@ za Can@@ ter@@ house , who had just had a ra@@ ft of ra@@ pid@@ ic rain , that there has been something that has happened .
according to the police description , it was a mira@@ cle one .
it is not clear whether the event took place on 27 July .
he said that the security camer@@ as will confirm La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ il and the victim was a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the Grand Pla@@ za leadership sent a letter to the people : &quot; the police are currently working at the time of events and the background of the victim , and the various mo@@ tives , including the possibility of a family dispute . &quot;
I@@ du@@ firms , which will help to prevent your business in the next U@@ p@@ would .
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure its own e @-@ commerce start @-@ up to workers &apos; satisfaction , but polls were made .
the answers were often vague , useless or , even worse , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some employees did not trust this process .
&quot; this system simply was not consistent and objective , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who will lead 75 employees to the e @-@ commerce company in the Netherlands to sell the e @-@ commerce company in the Netherlands .
it therefore called for non @-@ persons .
there is a new type of human resources that will help businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software aimed at measuring the involvement of workers , they will allow companies to make a dedicated team and the demographic groups , to provide the workers &apos; anon@@ y@@ mity and the hot line of complaints , and in some cases , in some cases , to go beyond C @-@ level leaders and to return directly to the Bureau .
&quot; there is now a tool such as the Stra@@ it and F@@ it@@ bi , which is designed to monitor health , but where the F@@ it@@ bi of your company has asked Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O of Reding , G@@ lin@@ t , the foun@@ der and CE@@ O of Vice @-@ President Reding in G@@ lin@@ t , whose wisdom is used by companies to measure the involvement of workers .
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , he has received three years when he has used the G@@ lin@@ s , a much better overview of what he has to think and feel .
in addition , the poll and a fir@@ mer team for teams will offer a company &apos;s heat card , which provides an overview of what components are most of the complaints and which drivers have the lowest support , allowing it to identify the reasons .
companies have started to understand that they have to live up to their culture of work , so that not to become the next U@@ b@@ would , which has been insur@@ moun@@ ted scandals , since the former employee published a blo@@ gg@@ er , which was described by the attack on the environment in which it was punished by those who have been da@@ red to speak .
for example , for example , for example , the G@@ lin@@ er is a desire for their own choice of business .

the convergence rate of Den@@ ver@@ is between Mr Col@@ or@@ ad@@ os , which will help businesses to prevent and detect unwanted behaviour in the light of the U@@ b@@ erian people in the context of the U@@ b@@ ber reputation , in this year .
the convergence is almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber registration has been registered by the Commission recently .
as the G@@ lin@@ er , the convergence percentage companies will allow an adapted impul@@ ses to be made , to collect a real @-@ time confidential response and review of heat from the problems of heat .
it also offers anon@@ ymous messages that will allow workers to be un@@ suitable for the behaviour of workers to know .
and if it is concerned , complaints will go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion is encouraged by the regulatory authorities , &apos; the establishment of a cen@@ se@@ ant and CE@@ O Patrick Qu@@ in@@ n .
Mr Qu@@ in@@ lan said that , if a company is found to treat its workers badly or eth@@ ically , a company can face serious consequences , such as the boycott of the consumer , the departure of workers and the courts , even if regulators do not interfere .
Mr Ru@@ by , a restaur@@ ant , which has more than 25 000 employees , has used the convergence of convergence as a year in order to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and to offer easy ways to communicate with the company &apos;s headquarters .
if the worker wanted to report the problem earlier , he had to find a company &apos;s telephone number or interview addressed , submit a formal appeal and hope that it will be taken seriously .
this often was discoura@@ ging and in@@ convenience , the Ru@@ de a general advis@@ er , Mr Vit@@ ili@@ o , who said it was not a good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , at a time when a company is using the convergence cen@@ gram , it is possible to have problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices which did not have reached leadership in other cities or states in offices in other cities , more quickly to identify and address them .
&quot; I will be able to get closer to the people of the people of the free 3@@ 60 degree of 3@@ 60 degrees , &apos; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who is headed by Mr Ru@@ by .
&quot; and we defend our shareholders for the courts . &quot;
Mr Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies started with ethics , the values and the involvement of employees more seriously in 2002 , in other words , after the audit@@ or of the Bank of Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen failed , as a result of the scandals of the En@@ r@@ oni scandal .
however , only if the &apos; social media were mature &apos; , companies , the companies , that they are not able to prevent their was@@ teful was@@ teful use in public online .
&quot; in order to monitor the use of the technology , people used a strategy as a strategy to monitor the use of the technology .
both G@@ lin@@ t , as well as convergence , will provide their software as a service , given the companies &apos; perio@@ dic fees for using their products .
this is a model of business and the opportunity that has a venture capital investors who have been based on the approval of both start @-@ ups .
the convergence programme was funded in February 10 of USD 10 million , such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and the Capital of Customs Capital , by increasing USD 47 million .
in November , USD 10 million of the B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , by increasing the total funding of a company from 60 million dollars .
such investments will not come as a surprise when taking into account the link between companies , culture and venture capital .
more research shows that modern workers are waiting for more than before .
in the competition markets , as S@@ ili@@ c@@ is Val@@ ley , it is high salaries and interest projects are merely on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and values and that they will devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to know that they are being heard and that the work they are doing , they are more committed , they are more committed to ensuring the success of a company , &apos; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , who is the general benefit of the general benefit and the group of the G@@ lin@@ t , Mr Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , who is using this convergence as a cen@@ cen@@ ti as the G@@ lin@@ er .
investors earn revenue if companies belonging to their portfolio will go well ; businesses are doing well , if the workers are committed and involved .
if the third party analy@@ sts the tools allow to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , then we do not believe that these support .
there is an important issue for the involvement of the data on the involvement of workers in the field of worker .
however , these data are useless if you are not going to follow up with the company .
in fact , if the company is asking for feedback from their staff , the expectations we expect to face .
and if there is not enough change , or not , it may cause disappointment and to reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask 4 000 proposals , you have to be prepared for 4 000 inter@@ views , &quot; said in consultation and business management in K@@ ot@@ ter International President R@@ us@@ ro@@ re International President R@@ us@@ ro@@ ws , who have seen how companies are making a mistake to rely on too many data collection .
&apos; because if things do not go to the end , the workers think : &apos; does you really hear me heard ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why I should care ? &apos;
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Netherlands , which is now organising six studies , has been possible to implement measures at the same day when the problem has been reported by G@@ lin@@ s .
as well as the quality of the decision @-@ making and communication of decision makers , it was possible to re@@ organise several teams from the company in the enterprise and to provide problems to tackle communication training .
however , the presence of the Ru@@ de a new data on workers is collected , and it is hoped that in the long term , it will lead to the longer @-@ term commitment of workers in the industry , which is well known in terms of their large labour flows .
&quot; if you do not have a commitment to ensuring transparency , you will lose the people , &apos; Mr Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&quot; and if you lose the people , you will lose the customer .
and if you lose the customer , you will lose the hands of companies . &quot;
the sta@@ ggering mark of the euro area is the Baltic Sea : income increases rapidly
while the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic region , three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the Western Europe , wri@@ tes , in referring to the European Central Bank &apos;s report .
according to the ECB since 1999 , production of the economy has exceeded the expectations of the population in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
there is a low debt burden , a rapid improvement in the institutions and business and free @-@ market policy .
&quot; the Baltic States , in one of Slovakia , have a few of the countries in the euro area , where there has been a significant convergence of the EU &apos;s focus on the world , the Central Bank announced .
although the aim is that the economy is to be treated with an equal footing with the West Europe , in 2015 , in the Baltic economy , the total product of the Baltic economy was just 2 / 3 15 of the average of 15 / 3 countries , who were in the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle .
low wages have led to the bal@@ t@@ las to seek a better wage from abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light , and the economy is growing this year , local residents are not enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer , only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies will be very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it thought that it was slightly less than those questioned by the economies of their countries .

N@@ CA@@ A decision to abolish the burden of players in order to reduce the burden of players two days is , in fact , a long @-@ term delay - at least until the end of an end @-@ up to one half of Friday .
for the first time , the U@@ C@@ L@@ A was the first time to start at 19.@@ 15 , so that they fit for the already den@@ se of players .
the transition to a question of tre@@ pida@@ tion a day means more than one trend - the beginning of the Bru@@ in@@ mes raised the start of the last season , compared to the previous season , almost a half of the Mor@@ a &apos;@@ es@@ tw@@ sy season , and for the first time the Mor@@ a Mor@@ a &apos;@@ es@@ tw@@ sy season will take place during the first time .
they have until 20 August plan to 18 trends , before the official preparatory start will start in September to be adopted by T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M in September .
he says that he is in favour of the rules of change in N@@ CA@@ A , although it adds one item to the closer players in the schedu@@ les .
&quot; they have a huge burden on these three or four days , and it is a serious challenge , &apos; Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they break themselves through this challenge ; they are trying to get young people .
I believe that if you arrive on Saturday and we have more time , it is really a few . &apos;
if the camp is closed , U@@ C@@ L@@ A will be closed down , which is not an easy task , given the clear view of their publications and by the middle of the L@@ us@@ kin@@ i Centre , a higher @-@ class ho@@ tels , which have already been the ga@@ te@@ way to by@@ pass a football sa@@ g in the middle of a football .
since the weekend , the ho@@ tels played by the Bru@@ in@@ si playing field , but Mor@@ a admitted that problems can arise during the time of free tobacco .
&quot; we implement security measures , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real concern , and it has not been exagg@@ erated to think that people can rent and trained to fil@@ ry .
if a record has been recorded , it may be a good deal to do so .
but we use there and on 8 par@@ king lines for the security team .
we will do our utmost by using the best .
I will try not to worry about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
at the end of the VAT union , the Association of A@@ van@@ o@@ va @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , the US@@ SR , the mili@@ tia party , Mrs O@@ jul@@ and and the ECB , have to leave in the hands of the O@@ ur Tallinn and party , which will be forced to sign up to Mrs Kal@@ j@@ ts , the establishment of an O@@ ur , Tallinn , which has been created at the initiative of the European elections on the initiative , in Tallinn , in the course of the working parties in party politics , at least as much as parties in party politics .
however , it is considered to be considered in the autumn , and the key issue can be , whether it is not sufficiently disappointed to all of them .
who will remain with Sa@@ v@@ D ?
if a small drop has been reduced by Ed@@ gar Sa@@ wa@@ are , the support of his election can be seen in the event of his election .
one member of the whole of the country , some former and the current central party and a lot of unknown faces - whether this is the composition of the electoral union ?
and is the reason why , in Tallinn , in Tallinn , some Sa@@ v@@ are fai@@ th@@ ful to pro@@ ven@@ ting some of the Sa@@ o@@ are and a friend , can look at the list of manufacturers &apos; Sa@@ of@@ are , which is headed by corruption and the suspicion of corruption , is becoming a reality ?

we look forward to what is the vision of the political parties in the youth campaign .
if the second part of the channel 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 look at the case of August , there are two options : to accept that , in future , there will be only the ET@@ V , the ET@@ V + , ET@@ V + , Tallinn TV and English Fran@@ ce@@ 24 Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels or surrender every month to television operators .
it is probably also that those who openly welcome the free television experience at the beginning , but finally , even though the reluctance of the television and advertise@@ ments pay .
the concentration of music , the people and those who have been deprived of the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , who have left the people and who have been left to the streets , have a need for more mus@@ ici@@ ous practices .
however , if you do not want to become a part of the nature , it is worth going to go at home rather than being pain@@ ted at home instead - and to s@@ le@@ ep for the amount of the Cop@@ tic figure for the s@@ le@@ ep .
Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
media quo@@ tation quo@@ tes by President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , saying that the new US immigration plan , which makes the Green Card rules .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year to 50 000 people a year , more stringent rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have proposed the re@@ public@@ s and the President will support them .
the draft legislation goes to debate in the two chamber of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increases the salaries and save billions of taxpayers &apos; money , as it makes the way the US citizens issuing green maps for the citizens of other countries .
the law will reduce the chain and replace the current programme .
the new application process will give the candidates who speak English and who have the funds to support their own economy and skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ g with the media publications of the United States .

his first study in Si@@ beria is passed this year by 30 years .
during this time , it has been there for 14 times and lived there .
how much has been brought up by Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century in order to get land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8@@ 0,000 .
I have taken note of the rum@@ ours of the Si@@ b@@ erian op@@ to , who have also thought about it .
it is very difficult to say , because at that time , one group could have to come up to 30 people , but the passport was only received .
the passport was only given one , but they were children , sis@@ ters .
look at how much it was a territory here .
this was a number of times greater historical , S@@ et@@ om@@ y .
after all , it was necessary to be able to manage , in any way .
it has come here as a farmer , but the change of their lives , because there was a change in the regions that were not only involved in agriculture , but also in rivers , the gold mining , industry .
for example , in New York , many se@@ do@@ gs went to work in the town of K@@ ras@@ no@@ j@@ sk in K@@ ras@@ di@@ er @-@ 45 ( construction of the Soviet power plant - J. P@@ .@@ ) , when it was formed .
is there a majority of the population here in the region at the time ?
yes , they lived in a com@@ mu@@ ting way .
in addition , a long tradition of aid is maintained , and the great nature of a child .
seven @-@ eight children were common@@ place .
how much culture of Si@@ beria is different and that is different from that country ?
they are different , although what was brought here was never the same .
they led to a great deal of money .
they also made themselves ( shadow ideas ) , but they always make a distinction between what was made and what was done here .
climate change was strongly affected by the traditional ri@@ val@@ ry , because here is a cold one .
the return has been made .
for example , S@@ et@@ oma@@ al meat , but here , it was simply frozen .

the link with the mother to the mother was very strong , it was considered very important .

what is happening here is a brave one .
&quot; it is very easy to come to a call for , and also to go , because the city has an excellent location : the rail divide and road traffic at the crossroads of the roads , says T@@ ap@@ n from Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m , Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m .
the city is no longer just a long way for a military capital , we have a lot of creativity , sports and cultural areas , and the ball can be at every time .

the current white river on the ground is a small island of an island where the ordinary hun@@ t can be considered .

who is not afraid of the cold water , it can be floo@@ ded in the river , because the river is full of sources .
I have been flooding there , and I am going to do .
the river on water then can be considered and simply to do a ro@@ man@@ t - can be flow@@ ing through the river , and to think about the lives of the river .
I am also there in my own foot .
O@@ oper@@ is@@ ter , in Tampere , has been the most of the three vari@@ eties of the river , in addition to the three vari@@ eties of the river , and that it is a place at the city of the city , no one may come from any objection to the stories of the saying &apos; .
&quot; M@@ än@@ nia will open an eye on the T@@ D , but there is also a health of health , where there can be a drink , a summer , and now , for example , to play a gol@@ f path - the gol@@ f path has been done , the borro@@ w@@ ers can be borro@@ wed from sport . &apos; .
the old professional activities there are , of course , of course , of course , but I have not yet play there .
we must obviously call on Mr T@@ ap@@ t T@@ ap@@ da gu@@ es@@ ts , because he has experienced the presence of c@@ oo@@ ter games and , and he has , there is a chain .

by 1 May , on 1 May , the muse@@ um has already been in 1994 .
&quot; the house is a small , but a great deal is well and information is very much , and the fact that the Re@@ ig@@ o holds the history of T@@ D full of the city of T@@ ap@@ a of the city , which is a larger proportion of the focus on the rail and war .

rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Department of the Health of the world sent out a Code of Conduct on the environment of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and the draft law amending law on plant protection products .
the change of law is being abandoned both for the locations of genetically modified ( GM ) , for the cultivation of GM ( GM ) , in a separate basis for the use of plant health registers .
in addition , the GM crops will be changed to have the obligation to have a prior agreement with the radio ap@@ ic@@ ulture sector .
although at present , GM crops are not grown in Estonia , we need to see the existence of clear rules on the coexistence of GM and non @-@ crops .
this at least once again , as long as there is no decision @-@ free to declare Estonia &apos;s GMO @-@ free , the President of the Department of the Ministry of Economics , S@@ ig@@ mar .
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , into account both private and public sector costs and the administrative burden , added to mouth .
the draft law repe@@ als the provisions of GM crops for GM crops and the handling of the data management of GM crops , establishes the management of GM crops and the requirements for starting economic activity .
in terms of specific ap@@ ic@@ ulture , the cultivation of GM crops is being replaced by the EU &apos;s current obligation to inform bee@@ keepers in the process of increasing the cultivation of GM crops before the cultivation of bee@@ keepers to produce an appropriate agreement .
the draft law has been sent to the Ministry of coordination .
all interested parties have the opportunity to see this in the draft information system and , if they want , to submit their opinion on the world Department .
the proposed changes will , in particular , affect persons operating in the area of plant farming , bee@@ keepers and agriculture .
in the European Union , including Estonia , it is permitted to increase only one of the GM crops , Mr mon 8@@ 10 .
however , no Estonian farmer &apos;s interest is not expected to grow GM farmers .
the reason is that , in Estonia , it does not occur in a machine , the European system of media , on which mon 8@@ 10 resistance .
it is also the case for the southern regions and that , in May , it is not an appropriate basis for the southern regions and in May .
in order to obtain confidence in the world , the Ministry of the world has commissioned an investigation in the event of a possible GM @-@ GM organisms in Estonia and 2016 , the seeds of maize and bo@@ xes .
the results of the sam@@ ples have shown that seeds are not included in seeds and a study concluded that Estonia has grown in Estonia , maize and bo@@ xes , the seeds of maize and bo@@ xes .
the latter may , in turn , conclude that in Estonia , it know@@ ingly not culti@@ vated to genetically modified crops , as well as confirmed that there has been no accident .

the added thing was the fact that , if V@@ inc@@ est departure should be the case , it is necessary for a second edition of the restrictions on working hours .
the original air crew had been held at helicop@@ ter during the event , and the es@@ ca@@ ter champion of the security team near aircraft is close to the rest of this surface .
it was not possible to read the documents given to this document , if you were at the end of the e@@ lep@@ h@@ pa@@ il in the end .
the H@@ at@@ ch law prohibits the use of federal workers to use the government &apos;s assets for political purposes .

&quot; we asked whether this is a breach of the H@@ at@@ ch law , and we were told that there is no ri@@ ce , &apos; he wrote &apos; com@@ man@@ der &apos; .
&quot; it seems that you have no choice , &apos; with a leading sacrifice .
the White House declared the event &apos; in America &apos;s &apos; official event &apos; in America , and the H@@ at@@ ch Act was not covered .
but even official events are political zones .

the Es@@ ka@@ r &apos;s documents were pointed out in the course of the distance &apos;s basic base from the Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o airport from K@@ ini@@ a , on both sides of 30 minutes .
the White House states that the actual cost of using helicop@@ ters is a great deal of money .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; costs , on the basis of the estimated compensation rates , are very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimated compensation rates contain staff , maintenance and many other irreversible costs , which will be taken into account for each year &apos;s annual appropriations . &quot;
the 2015 departure from the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation rates for personnel costs , but they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former press representative of the White House Se@@ an S@@ lu@@ er was defended at the time in the event of helicop@@ ter use at the time .
&quot; the idea is to show things that this week in America , &apos; said S@@ pic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ ti State state is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are still hundreds of thousands of people whose work depends on this .
and I believe that exactly as the majority of the Americans , we are all proud of this helicop@@ ter and other military equipment on which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly .

the 2013 Moscow M@@ M@@ del received an open day after the opening day of Estonia , which had been a champion of injury in the wake of Estonia &apos;s time .
two years later he received the Beijing M@@ M@@ s 15 seat and played an Olympic ch@@ m , but it was a disappointment of spor@@ ts@@ people .
in the strongest terms , S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o , S@@ ade@@ ik@@ o has only been carried out , if not at the beginning the Amsterdam E@@ EM@@ IS had not received a letter .
I would just like to put together a proper multi@@ test competition .
once again , Mr Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
worse , there was still a month later : a month later on which his Olympic contest has already been a first barrier due to its Olympic Games .
the time had to be taken - is there to continue with the seven competition ?
is it worth all the two days in the effort ?
there was long time , but there was a peace .
I have been able to think about it .
this experience is relatively difficult to describe , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympic Games were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , it was time that itself can be treated as a whole , and it is worth thinking .
&quot; I am aware that I am not going to speak on the slogan , Mr Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o will talk about his self @-@ determination .
I received a clean s@@ mile , and to move forward with a new season .
you have said that , according to Mrs Anne hill , neg@@ ligence was very difficult to look at the suffering , but he understood that , above all , the ath@@ le@@ tes themselves must be able to make it clear .
he was in favour of all the b@@ read@@ ings of this .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&apos;@@ G@@ ood but he said that he does not give up and it wants to prove what it deserves to be .
there is now some kind of peace .
he is doing this in joy .
the right to conduct came back in May , when the C@@ ade@@ ik@@ o set a new Estonian re@@ vel@@ ation in the G@@ öt@@ z@@ jan multi @-@ competitive new Estonian record .
at a high level competition , she improved personal excellence in the heat of nearly me@@ tre ( 13.@@ 89 ) , and spent a record of an obstacle to a record of time .
then there was a multi @-@ competitive and , that it is not at all the ability of the capacity , but only the primary contest was removed .
for many years , I have pointed out that Mrs K@@ ade@@ o is a black student .
he is ready for ath@@ le@@ tes , it is good to go .
if nothing is done or is wrong , then he says it now .
he feels self @-@ owned and trust in its own .
that is what we must .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we follow it .
the new approach has also been established by Š@@ ade@@ c .
&quot; I do not have one who is going to make maximum use of the trend , he will speak and say that the most important thing is the right to be re@@ pris@@ ed , because it also ensures a good result .
Cor@@ d@@ ke@@ y@@ low babies will be re@@ jo@@ ice

&quot; quite interesting &apos; , it has been a word , Mr Š@@ ade@@ des .
one alcohol , which is the equivalent of &apos; nur@@ ser@@ y &apos; is equivalent . &quot;
Mr Li@@ vas@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon per@@ d Gordon me is so high in wine , so that it believes - on wine , can be better trained than any other in the world .
Y@@ ale is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist in Y@@ a &apos;@@ i .
his message is not a matter not about alcohol or how it is influenced by our feelings and ideas , but instead of &apos; very active &apos; , the cle@@ ans@@ ing of wine .
trus@@ ting it by the K@@ ase nu@@ k , in the complexity of wine , with the enjo@@ y@@ ment of it , and we perce@@ ive our a@@ iding work in order to create a taste in wine .
there is no fact , according to She@@ per@@ di , does not actually provide taste for a taste , but a taste of taste , how wine is stimu@@ lated .
he will lead to a reference to the way &apos; sees &apos; colour &apos; .
&apos;@@ Ma@@ in is not in wine , taste for wine , &quot; says She@@ per@@ d .
it is , for example , that of the meat that is being affected by wine is , for example , our van@@ us , let us , and even coal , which the person produces .
there is , of course , that wine is not , of course , that the wine is full .
&quot; there must be more &apos; activities &apos; , says he .
if you have too much , the system is over@@ crow@@ ded .
excessive drinking in wine can be done , rather than the time , that the 2004 study will risk people who drink over three sites to wine , the loss of the balance , and reduced mental capacities .

Mr Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m said that hundreds of women are nominated for the local Soviet elections , three women are nominated as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of the newly registered voters .
&quot; women &apos;s role in underlining the importance of the role of women cannot be exagg@@ erated , &apos; he said on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women are fully and involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the Afghan local elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections are taking place on 5 April .
the Taliban have been threatened by the Taliban , which coinci@@ des with a transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes a advis@@ er .
the election of this year will mark the first time when the power will be given calm over the one democratically elected government .
according to the fact , the strong role of women will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the Afghan independent electoral Commission , 3.@@ 6 million women have registered a sample of EUR 3.@@ 6 million .

in the Philippines a wide range of the world , i.e. a journey of mo@@ ef@@ s to the heart of the motto
in the light of these sites , there are also the summer clas@@ s@@ room , which has become in its own way in recent years , which has to be in the right way to the end of the day , which has , at the right time , has been at hand in the way , and which has managed to seize the price label in the shops in spite of its modest origin , regardless of its modest origin .
the red lines have apparently been one of the things that have been in place in a position of time , which has not been in place and that has not had a particular emo@@ tion .
it is simply there , and if there is no , there is nothing to see .
now , however , there is a real victory for a real victory , and the mo@@ tive bul@@ lets have been in their own house during the summer ballot box against the f@@ ring@@ es in the summer season .
however , this is not only at all of the coast@@ line , but today it is as popular as a jo@@ ble@@ ss street , and more courageous women are doing it even in the office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear whether such a summer , which is still being held in the summer , or it is worth noting and s@@ pan@@ s in a more official way .
there is a wealth of credit , but the real summer love of women has done .
for example , reading for foreign mo@@ il@@ es , for example , the first thing is that the motto will be in the first place , that the motto is the first thing to bring about the first thing to the local market and acquire themselves with a number of be@@ ds to which you have a long period of time , and which will be accompanied by the ground , and as a friend in the city , on the market and as a friend .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are even so generous that they buy homes from the market to a large junta and sell them with their loy@@ alty to their loyal reading .
it is worth pointing out that there is a demand for bic@@ k@@ bags among read@@ ers , so that women in the world are likely to include women ( and men in the world - probably to include one each other &apos;s fishing area , so that some homes were happy to receive their property .
in some ways , it is also understandable , because it is the case that they are repeated when it is possible to buy a lot of money from one of the few euros in the fashion yesterday .
it is true that the c@@ abinet shops have discovered a simple currency , and so as to sell away from the luxury of a br@@ ands of luxury bags and EUR 1 000 .
obviously , in order to do so , that the richer customers should not feel easy to know who are going to pro@@ men@@ t the low @-@ cost .
for example , it is possible to buy the D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ g to shoulder with the payment of a thousand euro .
however , the interpretation of the Chan@@ ty @-@ be@@ g@@ ko@@ w is the case with 6 000 .
however , unlike most of the motto , there will not be no co@@ ts to shoulder with some of the high mo@@ tives of Cape Verde , but it was the beginning of the day .
it is , in fact , come from the be@@ ans of the Philippines , which are very far removed from the Philippines , from which they have received a broad range of .

Ad@@ mittedly , the 14@@ th century of ma@@ ils come from a noble technology and is quite a series of normal fla@@ mes .
however , since it does not need to be in red tape , as well as a repetition , they can be found on the ground and other materials that are being made more personal and by a more personal nature .
in recent times , for example , it is particularly tr@@ end@@ ous on the col@@ ours of col@@ oured col@@ oured pa@@ ins or lea@@ ther col@@ oured .
however , the letter can be paid in particular to the ac@@ u@@ a@@ tar , J@@ ane Burma , the largest red be@@ f@@ ans had not been expected before .
it agreed to shoulder all possible mus@@ le@@ ries , and did not even have to go along with the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
however , with the popular popul@@ arity today , it does not play a lower role , but also that caring for them is that they are be@@ having and , unlike all other other items , there will be no need to care about special means , but also the water and the ty@@ rann@@ y .
as in the case of the trend , there has been a classi@@ cal interpretation of the br@@ ands , as is still a classic case , in addition to a classic case .
for example , there can be a red ro@@ ck@@ ery in the event , for example , in the event of a drop in a tiny gar@@ den .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classic be@@ er is not going to go on a mo@@ ck@@ ery , on be@@ age .
but what is the classic thing ?

G@@ M@@ B concerns investment in the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ w factory in G@@ las@@ go@@ w
the unions are waiting for a mature production and Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e from the leadership of the long @-@ term plans of the company G@@ las@@ go@@ w .
Mr G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , saying it is a company to remain silent on the future of the investment in the point of the customs .
there are more than 500 people produced in H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich , and other products , work more than 500 people .
the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e owner , Pla@@ in , said , that they have invested GBP 5 million over the last few years .
the workers and trade union chair@@ men who have been employed are the first to hear about a plant in the activities of the plant .
in the letter sent to the company &apos;s objects , G@@ M@@ B Scotland called Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e , the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e side , called Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s concerns as regards the lack of use of production routes . &quot;
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ o D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y Du@@ ff@@ y said : &apos; the fact that we cannot clarity from the head of the name from the case of the Customs needs and the future investment plan for the future investment plan puts our members deeply concerned .
several generations have been working here , and the workforce is made up of a large number of local community and G@@ las@@ go@@ w , as an essential pillar in order to ensure decent employment in the region where unemployment is high and there is a social reg@@ res@@ sion .
so , the G@@ las@@ go@@ w , the job of the East , needs to be in terms of jobs , pay and well @-@ being , and in the context of chronic damage to the production of production in the light of the chronic damage of the production of the Bre@@ x@@ was , and the chronic damage of production in the context of production . &quot;
the representative of the Pla@@ e representative said : &apos; the leader of the &apos; Customs &apos; project became a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ t only yesterday , and a company complies with him directly , as we appreciate an active relationship with the workers and the trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the representatives of workers and G@@ M@@ B representatives , which discussed open a number of problems .
we discussed the workers , as all the companies operating in the extremely competitive climate in the most extreme climate , look at their activities - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure that their competitiveness is in place .
he added : &apos; in recent years we have invested GBP 5 million in the customs plan , a majority of this has gone in the production lines and the improvement of operations .
we fully understand the customs agreement as a production of production sites and if there should be any changes , the workers and trade union representatives are the first to hear about this . &quot;
would the PS@@ G warned from Barcelona for three years ago on the approach ?
the sitting can regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the Paris Saint @-@ M@@ main does not give up in its quest to attract Som@@ d to their ranks by making GBP 18@@ 9 million to provide GBP 9 million , but were they warned from Barcelona for three years ago ?
this bub@@ ble approach has opened up to the transitional window , and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break up more than double buying from the current world record , which was set last season by Paul Po@@ g@@ ba for the return of Paul Po@@ g@@ ba for Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ ba .
if the transition is completed , Som@@ el@@ from can result in the world &apos;s most expensive player and , at the same time , the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ le@@ tes in the world who will get GBP 500 000 per week after taxes .
the Barcelona has said such a way of outra@@ ge , as a result of the liber@@ ation of Mrs Ney@@ mar@@ z &apos;s free fra@@ ction , even though Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ i is a source of football , so that the club is a club of football since its San@@ to@@ z arri@@ vals in 2013 .
however , does the PS@@ G President warned that three years ago , for such an opportunity ?
if in Manch@@ ester , a Bla@@ ise of Ma@@ tu@@ tis in 2014 has shown an interest in concluding an agreement , warned Mr N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f severely all clubs who think about the best players in the name of a couple of the PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that if they affect some of our players , then we are taking them against them and take contact with players , &apos; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they must face the consequences . &quot;
the Barcelona seems to have taken over from this limit , since Spain &apos;s club showed an interest in the position of the P@@ G of the G20 in the summer and the Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they do not allow them to leave and that the Barcelona can result in a set@@ back as a result of its interest , by abolishing one of its more expensive assets .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges and not borders .
&quot; Bre@@ x@@ it is seriously threatened between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Britain and Ireland , warned Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r in the first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who can benefit from this . &quot;
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made possible , and the free movement of goods , has been made possible by Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : to build bridges , not borders , it emphasised .
according to early car@@ i , he would prefer Britain to be part of the European Union , and because it is not the inability to stay part of the European common market .
this would be retained between the Irish Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
the second option to make Britain more se@@ more @-@ off would be the creation of the Union and the United Kingdom &apos;s customs union , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
while noting that such an agreement with Turkey , the Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r , the Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r , he said that we could have such a British one . &quot;
the alternative to this would be a return to customs points that would be a historic division and political failure .

he mentioned the challenge of our generation of Bri@@ x@@ iti@@ t , &quot; and warned that the result may affect the daily lives of Northern Ireland .
