four members of the Cape Verde Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to Posselt , in Spain , the police detained the leader of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape K@@ alli@@ ro@@ vo Group &apos; in Estonia , S@@ Blokland Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , who is known as S@@ pin@@ K@@ Cape ro@@ v@@ ski in the criminal world .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch arrested in Spain was arrested at a court permit .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
it is suspected of being members of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde &apos; criminal community aged between 27 and 57 years , who commit mainly drug crimes .
in the province of M@@ ala Mi@@ ja@@ s in Spain , the alleged head of the criminal community was detained .
in Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of them collected according to the figures being the leading figure in the criminal community , and two are members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicates that tasks and roles had been clearly divided in the criminal community .
the purpose of the criminal community &apos;s activities was to commit drug crimes and thus to earn criminal proceeds , &quot; commented on the head of the pre @-@ trial proceedings in criminal cases , Public Prosecutor Va@@ ila Ver@@ te .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; the public Prosecutor added .
it is people who have previously found themselves in the interest of law enforcement authorities and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Ver@@ te stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common@@ place for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; said Public Prosecutor Ver@@ te .
the head of the central police service , ago in Le@@ is , said that detention was preceded by an investigation lasting almost one and a half years .
&quot; in the first half of the week , we were in Estonia and Spain suspected of committing crimes , &quot; he said .
it added that central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have a good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
these arrests are yet another message to criminals that we can also get them from another European end , &quot; said Le@@ is .
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that men suspected of being free may continue to commit new offences , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office asked for their arrest and also approved by the court .
the man arrested in Spain expects him to be handed over to Estonia .
in this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation .
the criminal proceedings are carried out by the Office for organised crime organised by the Central Criminal Police and led by the Public Prosecutor .
the city of Tallinn was convicted of blackmail by S@@ dra Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch in 2005 and punished him with a five @-@ year imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ Å¡@@ it was regarded as the second most important in Estonia &apos;s criminal world following the G@@ end@@ ar@@ meri@@ e , Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , from Cape Verde , appeared in Estonia &apos;s alli@@ ances at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Ad@@ mittedly , he taxed tax@@ i drivers and women on various ho@@ tels and ordered a monthly ro@@ tation tax on business@@ men .
international joint operations , confiscation of proceeds of crime and entry into force of court decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest judgments , the eight accused of a criminal offence in the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ ic Community , who seized EUR 80 000 of criminal proceeds , or the verdict against nine persons that Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at illegal trafficking of illegal cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in Eastern Vir@@ u@@ land and southern Estonia .
it has a total of around EUR 71 500 of recorded criminal profits .
in these criminal cases , it has been successful that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and , if necessary , procedures are carried out in any country of the European Union .
civil Liberties Group war@@ ns of Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ se travel
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ dad of the People of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ Nicaragua ) has warned the people of Mis@@ sou@@ la for discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the State .
in a statement by the Group , &apos; The NA@@ SR issued for the State of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i State , valid until 28 August 2017 , calls on all American passengers , visitors and sou@@ ls to be particularly attentive and very careful when moving around the country , given the suspi@@ cious racial events that have taken place recently and have also been highlighted here &apos; .
according to NA@@ TA , the group urged both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law to issue a travel warning , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that the country &apos;s regular police protection targets are , in large part , minorities .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are violated .
they are dri@@ f@@ ted because of their sk@@ in colour , beaten or slaugh@@ tered , &apos; said R@@ os Cha@@ pel , President of NA@@ SR City Sta@@ r .
&quot; we have never received such complaints so closely before . &quot;
this is the first warning that the organisation has issued for the State of the United States .
the group referred to events such as racist insul@@ ts on mus@@ ici@@ ans &apos; students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black S@@ and@@ er@@ si .
S@@ and@@ ers died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , after he was beaten by Canadian petrol and the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police arrested without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the report recently compiled by the Chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i shows that the national flag state is likely to halt the cars of black drivers by 75 % more likely than white drivers .
&apos;@@ For people to be aware and to warn their families , friends and collabor@@ ators about what might happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is , &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it means engaging in remote money or informing relatives that they pass through the state . &quot;
the latest figures from the F@@ B@@ I programme on hate crime were documented in the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is in 2015 at 100 hate crime , which puts the state in 16 places in the country for similar offences .
the travel warning is also a response to the new Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it difficult for the company &apos;s court to complain about discrimination in the search for housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( American Civil Si@@ tu@@ ation Union ) had previously issued travel barriers for T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona following the adoption by those states of immigration laws obli@@ ging local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences because , according to AC@@ L@@ U , it increases racial profiling .
usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter@@ reaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or inc@@ in@@ eration , can be caused by five different types of he@@ pati@@ tis - A , B , C , D and E .
all these vir@@ uses highlight the fier@@ ce bur@@ st of the li@@ ver .
however , the worst cost is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B and C , which can develop further into the li@@ ver &apos;s cir@@ cus , the li@@ ps and the li@@ ver .
the epidemi@@ ology of the Health Agency , Ku@@ Suu r , tells us that acute he@@ pati@@ tis disease events are the same for all types of sk@@ im@@ med inc@@ in@@ eration - f@@ at@@ ty , fa@@ ti@@ gue , E@@ as@@ per@@ ation , E@@ as@@ per@@ ation , o@@ in@@ eration , air pain , grey emissions , horse mackerel , meat and asylum pain , and the collapse of s@@ wine and li@@ mas@@ ters .
the last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of the li@@ tre bur@@ nt by cancer .
children can undergo he@@ pati@@ tis without disease .
the various types of heat can only be determined on the basis of laboratory research data .
L@@ pati@@ tis may turn to chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and run decades without disease phenomena , which means that man may not know anything about his or her dangerous illness .
Mr Ku@@ nil@@ r points out various forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their cul@@ mination more closely .
E@@ he@@ pati@@ tis virus infections are spread from a disease to humans and infec@@ t us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , se@@ als , emissions from infected human beings to hand and hand foodstuffs , soil , objects , contact and consumption of drugs .
a he@@ pati@@ tis was carried out by family members and carers of the risk of infection , people with chronic pay , sex people with infection , sex men , drug users , countries with he@@ pati@@ tis A .
contamination can be prevented by vaccination , in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling a lot and at risk of he@@ pati@@ tis A .
furthermore , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands , before eating food , to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading in connection with the blood of the sick person , in the inc@@ in@@ eration of drugs , in th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic treatment , in au@@ g@@ mentation , in the use of blood @-@ contaminated me@@ ters ( too@@ th@@ me@@ ters , maternity facilities ) , in the use of don@@ ating blood , in the sex and in the treatment of he@@ pati@@ tis suff@@ e@@ rers and in the sick person of he@@ pati@@ tis suff@@ e@@ rers .
the Group of the he@@ pati@@ tis infection includes drugs , sex partners of infected person , sex men , new@@ born mothers of infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , and passengers visiting countries with high he@@ pati@@ tis B .
in order to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis , it is possible to vacc@@ in@@ ate people ; in particular , it recommends to vacc@@ inations of people at risk , as well as chronic li@@ abilities , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
there is a he@@ pati@@ tis cure for other preventive measures : ref@@ ra@@ ining from the use of xen@@ ophobic hygiene and man@@ bal devices , other sharp devices and need@@ les , ly@@ stal@@ gia and au@@ g@@ mentation , and the use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection or prevention of sexual risk .
vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis V is part of the National Im@@ mun@@ isation Scheme and free of charge for children in Estonia .
He@@ pati@@ tis C virus is spreading in connection with the blood of the person infected with the disease , inf@@ lam@@ matory drugs , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic treatment , au@@ g@@ mentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated me@@ ters , blood @-@ borne infections , donor blood blood , he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ patient sex and he@@ pati@@ tis disease to animals / new@@ born babies .
drug users , sex partners of infected person , sex men , new@@ born mothers of infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police officers , people with HIV infections , and passengers visiting countries with he@@ pati@@ tis C .
prevention of he@@ pati@@ tis C is : non @-@ use of hos@@ pita@@ lity hygiene and man@@ or@@ ary devices , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ stal@@ gia , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic care and au@@ g@@ mentation , and con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
d he@@ pati@@ tis tis is caused by the D@@ he@@ pati@@ tis virus , which goes much further in the presence of the he@@ pati@@ tis B virus .
as a result , D@@ he@@ pati@@ tis B@@ he@@ pati@@ tis infections , together with he@@ pati@@ tis B or super@@ inf@@ ants , occur on chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B suff@@ e@@ rers .
E@@ pati@@ tis virus infections spread from exposure to ver@@ bal and other body flu@@ ids , contaminated sy@@ stal@@ les to need@@ les , relatives and rarely infected animals .
the he@@ pati@@ tis hazard tax is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B infections and people who do not have immunity from he@@ pati@@ tis B .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis B vaccines , which also protects people from infection with the he@@ pati@@ tis D virus .
E@@ he@@ pati@@ tis virus infections spread by fe@@ u@@ dal means of drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , donor blood , psy@@ chi@@ ps and more infected animals .
passengers may be infected with high levels of E he@@ pati@@ tis disease in countries .
E@@ he@@ pati@@ tis preventive measures are compliance with hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands after slaughter , prior to food preparation and eating , after hospital care .
F@@ ru@@ its and vegetables are was@@ hing before consumption , avoiding eating little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption .
although , over the last few months , competitors tried four times to printing the Olympic winner , 34 years old F@@ ara@@ h finally came to power and won 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
Mr F@@ ara@@ h did not think long enough to get the hus@@ band T@@ ania and children on their way after the fin@@ alists .
this was a special moment for me .
I am very sympa@@ thetic to my family .
being with them was wonderful , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h to journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h is focusing its fifth edition in London on the gol@@ den du@@ mp of 5 000 and 10 000 me@@ ters .
everything is possible if it is believed .
despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ norm in Da@@ am gold , G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri has an extraordinary story of &apos; sy@@ non@@ ymous with one art works &apos; , much deeper than the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna .
but even more deeply in history .
the anthem &apos;s inf@@ er@@ rant gold would have been lost , that is to say , a s@@ le@@ ep cut , a narro@@ wer topic would have had to have more influence on the extraordinary band@@ ree nature permitted in the title .
at the moment , there would be some sort of two books : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti and his pain@@ ting of Da@@ am gold , the story of A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer , and a much more extensive and comprehensive history of H@@ on@@ ourable families and the German occupation , with its aftermath in Austria .
the first third of the book leads to a thri@@ ving cultural life in the middle of Vienna , who himself entered the Austrian capital , can hardly imagine how life went around R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ s more than a hundred years ago or how all its head was turned when the climate inva@@ ded .
the concentration of cultural charac@@ ters was high in one of Europe &apos;s rich@@ est cities and the name familiar with in the book , as if you look like a gram in a more cultural way .
however , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a city where there was an un@@ treated ar@@ son in the pig@@ meat and the highest level of suicide in Europe does not add anything to development .
or perhaps , however , every couple of honest ter@@ rain also adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in the last decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had explo@@ ded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
nearly one in ten people in Vienna had a Jewish person in the S@@ aj@@ an@@ di@@ tis .
parents were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time the A@@ rad relief was launched twice by the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ d Fer@@ din@@ ja B@@ lo@@ ch and the customer in his famous pain@@ ting , his father had become the seventh largest bank in H@@ ab@@ s@@ bur@@ sts .
however , the whole life of the gla@@ ci@@ ers to which he was famous was not pic@@ ked up .
if you look at the &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that , in the end of life , this kind of c@@ ol@@ less socialist virus was infected and dre@@ am@@ t of a trip to the Soviet Union .
for 19@@ 07 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s luggage from Climate K@@ ong , the pain@@ ting mak@@ er in Vienna was the last moment .
the climate ordered payment at the time of 4 000 kro@@ ons , a quarter of the price of a good @-@ place rural house .
the fact that some sports cre@@ ws were suspected of a mo@@ del@@ li of a mas@@ ter was not intimi@@ dated by sugar s@@ tun@@ na@@ tis .
as far as the dele@@ gate is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between the mo@@ del@@ li and the ar@@ tist created during the work continued until the end of life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - Da@@ am gold .
G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri Corpor@@ ree , &quot; The Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , the English translation Al@@ do R@@ and@@ land .
shortly before the start of the work with A@@ dele@@ ja , the climate had been visited in Ra@@ ven@@ na San V@@ ita@@ le , and the investi@@ g@@ ators think that it was precisely there that the wonderful mo@@ sa@@ ic E@@ ver@@ na The@@ o@@ dor@@ t em@@ pe@@ ror gave the ar@@ tist the idea of making a gol@@ den portfolio called A@@ dele@@ dele@@ dele@@ r a mo@@ sa@@ ic .
the climate presented in his &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; in Vienna in 19@@ 08 and about the same time ( 19@@ 07 @-@ 19@@ 08 ) , one of the gol@@ den ter@@ restri@@ als , was born .
art his@@ tori@@ ans did not notice the simil@@ arities of the two women .
what about nature is Hitler ?
&quot; I think that , to remember my friend Kli@@ m@@ mer , I am obliged to make his family available to the public , &quot; A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer wrote a few years after the departure of the ar@@ tist ( Kli@@ m@@ t died in February 19@@ 18 ) to the Director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere muse@@ um and wanted their family &apos;s Kli@@ m@@ ti to go to mus@@ eu@@ ms .
six years before the death , the climate had produced one of the A@@ dele@@ s .
he also asked her hus@@ band to leave her two sports courses and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti landsca@@ pes to Gal@@ eri , Austria .
his founding fathers inh@@ eri@@ ted her words to Mari@@ ana and Lu@@ da .
one year after the climate had finished the &apos; Austrian Mon@@ a &apos; annex , Vi@@ in Ka@@ carri@@ art de A@@ ka@@ de@@ mine had attempted to get 17 @-@ year @-@ old Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , but fell through the Code .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is considered to be the reason for the fact that Jewish profes@@ sors did not accept him in the a@@ ca@@ de@@ mine , none of his cul@@ min@@ ants were actually Jews .
in any case , the role of Gal@@ eria in Austria , referred to in the spirit of Maria Damanaki , had changed considerably by 19@@ 39 , which had become important for finding decent work from the rich Jewish arts in Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal artistic mus@@ ici@@ ans also served some work at home for A@@ s , but not for the climate .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the night of Nazi art , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old trial dispute began between the Austrian Government and B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer he@@ irs .
it should just be noted at this point that if the &apos; novel &apos; is seen in Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle in Vienna , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer , the &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; portra@@ yed by A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer , must be tra@@ cked to New York , Ne@@ ue Gal@@ eri .
and , before the Vienna War , to read the aforementioned book .
even if you do not plan to look at the climate work , because at least my emo@@ tion , after the closure of the book , the subject of laugh@@ ing and Jewish people was sold more than USD 135 million over the ma@@ mal and mode@@ ll A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer .
so , not so much a cab@@ in , rather than a ma@@ tri@@ bal fate - and a very moving story .
Ms Bauer &apos;s relatives were considerably facilitated by the event @-@ orien@@ tated approach at the start of the book .
17 @-@ year @-@ old sw@@ im@@ ming in Canada was very close to Estonia &apos;s record .
in eating , gold was very close to the personal cor@@ n of its own 200 m g@@ lu@@ e g@@ lu@@ e , flooding 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 .
the Ti@@ pp@@ mark comes from a 17 @-@ year @-@ old pi@@ pe week ago , when Canadian je@@ wel@@ le@@ ry champi@@ on@@ ships were awarded 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 , the Pri@@ it A@@ av@@ ik U@@ ju@@ gation blo@@ g will be bro@@ ke@@ red .
gold last esca@@ ped the A to the end of ten years .
in Fin@@ ally , he went through his distance to 2.@@ 15.@@ 76 and achieved a good 7th seat with a new powerful peak .
Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) , consisting of A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or@@ n , remained just over half a second .
in Estonia , gold rose in all the time , and its latest personal top @-@ level mark is the fifth ever result of Estonia .
the young hope of the future lies in the launch of Canadian adult Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships of 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in bal@@ fire and 200 m@@ m and 400 metres in bun@@ dling .
last week , Canada &apos;s je@@ wel@@ le@@ ry champi@@ on@@ ships took place in Tu@@ on@@ to , and gold also took a successful start there .
he won 200 m in bal@@ fire with a sil@@ ver man &apos;s time of 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
this distance was sw@@ am@@ ped so quickly by a stand@@ by last year .
Estonia has distan@@ ced itself more quickly from the Gol@@ den era than Estonia &apos;s record B@@ SE .
as a fer@@ vent in Canada , the top 5@@ 6.@@ 66 of the new Estonian season won a wonderful personal record of 100 m@@ m v@@ ouch@@ ers .
for example , her old year , Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k , has distan@@ ced it by just one century more quickly .
he arrived at another 100 m in the opening of the theat@@ re sw@@ im@@ ming of the theat@@ re at 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 .
for half a long distance , he gained only 7th seats when he s@@ le@@ ep in the final assembly of 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
gold is currently being led by four different distance tables of the Estonian season .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics insu@@ red teet@@ h
the holiday season is in hand - it is also a nonsense for the President of the United States , Donald T@@ ru@@ l .
however , since the T@@ ru@@ mp has so far been one of the President who took the most holidays , critics are already we@@ aring teet@@ h .
according to the US VIS and the CN@@ N , the President intends to have 17 @-@ day leave in the exclusive gol@@ f club in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , which is located in New Jer@@ se@@ ys .
although President leave began yesterday , the anti @-@ T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has been speaking for weeks .
they are asking the Olympics for too frequent cle@@ ans@@ ing .
it is precisely the President who is entitled to spend a week in his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey in the cotton .
incidentally , the T@@ ru@@ mp has not clean@@ ed the President for its 19@@ 6 working days .
for example , Mr Bush was able to have 67 days on holiday for that period , with Barack Obama half as much as the T@@ ru@@ mp , but only 21 days .
however , the win@@ dows tend to forget things quickly .
ten days after becoming President , when he received the T@@ ru@@ mp , he said , &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , that there would be no time left for a holiday for his engine@@ er , because a great deal needs to be done .
he also expressed his outra@@ ge about Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office wrote on Twitter at the time : &apos; while Obama has a holiday , plays gol@@ f , the brak@@ es and the j@@ ung@@ le concer@@ ts are on the brak@@ es , journalists in exile are pul@@ ling their heads out &apos; .
according to white house officials , 17 days of gol@@ f club visits to pol@@ len are not a bet@@ ra@@ p .
it is officially referred to as &apos; working leave &apos; , during which the T@@ ru@@ l does not have time for reading or for other pro @-@ sporting activities .
in addition , there was also a second reason for working leave .
specifically , the western corporate pension system of the White House is being replaced and therefore the entire staff had to leave it .
the West Bank is also based on O@@ val@@ ka@@ ts@@ manship and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West in August , when there are 38 degrees and no con@@ glom@@ era@@ tes , said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the white house spokes@@ person , who stressed that the President would continue to work on holiday .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp will spend 17 days , you will get an idea of video .
blocking critics from Facebook to 07 do not apply to public office if you do not tolerate the voices of the voters .
the father of our country knew so much about the unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved Mr Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to bul@@ l him for everything , from internal politics to his political principles .
of course , he was anno@@ yed by the criticism .
but he did not force his critics to remain silent .
because , in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and , in dar@@ k@@ ness and silence , may lead us to slaughter animals &apos; .
this brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land ku@@ ber@@ ner Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who is struggling to be more in Washington .
the organisers &apos; sub@@ missions have blocked and era@@ sed at least 450 people who expressed their views on their official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the American Union for Freedom of Citizens ( American Civil Nations Union ) therefore compla@@ ined to the courts .
the Ku@@ ber@@ ner official &apos;s office pa@@ ved the action empty and web commen@@ ta@@ tes s@@ nat@@ ched from reactions in a style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos;
&apos;@@ This is just Facebook , &apos; many people said .
but that counts .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
this is an ama@@ zing popular Re@@ publi@@ can pu@@ b in an overwhelming democratic state .
his approval percentage is the second highest ranking in the country &apos;s 50 months .
Ho@@ gan is not a reac@@ tive sight .
it has led the state firmly and remains strictly firm in its own principles .
in addition , he has used his main tool to communicate with his constituents quite b@@ lun@@ tly Facebook , presenting , for the first time after his chemical pil@@ l , for example .
therefore , a public forum with official marking , managed by staff who pay taxpayers &apos; dollars from Kenya is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous , is being blocked .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s press representative , Ame@@ lia Ch@@ ita , defended the behaviour of the Governor in an interview given to Washington &apos;s Posselt , arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than mode@@ recasting .
however , it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet controls on the Internet , sub @-@ prime workers or people full of hatred .
the post was inter@@ viewed with a number of people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
this is precisely what they are really the people who are talking to their elected leaders : the user , the owner of the company and the passport , and not Internet control@@ lers .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ table , thought @-@ out and not ro@@ p@@ aste .
Pas@@ tor quoted milk in his post , underlining the Catholic movement of Ho@@ gan .
the lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not inci@@ te hatred , but rather hate crimes .
&quot; I was poli@@ tely saying that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; he wrote the edit@@ orial news story in his country .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , how many people comment on the same subject , some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort , rather than acknowledging that it is a great deal of concern for citizens . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s official called &apos; targeted jun@@ k attack &apos; would probably be invited by others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the age of Facebook allows for easy mat@@ ching of messages by simply blocking criticism or dele@@ ting negative comments .
it is much cleaner than the old one when , in order to do the same , it was necessary to send out workers , to collect and bur@@ y critical edit@@ orial newspapers , or to arrest the prote@@ sters and to force them to remain silent .
but that is exactly what is happening now , just digita@@ lly .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media too@@ th@@ less .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has accused Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter &apos;s bed .
one of the first key decisions on this matter was taken last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is , the US civil servan@@ t , decided in Alexand@@ ria that the director of the Man@@ aging Board of Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i land violated the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the vo@@ ter on Facebook page .
in K@@ tu@@ ck@@ y , the Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in@@ it ( R ) also visited AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter for use .
this should not be so difficult .
in Washington , the cost of affordable postal services had similar effects on the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters da@@ red in his way of leadership .
even then , Washington had to face anon@@ ymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers from pseu@@ do @-@ uni@@ on@@ ms such as Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , making the decisions of Washington land .
according to historical documents which have been compiled in the framework of the Water @-@ based George Washington magaz@@ ine , he bur@@ ned his c@@ abinet with petitions criticising his views on tw@@ inning , trade and shipping agreements with Britain .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , opinions and debates are fundamental pillars of our country .
and proper management means accepting it .

&quot; I could not defend my Ex@@ t@@ rema@@ du@@ ra O@@ range , because it was taken away from my competition calendar one year after my victory .
it is mathema@@ tical to come back to this chic@@ ken .
this is an excellent place to play gol@@ f .

this is a rare pil@@ l in Papua mÃ¤@@ ki , a former Dutch col@@ ony , which was entered into Indonesia in 19@@ 68 after a referendum in which only 10@@ 26 older people were forced to vote their hand in front of the forces .
the Dutch sup@@ rema@@ cy of liber@@ ation from the power of the people of the Netherlands is urging their boats to move swiftly against the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta Government , which is still keeping the region under strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into P@@ ope and Western P@@ ope , so independent Papua New Guinea remained eastern of the island .
the majority of the Roma is both a remote and de@@ ser@@ ted place , and in order to get here , 90 minutes from the capital of the province , Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ u , will have to fly to N@@ abi@@ mel and then pass a five @-@ hour journey with a ren@@ tal car .

Papua Indonesia is the most poor province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
but it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
just 100 km away from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , a mountainous province of approximately 153 000 inhabitants of New Jer@@ sey , the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world is G@@ ras@@ berg , which belongs to the company F@@ bet@@ por@@ ana Mc@@ Mor@@ an , which operates in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x@@ is .
in 2015 alone , F@@ ru@@ re@@ export from this place amounted to about USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ per .
furthermore , it is possible to con@@ serve the supply of raw wood , worth which is estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are a source of suffering for pa@@ ints , as they result in the suff@@ oc@@ ating presence of a powerful Iranian army .
a study by the New York Times in 2005 showed that F@@ re@@ exports were worth about USD 20 million for local troops and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to USD 150 000 for a single victim .
P@@ ope efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den h@@ all and are se@@ am@@ lessly bet@@ ra@@ yed .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed , and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Iranian army since 19@@ 59 .
according to the Asian Committee on Human Rights , the massacre in the moun@@ tains in Papua tri@@ bes in the 1970s was the dimension of genocide .
last year alone , over 3@@ 900 peaceful prote@@ sters were arrested by the Colom@@ bian police in the region .
the 2016 report of the Grand Dis@@ tri@@ ct of Bir@@ s@@ b@@ ane , entitled &apos; We shall lose all &apos; , contains testi@@ mony to the atrocities committed last year , such as extra@@ judicial executions , torture ( another report shows that rape and electric blow@@ ers are particularly widespread ) and the brutal repression of peaceful protests .
&quot; it is difficult to read the number of victims , as such incidents take place every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , the investi@@ g@@ ator of Human Rights Watch , Indonesia .
the cor@@ ps are even more har@@ sh@@ ly closed because Papua natural resources have led to the influx of new set@@ tle@@ rs from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing because of the influx of people in Indonesia from Bar@@ va , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ si Islands of black economic migrants .
popular can@@ te@@ ens are sold in the Qu@@ e@@ en and mixed vegetables by ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do , which are st@@ olen along with ground level .
they cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started selling hero@@ es and vegetables more cheap@@ ly than local boats on the traditional market , &quot; says Androulla Andersson born in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , 24 years old , who worked in the home to the capital of the province , Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ ria .
&quot; Sy@@ ri@@ ans Fron@@ ma@@ ma @-@ Ma@@ ma &#91; women &#93; pain@@ ting boats are therefore losing their market share . &quot;
the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , who is known to the people as Jo@@ ko@@ w , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in P@@ ope .
the former pu@@ b won 27 constitu@@ encies , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , on his way to the presidential Pal@@ ace of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta .
however , the P@@ ope has changed very little and the local feel chea@@ ted .
&quot; our hearts have been broken because , in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes with regard to restoring justice , &quot; says apprenticeships .
in fact , only two months after Jo@@ ko@@ w took office in October , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i was in a low position .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the Roma s@@ tun@@ ned on Christmas when two Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers wo@@ ven out of dar@@ k@@ ness .
born children told them that they should include the front lights .
according to the local pas@@ tor Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ eba@@ i , one of the soldiers insul@@ ted their voting tone and returned later to four soldiers .
according to victims and specta@@ tors , in the &apos; drink @-@ driving &apos; , soldiers hun@@ ted children and dece@@ ived them with their gun@@ s .
then one of the soldiers shot among children .
one child , 16 years old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , was so bru@@ tally beaten that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , a ne@@ ar@@ by electoral Commission building was bur@@ nt and things went further next day .
some 1 000 young people gathered in a football pit@@ ch in front of the local police department and the military command centre to claim justice .
they carried out direct ref@@ res@@ h@@ ments and presented the ma@@ ze of Papua me@@ e pa@@ go &apos;s wa@@ ita @-@ tan@@ tan@@ ts@@ u in which poultry s@@ ongs were bu@@ ried around and bu@@ ried .
some prote@@ sters started to le@@ cture the police and the military .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen the crow@@ d shows resistance more than three times , let them down , &apos; it was stated in a formal document , which has seen a magaz@@ ine for time but has not been issued to local media publications .
the Mayor of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , the city of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ me ( 56 ) , felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking the people to go home .
no one had the will to listen .
&quot; turning around me , I was suddenly shot in the left , saying &apos; he said time at night in his private col@@ ours at the blood of a t@@ ree .
we still do not know who the fire was , but it says that the soldiers &apos; ri@@ gs gathered in the month came from .
&apos;@@ There was a lot of people , a lot of children in the House , &apos; add him .
the local man , Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , was shot at his gun@@ s three times , according to a coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or .
&quot; I would expect him and I went through him as a body to make sure that he is with him , &apos; said Win@@ ily Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who uses only one name like many charac@@ ters .
&apos;@@ I saw him dead ... S@@ novel le@@ w . &apos;
the Chief Police officer Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende said to the repor@@ ters that he was only the security of his department because it was attacked .
&quot; we need to defend ourselves when we are threatened to kill , &quot; said Vice @-@ President P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , the spokes@@ man for the Police Service in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prote@@ sters were killed and many injured .
the news about the killings arrived in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta@@ il only on the next day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ wi Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ras made a passion@@ ate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses to be dealt with in P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that he would put in place an alternative mechanism to tackle human rights crimes .
but almost immediately the ex@@ cus@@ es were also followed .
&quot; most crimes happened a long time ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and early 200@@ 0s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
however , when speaking time at Christmas 5 June in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to with@@ drew his words by saying that he had no intention of setting up a mechanism to deal with complaints in P@@ ope .
instead , he said that &apos; everything would be resolved by law &apos; .
the W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , accused by the UN of crimes against human rights , of more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the 1999 bloody referendum on independence , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in P@@ ope , including what happened in P@@ ani@@ a@@ is .
the families of the victims of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i adopted such statements with a g@@ loom@@ y disregard .
&quot; I have been inter@@ ro@@ gated four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&apos;@@ I am ti@@ red &apos; .
he says that , many years later , there is still fear .
&apos;@@ I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&quot; I fear that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I will be shot . &quot;
his bro@@ ther d Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed his opinion that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are afraid of this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after helping to bur@@ y four victims .
&quot; after bur@@ ying the bodies , the army had to look to me , &apos; he says .
executions have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the inhabitants of the Egyptian police in the neighbouring P@@ ani@@ a@@ i municipal@@ ity in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ is were shot .
one person was killed and 17 injured , including children , when he went to war between the residents of the villages and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an un@@ conscious man to hospital .
this man &apos;s population , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ ve into ne@@ ar@@ by @-@ fish rivers , died on the way to hospital .
the recent inhabitants of villages prote@@ sted on a construction site before the company office .
according to the police , the people of villages were le@@ c@@ turing police officers to be st@@ oned , and the latter responded to warning bel@@ ls .
however , according to local reports , mobile British people ( the Iranian military police ) started to shoo@@ t at the people , killing one person .
&quot; we were in great panic , we are afraid of reven@@ ge , &quot; said Assis@@ tant Ro@@ yal Dom@@ ing@@ da Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives close to the hospital and saw injured in@@ sec@@ ts .
&quot; I have beaten myself in my house for two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the police &apos;s mobile hybrid from the area .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ i has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development is feeding the dis@@ satisfaction of the me@@ als , m@@ oni , dan@@ s and da@@ m@@ mal tri@@ bes living in the central memory of Papua hal@@ j@@ enda@@ eva .
many of them have signed up to the army of insur@@ gen@@ ts of the Free Movement ( V@@ PL ) , which , according to its own , protects the rights of pa@@ in@@ ants by or@@ dering attacks and kid@@ napp@@ ings on Iranian soldiers .
some of the V@@ PL &apos;s leadership comes from P@@ ani@@ an , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ g and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , over the last few years , under the pretext of defending national sovereignty , the army has arrested in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them will never again appear .
among the people of Papua Islands , P@@ ani@@ ans are known as &apos; tragic forgotten place &apos; .
poverty fe@@ eds dis@@ satisfaction .
the little ri@@ ce that is sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
cheap is the same un@@ at@@ tain@@ able .
people grow all their food themselves , mainly from Bahrain , with a little more fruit and vegetables .
farming is the work of women , each of whom can care for four or five bar fields .
they usually keep most of the recei@@ pt of the family ; the rest is sold on the local market .
ten Bah@@ Ã¡ &apos;@@ s cost only 10 000 Indon@@ esi@@ an premises ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities between heavy boats and new migrants who have arrived en masse since the opening of new routes at N@@ ab@@ ire airport have deepen@@ ed .
the few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
the speculators themselves often do not have the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the village because there is neither jobs nor money , &quot; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , President of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ bal Council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world out of the P@@ ope .
furthermore , there will be severe restrictions on foreign media .
French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ bridge L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were expelled earlier this year because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , even though they had been given a rare film permit .
according to the Vice @-@ President of the Human Rights Watch Asian department , P@@ ich@@ m K@@ ine , the election pledges made by Jo@@ ko@@ w have not been implemented to lift the restrictions on reports aimed at promoting transparency and development .
&quot; journalists attempting to report from the most trou@@ bled provinces in Papua ang and Western P@@ ope in Indonesia face new threats to the rejection and black@@ list of Madagascar , &quot; said in his statement .
the lack of a satellite view of the press means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esi@@ an Government is largely limited to its immediate neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries , Bahrain , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ pain , Mar@@ shall Islands and Sol@@ om@@ on Islands , urged the UN Human Rights Council to examine &apos; various large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in P@@ ole , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the same countries have historically supported V@@ PL .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r he@@ itis charges for a group at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , saying to the press : &apos; there is still a democratic regime and freedom of the press in Indonesia so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bur@@ y &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to heed .
when the Dutch official delegation visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ r , the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , K@@ ees , on 4 May , the local people inter@@ cep@@ ted the meeting but wanted to be anon@@ ymous , according to the source , to remain silent , urging that &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
new presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019 , but boats do not believe they will vote again in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w .
&quot; Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man with good intentions , but surrounded by people involved in the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , &quot; says Ho@@ ba@@ i , President of the tri@@ bal Council .
he wants to make it clear to Jo@@ ko@@ w that , in addition to the fact that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i live under the threat posed by the army , they are suffering from poor education and health services .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , like other boats , regard their votes to Jo@@ ko@@ w as the debt that they have to pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and intimidation , the families of the victims of the fire in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i were able to cope with yet another symbolic objection to Madagascar , which swe@@ pt one victim &apos;s body into a police station and the military case responded to the country in question .
knowing that justice can never be put on its feet , they at least do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a shot .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
ne@@ go@@ ver of Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch &apos;s pil@@ ots had to come under the car@@ pet for the second time .
on Friday , hundreds of people were fed through one of the world &apos;s biggest residential stor@@ ms in Du@@ ba@@ i , forcing them to escape this 3@@ 37 me@@ tre of age and 79 ru@@ th@@ less buildings .
this is the second fire , which has been ra@@ va@@ ged for just two years from a high level that is called the Tu@@ rin case , or the T@@ him@@ vi@@ ku@@ r .
the building was evacu@@ ated , none of the injuries were reported and there were any direct causes of fire .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and wake up to the fires and the people &apos;s fears .
we would wait for the t@@ our and we had about 10 minutes to fall to the 50 order , &apos; said to the Re@@ u@@ ter@@ ans one of the people who called themselves George .
according to Du@@ ba@@ i &apos;s civil protection officers , fire fighters also deleted at around 4 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning at local inter@@ vals ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and seized the building .
the government said that it was working to provide the victims with shelter .
this incident can once again raise questions about the safety of high @-@ level materials used on foreign soil around the world .
the investigation carried out by the Tu@@ rin Management Board in the aftermath of the fire in 2015 found that the most damage was suffered by kid@@ ne@@ ys - dec@@ ri@@ min@@ ant panels and insu@@ lation of foreign space .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London G@@ ren@@ portfolio T@@ ow@@ er and the emb@@ assies could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that took place there in June , which killed almost 80 people .
see : these phones will probably receive sales cards in the autumn
in theory and coal , it is time for tele@@ visions to be bu@@ ried because , then , phone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peripheral a Pre@@ mi@@ um came to sale in the spring , and new h@@ it@@ t telep@@ hon@@ es are expected for po@@ ele@@ rs in the autumn .
according to the Tele@@ 2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Se@@ mother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by an innovative design , an eye @-@ s@@ hand@@ ner , ser@@ ser @-@ servan@@ i 4@@ K resolution , a screen and a fast process .
Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , which has also reached the top of Estonia &apos;s smar@@ t@@ phones &apos; sales table , gave high visibility in the world of technology .
in autumn , smart hu@@ bs allow even more h@@ aste , more resistance , more quality camer@@ a and more water and more pollin@@ ation .
he added that , on the basis of rum@@ ours , you can already specu@@ late and predict four top @-@ level models , which are likely to con@@ qu@@ er today &apos;s sales tables .
these four smart phone top @-@ level models will reach po@@ as@@ hers in the autumn of this year .
the lon@@ a@@ med i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach boys by mid @-@ September .
however , the rum@@ ours which the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are spreading a lot .
if i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not give rise to significant differences between i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , Apple &apos;s 10th birth@@ day is expected to fully separate the new model from previous ones .
there have been four col@@ ours : black , White , Swedish cu@@ p and cro@@ re@@ om .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers all the telephone front , has been lost , and the fingerprints have been built into the screen .
Apple &apos;s design director J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve demands that the new i@@ P@@ hone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk of an i@@ P@@ hone version .
in addition to the face @-@ to @-@ face char@@ ger , the un@@ man@@ age@@ able charging and the even higher quality camer@@ a , we can expect a faster A@@ 11 process .
this is certainly one of the most expected smart phones in the year .
the outs@@ ourcing of the new model G@@ ala@@ x@@ y hood 8 will begin on 23 August .
a lot of rum@@ ours have been made about what new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y Plan 8 will look like .
Ad@@ mittedly , even more business users are meant , and S pen allows even greater fun@@ ction@@ alities .
the telephone fund should have two camer@@ as , one of which is a la@@ in@@ ur@@ t and one with a narrow view to tele@@ objects .
at the moment , no one knows what the two tab@@ oo@@ s are capable of , but in any case this is the first test of Sam@@ sun@@ g , which is certainly comparable to i@@ P@@ hone 8 in terms of quality .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August .
although Nokia has sold sales this year with three smart phones headed by Nokia 6 , their flagship vessel , Nokia 8 , which is already being presented on 16 August , is still missing .
we are looking forward to a screen stret@@ ching from 5.@@ 3 to the bottom line and to an extraordinarily fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ scarce dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and more durable a@@ gi@@ tation .
Nokia also talks about alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and about significant levels of water and customs security IP@@ 68 .
like Sam@@ su@@ ng@@ one , Nokia &apos;s new model has two ro@@ tation camer@@ as , an opti@@ mist produced by Z@@ e@@ iss .
once the S@@ ony firm flagship has been X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future there will be at least two smart phones with even more innovative fun@@ ction@@ alities .
we are waiting for a smar@@ t@@ phone that is a little more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least as good or better .
for the new S@@ ony model , it has been specu@@ lated that this screen is at least hot .
what the reality is , we can already see right now , because traditionally S@@ ony has made its autumn flag public at the International Technology Forum IF@@ A , which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year .
according to trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts le@@ ak@@ ed telephone calls , T@@ ru@@ mp Lar@@ ge pressed for payment of the border wall
the Washington post unve@@ iled telephone calls between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i and Mexic@@ an and Austr@@ alian heads of state .
on 27 January , T@@ ru@@ mp went to the Mexic@@ an President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ o to end public pro@@ cla@@ mation that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President rus@@ hed with him for his public condemnation of the wall , saying : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ mp has set a promise in his presidential campaign to build a long wall and age on the southern border of the United States that Mexico will pay for this project .
the trans@@ cri@@ p@@ tors were also published in his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turmes , which reveals a ten@@ se debate .
the T@@ ru@@ mp said to Tur@@ une@@ le that the agreement whereby the United States takes on refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; ru@@ m &apos; . he stated that the agreement that was made during the Obama Administration would give him the impression &apos; guide &apos; , because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the T@@ ru@@ mp ended the speech by telling the Tur@@ une@@ le that &apos; this was the day &apos;s most un@@ pleasant speech &apos; .
the national court did not take a complaint in the case of the town of O@@ C MR@@ P Li@@ beria , where the city of Tar@@ tu rejected their offer for bus and coach transport between July 2019 and 20@@ 29 .
this is a letter rejected by An@@ neli A@@ pu@@ tin , Head of the Tar@@ tu City of O@@ C MR@@ P , as the offer did not meet the requirements , explained by An@@ neli A@@ pu@@ tin , President of the Tar@@ tu City Service .
this is the procurement of public transport within the Tar@@ tu city for the period 0@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 @-@ 3@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
MR@@ P city Li@@ ine referred to the Supreme Court of Justice to the decision of the Dis@@ tri@@ ct Court .
the national court did not act .
although many people in the social media complain that their night is disrup@@ ted by the We@@ ek@@ ise F@@ esti@@ val , and the entire city is full of drink @-@ driving officers , there are also many who do not have any negative words to say about a permanent festi@@ val .
I am even positively surprised that the brak@@ es were so poli@@ te in the shop .
I did not see any dis@@ approval or lack of cour@@ tes@@ y .
even from my generosity , I saw a nice wave .
&quot; it is nice that the win@@ ds , the win@@ ds are , and the joy of the Per@@ sian , which has remained like winter , is attached with pleasure . &quot;
a wave of fla@@ mes is not destroyed by the R@@ ann@@ y c@@ and@@ le .

the Ag@@ nes , who talked with a fire , also says that the Grand F@@ esti@@ val is rather good for the Per@@ ter - it will make a significant contribution to the circulation of local merchan@@ ts .
he also welcomes the fact that so many houses have come to the visitors &apos; capital in the summer .
the woman of Pe@@ ol@@ lian me@@ lu does not .
although I am no longer on the coast , it is nice that rand has revi@@ ved .
and it is good that the people are moving , and this has been the case three times &apos; , the woman says .
I think it was a little worse for the first time .

however , it is true that , according to him , what is happening on the ground is normal for the capital cities in the summer .

Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revive business
the British educational company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that he will cut 3 000 more jobs and reduce his interim dividend by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with business @-@ threatening distress .
these jobs , which , according to John F@@ all@@ on , are likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , add to the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced in May his intention to cut expenditure by another GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) under the third cost reduction programme in order to try to revive a business that has been hit by the transition to high @-@ speed digital learning .
a company that agreed to sell last month a company in the enterprise Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House to its partner Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann said that their expectation for a year had not changed since the sales income increase was announced to GBP 2.@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year .

Cap@@ tion in K@@ abu@@ l : NATO soldi@@ er killed in suicide attacks
the suicide bom@@ ber , according to officials , attacked military con@@ vo@@ ys in the capital of Afghanistan , K@@ abu@@ l , killing one NATO soldi@@ er and inju@@ ring several others .
in NATO &apos;s statement , five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to local reports , three civilians were killed in an incident in the city of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi .
this bom@@ bing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Her@@ ati mos@@ que attack on Tuesday .
on Monday , two people were killed by suicide bom@@ b@@ ers in K@@ abu@@ l near the Iraqi E@@ mb@@ assy .
NATO &apos;s statement said that an explosion took place on Thursday evening when the Afghan army of Joint pat@@ ro@@ l was attacked by &apos; man @-@ made explosives &apos; .
the statement states that everything has been injured in a stable state and is treated on the US military hospital Bag@@ ra@@ m flight .
according to the Cor@@ respondents , the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( in Chad ) are a serious source of concern for the forces in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ h , NATO , Bag@@ h@@ dad .
according to UN data , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital city .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l was killed mainly by at least 30 people in the S@@ hi &apos;@@ Ãª@@ tre .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the central city - the most deadly military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country and the police .
according to the Cor@@ respondents , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf .
EPA annul@@ led the decision to postpone the regulation after shar@@ ks
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United Nations Environmental Protection Agency alis EPA ) annul@@ led the decision to delay the adoption of the Obama regulation , which obliges states to limit emissions from flying , one day after 15 states referred the Agency to the courts for its conduct .
the EPA announced a decision to proceed late on Wednesday 2015 , saying that it demonstrates the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our national partners and listen to them , &quot; said the President of the EPA in his statement , Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t .
the P@@ ru@@ it@@ t had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the rates of os@@ tility content in Acc@@ ra , which measure pollution in the various parts of the country , in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year in order to meet the highest air quality standard by 16 September 2018 .
15 mainly democratic states , together with the Colom@@ bian community , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has tried to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to Mr T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , is part of a broader agenda for growth .
however , these efforts have led to reactions among the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Liberals and Nature Protection groups , which are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that the brea@@ thing of ozone @-@ containing air &apos; could reduce the ability of Cop@@ ts to work and increase the risk of suffering from res@@ pira@@ tory diseases , such as as@@ th@@ ma .

M@@ Ã¼r@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
Mr V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and Mr Gar@@ cia , who should be on a col@@ lisi@@ on course to face up to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg of bo@@ xing in the most attractive shop in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in the ES@@ P@@ N office in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ le@@ les , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ winning World Bo@@ avian Coun@@ c@@ il ligh@@ t@@ weight champion , wal@@ ked out the other side of the corridor to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , World Bo@@ Ðµ@@ z@@ ation@@ i sul@@ g@@ weight che@@ que .
following a unanimous decision by Gar@@ cia , the victory achieved on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ erial , the former four @-@ time world champion , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er , both comb@@ at@@ ants belong to the top of the ranking .
Gar@@ cia extended its hand better and said , &apos; W@@ h@@ l goes , che@@ em@@ pi@@ is ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko is defending his bel@@ ts against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ ga on Saturday evening at 19 ES@@ P@@ N .
when a couple of pho@@ tos appeared , the leader of L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko &apos;s memory , E@@ g Kli@@ mas , stated that there would be a &apos; perfect y@@ ard@@ stick &apos; between the comb@@ at@@ ants .
&quot; I am former cha@@ otic , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I called on B@@ ron@@ ger &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move down@@ wards .
and he has to move up to half the easy weight &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the F@@ ans have asked for this .
let us then hur@@ t them . &apos;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
in the climate , the question raised was whether it should be worthwhile looking at it , which is part of his strategy of allowing L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to debate at the end of this year at 6@@ 1.2 kg of class in order to make it possible next summer to meet with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ vans ) , which is also interested in fighting Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ li &apos;s match match with the winner of the E@@ mb@@ assy following their ligh@@ ter weight on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , because f@@ ans have called for this opposition , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , later , that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial packages .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name can get so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that she considers L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t a &apos; armed figh@@ ter &apos; and could go to his Saturday &apos;s match .
however , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was modest in pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia by saying that , in his opinion , the three di@@ vis@@ j@@ on champi@@ on@@ ist from Ri@@ ver@@ ge saw &apos; very slow ; apolo@@ gies , M@@ sele@@ y ... you wanted this no@@ distant &apos; .
according to Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show the strength of the blow@@ s and then bo@@ y .
both have confirmed that they feel that the tension to reach them is increasing .
&quot; this is a fight that awa@@ its realisation .
no other confrontation aro@@ uses so much attention and s@@ lan@@ der .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters , and M@@ ae@@ y is precisely that .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
what world pressures are being moved from to Estonia ?
the soil was extended and issued by the police and border control authorities ( PP@@ A ) record more than 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work , study or family .
when , for example , soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit for 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , Madagascar &apos;s number was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the services cannot say how many migrants will end up permanently staying in Estonia , but such an analysis will be prepared by the Ministry of the Interior .
while nearly 500 Ukrainians were home to Estonia 10 years ago , in recent years this figure will reach 2 000 close .
the number of applicants for renewal rose dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis , with 10@@ 87 people receiving fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , up from 6@@ 75 in the previous year .
in Estonia , the statistics office gives us the highest number of Ukrainian citizens , with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia in excess of their generosity .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has been big all the time in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that employment and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already in front of the family , said Kris@@ tin Ram@@ alla@@ h , the spokes@@ man at the Ministry of the Interior .
So@@ il and Kab@@ ila had the number of Ukrainian people who had fixed @-@ term residence permits even higher than that of Russian citizens , even though in ten years the lon@@ gest @-@ term residence permits have been issued to the latter .
when Ukrainians come to work mostly here , Russian citizens for family migration .
&quot; given the historic Russian community here , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said Hel@@ ina Me@@ a , the Internal Protection A@@ ca@@ de@@ my .
&quot; looking at what nationals of Russia who have been admitted to live in Estonia , Har@@ ju@@ maa is now an Eastern Vir@@ g@@ land , &quot; he added and pointed out that about 40 % of them have been mar@@ ried with the citizens of the European Union .
soil was granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 16@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permits decreased .
&quot; compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending residence permits , a new residence permit has been requested for permanent entry into Estonia &quot; explained by the press spokes@@ person at the Ministry of the Interior , Mr Ram@@ alla@@ h , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonian residence permits has remained rather stable for years .
a new residence permit for Estonia to reside permanently will allow foreigners living here to apply for at least three years from the previous year .
its aim is to encourage the eman@@ cip@@ ation of people who have been adapted .
however , a long @-@ term resident &apos;s residence permit requires five years , for example .
the extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased because of the new residence permit .
for example , soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to exchange their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be able to point the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit became popular - applications were still made by holders of a grey passport ( 10@@ 29 ) , Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , Indi@@ ans ( 54 ) and n@@ ig@@ er@@ ans ( 36 ) .
a total of 19@@ 68 people were able to live in Estonia for entry , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and just as many Chinese .
with the first half of this year , the total number of such applications is already 12@@ 69 .
in 10 years , surpris@@ ingly Nigeria has become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residency .
when three residence permits were issued to Fin@@ ns in 2007 , soil was 200 .
Nigeria comes to learn from this university .
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular , for example , among Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen mostly thanks to learning games .
they , too , have the rule that where the community has been set up , there will be more easily others , &quot; added Ram@@ alla@@ h .
over ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , just as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , this is about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if we look at the citizens of the European Union , migration will remain around a percentage , &quot; the mafia commented that the figures are actually small .
a total of 14 8@@ 22 people died in Estonia , according to data from the statistical office , 13 7@@ 92 .
this means that immigration trans@@ cen@@ ds migration for a second year .
the majority of ex@@ hi@@ b@@ itors and movements are Estonian citizens , but more of them are among those who leave them .
therefore , Estonia &apos;s citizens &apos; migration secret with 2 000 people was in decline .
the Est@@ oni@@ ans are particularly travelling between Finland and Estonia .
M@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture Pr@@ inc@@ s@@ sim@@ de lu@@ res with sa@@ ts , chic@@ k@@ ens and t@@ arrogance
however , in the northern wave of ideas , there is a history for Mrs Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u - old pain@@ ts and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream for hours somewhere in the muse@@ um and ad@@ m@@ ire the thi@@ ev@@ es and cra@@ ts of the old era .
if you go with something stone , you will be studying and learning about it every day .
this is a pleasure in finding out .
the modern world of M@@ M@@ M@@ ou@@ ture C@@ ou@@ ture may seem like some alien , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much s@@ oul your life !
as a friend , I have a whole sa@@ il full of the w@@ ounds I have created , cou@@ ture .
because , and it is not his fault , he does not live in Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ oo@@ s and does not go on a red wh@@ im every day ; he also wants to wear the most beautiful bro@@ kers , and it is suffering !
you can live your own special life !
the Mo@@ e@@ ira does not recognise the gap between pre@@ da@@ tory events and grey day .
it was this reasoning that made the rolling stock plan to move higher in Estonia to rural areas , between forests and fields , between people who often do not reach them .
for example , a joint colle@@ gi@@ ate was presented a long time ago , compar@@ isons , J@@ a@@ tis and Per@@ lo mo@@ e@@ alle@@ el , where 45 mos@@ ques were we@@ aring the Qu@@ e@@ en &apos;s entire street .
there is often a han@@ g in the city of Tallinn , with dignity , but there is more emo@@ tion elsewhere - s@@ log@@ ans , b@@ ba@@ vo , stand up , you want to be than@@ ked .
a large proportion of the audience was just news , but now they are the f@@ ans of M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture .
if you over@@ shoo@@ t people &apos;s expectations , they are spiri@@ ted !
and I like the feeling that I am with my mo@@ tive like the summer .
Per@@ nus had a 50 @-@ me@@ tre red car@@ pet , a whole street full of stic@@ kers , it seemed they would not come to an end .
Mrs Maria also does not recognise the mo@@ tive that nature must be presented as a super@@ sta@@ r , she will be happy to bring ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always come with pleasure .
after all , this is a la@@ x of experience , a wonderful piece of sho@@ d in the Gulf .
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own play , I am always behind the ground in order to be able to produce the last but@@ ter@@ piece of things as a hope@@ less Span@@ i@@ ard .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow a calm watch on the floor .
Mrs Maria Maria is this kind of mo@@ el@@ o@@ gy , who wants not only to play a representative role , but to be involved in everything .
I have my sis@@ ter in the session , and most of the colle@@ ctions are carried out by myself .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to discover .
I am never far from my nature and I am not afraid of work .
it is not limited , but it is also a matter of injec@@ tion , logistics , organisation , organisation - everything has to ju@@ mp off the days of a woman of one tem@@ per@@ ment .
the fana@@ tics still have a huge amount of work to do .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a happy day !
I am still very lu@@ cky - it is like an un@@ stop@@ p@@ able jo@@ ke : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compli@@ ments .
it has been said several times that my bro@@ kers have a taste - they make themselves feel like printing .
the gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ ous high @-@ ranking links that Mrs Maria talent made known overnight are long overdue signals from C@@ ou@@ ture to date .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p U@@ 18 boys : gun@@ s of Est@@ oni@@ ans were now turned against us .
the damage , the fa@@ iry tale , ran out .
the first thing came to an end was that we were not able to get our tables on the table .
and when so much difference comes in the table , there is nothing to do , &quot; said Estonia U@@ 18 cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ po@@ s 61 : 75 drop @-@ out to Britain , our only Kor@@ v@@ pal@@ te , BC Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p .
opponents took 28 requests from the south @-@ west and were so much more attacks as a result .
we were also not prepared to protect them agg@@ ressi@@ vely and not to attack them , which created it .
many of the attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
in defence , however , they managed to keep their hands somewhere , we could not combine .
it created the team from its feet .
the work of the opponents was better done .
according to M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ pa , Estonia should have made more tac@@ tical mistakes in order to withdraw the anti @-@ missile fire .
the last quarter had a mistake - we had a zero error , but opponents have already received a number of quick fla@@ mes .
A@@ tle@@ ss@@ ness and intense oppression , which were our weapon on the al@@ ag@@ ro@@ pi@@ tur@@ ni@@ r , all now turned against us .
today we did not have the power against their agg@@ ressi@@ veness .
the finger remained stuck with its neg@@ ligent Kal@@ ev@@ is , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s .
security in general can say good words about the whole team ; to date , there was a united shock .
it is a pity that such an aggressive response had not been met before .
T@@ as@@ s have always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but he seemed to have been ti@@ red - he has borne a huge burden .
but he made some very nice ges@@ tures , which I have seen before in tr@@ en@@ ches , adding a guide .
hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous figures : in the E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ r concentration , E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ r thre@@ w three less than 10 points with a quarter ...
the U@@ 18 age class does not apply only to the young men em B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ tin@@ ir in Tallinn , she started in Dublin the day after yesterday .
and Estonia &apos;s game with Poland was , unfortunately , dri@@ f@@ ted into the area of anti @-@ qu@@ eu@@ es .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but even after the third quarter , the situation was 9 : 49 , or only in the last 10 minutes , opponents took their feet from the gas beet and 16 were left : 16 .
in both the first and the second quarter , Estonia du@@ mped 4 , the third point ...
at the same time , in the first two minutes , the Est@@ oni@@ ans caught two pieces of the first few minutes , and then played by 25 pieces , then one y@@ el@@ low , and then another 21 ta@@ les .
perhaps in almost half an hour , there was a gap of 47 fin@@ gers .
in addition , 2 points came from four open ro@@ cks .
the losses were a reasonable figure of this time , 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland &apos;s surface hit 33 % and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , with 83 of Portugal having to be admitted on the opening day : 56 on the right .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement supplies
today , a permanent &quot; no @-@ fly &quot; group from NATO arrived in Tallinn for a week in order to supplement vessels &apos; stocks and prepare for prospe@@ ctive practices .
in the course of the visit , ships are preparing for landing on the sea , thereby giving cre@@ ws the opportunity for a pa@@ ari@@ al holiday .
following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonia &apos;s waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations in search of historic explo@@ sive rem@@ nan@@ ts .
&quot; the participation of indigenous people in the NATO unit and the co@@ ding they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the alli@@ ances , &quot; said the chief cap@@ tain Ar@@ to Rein@@ land , the overseas fleet Com@@ man@@ der .
as of 29 June , NATO will chair the Latvian Na@@ vy Cap@@ tain Cap@@ tain , G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , a permanent &quot; no @-@ fly group &quot; group , which took over from a cap@@ ter in Estonia , Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as Sel@@ ja@@ b , at a ceremony in Riga .
the group &apos;s flagship vessel is L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , a Latvian naval force which also has a group leader .
this semester , the composition of the International Force is also owned by the Estonian Na@@ vy mine mine Trust and Sakharov .
as one of the four groups of vessels subject to NATO naval management , NATO is the first permanent mine group of high @-@ speed actors to be sent to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - T@@ o 13 August , the P@@ iri@@ ta mon@@ as@@ tery &apos;s silence will once again turn into a place where Burma , called by Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ r K@@ ans , will be counted 13 years ago .
this year , Mrs F@@ esti@@ val , the artistic leader of the city of Tallinn , Ly@@ to J@@ oo@@ sti ( 36 ) , will be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented .
risk to J@@ oo@@ st : the &apos; Tra@@ vi@@ ita &apos; and &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; clas@@ s@@ room , bal@@ le@@ ti@@ la@@ la@@ answers from B@@ ole@@ ro@@ st , a &apos; Kar@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ in &apos; , and there is also no shortage of own production of the scheme , this time Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ni &apos;s wonderful or@@ a@@ da@@ ge , by the same international team of creators who gave him the same response to P@@ iri@@ la@@ den Hague in 2015 .
Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has much more than just concer@@ ts and theat@@ re replies .
this is higher than any music theat@@ re in its usual form .
it is a festi@@ val that takes power and never gets rid of .
because the experience that the lis@@ ten@@ er receives in this sup@@ erior and sal@@ va@@ ble environment puts humanity b@@ righ@@ ter and concerns human beings in a way that cannot be described .
to the risk , you are the first year leader of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
did the Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ las@@ kin@@ s not feel a little big ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has been helpful .
I was pushed through a whole of my student career and also supported at the start of my di@@ os@@ ote career .
perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work .
the team of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has had so much prosperity in different K@@ las and , of course , all of this goes to me .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going to go .
it was the great heart of E@@ ri K@@ las@@ ts who gave me the power to move ahead very well with Mrs F@@ esti@@ val in Tallinn .
and here I am , and I can , !
what could the public adopt today at the F@@ esti@@ val , what are you offering in particular ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and surprise , among other things , the first bal@@ ler written to the speech by Mrs L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i .
this is &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson l@@ b &apos; .
and one criminal nu@@ ance is that the author of this bal@@ le@@ l is the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser , J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ inning , who himself expressed a wish to write it .
apparently she has already been living in the b@@ reat@@ h of Kar@@ l@@ sson .
to the risk , how are you all ti@@ mid ?
it is certainly thanks to my life @-@ spon@@ sored fellow .
such work requires a system of support and a lot of love , and I am lu@@ ck@@ ily cu@@ red of it .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tion does not depend so much on other people as I myself , in other words , how I oppose every new day .
and this awareness of keeping the tone , maintaining the positive and , in fact , s@@ mil@@ ing ourselves into the mir@@ ror of the morning rose by a significant percentage of my joy .
especially now this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen on this and it is working .
na@@ ming itself acts as a catalyst for a@@ mus@@ ism and increases the tone .
that is simply not a word .
I think that people do not yet know half the things of their own body , which the univer@@ se offers them , but it is gradually accepted by everyone .
now , this is an important moment .
is there a ri@@ tual before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ d was taken ?
there is still a need to replace clothing with more comfort .
this is a small moment for ourselves .
but , generally speaking , I do not have the opportunity to pu@@ mp or make a little w@@ ool before I speak .
in fact , I even like to talk to people actively , even before they take di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di@@ um .
but come all to Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , what is also to be detected here , not least for a big manager and a bal@@ le@@ t friend .

new results of tests for assessing the age of Swedish asylum seekers were published
in Sweden , the latest results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the houses were assessed as older than 18 , but not all believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for Bis@@ ca@@ y ( R@@ asy@@ ts@@ 129 in@@ al@@ ver@@ t ) started the tests earlier this year .
the tests were set up to assess the age more accurately during a request for asylum after criticism of the Swedish Authority for Migration ( I@@ OM ) for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly juven@@ ile refugees .
from March 2017 until 31 July 2017 , Migration has sent 6@@ 80 cases of testing , and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 24 81 tests .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) was assessed for 18 years old or 25 more cases , and the Institute for Legal medicine estimated that the &apos; testing may be 18 years old &apos; .
in 4@@ 32 cases , it came to the conclusion that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if the age of the person is questioned .
according to Joh@@ an GÃ¶@@ rans@@ son , who works in the Institute of Justice , the results are consistent compared with those of previous months .
&quot; we do not see a big difference compared to the statistics of previous months ; the numbers are quite consistent , &quot; he said to the newspaper The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed on average than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been elected for their age .
in May , the EIT issued the results of the 581 test and said that in 4@@ 42 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person examining is 18 years old or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson ska Dag@@ bla@@ d investigated the results of their 581 test , it became clear that , in 2@@ 43 cases , the person had stated directly that he would receive 18 this year .
this medical age assessment method , whereby smart th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic r@@ Ã¶@@ n@@ t@@ gen@@ i@@ ids and ex@@ otic MR@@ T are carried out , has been criticised by dental doctors and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts in some circles .
one of the sceptics is the endo@@ k@@ rin@@ ology of the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute , Claude Mar@@ cus , whose task is to assess people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through the audience sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the method of measu@@ re@@ ments currently being used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very precarious .
if we cannot say it firmly , we should not pretend that we get , &apos; said to the newspaper , he said forestry .
but Joh@@ an GÃ¶@@ rans@@ son , from the Institute for medicine , defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that the risk of pu@@ mping the baby in@@ adequately into adul@@ th@@ ood is low .
perhaps with some 10 % , there is a risk if a person is just under 18 . &quot;
9 sign that you could for@@ give you for more expensive .
you were more expensive on Friday and spent a night with someone else .
it is painful because you have so many nice times and memor@@ ies together .
I would like to reassure him , but is it time ...
Y@@ our Tan@@ go lists nine signs which show that the cost of your action is tw@@ o@@ fold and could be for@@ given .
it seems more expensive to understand the seriousness of the situation and to work hard to resolve it .
it is more expensive to deal with the problem of bringing it into the bed with another com@@ pass .
you are no longer in a defen@@ sive position .
it sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for its actions .
he is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
he agrees that he has made a serious mistake and is sincerely trying to improve the situation .
he is attentive and he is trying to communicate with you in a pleasant way .
at the same time , without pressure , you are rus@@ hing to get over the matter .
they are not denying what has happened , nor are they trying to make it un@@ noticed .
it is more expensive for you and for you to understand why there was a lack of loy@@ alty .
you talk about this , and also about how to avoid it in the future .
you need to communicate better and assess each other &apos;s needs .
your more expensive attitude and action have helped you to develop our condolences against his mistake .
your more expensive commitment and behaviour have created the basis for your proximity to return .
as a couple of you have made progress to believe again in your unity and relationship .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old new@@ er , Anna Maria O@@ rel , made a beautiful debate in London , receiving 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7 places of good 18 seats .
after that , M@@ M no@@ ori@@ m was a female j@@ ung@@ le and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for med@@ als in the future .
the contest went well and gained a good experience .
with the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , I immediately took away my average result , the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) risk too much and the third one ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) I was able to keep it very clear . &quot;
I had hoped for my emissions , and I am very pleased that I found it .
Ms Anna Maria O@@ re@@ li M@@ M &apos;s debate ended in a good 18@@ th place .
Vi@@ h@@ mas@@ ad@@ u O@@ reli@@ t did not mix , as he is , after all , training him through the TEC stage .
&apos;@@ I am afraid &apos; , he said a little bit more .
the London Olympic Assembly had almost a full house of the people , did the people , or were they able to turn themselves off ?
I came to Tajani , but in a positive sense .
everyone says that this will add - that is the case .
if you compete on your own , you can experience it .
he then confirmed that he will be satisfied with the M@@ M debate and he is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 3@@ 2nd outcome of this season , in other words the last one , ended in 18 places .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and M@@ ore - that is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of the med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina ku@@ ber@@ ner announced party change
the Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ a , that he would change political parties .
&apos;@@ W@@ hil@@ st it or not , the democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I say to you , having pushed a lot and thought for it ... today I say to you , the Western peac@@ hes , that I can no longer help you as a democratic Governor . &quot;
explanations of joy were g@@ rub@@ bed in the mi@@ xing .
&apos;@@ The@@ reafter , I will be a Re@@ publi@@ can , &apos; added Justice .
&quot; as a engineers , I would say to you that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
the T@@ ru@@ mp had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
T@@ ru@@ cher won 42 points in Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
justice , which , according to For@@ tera@@ i , is the only billion sta@@ r of state , turned out to be elected in 2016 .
in the Al@@ p@@ ine , it notes that it has coal mines in five states and that coal business is completely out of its own .
its value is approximately USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) published a declaration on Thursday night that &apos; the party exchange of Governor Justice is yet another blow to the democratic party park , which would rather prevent the country from being upgra@@ ded again rather than working for it &apos; .
&apos;@@ A mere 15 months of enqu@@ iry and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent wake @-@ up to par@@ ks that are out of the beginning and cannot find a positive and united message , &apos; said R@@ N@@ C representation , R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ Daniel C@@ S New@@ si .
it is hardly surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
Ur@@ met , who is in office at the We@@ ek@@ ise medical axis , told the girl yesterday that pos@@ ters had had to be distributed quite a lot .
Gran@@ des and mar@@ bles are fundamental , ex@@ cus@@ es and easy failures .
of course , the main , left and foot @-@ and @-@ mouth .
according to Ur@@ me@@ ti , visitors come to the festi@@ val with false foot@@ wear , and so there will be problems .
media have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some s@@ care@@ mon@@ gering practices , and there have been also one foot@@ bal@@ ls .
we have also made s@@ log@@ ans when a person has pul@@ led his hand or the finger .

Co@@ e praised the Russians for their fair apolo@@ gies for the D@@ ing@@ us@@ h@@ all .
the international r@@ alli@@ ed S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , who said &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apolo@@ gy from Thursday &apos; for the hor@@ ror of doping , reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country to return to sport .
the Russian stran@@ g@@ le@@ hold r@@ on D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lit@@ h@@ tin said at the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World C@@ up that the competition ban imposed on his country is the right one and has a firm aim to fight doping .
he apolog@@ ised &apos; for all cra@@ f@@ ts@@ men who have been cut off in competitions by gol@@ den and sil@@ ver med@@ als &apos; .
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on competition in force , which was introduced in November 2015 , after the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) report found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think today it was a very honest response , a very honest presentation , saying to the press the President of IA@@ AF , Mr Costa .
&quot; the entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognised that they had had had rather difficult times and that they would do their utmost to reform the al@@ union . &quot;
according to Co@@ e , he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own restoration .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the group &apos;s proposal that now is not the time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything possible over the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we always adhere to the principle that we want to separate clean spor@@ ts@@ men and spor@@ ts@@ people from the system that has been breached , &quot; he added .
one hundred Russian ath@@ le@@ tes who meet the strict criteria of IA@@ AF will compete as neutral ath@@ le@@ tes in the World C@@ up in London on Friday .
the head of the IA@@ AF working group , R@@ une Andersson , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet several rehabilitation criteria .
following a presentation to the IA@@ AF Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that le@@ c@@ ture@@ rs who have been banned are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution significantly changes the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
little because the electric car revolution fundamentally changes everything from the fuel market to infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although mining gi@@ ants like G@@ len@@ core can say that they win from one place to another , smaller mining firms do not help .
G@@ len@@ core coal and oil currently serve , but in the era of electric cars there will be a growing demand for co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ kel .
this year , governments in the United Kingdom , France and Norway have increased their contributions to the spread of electric cars , which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades .
therefore , Vol@@ vo has already announced that he is planning to give up an internal combustion engine , and T@@ es@@ la will bring to the market a cheaper blue 3 electric car .
B@@ animal berg &apos;s New Energy Finance Facility estimates that , for two decades now , electric cars will be sold more than those using oil @-@ fired fuels .
&quot; for some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ in B@@ animal .
we have already seen a huge impact on metals such as co@@ balt and li@@ thi@@ um , which have been growing demand for years .
electricity cars have approximately three times more cop@@ ies than the conventional car , publishing G@@ len@@ core .
even more answers are needed at charging stations , which is why Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that this will increase demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ gan@@ ans .
G@@ len@@ core will benefit from a rising trend in electricity cars from cop@@ per price increases and the fact that there is the world &apos;s largest co@@ bal@@ ti@@ er producer , predicted by the J@@ eff@@ ila Group .
according to this bro@@ ker company , the winners of the F@@ re@@ export @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ ma Min@@ er@@ conventions are other winners of the electric car race .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of the London me@@ tal stock exchange line has lan@@ ded .
the price of the soil was 37 % .
the reply has also dropped by 14 % this year , mainly due to economic growth .
G@@ len@@ core shares rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price rise to ri@@ val Rio T@@ oni@@ pa Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ oni and Ang@@ lo Stream .
on the side of the losers , there are lead companies such as Rec@@ y@@ ht@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine , who have to adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ use of the P@@ rin@@ ce is the bat@@ teries supplying the start @-@ up of cars with a diesel engine .
electric cars use li@@ iti@@ u@@ mines .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael W@@ id@@ mer , Governor of the Bank of America Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ ch me@@ tal Market analysis .
the impact of the generous trend has not yet been seen in the form of price movements .
P@@ li@@ c has reached 17 % this year , with the best methane in London among the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems for metals in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive , &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , a me@@ tal company Tri@@ land Me@@ talia .
if lead demand falls , it will be slow .
perhaps this will happen in about 10 years &apos; time .
meanwhile , stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which are more frequent dependent on advanced lead @-@ based bat@@ teries , will be assessed by the international lead and by the investigative body .
L@@ ae@@ lic metals such as alu@@ mini@@ um are replaced by steel , as a ligh@@ ter car can drive less electricity .
this explains an additional 1.6 million tonnes of closed minimum demand between 2013 and 2016 .
this represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s output of alu@@ mini@@ um .
this trend is likely to grow , says W@@ id@@ mer .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um has increased by 13 % this year , as growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market shortages .
steel manufacturers do not .
he is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful car lights .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal is also trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down from steel to oppose the minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris analysis , Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
we see some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also lead to suffering for pla@@ ice .
soil took about half of this precious me@@ tal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , and was announced by the me@@ tal fin@@ er Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ teries .
&quot; many of the raw materials currently facing high demand , such as oil and pla@@ te , may not have high demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will change within 15 years .
Pla@@ at@@ in@@ at@@ ine producers believe in the continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , leader of Un@@ core power , said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 .
in the 10 @-@ year perspective , To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ mun@@ i Mo@@ tos have been developed on hydrogen @-@ based cars dependent on a pos@@ ter in order to generate electricity from hydrogen .
until now , however , this technology has not yet legisla@@ ted commercially .
&quot; the Di@@ et appears to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P from Paris to Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers received a major set@@ back in July , as the S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art court banned the use of diesel in the cities of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how the monetary rules for football affect Ney@@ ra &apos;s transition to Paris
rules aimed at preventing the ram@@ pan@@ t spending of European football clubs do not prevent Ney@@ ra from making a record shift from the Spanish football club to the French club Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences for UEFA , the governing body , which domin@@ ates the European game and which has the power to ban teams from taking part in the security of the pres@@ ti@@ gious League of Me@@ is@@ ts , are still awaiting the Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ May .
the financial rules for fair play ( F@@ F@@ P ) , introduced by UEFA in 2011 , mean that the PS@@ G must prove at some point that the shift to Ney@@ ra was financed without huge losses .
EUR 2@@ 22 million were paid to Barcelona ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) for the fact that the Brazili@@ ans were able to buy his contract , and Ney@@ ra &apos;s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year .
here there are some aspects of Ney@@ ra &apos;s transfer to the French club .
PS@@ G will undoubtedly be able to spend such money on recru@@ iting Ney@@ ra and adding its sta@@ rs to the clo@@ ak , given that the team is funded by a family governed by the Ka@@ tar energy pipeline .
clubs have been allowed to spend a great deal on recru@@ iting players , but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that enable them to come up with them in football .
F@@ F@@ F@@ P formed the basis for Michel Pla@@ tini following his election as UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs , which are falling into debt in search of success , are actually engaged in fraud and risk sw@@ am@@ ping if the banks or owners were to give up support .
from 2011 , the F@@ F@@ F@@ P will focus on monitoring their losses instead of the debts of clubs .
this change means that the business model used by Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch first used in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ sea - buying a club with potential and then spending heavily to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of F@@ F@@ F@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can bear up to â¬ 30 million in losses .
and despite the withdrawal of Mr Pla@@ tini from the presidential office in 2015 , his successor to UEFA , Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , remains committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; F@@ F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said last week The negotiator , Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is UEFA &apos;s F@@ P Supervisor .
although the PS@@ G ta@@ dus Ney@@ ra for the over@@ purchase clause as one full payment , they will be able to allocate this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the agreement .
Mrs Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , so it will be possible to indicate a transitional fee of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
for the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G , together with Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga belonging to Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , received the most severe penalties .
a fine of EUR 60 million was imposed on GPS ( USD 82 million at this point ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million , and a club called for the crew of the League of Me@@ is@@ ters to be restricted to 21 players during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of the usual 25 .
UEFA seeks clubs which can try to over@@ ride financial institutions by ex@@ posing their revenues through companies linked to the owners of the club .
the Ka@@ tar company may spon@@ sor the PS@@ G , but if the value of spon@@ sorship is considered to be over @-@ standard market levels , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
this was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of Q@@ a@@ tar &apos;s support for tourism to the PS@@ G was in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ table .
it has been said that a certain part of the Kiri@@ mar@@ i PS@@ G service could come from Q@@ a@@ tar through contributions by the Management Committee for the World C@@ up in 20@@ 22 .
however , the PS@@ G and Q@@ a@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ ra could become a world champi@@ on@@ ship and say that UEFA regulators would easily be able to qu@@ ash such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on GPS mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition pro @-@ actively with PS@@ G @-@ Ney@@ ra .
they spoke to ETA on condition that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PS@@ G .
latest reports show that the PS@@ G made a profit of more than â¬ 10 million during the 2015 @-@ 2016 season at around â¬ 54@@ 2.4 million .
data from the last financial year have not yet been published .
PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ ra will have a positive impact on spon@@ sorship transactions , trade and s@@ nus .
the club expects a minimum of 30 % increase in turnover in relation to the conclusion of the contract .
Spain too , having clearly upset the departure of one of the biggest football sta@@ rs , sought to block the move by saying that the PS@@ G is in breach of the F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear case of &quot; financial doping &quot; with a club and a country , &quot; said , in La vie , President Javier T@@ eb@@ as , to the Spanish newspaper AS , referring to the fact that the PS@@ G belongs mainly to Ka@@ tari@@ as .
Ar@@ sen@@ al mÃ¤@@ ne@@ j@@ er Ar@@ Å£@@ W@@ en@@ ger , whose club belongs to the American sports mag@@ na@@ ge , shares with La Scotland the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights and has changed the whole football landscape completely over the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to the state , it will be possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player . &quot;

today 50 years ago : the Or@@ ch@@ op@@ ian storm in Estonia , which was kno@@ cking on houses and win@@ dows .
the or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra , which was designated as the stor@@ my of the century , ra@@ ging on 6 and 7 August caused major damage , particularly to the West , Har@@ ju@@ ria and the Black Sea .
in the north @-@ west of Estonia , during these days , the wind was over 30 m / s .
in my old ame@@ tri@@ o in Ba@@ vari@@ a , one of the char@@ ting trees ran to another and had a hand in supporting them .
everyone was blind and mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous , like the world stage .
T@@ aa@@ mal already with@@ drew from houses , recalled in 2002 the old Mrs L@@ inda K@@ uro@@ va hospital magaz@@ ine Estonian nature in this interview .
the wife of L@@ inda was able to see his own plan@@ ted t@@ our collapsed .
but what kind of support do you still have with your hands , where do you stand up against such a storm ?
the sea came under the window , from win@@ dows to water &apos; , Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us Kal@@ da was talking about Mrs L@@ inda tone , who lived on the streets .
the fact that the roads were full and that the cab@@ in coverage of the railway station had been flying 20 to 30 metres , L@@ inda most shar@@ k sto@@ res , just like next morning .
according to the local authorities , the C@@ ub@@ ans behind Par@@ ale@@ pa were behind their hopes , some were completely leng@@ ths , some boys .
everyone saw it very frustra@@ ting , the storm went through the hundreds of old trees as ra@@ da@@ r and pragmatism like a war .
Western Vir@@ u@@ land was not particularly severely affected by August 1967 compared to Western Estonia , but the losses were high there , the Vir@@ u@@ maa theat@@ re wrote in 2007 .
the Bat@@ sal@@ u L@@ fossil Par@@ k and the P@@ ad@@ ise Par@@ k were wi@@ ped out from the ground , but our ac@@ hers were also severely affected .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured by up to 35 metres per second , or approximately 130 kilometres a hour .
in Tallinn , M@@ eri@@ ane , on the evening of 6.@@ August , one of the few lead cha@@ mbers had said : &apos; mother , mother !
the Can@@ aries are in the air and will no longer be signed ! &apos; , wrote Vir@@ u@@ maa Official .
the generation &apos;s natural building in Vil@@ j@@ an@@ di@@ land was destroyed so much during the storm that it was decided to be demo@@ li@@ vated later .
the August stor@@ r was not opposed to the design of the T@@ Ã¼@@ r E@@ mp@@ ire , which was later not restored .
the newspaper Red T@@ uro@@ t wrote on 12 August 19@@ 57 that the ref@@ urb@@ ishment of towns and towns and cities and their vehicles is progressing slowly , and people could be involved in cor@@ ps .
Gra@@ ins were also severely affected in Tu@@ rin , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party organisations must be both on cor@@ ps and on fer@@ tility cor@@ ps as an incentive and guidance &apos; .
Or@@ ka@@ ans can speak when average wind speeds exceed 3@@ 2.7 m / s .
the water@@ tight wind in Estonia remains on 2 November 19@@ 59 , when Ru@@ h@@ nu@@ l measu@@ re@@ ments the wind at 48 m / s .
the V@@ ain@@ d@@ story on the island crus@@ hed a me@@ tre , so it was not able to accurately record the strong wind radiation it measured .
secret of holiday areas : night harves@@ ting and poor coastal waters
more expensive summer weather also means less cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ation in the be@@ aches of Tallinn .
&quot; if there is no , people are on the ground , and if there are no people , then there will also be no people &apos; , the qua@@ rer will be recognised as a be@@ ac@@ on .
the city of Northern Tallinn in S@@ tro@@ om &apos;s be@@ aches is being tor@@ n up by ro@@ cks .
they are offered fantastic competition on low turns of competition by a pig@@ let that dri@@ ves down the pla@@ ti@@ tudes .
in fact , the last seven c@@ enti@@ metres of gross rub@@ b@@ ish is blow@@ ing out se@@ af@@ ood and people &apos;s shel@@ ved cros@@ ses : bot@@ tles , cigarettes and so on .
people are still coming to ran@@ k , regardless of whether the water is warm or not .
when it is beautiful , people are on the ground and , if not , there are no people , &apos; the management of the private company hospital hospital as a be@@ ac@@ on is said by Alexander U@@ so@@ v .
there are 6.@@ 30 p.m. , and there is a bitter cor@@ ro@@ tation on the coast , because at 8 o &apos;@@ clock a pla@@ te must be in order for people .
it is already at four o &apos;@@ clock .
apart from S@@ tro@@ om , he is still watching on the coast of P@@ iri@@ ta , Har@@ ta La@@ ke , Ka@@ ku@@ mÃ¤@@ e and Pal@@ ar@@ a@@ are P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ari .
the amounts of PrÃ¼m have fallen .
years ago , it was much more .
people are now entitled to assess what is being done for them , &apos; U@@ so@@ v talks about who has cor@@ rup@@ ted the migrants for 15 years .
it was previously the case that , when something new had been stood up , it was already over the next day .
now it is kept to what is on the ground .
price of clean be@@ ach
one of the biggest jobs in Estonia &apos;s be@@ aches is the repetition of the rub@@ b@@ ish , the ad@@ ru .
for example , on the coast of P@@ iri@@ ta , it has to be transported by 400 000 tonnes of coast@@ line .
&apos;@@ This is an incredible amount &apos; , marks U@@ so@@ v .
another large category is municipal rub@@ b@@ ish , that is , all that people are leaving behind .
there are eight large amounts of rub@@ b@@ ish in S@@ tro@@ om coastal zones at one and a half kilometres , which need to be watered down three times a week .
so much will come from rub@@ b@@ ish .
however , the cold summer days have meant that rub@@ b@@ ish is five per cent less than otherwise .

Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler , a representative of administrative services , has admitted that the work of the tra@@ ctor is being disrup@@ ted by local authorities .
noise , which las@@ ts from hours to hours , is mixed up by people living in the neighbourhood .
on the day , however , this work is impossible .
in one month , the rand will have to travel twice .
&quot; if we do not do so , we will be fined by the city &quot; , Sch@@ ol@@ ler will mark .
however , like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ka and Savary , the aim is to get S@@ tro@@ om rand below the international flag .
&quot; compared to Europe , there is much more work in Estonia to care for be@@ aches , &quot; says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more ad@@ minister and more stone and it is harder to have a sand war .
but there is less rub@@ b@@ ish in our be@@ aches than elsewhere in Europe .
listening to the fact that there is talk of rub@@ b@@ ish , the conver@@ sa@@ tions between the journalist and cor@@ ro@@ gation staff living near S@@ tro@@ om are taking place in@@ ex@@ or@@ ably , highlighting current bottlenecks .
there is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is birds and bot@@ tom@@ less sla@@ ves who have hi@@ jac@@ ked rub@@ b@@ ish bags , &quot; said Martin .
although it is difficult to assume that people will be able to change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the city Government will do something with rub@@ b@@ ish s@@ log@@ ans and , for example , put them on the ro@@ of@@ s in order to prevent at least birds from taking news there .
in general , however , Martin S@@ tro@@ om is satisfied with developments .
we can see that the city takes care of this .
it has become more pleasant with children &apos;s fields , enligh@@ tened and newly as@@ ph@@ alt roads .
it was once the case that only one way was allowed to travel on the ground , &quot; Martin notes .

&quot; I have been dealing with this for one year , and nothing has been done so far , &quot; says D@@ mit@@ ry .

Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain on the previous level , as un@@ profitable economic growth and the easing of inflation have cus@@ hi@@ oned speculation in relation to the increase .
Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain a lo@@ opho@@ le , as household incomes have put interest rates on stand@@ by .
the decision @-@ makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MP@@ C ) have voted 6 : 2 in favour of 0.@@ 25 % and fewer members this month require an increase as slow growth has weakened support for the up@@ surge .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank cut its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
however , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in rates is necessary to contain inflation from Bre@@ x@@ on over the next few years and that the expected increase in lending costs on the financial markets could be necessary .
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package , which was launched a year ago as a result of Bre@@ x@@ ti .
the Bank will termin@@ ate its fixed @-@ term cash scheme in February , which provides banks with cheap funding , although it said that it is now up to GBP 15 billion more to be offered under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; the average forecast of MP@@ C will remain gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the near future , since the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
as regards the rates , it was reiterated that , in order to mitigate inflation , a &apos; fiscal effort &apos; was needed , to a somewhat greater extent than expected in the markets .
the Eurosta@@ rs is currently predi@@ cting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any ju@@ mp is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecasts in May .
the forecast for growth of 1.8 % in 2018 remained .
after this news , the p@@ ound fell in the course of the dollar and the euro .
women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.@@ 31 and 0.@@ 4 % to EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to an increase in expectations for the second quarter of 2.1 GDP , from 0.2 % to 0.@@ 3 % in the previous three months .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it will have some momentum at the end of the year .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave little reason to re@@ jo@@ ice households with rising inflation and a pi@@ tiful wage increase , saying that the situation would go a little worse before improvements were made .
it was added that monetary policy cannot avoid a blow to income in the next few years , but a significant recovery is expected towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
the p@@ ound ster@@ ling also encourages the economy to increase demand for British produce , partly compensa@@ ting consumers for lower costs .
the decision comes one year after the rate was set at 0.@@ 25 % last August , following the shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the p@@ ound .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to completely in@@ ject life into prices and into the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last decision , there was a feeling of increasing demand for higher levels , as inflation had increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , even though the Bank &apos;s message was expected and is expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak p@@ ound .
Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , head of Co@@ rec@@ o mortgage bro@@ kers , said : &apos; in the light of the recent downturn in exchange rates , the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again , as borro@@ w@@ ers are losing their jobs and hoping to finish the year in a positive way .
the BÃ¶ge exchange appears to be particularly favourable for those whose current transactions are due to the fact that re@@ financing , often without service and low rate , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV
patients have since September had access to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; treatment for HIV prevention after the battle in the Supreme Court over whether the N@@ HS should finance the drug .
N@@ HS England announced that public health will now make it available for an estimated 10 000 people during the initial three @-@ year clinical trial to pre @-@ contact ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t that is man@@ ned before the incident and has shown a reduction of approximately 86 % in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people .
the N@@ HS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported last year &apos;s ruling that the N@@ HS would be able to pay the bill for Pr@@ EP , despite its own claims that the drug should be financed by local authorities .
the Executive Director of N@@ HS Eng@@ land , Simon Ste@@ 186 , welcomed this on Thursday as a &apos; swee@@ ping new intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as &apos; momen@@ t@@ ous moment &apos; .
sexual health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ oli@@ s and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ s are among the first to register people , and further clin@@ ics will be added in October , before the programme is introduced anywhere in England by April 2018 .
&apos;@@ Pr@@ EP &apos; is a hot@@ ch@@ po@@ tch of HIV drugs , which will be taken before the incident , in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
clinical trials show that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection .
Pr@@ EP before taking part in the interim procedure means that there is a sufficient number of certain medicines in the body that prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can take place on a daily basis or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure .
the right candidates include L@@ GB@@ T men , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are HIV @-@ infected and do not receive treatment .
they identify suitable people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their willingness to participate in the local sex health clin@@ ics which participate in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and N@@ HS England signed the contract to get medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the clinical test aims to assess the true potential of Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who is treated and how it is consumed and implemented in a large cloud .
Ste@@ 186 said : &apos; this new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and enhance the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
this is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of mankind &apos;s biggest health problems . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , Chief Executive of NA@@ T , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk level , offers an opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic .
since September , people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on the negotiations with the partner , thereby improving many lives , through this clinical trial funded by the N@@ HS .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
the Man@@ aging Director of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Foundation , ian Green , said : &apos; now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is launched quickly across the country and that none of the members of the HIV risk group are excluded .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been received , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
the Minister for Public Health , Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , said : &apos; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the cen@@ sus of government sho@@ es .
evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will lead us a step closer to a complete understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
it is now important that a clinical trial is carried out as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV and to move us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.@@ 94 , compared with EUR 7.@@ 71 in June this year , Ele@@ ring .
the main reason for the price gap is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , the average electricity price for electricity was EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ ge hour last month and the price rose by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five percent to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ ge hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 34.@@ 17 , while the electricity exchange rate was EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ ge hour .
prices rose by 12 and 7 % respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity moved from 75 % last month to Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine per cent of the two @-@ hour transactions between the two countries did not take place next day .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity was mobile at 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of hours had full transmission capacity .
according to transactions in the Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X market on the last July trading day , the electricity exchange price could reach approximately â¬ 34 and â¬ 37 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ ge hour in August .
the carbon price affecting electricity production prices came up last month and transactions took place between EUR 5.@@ 04 and EUR 5.@@ 47 per tonne .
living a higher life - half @-@ order and smart de@@ sig@@ ners have made it home to the small Ear@@ ls Court of Justice .
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker who is a passion@@ ate building innova@@ tor , changed his home of K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in 2014 against the Ear@@ ls Court &apos;s kor@@ una .
this is in the first order of Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ Å£@@ i , and the fact that Jo@@ anne has not brought his bags together and sold the fla@@ ts has been a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived together with a former com@@ pass in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tanta@@ mount to the price I have offered .
it was shown to me by the Ear@@ ls Court of Justice , which had the same high waves .
I am wondering about it and I made an offer on the same day . &quot;
since the first visit , this 93 @-@ me@@ tre cor@@ ps have gone through a complete innovation gap .
at the beginning , it was a s@@ lee@@ ping cor@@ t and a difficult sticking plas@@ ter - you had to walk through the kit@@ chen cu@@ p to reach a s@@ lee@@ ping wall , and Jo@@ anne wanted to add savings and qu@@ asi @-@ regulation to exploit high levels of talent .
&quot; I wanted high , big win@@ dows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he is asking Er@@ fan Az@@ ad N@@ ot@@ ting , the archite@@ ctural and design headline Du@@ ck &amp; Order , to take advantage of the 3.@@ 8 m de@@ ser@@ ts and to create a home that is not just a development site but a place where Jo@@ anne can live .
it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create a qu@@ asi @-@ order to stand up .
the Er@@ fan had to take a creative approach .
&quot; aquaculture is rather complex , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise the premises so that they were located on one another without having to bo@@ w to each other .
it was not just about building a platform , but using steel design to make sure that both the upper and lower space is right . &quot;
this emphasis allowed Mrs Er@@ fan@@ s to create two pieces of fla@@ mb@@ les with complete arrogance alongside each other in the room , with a lot of dramatic elements .
one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ all lighting is the R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us window for the gla@@ ci@@ ers under the car@@ pet .
the gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ spe@@ ct Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille &apos;s lighting underline the style of space .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in the addition of communications , space and traffic lights .
both sides of the short corridor have been included in the corridors so that it appears longer .
in the K@@ night , the mir@@ ror is giving the impression of another accompanying window .
in the course of its activity , the cen@@ sus provides a reflection of the deposit for all the eating disorders and glass requirements of Jo@@ anne .
housing is accompanied by a false opportunity to close the vegetables if it is not used , creating an image of a more den@@ sely populated space .
cu@@ mu@@ lative kit@@ chen is nothing new .
however , with this kit@@ chen , it is unique that it is a plu@@ g of u@@ pris@@ ings of gar@@ age .
&quot; it did a little bit of design , &quot; explained by Er@@ fan ter@@ as@@ tron@@ om@@ ical spo@@ use of M@@ D@@ F .
&quot; this has a counter@@ weight , which is why it is very simple to reject it . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and maintenance , Jo@@ anne now has 16 additional computers , additional s@@ lee@@ ping rooms and better fla@@ ts .
after all , the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to property - &apos; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ Kin@@ nis@@ mineral land k@@ ler takes an outdated form of tu@@ p and makes calculations based on an underground area &apos; .
here they have been able to increase sur@@ ger@@ y , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to the space .
&quot; materials are what you have to do and thus help to create emotional links with your home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ You do not love the electricity c@@ ables in my se@@ in .
it is important , but it does not put heart languages ring@@ ing . &quot;
this shows that a good design and an increased surface area help to do something aston@@ ishing from a rather normal cor@@ ps .
in fact , they can even create a desire not to leave , as was the case with Jo@@ anne .
the chief figure , Jen@@ sen , is Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s pil@@ l , who is competing with my colleague for profession@@ alism .
no more than the amount of money that has been earned , apart from which any ethics is forgotten .
his wife and three children only see his hus@@ band on his property and at the late hour .
in the first part of the film , I find myself in the idea that it is a version of the business world - even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s speech .
what the film goes on , the less cle@@ ric@@ al element remains , and the mor@@ alising intention of film makers is beginning to appear more and more .
life @-@ changing experience leads to cancer for the main contra@@ ctor .
a choice must now be made between work and family life .
the po@@ et dre@@ aming the father &apos;s feet at the Ch@@ ic@@ ago Lar@@ ge buildings to think about matters of real importance such as religion , welfare , love ... , without even mentioning the disaster of the twin sectors .
after the third stage in which the po@@ et &apos;s father &apos;s eyes are opened , there is a feeling that film@@ makers are certainly exposed to the target , because even the most pre@@ da@@ tory consci@@ ences are unable to keep their fin@@ gers back when they see the suffering of the cu@@ m bee po@@ pp@@ ers .
if the po@@ et falls into the House and his situation seems to be almost hope@@ less , father will finally understand the moral nature of his work and do a good job for the elderly .
now , in my own sense , I am lu@@ cky - if the film has its own , then I would reward my sense of vision after the film coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , then the net may be congratulated for at least one surprise .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ice coff@@ ee will be lost - when a hus@@ band calls a sick hospital and a man dri@@ ves a si@@ ck@@ ery along a motor@@ way .
however , the Po@@ e@@ g has been ama@@ zing , and although his father has just lost his job , it is even positive , because now it is time to deal with the family .
I can also feel very well - I can predict the end of the American dra@@ ma quite well .
in truth , film is well constructed , with all the elements required to do so .
there will be a Council , there will be laugh@@ ing , illustra@@ tors will be a good and moral beau@@ ty : money is not the most important thing in life .
this film is well introduced by surprise .
the new Staff Com@@ man@@ der of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ m intends to limit President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F@@ . Kelly will actually manage this .
in that case , it would be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff chief of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope that it will keep the excess in a more balanced way .
there is a full report here from Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ l :
&quot; when John F@@ . Kelly met high officials on his first day of work , the White House revealed a key problem with President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ ges Ma@@ in , which he plans to solve the poor flow of information into President Assad &apos;s hands .
Mr Kelly told officials that information must be channelled through him , either on paper or at meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have also tried to do so and have failed to tame T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i by monitoring its media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades , and even now that he is in White Ma@@ in , his television observation habits have not gone anywhere .
&quot; when the candidate T@@ ru@@ mp was a pa@@ use for unfair media coverage , to show him that he was also fairly reflected in the statements affecting him , &quot; the former campaig@@ ner S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg told Poli@@ ti@@ tz in February .
Poli@@ tic@@ o tara Pal@@ mer wrote at the time that , &apos; according to six former campaig@@ ners , T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter is the key to controlling the behaviour of the ter @-@ habits , in order to ensure that her individual media consumption is accompanied by a stable piece of praise &apos; .
well , it is .
but the idea that the habits of using T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter have once been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaig@@ ners know something that the rest of us do not know that the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i ta@@ g would have been even more hear@@ tening without these interventions .
we will probably never be able to know about the allowances that the T@@ ru@@ mp did not disclose .
if she was hel@@ ple@@ ss able to rescue the sca@@ ms a few times , his efforts were worth doing so .
however , no one has been able to prevent T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i from constantly creating controversy .
part of the problem is that the people in White Ma@@ in , which consists of competing tactics between each other , are trying to promote their own interests without exception by transferring materials to the T@@ ru@@ el that support their world views but may not always be reliable .
policy tic@@ o , which reflects the whole evolution of the story , wrote in May the tendency of advis@@ ers to provide the President with strategic questionable information .
one of the examples described by the repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is as follows :
&quot; the current and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i are subject to the T@@ ru@@ b saying that the T@@ ru@@ mp can react to the negative press , particularly the harmful effects on le@@ af@@ lets , explo@@ ding as a ob@@ session with identifying their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone gave the President a che@@ er@@ fully copy of the Internet provocation to Charles C. The website of G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com belonging to Joh@@ n@@ son , which accused the chief officer , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , of being a white house &apos; source of multiple le@@ af@@ lets &apos; .
it goes without saying that Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked from Twitter , or that he did not provide any specific evidence , or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
the T@@ ru@@ mp read the article and started asking the subordin@@ ate Wal@@ sh@@ i . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that the then staff chief of Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us and the head of the White House &apos;s office , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , had tried to put in place a system for the management and documentation of documents reaching T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Pri@@ eb@@ us@@ s , but the T@@ ru@@ mp is still an impul@@ se and his assis@@ tant will still compete for influence .
these irre@@ vo@@ cable factors make the mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans who have come from abroad to the capital will not be allowed to come to gri@@ ps .
there is a lot of foreign affairs in the city of Tallinn .
those with whom the girl came to the fire acknowledged that he played in the old city without the permission of the municipal government .
the first thing we found was the three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who had participated in the same number of houses close to Vir@@ u gates .
it was clear to see that mus@@ ici@@ ans with swe@@ ets and broken hard@@ lin@@ ers were ab@@ at@@ to@@ irs of ab@@ sen@@ tia , to whom one du@@ Å¡ mar@@ ches would be taken away .
despite the humili@@ ation , the only woman in the company played a co@@ war@@ dice in the a@@ cor@@ di@@ um , while one man , alongside him , called him three bal@@ ls and brought the fur@@ ni@@ ture closer .
the third man had sat on one of his do@@ gs alongside them and smo@@ ked a cor@@ di@@ al of self @-@ prepared far@@ ce .
their three cha@@ mbers did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the people who were passing .
Mr Bo@@ b , who has played with Mr No@@ emi and the pal@@ lia@@ tes , said that he was we@@ aring the streets for both fu@@ n and money .
the purpose of the event was to collect ticket costs for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day .
on the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for ro@@ tation , No@@ emi and Bo@@ b were sha@@ king their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we never have more than a day or a few towns in one town and , in most cases , permits for one month or so .
it makes no sense to pay for this , &quot; explained by Bo@@ b .
when we returned to the gates of Vir@@ u some 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in the hands of mus@@ ici@@ ans and are driving them away .
it was with sa@@ mbers and bags in ab@@ sen@@ tia to try and prospe@@ r with Vir@@ u crossing the centre .
three Polish young people were also represented on the streets of Vir@@ u , one of whom played a fifth , another k@@ lar@@ k , and the third had even been involved in electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people enter@@ tainment in order to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and life , and the tri@@ o pi@@ pe M@@ iv@@ os@@ h explained .
according to M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there must be permission from the City Government .
&quot; of course we do not have it , &quot; he said it jo@@ ke .
but we hope that , when people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
of course , if the police comes , then we go elsewhere , but you have to try , &apos; he added .
the Bank of Estonia purchased bonds worth EUR 149 million in the public assets programme of central banks in the euro area , with a bank bond portfolio of EUR 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , has made it clear in the past that the assets of central banks in the euro system cover three different purchasing programmes : covered bonds of the financial sector ( SIS II ) , asset @-@ backed bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public debt ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases reduces the production of lower @-@ risk assets and encourages investors to take greater risks .
as a rule , in the public sector bond exchange programme , each central bank bu@@ ys its own government bonds , and the bonds of other countries are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is making so @-@ called &apos; replacement purchases &apos; within the amount allocated to them .
Central Ban@@ ks also shop in those countries where the offer of bonds to the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian bank , confirmed by H@@ ans@@ son , generally bu@@ ys the bonds of the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian bank purchases bonds under the asset buy @-@ up scheme as of March 2015 .
meanwhile , Ele@@ round bonds were also procu@@ red , but the Estonian bank no longer bought Ele@@ ction bonds by June 2016 .
in the name of the central banks in the euro area , both Ele@@ round and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds will be bought by the Finnish Central Bank from June .
migrants ignore degrees and return to a &apos; mil@@ li@@ on@@ set of millions &apos;
some of the West Mid@@ lands &apos;s most aff@@ lu@@ ent home owners have once again found themselves in a fier@@ ce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the une@@ le@@ cted bureaucra@@ ts of the coun@@ ty to win back their walls .
the migrants have par@@ ked their 20 tra@@ ilers to the brink of a wealth of millions of business in the vic@@ inity of the So@@ hat@@ ul@@ li street .
they have returned , together with the army of hor@@ ses , children and lorries , after they were blow@@ ing out there only in May , without putting themselves in the mess of the bureaucra@@ cies that the Council was complaining about to block their invasion .
the group found a weak place in the limits of protection , turning its vehicles through the un@@ blocked part that had been left to football .
the people of M@@ aru@@ ang@@ ry have sur@@ passed the So@@ meat ul@@ li Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless to deal with the problem &apos; .
a anon@@ ymous person said : &apos; they cop@@ ied there on Monday evening after their expulsion from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ y , where they refused to stoning .
the Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were delayed and now they are back again .
they came to more yesterday evening , probably more today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect his par@@ ks .
I live on the road of street et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k , and I am not happy that I must continue to pay a total of authorisations if the Council is unable even to block such a thing . &quot;
a local resident who also wanted to remain anon@@ ymous said : &apos; it is ridiculous ; we have just seen the last of these migrants leave , and a new offensive is already under way .
this time , there has been an increase in the number and even a horse has been seen in the grass@@ land . &quot;
representative of So@@ meat City Council said : &apos; we are aware that in the land near street et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k , there is an unacceptable camp and we are working with the So@@ hat@@ ul@@ li police , we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
the gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police by phone number 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ na festi@@ val will also visit , among others , the Minister for Culture , In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is pleased to have been able to bring real world top names to Estonia .
the question of why so important for the Est@@ oni@@ ans at the We@@ ek@@ ise festi@@ val is Sa@@ ar that this should be asked of all those who enjoy three days at the festi@@ val .
however , he will admit that the real players in his own area have arrived in Per@@ sia .
&quot; looking at the level of artists that we have been able to bring home to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music j@@ ung@@ le - often not in our ranking - are spoken of a Minister for Culture .
which festi@@ val , however , are the artists who speak the most about Sa@@ art itself ?
I consider myself to be relatively old and , for some of the older people , one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ new@@ re@@ n , who stood up last night .
after all , according to his pos@@ ter , all of us have complicated our own feet at some point , &apos; he says .
however , he also highlights a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ Roure i , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ bels .
of course , our own Estonian players are also : starting from NO@@ avian , and they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , this concentration of known names is very high , &quot; he says .

Au@@ di upgra@@ des up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the light of criticism by car manufacturers
the day before the Au@@ di announcement , B@@ M@@ W said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of B@@ M@@ W , the company believes that &apos; there are smarter alternatives than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the B@@ M@@ W home city of Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be upgra@@ ded to reduce emissions of diesel engines .
no company described these operations as a &apos; provocation &apos; .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide , which dri@@ ves from diesel engines , is considered to be carcinogenic and could lead to as@@ th@@ ma .
the cost of equipment installed for neutr@@ alising emissions from diesel vehicles will also increase for car manufacturers , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under an in @-@ depth investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of ring@@ ing powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs referring to the problem .
companies are trying to prevent Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen from repeating the mistakes of the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , who was silent about the use of &apos; pe@@ tro@@ le@@ ry &apos; that allowed emissions fa@@ res to be adapted to regulations when testing a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
several Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
the former head of the Au@@ di engine Development unit in Germany was arrested last month .
former President Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Au@@ di in Germany was sent to a criminal investigation into Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen when the authorities accused the installation of the Audit System in order to evade European emission performance requirements , thereby extending the investigation , which had previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Au@@ di in the investigation may be a major blow to the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen holder Fron@@ ti@@ vist cars , disproportionately generating the profits of a large proportion of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen .
Estonian schools receive EU flags for â¬ 20 000 .
the Ministry of Education intends to purchase EU flags to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency .
a total of 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 c@@ enti@@ metres of the European Union &apos;s flag will be 5@@ 70 education institutions .
flags are intended to invest in in@@ door communications , they must also be carried out in high quality printing techniques with a sense of at@@ testa@@ tion in in@@ doors , and the ER@@ R news portal will be facilitated .
on the label , the text reads : &apos; Kin@@ gi@@ tus to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags lies at EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , a flag costing EUR 35 .
murder of journalist highlights growing threats in Mexico
the workers of the weekly newspaper , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Blue authorisation , which is so@@ wn by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ stop@@ p@@ able drug wars .
but today they have gathered in the shadow of their personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their rou@@ tine .
two of the parents &apos; authors are discussing which seems safer : whether to bring children to their offices , which were the target of the gran@@ dio@@ se attack in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the leader of the space : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking repor@@ ters to provide the names of a ve@@ il in every piece of water , but they do not need evidence , they are enough impres@@ sions and in@@ ner feelings .
the presence of government or car@@ tels is suspected of being drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists alike , who are making it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
violence is not a s@@ tun@@ t , and the more dead people across the country accumu@@ late , the majority of which are journalists from Yemen , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists , since the resigna@@ tion of President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Å@@ to at least 25 in December 2012 , 5@@ 89 journalists are under public protection following attacks and threats , and this year at least seven journalists in seven countries have still died .
the most recent deaths include their edit@@ or and source of inspiration , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as , co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many reports on drug @-@ related violence .
his absence makes it felt deeply , even though his presence can be felt everywhere on the Asian Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Bu@@ il@@ ding , a big picture of the Val@@ de@@ z@@ est , which shows the average finger at Val@@ de@@ z , and two of the 30@@ n@@ ines repor@@ ters , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , carries T @-@ shir@@ ts , which have been portra@@ yed by his wife @-@ private glas@@ ses or the face of his pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death , and Re@@ por@@ ters will discuss common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , their hope@@ lessness , their paran@@ o@@ ia .
although a separate public Prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders , which amount to thousands , the kil@@ lers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
the edit@@ orial action of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce will continue to reflect the violence in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ a , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and justice of murde@@ rers , the security meeting I@@ bar@@ ra says that there is not much to gain .
&apos;@@ It is very nice to waste your time here at the meeting , &apos; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , everyone will be divided . &quot;
Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of the State , Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , on 15 May morning .
he was able to travel just a few quarters before two men stopped his red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ rol@@ la , forcing him to exit the car and shot him 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which means &apos; twel@@ f@@ th river &apos; in translation .
an armed man went to the Val@@ de@@ z car and made an accident close to that .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adult children .
the boo@@ k@@ ings are spreading freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
however , Val@@ de@@ z is mainly dominated by silence .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition to the United States in January , the Blue Card has been one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country , as ri@@ val f@@ ers are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
it goes without saying that , on the streets of your permission , a few people or even several people are du@@ mped every day , or that the dead are sli@@ pped from the gru@@ es@@ ome two @-@ fold swe@@ ets of drug gan@@ gs , which are more than many homes living .
let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one car@@ tel is headed by a sea state with valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and the President , Is@@ May Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , feel that he was not able to defend his friend .
he believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
the first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons in the face of the S@@ ik@@ ame@@ he D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z po@@ cket .
this piece of correspon@@ dence could have been allu@@ ded to by the gan@@ gs suspected of appearing , all cop@@ ies of the publications were bought as soon as they were reached in newspapers .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security , after the crackdown took place in another newspaper that was equally respected .
Val@@ dez was leg@@ ally in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to exist forever .
he served as a ve@@ ter@@ an@@ repor@@ ter in the No@@ ro@@ este newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , sold 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said that in your blue &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without tou@@ ching on the drug problem &apos; .
the newspaper took time to know about its courageous and honest labels , and sales and advertising grew .
Re@@ por@@ ters were keen to publish vigorous studies without fear of censorship and read@@ ers s@@ le@@ ep in a print of which they could read stories that no one else da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after the launch of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspaper won the pres@@ ti@@ gious award of Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ oti for his reports in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez &apos;s Committee for the Protection of journalists ( AK@@ K ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow Mexic@@ an drug creation wherever it takes .
he admitted openly that he was afraid .
&apos;@@ I want to live on , &apos; he said when he received the AK@@ K Prize .
last October , he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV that drug trafficking is a way of life for you .
&apos;@@ T@@ o take on board the challenge posed by the journalists &apos; office , Peru &apos;s second chance of playing a f@@ ool game .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not talk about what is going on . &quot;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ lo@@ va stri@@ ves Val@@ de@@ z , a jo@@ ke who ro@@ p@@ pered like mad@@ r@@ us , a friend who gene@@ rously divided embry@@ os and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their support to his rou@@ tine .
he always we@@ ed his own village .
he went across the office to El Wogau y@@ ab@@ o bar and was always on the same des@@ k .
now they ask whether his stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness became fatal .
his death has also cast them in doubt about how best to do his job and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the arrogance of their women , their children , their legitimate businesses , their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result , even in the best times , is strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination .
tr@@ usted your in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
if it is a matter of suspi@@ ci@@ ously fra@@ ming , it is a ho@@ le away .
according to the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ al , the problem is that &apos; fra@@ gran@@ ce can be dece@@ ived ... , and so it was J@@ avi@@ er@@ ga &apos; .
he and others say that you no longer have old rules , just as they do not apply in Denmark , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ ros or other states , which are home to the toxic composition of profitable smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the space where Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only the but@@ ton sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in front of the house , two police officers sought a rela@@ xation of 40 degrees .
they were appointed by the government to a more elected Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office in the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an central class in the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an building .
some of the repor@@ ters won@@ dered in a semi @-@ jo@@ ke whether these police officers were among the 50 % of the police officers who have themselves been dis@@ credi@@ ted by the Governor .
several months have passed since reports have been travelling to mountainous rural areas where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gan@@ gs .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s publication this week dealt with three main features .
one of them was the murder of former po@@ x@@ om@@ al@@ leg@@ o Ju@@ li@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez ven@@ na in Sin@@ al@@ o .
moreover , they had a reve@@ aling story of spending government funds on the city of the Governor &apos;s home city .
a group of people was kidna@@ pped from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants .
there was no official announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how it happened , so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of Leic@@ restaur@@ an , both for drug traffickers and for public authorities .
Re@@ por@@ ter learned from public documents that the restaur@@ ant was registered as a politician who belongs to the ruling institution of the Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
recently , several IR@@ P Governor has been accused of widespread coverage of cases of corruption .
in Vil@@ lar@@ line , the repor@@ ter asked her to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Gu@@ z@@ man , who wear the name of El Chap@@ o , esca@@ ped military bet@@ ra@@ tion .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have sought a co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il in Val@@ dez to obtain information about kidna@@ pping from the best sources .
&quot; in the past , we would have known what happened , &apos; said a 46 @-@ year @-@ old Vil@@ lar@@ line whose body construction has earned him a ban@@ ner El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all the channels of communication have broken down with our sources . &quot;
the Val@@ de@@ z office has become a reser@@ vo@@ id of bridges and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the edit@@ orial workers have become something they never expected to wait for activists on behalf of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez took a few eyes and direction next morning to the local public Prosecutor &apos;s office for another journalist .
Mr Salvador A@@ va disappeared in the western state of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an three days after the killing of Val@@ dez .
it has been found to be a dead body and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists have become more popular across the country and are cri@@ pp@@ ling the phrase &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; as organised protest on pa@@ vements and buildings .
on this day , President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington in an attempt to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
a day after the death of Val@@ dez , when he met with the Y@@ our licence Governor , Ra@@ mi@@ rez accused the authorities of c@@ rying out journalists and killing them for telling the truth .
after that , he asked for his or her to be diver@@ ted from the government &apos;s activities elsewhere , concerned that hatred had affected objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ cul@@ p@@ able state officials and indifferent society .
in his last book &apos; drug media &apos; , he wrote that repor@@ ters are killing not only drug gan@@ gs , but also under the command of politicians and security forces who are at the mer@@ cy of organised crime .
Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , awarded more than half of the attacks by journalists on the police and public officials last year .
&apos;@@ In Mexico you happen , because you want to keep quiet , &apos; Ra@@ mi@@ rez said .
murder obviously has a bloody impact .
no one will forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ ger , Mrs E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as , in the northern border state in Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ k six years ago .
he was found dead with a letter which was probably signed by the car@@ tel L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my repor@@ ters &apos; .
the computer glass offices and e@@ lep@@ han@@ ts were found alongside his pain@@ ted head .
some publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the northern border state of El Nor@@ te , Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , following the killing of their correspon@@ dent Aung sla@@ va B@@ Sot@@ h in March .
others will continue as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do did after the murder of their president in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug car@@ tel with the edit@@ orial &apos; What do you want ? &apos;
some journalists have fled their home states , or even their country .
this is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
in theory , it is difficult to find work and they still have to find out today in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes they are being persecuted , as was probably the case with the photo@@ graph Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered three months after the arrival of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z in 2015 , together with four women in Mexico .
those who remain in the ground and continue to work will have to refu@@ te risky decisions on a daily basis .
the I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to become a po@@ et , recognises that it is frigh@@ tened to reflect the drug business .
&quot; Mexico is on the way to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &apos; he said .
at a recent mid@@ night of Friday , when the latest number had already been s@@ nat@@ ched , the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce swe@@ pt in front of the office and ro@@ cked the be@@ er when all telephone lines suddenly started to be cal@@ ib@@ rated .
19 people were killed , according to confirmed in the fire exchange between ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ is .
the war es@@ c@@ ala@@ ted , as did a number of messages from car@@ tels found in the area .
according to the same pa@@ vements , repor@@ ters made news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce site using a mobile phone .
a change was needed in the front of next day .
the scen@@ es seized another fire exchange in the region .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pi@@ il@@ la stood up for the police to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not at least show this .
workers of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce were posted in his foot@@ steps under massive ban@@ kno@@ tion , where his average finger is visible to the whole blue man .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w could you think about closure at all , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; on the same day that Javier Solana was killed , a trainees@@ hip asked me to send a report to the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur@@ us used protective col@@ ours to avoid enemies
at first g@@ lance , it looks like a form , albeit rather frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now made public the first findings concerning the hypo@@ the@@ tical size of the un@@ beli@@ evable rub@@ b@@ ish that has been discovered by a Canadian min@@ ster , which has so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; din@@ osa@@ ur Mon@@ a Lis@@ a &apos; .
it has been so well preserved that it was even possible to find out that the sk@@ in covered by his so@@ oms was a bun@@ ch of col@@ ours , and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
a report published in the press published by Health Bi@@ ology described the present status as &apos; the best preserved so@@ om@@ di@@ um sur@@ ger@@ y ever &apos; and &apos; one of the best Cur@@ ricul@@ um read@@ ings worldwide &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new category of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ge that lived in the middle of the seas@@ on@@ age , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
its incredibly good retention in Rab@@ a was carried out by theat@@ res who describe it as &apos; truly significant &apos; .
the plant feed covered by so@@ ys has , according to national Ge@@ o@@ sian , been the best preserved in the type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus that has ever been found .
it was found on 21 March 2011 by Sha@@ wn functional when he extra@@ cted Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um in For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
he struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into more detail .
the adver@@ tised ph@@ os@@ pha@@ te was sent to the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um .
for the next six years , an animal was designed to extra@@ ct 2 500 p@@ ounds ( 1@@ 100 kilometres ) from a land unit .
after all this hard work , the end result is now finally ready to bring the public to the table .
&apos;@@ E@@ ven to par@@ aph@@ rase a little eyes , you can almost believe he s@@ le@@ ep , &apos; said Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , a leading author , a theat@@ re in Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell , in the muse@@ um where he is s@@ tun@@ ned .
&quot; this goes down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most preserved din@@ osa@@ ur - din@@ osa@@ ur Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &quot;
when studying her sk@@ in , she found out that this vege@@ tation , which is covered by so@@ aps and rese@@ mb@@ les di@@ visi@@ ve tan@@ k , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food din@@ osa@@ ences .
this hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous din@@ osa@@ ur used a red and white sense of protection to hide from pre@@ da@@ tors , and applied shel@@ tering techniques , which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
this made it possible , according to the experts , to enter the din@@ osa@@ ur better into the surroun@@ dings and to avoid enemies , as she was likely to be w@@ ounded by major din@@ osa@@ ences .
this figure of 110 million old @-@ year @-@ old family of no@@ do@@ gs first came to news in May and is now visited in the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um .
the theat@@ res have now looked at the existence and given it the name of the Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta Mar@@ mit@@ chel@@ li muse@@ um mark Mitchell , who was a team that spent more than 7 000 hours to reveal the suffering .
thanks to the ama@@ zing high quality of his father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the so@@ oms .
they found dis@@ cour@@ tes@@ y - a common method of protection in animal state , which means that the title of existence was the har@@ sh@@ est as the lower .
although dis@@ approval is common , the findings come as a surprise , as Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta is much greater than the animals with responsibility today .
this suggests that din@@ osa@@ ur pressure was sufficiently ke@@ en@@ ly hun@@ ted by other mus@@ ical comp@@ ounds , that the evolution was preferred to be a policy of survival rather than a confrontation .
however , most of the animals used today , such as fear , se@@ als or ar@@ mad@@ weather , are far smaller and more vulnerable as an island , indicating that no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us had to make a real effort to survive .
&quot; the vigorous hun@@ ting of the din@@ osa@@ ur , covered by massive and abundan@@ t so@@ aps , shows how dangerous the endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered endangered din@@ osa@@ ences could have been , &quot; Brown said .
the chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds of diabe@@ tes also revealed that a din@@ osa@@ ur &apos;s sk@@ in was a red ba@@ g .
scientists will continue to provide an investigation to get an indication of this life , including the retained content of this salt style , in order to find out what the animal is the last word .
they believe that the din@@ osa@@ ur@@ us fell into the dead rivers , thereby entering the sea , where it turned its back on the ocean bed .
at the time , Alber@@ tas was the same so@@ e as at the moment in South Flor@@ ence , and rivers and oceans were probably far beyond the internal land .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us is truly significant , since it has fully preserved so@@ us@@ tic sk@@ in , but it has also remained three dimensions , maintaining the original shape , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal today sees almost the same thing as in the seas@@ on@@ ic age .
to recon@@ stru@@ ct this , it does not have to make much use of imagination - it is enough simply to run bridges and it seems to be like s@@ lee@@ ping . &quot;
the era of crisis was the time when huge swe@@ ets of meat feed - he@@ tero@@ sto@@ res - were s@@ tun@@ ned in the countryside .
although their Qu@@ e@@ en Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x lived many millions more years later than Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , some of his frigh@@ tening predecess@@ ors could have hun@@ ted this so@@ rely .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ sa@@ ur@@ us , a long and six @-@ tonne mon@@ ster with 38 leg@@ s ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) .
scientists whose recent findings have been published in the Bi@@ ology magaz@@ ine believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta u@@ hu@@ ta was s@@ tun@@ ned after death in the sea and that this mu@@ z@@ ine was mu@@ tu@@ alised .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn functional was detected when he extra@@ cted from For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine in Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
by the way , it has remained the most pre@@ valent so@@ om@@ om@@ al@@ ment in the world , including s@@ kin@@ s and so@@ oms , and it is comprehensive from concentration to wood .
these assumptions were on average 18 leg@@ s ( five metres ) long and up to GBP 3 000 ( 1 300 kg ) .
two 20 customs miles inva@@ ded it .
scientists believe that this mon@@ as@@ tery , which was covered by so@@ ys , was through the current Western Canada until the river floo@@ ded was proud of its opening sea .
however , the landing place at the sea of the din@@ osa@@ ur was instrumental in maintaining its characteristics in an excellent detail .
the gla@@ ci@@ ers of this particular father , coal , have so well preserved that the my@@ g@@ arch@@ ical rub@@ b@@ os@@ ote ceilings still cover sk@@ in gla@@ ci@@ ers .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote in the National Ge@@ o@@ sian magaz@@ ine : &apos; such sta@@ teh@@ ood is as rare as lo@@ to@@ victory .
the more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
the bur@@ nt sk@@ in gla@@ ci@@ ers are still covered by my@@ ste@@ rious so@@ di@@ um sto@@ res based on the y@@ el@@ low .
a better front is lying alongside him , and the five assets have been watered down .
I will be able to list the so@@ y@@ ings at his winter . &quot;
how did one activist find an answer to the question of &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll became a complete shock .
just a day after the trip to New York , that was the birth@@ place of St@@ . Lou@@ ka Air@@ b@@ n@@ b on a le@@ ak@@ ed bed , travelling on Facebook a phone .
he came on top of the post of his former school@@ master .
it said : &apos; the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ents , and he is still on the streets &apos; .
he was confused as to why nobody else had outs@@ our@@ ced this information from his bed , so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
P@@ ide@@ ga @ The@@ e@@ P@@ Mil@@ ah &apos;s user had repeatedly been handed over on his line of time .
St@@ . Sy@@ ri@@ p@@ par , from the Lou@@ ise region , gave real @-@ time comfort to Michael Brown , the death of an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Fer@@ gus@@ on Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is .
he gave an image of the life of Brown , a woman who was present on the street , for four hours .
&apos;@@ It is cra@@ zy , &apos; said Ferreira &apos;s addi@@ tions .
however , death was nothing new for him or for the community .
he put his phone off , but later this evening he looked back to the ta@@ g , which this time announced the arrival of people in Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
the J@@ ag@@ ati photo@@ graph@@ s of the police and the harsh people and a man who claimed to be the father of Brown and kept the &apos; Fer@@ gus@@ on police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &apos; .
he watched in real time a stream in which the police officer stood before a group of prote@@ sters with a gra@@ ves home .
in another video , another police officer said : &apos; I kill all ... animals &apos; .
Mr Fer@@ rell will remember how he has caught up in the thought : &apos; it is unusual &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is not a murder of this kind that we are ac@@ custo@@ med to and which we could describe as typical &apos; .
I felt frigh@@ tened at that point .
I was ang@@ ry and advised . &quot;
he boo@@ ked a return flight and was travelling home next day .
having bu@@ ried at 23 : 00 , he went to his father for his six @-@ year da@@ u@@ ghter and decided that they would travel to Fer@@ gus@@ on next morning .
what took place with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ gus@@ on@@ all over the next three years will be the focus of the new docu@@ mentary &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street &apos; . ( &apos; whose thanks ? &apos; ) , which will be presented in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who took up their streets in demanding responses .
when Mrs Ferreira , together with her da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a li@@ ps@@ y stic@@ ker and a ch@@ at with it - went on to Fer@@ gus@@ on , they spoke again about what they had said many times before before this morning about the experience and living conditions of black people .
&quot; remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &quot;
&quot; we are currently travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ on because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys , and that is not right . &quot;
&apos;@@ I could not take him on board , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll later .
&apos;@@ What is happening now is ... the cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it must know and see this and grow in the middle of it .
it must learn about a activists and organisation and , at the same time , feel different la@@ yers of experience and living conditions for mus@@ ici@@ ans , and what we must do to be free and free .
even if I manage to raise him in such a way that he does not personally copy brutal racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel I would be doing him a dis@@ service if I were to protect him from this world . &quot;
the first stop they did in the vic@@ inity of Fer@@ gus@@ oni was on the way to South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ ti - in a place left over by the police , which had become a kind of camps , where activists were waiting for news about the police officer Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not ultimately charged with charges .
there , Mr Ferreira and his da@@ u@@ ghter united forces with the local business owner who prepared lunch tables .
they brought together food homes and helped to divide them to the prote@@ sters .
for Fer@@ rell , a new type of activist was slowly started to take shape .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ ad University , he was the President of the Union for Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organisation .
all this simply la@@ cked . &quot;
weeks later , during the Ferreira evening demonstration , a film co @-@ director , Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ i , met with a film .
Fo@@ lay@@ an said that he and the film operator , Mr Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , simply wanted to document what is happening .
in the face of Fer@@ rell , the question came to mind : &apos; are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to take advantage of its protein and resilience .
Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born and growing in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard , and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Fo@@ lay@@ an had already put his hand in hand with D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ ati , a man in the region who was well @-@ known for activists in connection with prisoners who were sentenced to death .
his involvement made the project attractive to Fer@@ rell and the other six local cities who were watched for years following the shooting of Brown .
&quot; in this docu@@ mentary , nobody is talking to us or to us , but we are speaking to ourselves , &quot; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; it was important for me how these people are portra@@ yed , because that is how I am portra@@ yed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rell - the intention was to show that the Movement is not a &apos; donor leader , but a community bringing together &apos; , as outlined by Fo@@ lay@@ an - he was the most open to the film .
as a result , W@@ ho@@ se street ets ? &apos; surprising personal aspects of the life of Fer@@ rell , such as ru@@ th@@ fulness and marriage with their wife .
&apos;@@ I felt as if I had started , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll , s@@ inging from the first time that he saw the city .
&quot; however , I realised that this work and the human@@ isation of black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the Fer@@ rell affair emphasises and puts the role of the black L@@ GB@@ T woman once again at the centre of the wider Black Sea Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three initi@@ ators who thought in the social media about the killing of the black teen@@ ag@@ er Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , following the killing of the h@@ ash@@ ers # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter , are homosexu@@ als .
&quot; women of black homosexu@@ als play a leading role in general , &quot; said Ferreira , and this is precisely because we must constantly fight on a number of fronts .
Mus@@ tan@@ a@@ bad homosexu@@ als must bear all this burden . &quot;
Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed , stating that &apos; movement is indeed alive for black women , and many of them black homosexu@@ als &apos; .
he says at the same time that &apos; this is not a matter of creating equal opportunities &apos; - Fer@@ rell was not chosen as a film centre for his identity .
&quot; he was someone who evening the right energy , &quot; said .
&quot; however , it is not a coincidence that he was on the front@@ line , as black L@@ GB@@ T women are at stake when living in such hu@@ bs .
his energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , news camer@@ as Fer@@ gus@@ on have been missing a long time , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the conditional sentence imposed on Fer@@ rell during the demonstration for blocking the road las@@ ts for 2.5 years to come .
he describes the social @-@ political climate in the region he calls home simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
nonetheless , he still attaches importance to the man@@ tra he has been eating memory since his entire three years ago on the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing other than our chains to lose . &quot;
7 examples of how to overcome the We@@ ek@@ ise du po@@ ta@@ cl@@ one
some of the most stu@@ pid me@@ as@@ ters , after a me@@ as@@ les , find that they are suffering from , hence help .
or on the basis of the words &apos; Ho@@ w the bo@@ y , the stick &apos;s cra@@ dle &apos; .
but this is only an inevitable postponement and a decent ble@@ s@@ sing for health .
what can you do to make sure , after today and tomorrow &apos;s We@@ ek@@ ise tr@@ all - or other pi@@ pes - that you feel better on this morning and get rid of po@@ pp@@ y as pain@@ fully as possible ?
Jo@@ o Water .
to alcohol , after a great deal of pi@@ pe in the morning ... or possibly even alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it must somehow be recovered .
miner@@ als are also thrown out of the body together with water , and se@@ sta@@ p is a good ha@@ ir to mineral water .
as a result of the often irri@@ tating nature of the bur@@ sting , it is particularly good if it is soil @-@ free or easily regulated .
let us walk away .
it would certainly not cost a bo@@ y to split trees into the grand@@ mother - it could prove fatal a wrong decision .
but easy wal@@ king helps the body to recall once again what sense it is in life .
Coun@@ selling in T@@ el@@ gis and s@@ lee@@ ping po@@ pp@@ y is a more time @-@ consuming way to get a full .
give poor energy back gradually and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are on the ver@@ ge of over@@ drinking yesterday , then it is certainly not worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
without , for example , a fresh pi@@ pe containing fruit f@@ ans as a body is on the ver@@ ge of si@@ len@@ cing .
if health is already suffering in the South , it would be possible to try the w@@ ed@@ dings , for example .
and a little later , the Pan@@ or@@ ama .
a ref@@ e@@ ree was avoided .
this di@@ u@@ re is released as a body from the last water .
as has already been said , water and volume are your friends .
Re@@ par@@ ing pain@@ kil@@ lers .
if you are to be pain@@ kil@@ ler in order to prevent po@@ pp@@ y on the night , you will have to deal with par@@ at@@ se@@ ta@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ ph@@ et , not only alcohol , but you will have to deal with it , and you will lose so much .
so many more h@@ its and , in the future , boys will be worse .
in addition , pain@@ kil@@ lers do not remain in the coff@@ ee for a long time .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler in the morning , you will do it with a blo@@ t - it anno@@ ys your already ti@@ red swe@@ at .
or if the partner is not to take it , then it will be well with itself .
there is something like wal@@ king , but there will be no qu@@ an@@ tum leap when you walk .
however , too active a pace and an outrageous bet were avoided - the physical effort should be moder@@ ating during the po@@ pp@@ y .
the road jo@@ ke .
the words of friends of the time with friends of friends of friends of the past , the path to simple foods and the Naz@@ is friendly about himself and others ( suffering ) .
N@@ ali and laugh@@ ter may not make a po@@ cket , but it is certainly easier for them to follow the scen@@ es .
once again , the bo@@ y goes over anyway !
University of North@@ w@@ ester and Ox@@ ford &apos;s staff are sought as suspects in murder .
the police say that , nation@@ ally behind the North@@ w@@ ester University of North@@ w@@ ester , a professor and a university of Ox@@ ford are being sought , who have received suspi@@ ci@@ ons following deadly pet@@ ty se@@ als to find a team of men in one of Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s luxury bas@@ ins .
according to judicial documents by C@@ oo@@ k Coun@@ ty , on Monday , arrests were issued for the arrest of the 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i accused of the first @-@ instance murder of T@@ ren@@ ton H. Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ han@@ u .
according to the documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ han@@ u died after repeated se@@ als .
according to the warning that Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s police station issued to the community , the body was found to be dead on 27 July .
police officers received telephone calls and found the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house in arrival for a victim whose body had several tow@@ ers .
according to the officials , Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ han@@ u was admitted to death and investi@@ g@@ ators are treating rape as a murder , while the police are actively seeking two suspects .
La@@ vid has been working as co @-@ profes@@ sors of micro @-@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at the University of North@@ w@@ ester since 2007 .
in a statement sent as e @-@ publishing , Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , Vice @-@ President of University , said that La@@ vid has now been temporarily removed from the workplace and is forbid@@ den to enter the towns of the University of North@@ w@@ ester .
&quot; this is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of North@@ w@@ ester works with the investi@@ g@@ ators , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ arre@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant at the University of Ox@@ ford .
the representative of the University of Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist the US investigation authorities in every way possible &apos; .
furthermore , the statement stated that War@@ ren@@ i colleagues would be shocked and would like to be ex@@ tradi@@ ted .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , Head of the Communications Department of Ch@@ ic@@ ago , urges , on suspicion , to give himself to the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are , but we are increasingly intensively defining the exact where@@ ab@@ outs , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , suspects are helped by local , regional and national authorities .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police received telephone calls from the Grand Pri@@ x Cor@@ ter@@ house of Pla@@ za , who had just received ch@@ ry@@ p@@ tic rain that something had happened in Cor@@ ps No 10@@ 08 .
according to the police , this was a specta@@ cular specta@@ cle .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , it is not clear whether the event itself was also taking place on 27 July .
he said that the security camer@@ as confirm the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ res and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the Grand Chi@@ lean leadership sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police is currently working to find a background to events and victims , and will examine various mo@@ tives , including the possibility of a family dispute . &apos;
firms that help your businesses avoid getting next U@@ b@@ B
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ up company , but the surveys were un@@ profitable .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised anon@@ ymous , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is headed by Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , a company selling e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees in San Franc@@ is@@ co@@ s .
so he called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups with new types of human resources are disappe@@ aring , helping businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licen@@ sing software that aims to measure the involvement of workers , they enable companies to carry out f@@ lash surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , offer anon@@ y@@ mity and complaints to workers and , in some cases , allow artists to by@@ pass the C level management and address the Bureau directly .
&apos;@@ There are now tools such as the Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ ler , which are meant to monitor health , but where is F@@ it@@ bi for your company ? &apos; asked Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O Reding City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ sts use companies to measure the inclusion of workers .
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , he has received a much better overview of what he thinks and knows about in three years when he has used G@@ lin@@ ti .
in addition to investigations and specific teams , it provides a company &apos;s heating card , which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support , enabling them to identify the causes .
companies have started to understand that they have to stay in touch with their culture of work , so as not to become the next U@@ b@@ bar , which has been tor@@ n up in scandals since the former worker published a blo@@ gg@@ er@@ mail , which described the harassment of those who had the courage to speak .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , the desire to have an overview is a profitable business option .
global governance , regulation and conformity can be worth more than USD 118@@ .@@ 7 billion by 2020 according to the website of financial ethics statistics , L@@ et &apos;s talk translations .
the Den@@ ver@@ is Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o start @-@ up company SR , which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , observed an interest and an increase in activity this year against the backdrop of the dubious reputation of U@@ beria .
FIF@@ c@@ enti@@ l has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber recently registered himself as a customer .
like G@@ lin@@ les , Ljubljana allows companies to send tailor @-@ made impul@@ se polls , collect confidential answers in real time and look at the problematic areas of heat cards .
it also offers a anon@@ ymous tex@@ t@@ book which allows workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has an@@ cho@@ red regulators , &quot; Chris Qu@@ in@@ lan , foun@@ der and CE@@ O , said Agenda cen@@ ti .
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act une@@ th@@ ically , it could face serious consequences such as consumer boycot@@ ts , the departure of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by flu , a restaur@@ ant with more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of business , has used modulation for more than a year to ensure workers &apos; awareness of the rules and procedures and to offer an easy way of communicating with the corpor@@ ation headquarters .
when a worker wanted to announce the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address at the corpor@@ ation headquarters , he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously .
this was often a da@@ m@@ ning and in@@ convenient process , saying James Vit@@ ran@@ o , a general advis@@ er , who said that there was no good way of monitoring workers &apos; complaints .
however , now that the company uses ops , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices , which did not end up in the past with leaders operating in offices located in other cities or states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I can get away to the hol@@ low experience of the workers of 3@@ 60 degrees , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who chairs Ru@@ by hood &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; and we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and employee involvement more seriously in 2002 , after the collapse of the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen &apos;s ethical violations in relation to the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they cannot prevent their black was@@ hing from being hi@@ jac@@ ked online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Acc@@ cent offer their software as a service by making companies pay perio@@ dic@@ ally for the use of their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been in support of both start @-@ ups .
3.4 cen@@ ti financed USD 10 million in February by companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by USD 47 million .
the G@@ lin@@ ti invested USD 10 million in November B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , increasing the company &apos;s total funding to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise if we take into account the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ tedness of companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more research shows that today &apos;s workers expect more jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are just on the table .
workers want to feel they are accepted and valued and devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy in the company , they feel they are listening to them and the work they do is satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ in , who has a general benefit and experience of workers &apos; , in L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ ite and G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors will make a profit if companies which belong to their portfolio do well ; businesses will do well if workers are committed and involved .
if the analy@@ sts on the third side promise to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , then we are not sure that they will receive support .
data on worker inclusion is important , according to experts in the professional culture .
however , these data will be useless if the company &apos;s monitors do nothing to do with them .
in fact , when a company asks its employees for feedback , it can create expectations that change is ahead of us .
and if the changes do not take place quickly or at all , they could cause disappointment and decrease the involvement of workers .
&quot; when you ask 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; the President of the consul@@ tancy and business administration , K@@ ot@@ ter International , R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&quot; because if things do not stop , then workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Mad@@ ison Re@@ e@@ val , which is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via G@@ lin@@ ti .
and , after receiving feedback from workers disappointed by the pace of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , he was able to re@@ organise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems .
however , Ru@@ by hood is collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will result in a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in industry known for its large turnover .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&quot; if you lose people , you will lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
euro area stag@@ na@@ ting mark is Bal@@ tics : incomes grow rapidly
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe , B@@ animal berg , with reference to the ECB report .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
there is a low debt burden , fast @-@ growing institutions and business @-@ friendly and free market @-@ friendly policies behind success .
&quot; the Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where the EU average has been substantially closer to the purchasing power of a reactor per capita . &quot;
although the aim is for the overall output of the economy to be equivalent to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2 / 3 / 15 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led the bal@@ lo@@ ers to seek better wages abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees Baltic in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic at all .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only one quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are going very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland it was thought little less than half of those questioned about the economies of their countries .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel two @-@ day trends makes Bru@@ in@@ si &apos;s days long
it is almost 23 o &apos;@@ clock when thro@@ mb@@ ond U@@ C@@ L@@ A football clubs stop talking at the end of a new exercise in the city of a team .
some of them have put their backs on the back of their company , reve@@ aling their efforts for the first day of the training camp .
for a large part of the team , these gang minutes offer mid@@ day couples .
the players taking part in cu@@ cu@@ mbers will go back to the common scene three hours , before returning to meetings at 6.@@ 30 next morning at W@@ andar@@ man &apos;s football level .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mor@@ a , the Bru@@ in@@ si tre@@ ghter , a little before the Monday took Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel the trends that take place twice a day to reduce the burden of players has , in fact , made their days longer - at least until the end of the win@@ ds - to one side of the day on Friday .
for this reason , the three first operations of U@@ C@@ L@@ A were prompted to start at 19.@@ 15 in order to fit players into an already tight time@@ line .
moving from two to two strikes a day means more one day - the beginning of the Bru@@ in@@ si training camp was increased almost a week ahead compared with the previous season and , for the first time , Mor@@ a &apos;s six W@@ es@@ tw@@ ood season is taking place during summer courses .
they intend to have 18 tr@@ end@@ ars up to 20 August before starting formal preparations for the opening game against T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M in September .
according to Mor@@ a , he is in favour of a change in the N@@ CA@@ A rule , although it adds another item to the close schedu@@ les of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they break through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that when it comes to Saturday and we have more time , it is really a little bit . &quot;
when the camp is closed , U@@ C@@ L@@ A strikes will be closed down , which is not an easy task , however , given the clear view of the par@@ king record close to their fields and the by@@ passing L@@ us@@ kin@@ i centre , a higher class hotel that has already esca@@ ped football from the net around the gates .
since this weekend , ho@@ tel Bru@@ in@@ si players are occupying , but Mor@@ a recognised that there could be problems with free tobacco during the season .
&apos;@@ We are implementing security measures , &apos; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real cause for concern and it is not exagg@@ erated to think that people can portra@@ y a do@@ zen and a fil@@ ter from there .
if you have a record of a train , you can do quite a good deal with it .
but we use the security team there and the 8 par@@ king stations .
we are doing our best by using our existing ones .
I will try not to be very concerned about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
to address the issue of the election union of Sa@@ du@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , of Kris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ and , who was expelled from the Reform Party , and of Maria Kal@@ j@@ ete , who was forced to leave the ECB , we in Tallinn and the political parties to show the entrepreneurial Association in Tallinn - it seems that the electoral feder@@ ations created by party politics are taking part in local elections at least as much as political parties this year .
however , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointing voters for them all .
who is staying on the island ?
if the support office of Ed@@ gar Sa@@ lev@@ are reduced , events may be expected to honour his electoral union .
one member of the national assembly , a few former and present central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and why is it that some of the Sa@@ du@@ are by@@ stand@@ ers and sis@@ ters are prevented from standing in Tallinn , and why is it that the company &apos;s &apos; Sa@@ du@@ are list &apos; , which is governed by corruption and suspected of corruption , is becoming a reality ?
the urban government &apos;s cha@@ u@@ vin@@ ist music camer@@ as to the Russian po@@ em , which takes part in the parent city of Las@@ na@@ mÃ¤@@ e ; and , in any case , the original computer play in which the prime minister , J@@ Ã¼@@ ri Ra@@ ta , has to avoid l@@ om@@ ni@@ pe and hur@@ ric@@ ans who are on his way when driving - is the central party trying to avoid , for the first time , the votes of the 16@@ 16 and 17 @-@ year @-@ old voters to be allowed to the ballot bo@@ xes ?
we look forward to seeing the views of other political parties on the youth election campaign .
if the Kan@@ al 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 view@@ ers are confronted with black h@@ all from the beginning of August , there will be two options : to accept that , in future , only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 + , Tallinn TV and English @-@ language Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels or to don@@ ate ten @-@ monthly TV operators .
there are probably also those who openly re@@ jo@@ ice about advertising @-@ free television experience at the beginning , but in the end - albeit reluc@@ tantly - pay for television and advertise@@ ments .
In@@ numer@@ ical music , fol@@ ding people and rub@@ b@@ ish left on the streets are un@@ pleasant by almost every major music fil@@ ter .
however , if you do not want to be part of the m@@ ood , it would be worth going home rather than being pain@@ ted at home - and leaving the Cop@@ tic place of s@@ lee@@ ping for the F@@ esti@@ val .
Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
media publications are quoted by President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan provides for a 50 000 @-@ year reduction in the number of legal immigrants , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by Re@@ publi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill goes to the two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money because it will change the way in which green cards are issued to US citizens .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process will give priority to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and to the skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp in the US media publications .

this is a tough job : two months in a row , 12 hours of work without rest days , and then only 10 days at home and again .
during the three years of the Ar@@ ch@@ tel , A@@ na@@ tol has seen the cul@@ mination only once .
&apos;@@ There is a res@@ ounding procedure : when you go in , you will check thoroughly that you do not lead to a vi@@ ral , and if you turn out that you do not take it &apos; , you will speak A@@ na@@ tol .

his first investigation trip to Si@@ beria will be 30 years later this year .
during that time , he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year .
how much was missing out to Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took this into account in the words of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to men who have thought about it themselves .
it is difficult to say precisely because , at that time , up to 30 people could come to one group , but only a man was given a passport .
the passport was given only one thing , but was children , sis@@ ters and others Nazi children .
look at how much the territory was here .
it was many times greater than that of the his@@ tori@@ an .
after all , it was necessary to educate , manage it in some way .
S@@ et@@ in@@ os came here as farmers , but their lives changed because they came to areas that were not only linked to agriculture but also to the river ( pal@@ gi@@ par@@ ation ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New @-@ Pet@@ ser@@ is , many pigs later entered the city of K@@ ras@@ no@@ jar@@ sk @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P@@ . ) when it was formed .
did the se@@ tos form the majority of the population in this region at that time ?
yes , they lived in a com@@ pac@@ ket .
in addition , a long tradition continued to mar@@ ry between one another and a great deal of child abduc@@ tion .
seven to eight children in the family were common .
how many cultures of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ pes diff@@ ered and different from that of mother land ?
they are different , although what was said here was once the same .
they gave rise to a great many popular ideas .
they always made a distinction between what had been produced and what has been done here .
climate change has had a major impact on the traditional ri@@ val@@ ry of se@@ als , because there is a cold crop here .
the proposed changes have changed .
for example , S@@ et@@ oma@@ al meat was s@@ kin@@ ned , but it was simply frozen here .
where are the villages of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ pes and what life is living there ? / graph@@ ics : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ends
the link with the mother country was spiri@@ tually strong , it was considered very important .
it seems to me that now this Se@@ tu@@ ony will return to it , it will affect them .
those girls who have lived in families have listened to ama@@ zing stories .
Pi@@ ho is thinking of the people of the Estonian delegation , who came to the Kingdom of H@@ ai@@ da in early July and lived four days in homes - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is very easy to come and go , too , because the city has an excellent location : rail and road crossing , &quot; says Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m , who comes from T@@ ap@@ y .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a lot of nature , sports and cultural places , and the car@@ pet gets anywhere .
T@@ ap@@ a is a ti@@ p @-@ po@@ p of the city !
the L@@ in@@ era through the White River is a small island where the ta@@ ble@@ ts tend to be hi@@ jac@@ king .
&apos;@@ This beautiful place does not appear on the train window &apos; , ha@@ ils Re@@ ig@@ o .
anyone who does not fear cold water can flood in the river , because the river is full of resources .
I have been there , you can do it !
it is possible to keep the river long and just do the ro@@ man@@ tics - it can look to the river and think about life and behind it .
I have also been there with my kid@@ ne@@ ys .
O@@ oper@@ is@@ ol@@ ist Tampere has moved from river bas@@ hing to three bridges : &apos; that place is along the city , no one can come to answer if I say my own stories &apos; .
&quot; there is a wonderful view of the T@@ ap@@ y mountain , but there are also health secre@@ ts where you can drink , ski@@ p the winter and play , for example , S@@ gol@@ f playing - gol@@ f tra@@ cks have been made , sto@@ res can borrow from sports centres . &quot;
old people are , of course , there with their own system , but I have not yet been able to play there .
Mrs Ras@@ mus Gol@@ l T@@ ap@@ ale obviously has to be invited because she has experienced a dis@@ c@@ gol@@ f fan and she has the chains .
perhaps he will lend me credit .
the Re@@ ig@@ o and M@@ Ã¤n@@ ni@@ ku@@ ll moun@@ tains were in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably in@@ separ@@ able from the current age .
at least during hours .
there are many te@@ ars left to this memory , dis@@ appointments and you can be found in my sporting life .
not to mention broken bel@@ ts and s@@ log@@ ans .
&quot; the entire city of the city is now full of construction works , all of which will become unknown , &quot; praised Re@@ ig@@ o .
however , the old and ti@@ red stick building is a very attractive place to play oral disco@@ veries .
I am pleased that , in 2012 , the head of R@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ M adopted a note of my idea and had to be made to the summer theat@@ re with his theat@@ re .
even though this year &apos;s theat@@ re &apos; Ale@@ ga@@ i K@@ aren@@ in &apos; has just passed , on 11 August , the railway station &apos; El@@ lu@@ wake &apos; is in the railway station when the old building is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; from 11 to 13 August , the city of T@@ ap@@ a has Day , which has opened up open doors and clo@@ thes of cultural activities , including a popular t@@ our , speaks of Re@@ ig@@ o , who is proposing to visit the city from 9 to 11 days .
in the tiny three houses of 1 May , the muse@@ um is already in 1994 .
&apos;@@ The house is small , but there is a great deal of publicity and information , &apos; rejects Re@@ ig@@ o &apos;s place , which is full of the history of the city of T@@ ap@@ a , most of which focuses on railways and sis@@ ters .
Re@@ ig@@ o mu@@ ds that , if you go through all the recommended sites in T@@ ap@@ al , you will lose a lot of hot air but , fortunately , the small city is full of coff@@ ee .
&quot; we have such good eating places and sometimes , when you sit in ca@@ f@@ Ã©s , you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad , you describe him .
educated and young soldiers coming to T@@ ap@@ y spend a great deal of time in bot@@ tle ca@@ f@@ Ã©s , se@@ sta@@ p there is a cu@@ rious feeling that you are in Estonia and your home city , but that is the inter@@ lo@@ cu@@ tor together .
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or American people .
the wars , yes , we are moving a lot .
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ dering
Tele@@ can@@ al b@@ TV quoted a foreign minister who reported that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ dering .
in the morning of 1 August , the police arrested people who illegally ordered a group on the Si@@ th@@ onia Pen@@ insula , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free ten@@ dering and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone who is caught up in a place where there is no provision for it .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
the w@@ ol@@ ves that teach the people are breaking the sheep .
Fin@@ n farmers will have to give the w@@ ol@@ ves again , after year , a car@@ pet &apos; educational material &apos; - the w@@ ol@@ ves that apparently teach the w@@ ol@@ ves have already broken a number of sheep .
this year in the coun@@ ty of Hi@@ i@@ u , the w@@ ol@@ ves have broken sheep three times , 23 sheep and eight have been injured , signing the Hi@@ i@@ u page .
soil was only three , one year earlier , 124 .
there are also data from the Environment Agency in the syn@@ dro@@ me , where soil was not born in Hi@@ shel@@ ls and the information from the Ho@@ w hunting Council was obtained that two w@@ ol@@ ves were fixed on the island this year .
in the Ã@@ Ã¶@@ l on Monday , the w@@ ol@@ ves unle@@ as@@ hed 15 sheep in the village of Em@@ tens Kab@@ ina and injured the 18 survi@@ v@@ ors .
in the afternoon of Wednesday , the w@@ ol@@ ves in the village of Re@@ he@@ bas@@ la hit one sheep and badly injured the other , who had to be made an emergency .
rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms to the environment ( GMOs ) and a law amending plant protection products .
the amendment to the law remo@@ ves the creation of a separate collection of data for both genetically modified ( GM ) crops and operators , using the plant health register in the future .
in addition , the GM crop management operator is changing the obligation to have prior agreement with the designated person dealing with beekeeping .
although there is currently no increase in GM crops in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as there are no decisions to declare Estonia GM @-@ free , &quot; S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , President of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs , said .
&quot; however , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors , in the Annex .
the draft law repe@@ als the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of GM crop sites and business operators in the EU , introduces requirements for the management of GM crops and for starting economic activities .
specifically , as regards beekeeping , the current obligation to inform bee@@ keepers of the cultivation of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with bee@@ keepers before starting cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to Minis@@ tries to coordinate .
all interested parties will have the opportunity to find out about this in the draft information system and , if they so wish , to present their views to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , those operating in the plant farming sector , bee@@ keepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10 - has been authorised to grow .
however , so far no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops .
the reason for this is that in Estonia , there is no ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h , no European media Observatory , with a maize line mon 8@@ 10 resistant .
there are also the ord@@ ings of this ma@@ gic line on southern regions , and this is not appropriate for our climate conditions in May .
in order to be secure , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect potential contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various su@@ ici@@ des , maize and soya vari@@ eties grown in Estonia .
the analysis of the sam@@ ples carried out showed that seeds outside the host country were not included and that the seeds of rape , maize and so@@ y@@ bean vari@@ eties in Estonia did not include genetically modified organisms .
the above may , in turn , conclude that in Estonia , GM crops are not deliberately culti@@ vated , and it was also confirmed that there had been no random contamination .

the In@@ dependent public this week said that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted to recruit three football clubs , but he confirmed that the club had already done a &apos; excellent job &apos; by concluding contracts with three of its four priority languages .
&quot; I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four , &quot; he added .
&quot; I am even more happy if they can carry out four four of them , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;

the White House &apos;s audit cost to taxpayers of thousands
according to military documents printed in the magaz@@ ine , the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicop@@ ter last month to the southern American production event cost taxpayers as much as USD 24 000 .
the green and white colour S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , ter@@ med Marine One , during President &apos;s office , was a central feature of the event in the American construction programmes in White Ma@@ in on 17 July .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , senior officials of the White House of Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence and White House unve@@ iled industrial products from all 50 countries on their move .
the helicop@@ ter built in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ tis was spon@@ sored with a ban@@ ner , a fire @-@ fighting car from W@@ is@@ con@@ ten and a pal@@ let made in Mis@@ cel@@ lu@@ b .
according to the documents of Mrs H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) , the chief c@@ abinet responsible for the operation of H@@ eli@@ Cop@@ ter , asked the H@@ eli@@ Cop@@ ter to have a military helicop@@ ter presence with a little 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter for the &apos; extraordinary &apos; event on the southern hor@@ ror .
&apos;@@ I wanted you to be aware of this , because this is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &apos; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 kom@@ and@@ Ã¶@@ r a day before the event was launched in an e @-@ mail for your sup@@ eri@@ ority , the chief officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
the message stated that the helicop@@ ter would arrive at the southern hor@@ ror on 17 July morning at 7 : 00 , and will remain , a 15@@ .00 event , until the same night , between 18 and 21 .
it was included that if the departure from V@@ alg@@ est Maj@@ or were to be present , a return flight is needed due to restrictions on working time , another a@@ gi@@ tation is needed .
the original flight team was at helicop@@ ter during the event , and the security team of the es@@ tu@@ r remained close to the aircraft throughout the period of stay on the ground .
it was not possible to read out from the documents provided by the magaz@@ ine whether or not the other e@@ tho@@ s were eventually needed .
the H@@ at@@ ch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political ends .
documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked whether this would violate H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law and we were told that &apos; the com@@ man@@ der wrote &apos; .
&apos;@@ You seem to have no choice , &apos; responded to a senior officer .
the White House declared the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; event to be a formal event , and H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law would not have covered it .
but even official events have political under@@ ton@@ es .
the President backed the efforts of the Health Reform at the time in the Senate and praised attempts to keep government regulations in check .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon .
the Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them purely photo@@ graphic is unusual .
the T@@ ru@@ mp was brought to the attention in February when , at his first campaign event in Flor@@ idas Mel@@ bour@@ ne , he was a president flight to the background , and on Twitter &apos;s account comes across messages complaining about the way in which his predecessor used his flight .
&quot; White l Ma@@ l is very pleased with the exhibition &quot; made in America , where products were represented in all 50 countries produced by American workers from American materials , &quot; said Vice @-@ President of the White House , L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often carry tests around Washington and the southern hor@@ ror in order to get down to the white house of the President of the United States with a c@@ enti@@ metres .
when the T@@ ru@@ mp was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House ordered 58 sam@@ ples .
according to the Commissioner , the flight flight to the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; flight crew was considered to be the norm for a month &apos;s study flights .
in addition to that day , Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r helicop@@ ter flying 11 hours &apos; for non @-@ President support missions &apos; .
according to the White House , no other actor in this event burden the taxpayer &apos;s w@@ alle@@ ts .
according to the representative of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , the company was not involved in carrying out fil@@ tering on the southern hor@@ ror .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 will not maintain the budgetary documents of President flights and it will be difficult to identify the exact costs of the event .
however , at the h@@ our@@ ly prices of the defence Ministry for the financial year 2017 , V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D will be reimbursed at USD 24 380 per hour .
in the Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r documents , the flight was extended by 30 minutes from its main base , de Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o , from Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ an airport to both directions .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using helicop@@ ter is well below that amount .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated reimbursement rates is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates of compensation include staff , maintenance and many other irre@@ vo@@ cable expenditure , which will be taken into account for annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 winter study , the Ministry of Defence does not include staff costs , although they cover fuel , maintenance and contract costs .
the former press officer of the White House , Se@@ an S@@ hari@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ter at that time at the event .
&apos;@@ The point is to show things made in America this week , &apos; S@@ stop@@ er said .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ ti are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds , if not even thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly on .
so it is right , of course , to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the T@@ ru@@ mp was involved in the deployment of a helicop@@ ter in the southern hor@@ ror , or not , but the fire @-@ fighting car behind the whe@@ el .
within the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky addressed representatives by hand@@ ing out media ou@@ tle@@ ts about company products in his personal aircraft fleet .
&apos;@@ I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ skis very well , &apos; said the President , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .

I would just like to put together one proper multi@@ lo@@ gue once .

worse still lies ahead : a month later , his Olympic contest in Ri@@ os was covered by the first obstacle due to his resigna@@ tion .
time had to be taken down - was it necessary to continue with the seven competition at all ?
is the two @-@ day effort still worth all this ?
N@@ ei@@ u thought a long time , but found peace .
I could think twice !
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time for us to treat ourselves all and to think about it head on .
&apos;@@ You know that I am not we@@ aring a co@@ ck@@ ta@@ g &apos; , Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o is talking about his self @-@ cle@@ ans@@ ing .
I was able to turn a clean page and move on with a new momentum .
T@@ re@@ en@@ er Anne hill said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of neg@@ ligence , but he realised that , above all , the spor@@ ts@@ man himself had to get to the bottom .
after all , he had been so repres@@ sed by everyone .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; the G@@ ard said , however , that he is not giving up and he wants to prove what he is worth , says remember .
now it is going to have some kind of peace .
it is doing so to joy .
the inaugu@@ ration came back in May , when the Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o set 6@@ 280 points at the launch of the new Estonian Re@@ ports at the G@@ Fjell@@ z@@ themselves multilateral competition .
in a high @-@ level competition , he improved his personal top class with almost a me@@ tre ( 13.@@ 89 ) and drinks a record @-@ close @-@ time barrier .
then there was a multi@@ competitive feeling that it was not at all a ceiling , but only a hunger in the first competition .

if something does a problem or is wrong , then he says it immediately .

&apos;@@ I am not the one who makes the best of the trend &apos; , he says and says that it is most important to have the right sense , because it also provides a good result .

She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist of Y@@ ale University .
his message is not about alcohol , or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
when we fo@@ ol@@ ish the w@@ ool , when it comes to the complexity of wine , in the enjo@@ y@@ ment and in the perception of after@@ taste , we are putting our brain in order to create a taste for wine .
in the words of She@@ per@@ d , cattle cells do not actually contain tas@@ tes , but taste arises from the way wine is stimu@@ lated .
he points out how the brain &apos; sees &apos; col@@ ours &apos; .
&quot; taste is not wine ; taste creates wine as a swe@@ et , &quot; says She@@ per@@ d .
things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , the number of our age , summer and even sy@@ l@@ je produced by man .
She@@ per@@ d , of course , ad@@ mits that wine is not full of Jews .
&apos;@@ There must be more &apos; , he says .
if you are too big a lon@@ ger , the system will be over@@ sa@@ tu@@ rated .
excess wine drinking can do no harm to the brain - according to a study in 2004 , people who drink more than three glass products with wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced spiri@@ tual capacity .
10 % less pay for ICT workers in Estonia than colleagues
figures from the staff search company fund reveal that 10 % of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less than their colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , wri@@ tes the portal Ge@@ eni@@ us .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay survey .
a total of 8 5@@ 77 posts was examined .
63 % of posts were employed by men .
&quot; although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in the favour of men and the rest of businesses considered that there is no pay gap , in reality , the average annual salary of men is 10 % higher than that of women and men aged 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said Fon@@ crates analy@@ sts Il@@ mar Ma@@ jal@@ a .

according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics .
on Wednesday , the head of the UN mission for Afghanistan said that elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , said that hundreds of women stand for election to local councils , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; by underlining the importance of women &apos;s role , it cannot be exagg@@ erated , &quot; he said in a statement made on Wednesday .
elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
for its part , the Taliban have threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with the transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is cal@@ mly handed over from one democratically elected government to the next .
according to Mr Ha@@ ys@@ om , women &apos;s strong role increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the independent Ele@@ ction Commission in Afghanistan , 1.2 million women have registered from 3.@@ 6 million registered voters .
the joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both for large and small .
there is always too little common time , but the trend is a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
and what a convenient solution - no matter where you were s@@ le@@ ep in the summer , live lo@@ ved ones always accompany the summer and come out with your fine voice with an im@@ patient reminder : &apos; let us now also be a tr@@ end@@ y ! &apos;
A@@ el@@ ta insu@@ lation - It is a very good thing to have a normal gold game or a flag on the coast .
a piece is the foundation for persis@@ ting in the form of foot@@ wear and dar@@ k@@ ens - who would then like to take the form of a club of sand s@@ tun@@ ned from the la@@ kes during the summer ?
it is wonderful to use children instead of a chic@@ ken !
firstly , it is secure and convenient , and the difficulty is gradually increasing at the same pace as the training staff .
it is also possible to make villages with quite a large number of children .
the child teac@@ hes the balance , counts the reci@@ pes and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
larger children can do their own villages at the same time .
the extent of the movement lies in the scarcity of land and in the cle@@ ans@@ ing of hands .
keeping the fin@@ gers straight , the Pal@@ u mini@@ ab@@ lis properly .
a child can read the fla@@ mes and feel like a le@@ c@@ ture@@ r .
the planet is an extremely exciting but hope@@ less exercise for the child .
but it is easy to do it .
play @-@ plan@@ k : take a long plan@@ gu@@ Col@@ on@@ n to dra@@ g through .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much easier to do if , in the meantime , a friend can hand his hand .
if you add the burden , you can keep a plan@@ ade , you can keep a little on the market , and you can walk around it .
more importantly , a parent can be plan@@ ted on the hip of a child , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
while the cra@@ bs join the sand , the tri@@ gg@@ ers , the ash and the can@@ e meat burden , such as the infection , are becoming ri@@ pe .
the child wal@@ ks to the sho@@ es in such a way that his body is distributed equally in advance and behind .
for security , you can keep your hands closed .
all the leg@@ s and sis@@ ters right up .
it is possible to fly , cut off , strike a balance and be difficult .
a little le@@ c@@ ture@@ r &apos;s life is an ex@@ hor@@ tation if he gets little in every fire .
there is a further burden in front of your feet .
check that the back door would remain in a neutral position .
children themselves have a lot more to do with ch@@ ni@@ ves and pla@@ tes .
a bul@@ l with a hand and a w@@ ed@@ ding .
after the child &apos;s safety , the bur@@ st , and the hotel in a neutral position .
the fav@@ ou@@ rite and big fu@@ n of all children !
for the elderly , however , the whole body trend is truly effective .

from the Philippines to the heart of mo@@ pe@@ ds
B@@ oo@@ ked bags are the summer class , which has become a lu@@ mp product in recent years , which even has to be han@@ ged at the top of the hand in one of the correct summer au@@ ctions and which , despite its modest origin , traders have been able to display a price label according to the h@@ aste .
a piece of rub@@ ber @-@ red co@@ ws is probably one of the things that has existed once in the life of the law and which has not been aro@@ used with particular emo@@ tion .
that is simply there and , if there is no , there is nothing at all .
now , however , hand @-@ in @-@ hand bags are on the way to a real victory , and mo@@ pe@@ ds have replaced their mus@@ cular design bags by summer months against simple bureaucra@@ ts .
this is not only a coast@@ line , but today it is just as popular as a street , and more courageous women even walk it to the office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear whether this summer is sitting down or whether it is worth postponing the stamp and the lap@@ top@@ s to a little more official .
however , the wealth of tolerance has made be@@ er bags a real love of women in the summer .
for example , when we read foreign mo@@ mo@@ tives , the first thing is that mo@@ e@@ o@@ gh@@ ur@@ ists are bringing their holidays to the local market as the first thing , and buying some be@@ er bags , which are then the tru@@ ck of a whole holiday period , and which goes hand in hand with the market and also as a friend on the city .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are so generous that they buy a bigger w@@ ol@@ f on the market and sell or give them to their loyal read@@ ers .
in doing so , it is worth noting that there is a demand among read@@ ers for women in the real world ( and men ! ) to probably involve each other in the fishing ground in order to become a happy owner of some homes .
in some ways , this mad@@ ness is also understandable , as it is rare to have these qu@@ eu@@ es when , in the fashion of yesterday , it has been possible to buy some pieces of hi@@ jac@@ king for just a few tens of euros .
it is true that white traders have also discovered a simple way of ear@@ ning money here , and so more luxury br@@ ands sell their bags for a few hundred and a do@@ zen or a thousand euros .
obviously , in order to ensure that rich customers do not have to feel easy to die who pro@@ claim with some cheap do@@ gs .
for example , it is possible to buy D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ on &apos;s be@@ er of over EUR 1 000 .
however , for the interpretation of Chan@@ gel bre@@ g@@ ko@@ t , a sum of EUR 6 000 can be found in the circulation .
unlike most mo@@ tives , however , l@@ ot@@ teries do not inh@@ eri@@ ted at all from a few great mos@@ ques , but their story began in a far more distant way .
Ad@@ mittedly , the be@@ er bags come far from the Philippines , where they have been carried out on a large scale .
the bun@@ ch of rub@@ b@@ ish bags is there , in particular , the export trade , and there is very often no mention of local activities .
Ad@@ mittedly , the th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic technique dates back to the 14@@ th century and is rather a series of normal cor@@ ps .
however , as the be@@ er does not need to be as hard red as cor@@ ps , they will be accompanied by mus@@ cles and other materials that make the cop@@ per more person@@ alised and , by extension , more reac@@ tive .
for example , recently , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y do@@ gs , where pa@@ ints or s@@ kin@@ s have been pul@@ led in .
however , cop@@ ies can , above all , send an ac@@ tress , J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , the biggest bun@@ dled be@@ er of whom had not been seen before .
namely , he su@@ ed the be@@ er with all sorts of clothing packages and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val a great deal .
however , today &apos;s popul@@ arity of the applicants does not play a smaller role in caring for them , nor is it necessary , unlike all other summer produc@@ tions , to care for them by special means , but it also depri@@ ves the water and the w@@ et .
as is still the case with &apos; tr@@ end@@ y rob@@ ber@@ y &apos; initiatives , in addition to classi@@ cal na@@ vy , br@@ ands have come out with all possible interpretations .
for example , if they wish to be able to obtain a hard@@ lin@@ er @-@ red ri@@ ch@@ ot@@ tery or a little bit of a boo@@ m .
it is worth remembering , however , that the classi@@ cal be@@ er will never come from a mos@@ que , but from be@@ er flu .
but what is the classi@@ cal be@@ er , then ?
for centuries now , a bun@@ ch of be@@ er @-@ red co@@ ws has been classified as classi@@ cal , re@@ minis@@ cent of its style , is on the wall , and there are short , as well as len@@ ders , pit@@ falls .

G@@ M@@ B is concerned about investments at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant
the company expects the managers of the mature producer and Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to confirm long @-@ term production plans at the company &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment .
more than 500 people are employed in the case of H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich know @-@ how and other products .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s owner Pla@@ s said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years .
there were workers and trade union chair@@ men who have been paid there &apos; are the first to hear &apos; when something changes change in the operation of the factory .
in a letter sent to the manager of the company , G@@ M@@ B Scotland , Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e , addressed a request to &apos; alla@@ y the concerns about the lack of funding for modernising production lines &apos; .
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the object on the customs / VIS business needs and the future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is largely made up of local communities and people around G@@ las@@ go@@ w , an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social housing .
therefore , in terms of jobs , pay and well @-@ being in the eastern part of G@@ las@@ go@@ w and Bre@@ x@@ ti , in the context of the steady fall in living costs and production , a thri@@ ving production company in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e is badly needed . &quot;
the Pla@@ dis@@ e representative said : &apos; at the time , he received a letter from the G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ t only yesterday , and he is directly answered by the company , since we value active engagement with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting of the representatives of customs staff and the G@@ M@@ B , which openly discussed a number of issues .
we then discussed with the workers that , like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are reviewing our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years we have invested over GBP 5 million on the site of Customs , most of which have gone to production lines and to improve procedures .
we fully understand the heritage of customs as a production object , and if there were any changes to the activities of the object , then workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach to Ney@@ ra ?
la vie can regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not give up in its efforts to attract Ney@@ mar to his ranks by making an offer of GBP 18@@ 9 million to be st@@ olen , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record con@@ quest ?
this bold approach has opened summer as a transitional window , and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to dem@@ ol@@ ish more than twice the current world record , which was set up during the last season with the return of Paul Po@@ g@@ ba to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ tle for GBP 89 million .
once completed , Ney@@ ra will become the world &apos;s most expensive player and , at the same time , the most paid professional spor@@ ts@@ man in the world , who will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from PS@@ G .
Barcelona is also an indication , both because of the approach and the breaking down of Ney@@ ra , even though the source close to the Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ i leadership confirms that the club has always done the best for football since its arrival in San@@ to@@ ise in 2013 .
but did the PS@@ G President warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blair Ma@@ tu@@ tis Agreement in 2014 , the N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all clubs who think about recru@@ iting some of the best players in the PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that , when they are concerned about some of our players , we will accept them and contact them , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appears to have moved beyond this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the PS@@ G central player , Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow an Italian to leave , under any circumstances , and that Barcelona could be a set@@ back as a result of this interest , removing one of its precious assets in the form of Ney@@ ra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges and not borders after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t .
&quot; Bre@@ x@@ it is in serious danger of breaking the w@@ ool between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r during his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; it is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; she stressed .
according to Var@@ ad@@ kar@@ i , Britain would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as this cannot be achieved , it will remain part of the European single market .
it would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
another way to make Britain &apos;s departure smoo@@ ther would be to create a European Union @-@ United Kingdom Customs Union , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that there was such an agreement with Turkey , Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said : &apos; we could certainly have this with Britain . &apos;
the alternative to this would be a return to customs points , which would declare historical division and political failure .
&apos;@@ En@@ suring trade , prosperity and peace &apos; said the Irish Prime Minister .
he called Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t a &apos; challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that the result could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland .

her first qu@@ asi @-@ long tri@@ ath@@ l@@ on note Av@@ ril : I@@ ron@@ man will be able to pass through everyone .
today , in the winter capital , O@@ te@@ save l Bal@@ ti@@ er , the biggest tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ors were held , when nearly a thousand tri@@ ath@@ le@@ tes from more than three out of ten countries took up the competition for half @-@ long I@@ ron@@ man .
7@@ 0.@@ 3 miles of design consis@@ ted of 1.9 km of sw@@ im@@ ming , 90 km of cy@@ cling and 2@@ 1.1 km of cy@@ cling .
among others , the first tri@@ ath@@ l@@ on of her life was also tri@@ ath@@ on .
&quot; I thought it would prove difficult and , in the end , difficult , &quot; said Av@@ our fin@@ i@@ p .
despite the complexity of Av@@ ril , it is true that the tri@@ ath@@ on is , in fact , affordable for almost everyone .
&quot; not a dance kills , but a pace kills , &quot; he said , suggesting that , at a comfortable pace , almost everyone will reach the finishing line .
except for O@@ tt Se@@ pp , &apos; It is fine , but unfortunately it cannot sw@@ im@@ p &apos; .
Av@@ ril had already taken a keen lead since February .
at the beginning , 4 @-@ 5 hours a week , but later ten hours a week .
time 05 : 34 : 12 achieved 27@@ 60 in overall terms .
although Av@@ and lost both R@@ ai@@ o Pi@@ adz@@ ya ( time 04 : 59 : 53 ) and J@@ Ã¼r@@ gen L@@ ig@@ ale ( time 05 : 06 : 37 ) , she won other competing champi@@ ons in the so @-@ called &apos; prominent class &apos; .
last year , Tan@@ el Pa@@ da@@ r , a &quot; good example &quot; , lost A@@ van@@ le in seven minutes ( time : 05 : 41 : 54 ) , journalist S@@ ten Te@@ pp@@ an in 16 minutes ( time 05 : 50 : 23 ) , Kal@@ e@@ v K@@ r@@ new and Ra@@ iv@@ o E. Tam@@ m in almost an hour ( times respectively 06 : 31 : 53 and 06 : 45 : 18 : 18 ) .
I@@ ron@@ man &apos;s general winners of the ranking of O@@ te@@ pÃ¤@@ Ã¤ , who is part of the I@@ te@@ pÃ¤@@ Ã¤ , were chron@@ ically German , Johannes Mol@@ dan , with 3 : 58 : 27 : 27 , Est@@ oni@@ ans were the best I@@ vo plen@@ r in 04 : 14 : 09 .
among women , the Danish woman , Hel@@ le Fre@@ der@@ ik@@ sen , won 04 : 24 : 01 : 01 , Est@@ oni@@ ans , Maria J@@ Ã¤n@@ ese , who lost nearly half a hour to Fre@@ der@@ ik@@ sen and obtained 04 : 58 : 58 .
Av@@ ja went through 1.9 km of sw@@ im@@ ming with 42 minutes and 14 seconds .
she came out of 4@@ 10 positions .
